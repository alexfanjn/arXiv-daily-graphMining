    "abstract": "One-stage algorithm have been widely used in target detection systems that need to be trained with massive data. Most of them perform well both in real-time and accuracy. However, due to their convolutional structure, they need more computing power and greater memory consumption. Hence, we applied pruning strategy to target detection networks to reduce the number of parameters and the size of model. To demonstrate the practicality of the pruning method, we select the YOLOv5 model for experiments and provide a data set of outdoor obstacles to show the effect of model. In this specific data set, in the best circumstances, the volume of the network model is reduced by 49.7% compared with the original model, and the reasoning time is reduced by 52.5%. Meanwhile, it also uses data processing methods to compensate for the drop in accuracy caused by pruning. ",

    "abstract": "Knowledge graph embeddings (KGE) have been validated as powerful methods for inferring missing links in knowledge graphs (KGs) since they map entities into Euclidean space and treat relations as transformations of entities. Currently, some Euclidean KGE methods model semantic hierarchies prevalent in KGs and promote the performance of link prediction. For hierarchical data, instead of traditional Euclidean space, hyperbolic space as an embedding space has shown the promise of high fidelity and low memory consumption; however, existing hyperbolic KGE methods neglect to model them. To address this issue, we propose a novel KGE model -- hyperbolic hierarchical KGE (HypHKGE). To be specific, we first design the attention-based learnable curvatures for hyperbolic space to preserve rich semantic hierarchies. Moreover, we define the hyperbolic hierarchical transformations based on the theory of hyperbolic geometry, which utilize hierarchies that we preserved to infer the links. Experiments show that HypHKGE can effectively model semantic hierarchies in hyperbolic space and outperforms the state-of-the-art hyperbolic methods, especially in low dimensions. ",

We apply our approach to a very large case study: the Educational Censuses of Brazil, curated by the governmental agency INEP, which comprise over 90 attributes of approximately 50 million individuals released longitudinally every year since 2007. These datasets have only very recently (2018-2021) attracted legislation to regulate their privacy -- while at the same time continuing to maintain the openness that had been sought in Brazilian society. INEP's reaction to that legislation was the genesis of our project with them. In our conclusions here we share the scientific, technical, and communication lessons we learned in the process. ",

    "abstract": "The complexity of the problem of deciding properties expressible in FO logic on graphs -- the FO model checking problem (parameterized by the respective FO formula), is well-understood on so-called sparse graph classes, but much less understood on hereditary dense graph classes. Regarding the latter, a recent concept of twin-width [Bonnet et al., FOCS 2020] appears to be very useful. For instance, the question of these authors [CGTA 2019] about where is the exact limit of fixed-parameter tractability of FO model checking on permutation graphs has been answered by Bonnet et al. in 2020 quite easily, using the newly introduced twin-width. We prove that such exact characterization of hereditary subclasses with tractable FO model checking naturally extends from permutation to circle graphs (the intersection graphs of chords in a circle). Namely, we prove that under usual complexity assumptions, FO model checking of a hereditary class of circle graphs is in FPT if and only if the class excludes some permutation graph. We also prove a similar excluded-subgraphs characterization for hereditary classes of interval graphs with FO model checking in FPT, which concludes the line a research of interval classes with tractable FO model checking started in [Ganian et al., ICALP 2013]. The mathematical side of the presented characterizations -- about when subclasses of the classes of circle and permutation graphs have bounded twin-width, moreover extends to so-called bounded perturbations of these classes.

    "abstract": "Classifiers are biased when trained on biased datasets. As a remedy, we propose Learning to Split (ls), an algorithm for automatic bias detection. Given a dataset with input-label pairs, ls learns to split this dataset so that predictors trained on the training split generalize poorly to the testing split. This performance gap provides a proxy for measuring the degree of bias in the learned features and can therefore be used to reduce biases. Identifying non-generalizable splits is challenging as we don't have any explicit annotations about how to split. In this work, we show that the prediction correctness of the testing example can be used as a source of weak supervision: generalization performance will drop if we move examples that are predicted correctly away from the testing split, leaving only those that are mispredicted. We evaluate our approach on Beer Review, Waterbirds, CelebA and MNLI. Empirical results show that ls is able to generate astonishingly challenging splits that correlate with human-identified biases. Moreover, we demonstrate that combining robust learning algorithms (such as group DRO) with splits identified by ls enables automatic de-biasing. Compared with previous state-of-the-arts, we substantially improves the worst-group performance (23.4% on average) when the source of biases is unknown during training and validation. ",

These games usually assume a set of indistinguishable agents strategically buying edges at a uniform price leading to a network among them. However, in real life, agents are heterogeneous and their relationships often display a bias towards similar agents, say of the same ethnic group. This homophilic behavior on the agent level can then lead to the emergent global phenomenon of social segregation. We initiate the study of Network Creation Games with multiple types of homophilic agents and non-uniform edge cost. Specifically, we introduce and compare two models, focusing on the perception of same-type and different-type neighboring agents, respectively. Despite their different initial conditions, both our theoretical and experimental analysis show that the resulting stable networks are almost identical in the two models, indicating a robust structure of social networks under homophily. Moreover, we investigate the segregation strength of the formed networks and thereby offer new insights on understanding segregation. ",

    "abstract": "There are several measures for fairness in ranking, based on different underlying assumptions and perspectives. PL optimization with the REINFORCE algorithm can be used for optimizing black-box objective functions over permutations. In particular, it can be used for optimizing fairness measures. However, though effective for queries with a moderate number of repeating sessions, PL optimization has room for improvement for queries with a small number of repeating sessions. In this paper, we present a novel way of representing permutation distributions, based on the notion of permutation graphs. Similar to PL, our distribution representation, called PPG, can be used for black-box optimization of fairness. Different from PL, where pointwise logits are used as the distribution parameters, in PPG pairwise inversion probabilities together with a reference permutation construct the distribution. As such, the reference permutation can be set to the best sampled permutation regarding the objective function, making PPG suitable for both deterministic and stochastic rankings. Our experiments show that PPG, while comparable to PL for larger session repetitions (i.e., stochastic ranking), improves over PL for optimizing fairness metrics for queries with one session (i.e., deterministic ranking). Additionally, when accurate utility estimations are available, e.g., in tabular models, the performance of PPG in fairness optimization is significantly boosted compared to lower quality utility estimations from a learning to rank model, leading to a large performance gap with PL. Finally, the pairwise probabilities make it possible to impose pairwise constraints such as \"item $d_1$ should always be ranked higher than item $d_2$.\" Such constraints can be used to simultaneously optimize the fairness metric and control another objective such as ranking performance.

We propose an abstraction called causal knowledge hierarchy (CKH) for encoding priors into causal models. Our approach is based on the foundation of \"levels of evidence\" in medicine, with a focus on confidence in causal information. Using CKH, we present a methodological framework for encoding causal priors from various data sources and combining them to derive an SCM.

In this paper, we focus on the scenario where there is a mismatch in the threat model assumed by the defense during training, and the actual capabilities of the adversary at test time. We ask the question: if the learner trains against a specific \"source\" threat model, when can we expect robustness to generalize to a stronger unknown \"target\" threat model during test-time? Our key contribution is to formally define the problem of learning and generalization with an unforeseen adversary, which helps us reason about the increase in adversarial risk from the conventional perspective of a known adversary. Applying our framework, we derive a generalization bound which relates the generalization gap between source and target threat models to variation of the feature extractor, which measures the expected maximum difference between extracted features across a given threat model. Based on our generalization bound, we propose adversarial training with variation regularization (AT-VR) which reduces variation of the feature extractor across the source threat model during training. We empirically demonstrate that AT-VR can lead to improved generalization to unforeseen attacks during test-time compared to standard adversarial training on Gaussian and image datasets. ",

    "abstract": "Federated learning is a private-by-design distributed learning paradigm where clients train local models on their own data before a central server aggregates their local updates to compute a global model. Depending on the aggregation method used, the local updates are either the gradients or the weights of local learning models. Recent reconstruction attacks apply a gradient inversion optimization on the gradient update of a single minibatch to reconstruct the private data used by clients during training. As the state-of-the-art reconstruction attacks solely focus on single update, realistic adversarial scenarios are overlooked, such as observation across multiple updates and updates trained from multiple mini-batches. A few studies consider a more challenging adversarial scenario where only model updates based on multiple mini-batches are observable, and resort to computationally expensive simulation to untangle the underlying samples for each local step. In this paper, we propose AGIC, a novel Approximate Gradient Inversion Attack that efficiently and effectively reconstructs images from both model or gradient updates, and across multiple epochs. In a nutshell, AGIC (i) approximates gradient updates of used training samples from model updates to avoid costly simulation procedures, (ii) leverages gradient/model updates collected from multiple epochs, and (iii) assigns increasing weights to layers with respect to the neural network structure for reconstruction quality. We extensively evaluate AGIC on three datasets, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and ImageNet. Our results show that AGIC increases the peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) by up to 50% compared to two representative state-of-the-art gradient inversion attacks. Furthermore, AGIC is faster than the state-of-the-art simulation based attack, e.g., it is 5x faster when attacking FedAvg with 8 local steps in between model updates. ",

A huge number of sensing devices collect and/or generate numerous sensory data throughout time for a wide range of fields and applications. However, WSN has been proven to be vulnerable to security breaches, the harsh and unattended deployment of these networks, combined with their constrained resources and the volume of data generated introduce a major security concern. WSN applications are extremely critical, it is essential to build reliable solutions that involve fast and continuous mechanisms for online data stream analysis enabling the detection of attacks and intrusions. In this context, our aim is to develop an intelligent, efficient, and updatable intrusion detection system by applying an important machine learning concept known as ensemble learning in order to improve detection performance. Although ensemble models have been proven to be useful in offline learning, they have received less attention in streaming applications. In this paper, we examine the application of different homogeneous and heterogeneous online ensembles in sensory data analysis, on a specialized wireless sensor network-detection system (WSN-DS) dataset in order to classify four types of attacks: Blackhole attack, Grayhole, Flooding, and Scheduling among normal network traffic. Among the proposed novel online ensembles, both the heterogeneous ensemble consisting of an Adaptive Random Forest (ARF) combined with the Hoeffding Adaptive Tree (HAT) algorithm and the homogeneous ensemble HAT made up of 10 models achieved higher detection rates of 96.84% and 97.2%, respectively.

Although adaptive model refinement can be employed for enhanced effectiveness, it is cumbersome for the traditional mesh-based methods to perform while modeling the evolving localizations. In this work, neural network-enhanced reproducing kernel particle method (NN-RKPM) is proposed, where the location, orientation, and shape of the solution transition near a localization is automatically captured by the NN approximation via a block-level neural network optimization. The weights and biases in the blocked parametrization network control the location and orientation of the localization. The designed basic four-kernel NN block is capable of capturing a triple junction or a quadruple junction topological pattern, while more complicated localization topological patters are captured by the superposition of multiple four-kernel NN blocks. The standard RK approximation is then utilized to approximate the smooth part of the solution, which permits a much coarser discretization than the high-resolution discretization needed to capture sharp solution transitions with the conventional methods. A regularization of the neural network approximation is additionally introduced for discretization-independent material responses. The effectiveness of the proposed NN-RKPM is verified by a series of numerical verifications. ",

Many machine learning methods that consider the two characteristics have been proposed for medical event prediction. However, most of them consider the two characteristics separately and ignore the correlations among different types of medical events, especially relations between historical medical events and target medical events.

It is a time-aware, event-aware and task-adaptive method with the following advantages: 1) modeling heterogeneous information and temporal information in a unified way and considering temporal irregular characteristics locally and globally respectively, 2) taking full advantage of correlations among different types of events via cross-event attention. Experiments on two public datasets (MIMIC-III and eICU) show CATNet can be adaptive with different MEP tasks and outperforms other state-of-the-art methods on various MEP tasks. The source code of CATNet will be released after this manuscript is accepted. ",

    "abstract": "A computer-aided detection (CAD) system based on machine learning is expected to assist radiologists in making a diagnosis. It is desirable to build CAD systems for the various types of diseases accumulating daily in a hospital. An obstacle in developing a CAD system for a disease is that the number of medical images is typically too small to improve the performance of the machine learning model. In this paper, we aim to explore ways to address this problem through a sim2real transfer approach in medical image fields. To build a platform to evaluate the performance of sim2real transfer methods in the field of medical imaging, we construct a benchmark dataset that consists of $101$ chest X-images with difficult-to-identify pneumonia lesions judged by an experienced radiologist and a simulator based on fractal Perlin noise and the X-ray principle for generating pseudo pneumonia lesions. We then develop a novel domain randomization method, called Goldilocks-curriculum domain randomization (GDR) and evaluate our method in this platform. ",

    "abstract": "The complex nature of real-world problems calls for heterogeneity in both machine learning (ML) models and hardware systems. The heterogeneity in ML models comes from multi-sensor perceiving and multi-task learning, i.e., multi-modality multi-task (MMMT), resulting in diverse deep neural network (DNN) layers and computation patterns. The heterogeneity in systems comes from diverse processing components, as it becomes the prevailing method to integrate multiple dedicated accelerators into one system. Therefore, a new problem emerges: heterogeneous model to heterogeneous system mapping (H2H). While previous mapping algorithms mostly focus on efficient computations, in this work, we argue that it is indispensable to consider computation and communication simultaneously for better system efficiency. We propose a novel H2H mapping algorithm with both computation and communication awareness; by slightly trading computation for communication, the system overall latency and energy consumption can be largely reduced. The superior performance of our work is evaluated based on MAESTRO modeling, demonstrating 15%-74% latency reduction and 23%-64% energy reduction compared with existing computation-prioritized mapping algorithms.

    "abstract": "Although deep neural networks have achieved state-of-the-art performance in various machine learning tasks, adversarial examples, constructed by adding small non-random perturbations to correctly classified inputs, successfully fool highly expressive deep classifiers into incorrect predictions. Approaches to adversarial attacks in natural language tasks have boomed in the last five years using character-level, word-level, phrase-level, or sentence-level textual perturbations. While there is some work in NLP on defending against such attacks through proactive methods, like adversarial training, there is to our knowledge no effective general reactive approaches to defence via detection of textual adversarial examples such as is found in the image processing literature. In this paper, we propose two new reactive methods for NLP to fill this gap, which unlike the few limited application baselines from NLP are based entirely on distribution characteristics of learned representations: we adapt one from the image processing literature (Local Intrinsic Dimensionality (LID)), and propose a novel one (MultiDistance Representation Ensemble Method (MDRE)). Adapted LID and MDRE obtain state-of-the-art results on character-level, word-level, and phrase-level attacks on the IMDB dataset as well as on the later two with respect to the MultiNLI dataset.

Extensive experiments show that our MDRN achieves favorable performance against other SID models with fewer parameters.

    "abstract": "Automatic extraction of product attributes from their textual descriptions is essential for online shopper experience. One inherent challenge of this task is the emerging nature of e-commerce products -- we see new types of products with their unique set of new attributes constantly. Most prior works on this matter mine new values for a set of known attributes but cannot handle new attributes that arose from constantly changing data. In this work, we study the attribute mining problem in an open-world setting to extract novel attributes and their values. Instead of providing comprehensive training data, the user only needs to provide a few examples for a few known attribute types as weak supervision. We propose a principled framework that first generates attribute value candidates and then groups them into clusters of attributes. The candidate generation step probes a pre-trained language model to extract phrases from product titles. Then, an attribute-aware fine-tuning method optimizes a multitask objective and shapes the language model representation to be attribute-discriminative. Finally, we discover new attributes and values through the self-ensemble of our framework, which handles the open-world challenge. We run extensive experiments on a large distantly annotated development set and a gold standard human-annotated test set that we collected. Our model significantly outperforms strong baselines and can generalize to unseen attributes and product types. ",

This process is time consuming and sometime is ineffective to detect the right behavioral disorder. Also, reserved people sometime hesitate to follow this process.

By using this framework people can input required data that are highly responsible for the three behavioral disorders namely depression, anxiety and internet addiction.

In many cases, this approach improves the forecast error and reduces the required training data. However, it does not take the seasonal influences in power forecasts within a day into account, i.e., the diurnal cycle. Therefore, we extended this idea to temporal convolutional networks to consider those seasonalities. We propose transforming the embedding space, which contains the latent similarities between tasks, through convolution and providing these results to the network's residual block. The proposed architecture significantly improves up to 25 percent for multi-task learning for power forecasts on the EuropeWindFarm and GermanSolarFarm dataset compared to the multi-layer perceptron approach. Based on the same data, we achieve a ten percent improvement for the wind datasets and more than 20 percent in most cases for the solar dataset for inductive transfer learning without catastrophic forgetting. Finally, we are the first proposing zero-shot learning for renewable power forecasts to provide predictions even if no training data is available. ",

With the rise of transformer-based language models, text comparison based on meaning (rather than lexical features) is available to researchers. However, performing pairwise comparisons of all textual descriptions of concepts in two knowledge graphs is expensive and scales quadratically (or even worse if concepts have more than one description). To overcome this problem, we follow a two-step approach: we first generate matching candidates using a pre-trained sentence transformer (so called bi-encoder). In a second step, we use fine-tuned transformer cross-encoders to generate the best candidates.

However, the same embedding dimension for both dense entities and sparse entities will cause either over parameterization (sparse entities) or under fitting (dense entities). Normally, a large dimension is set to get better performance. Meanwhile, the inference time grows log-linearly with the number of entities for all entities are traversed and compared. Both the parameter and inference become challenges when working with huge amounts of entities. Thus, we propose PIE, a \\textbf{p}arameter and \\textbf{i}nference \\textbf{e}fficient solution. Inspired from tensor decomposition methods, we find that decompose entity embedding matrix into low rank matrices can reduce more than half of the parameters while maintaining comparable performance. To accelerate model inference, we propose a self-supervised auxiliary task, which can be seen as fine-grained entity typing. By randomly masking and recovering entities' connected relations, the task learns the co-occurrence of entity and relations. Utilizing the fine grained typing, we can filter unrelated entities during inference and get targets with possibly sub-linear time requirement. Experiments on link prediction benchmarks demonstrate the proposed key capabilities. Moreover, we prove effectiveness of the proposed solution on the Open Graph Benchmark large scale challenge dataset WikiKG90Mv2 and achieve the state of the art performance. ",

Recent works demonstrated attacks that aim to hide objects from AV perception, which can result in severe consequences. 3D shadows, are regions void of measurements in 3D point clouds which arise from occlusions of objects in a scene. 3D shadows were proposed as a physical invariant valuable for detecting spoofed or fake objects. In this work, we leverage 3D shadows to locate obstacles that are hidden from object detectors. We achieve this by searching for void regions and locating the obstacles that cause these shadows. Our proposed methodology can be used to detect an object that has been hidden by an adversary as these objects, while hidden from 3D object detectors, still induce shadow artifacts in 3D point clouds, which we use for obstacle detection. We show that using 3D shadows for obstacle detection can achieve high accuracy in matching shadows to their object and provide precise prediction of an obstacle's distance from the ego-vehicle. ",

To resolve the sample efficiency issue in learning the high-dimensional and complex control of dexterous grasping, we propose an effective representation of grasping state characterizing the spatial interaction between the gripper and the target object. To represent gripper-object interaction, we adopt Interaction Bisector Surface (IBS) which is the Voronoi diagram between two close by 3D geometric objects and has been successfully applied in characterizing spatial relations between 3D objects. We found that IBS is surprisingly effective as a state representation since it well informs the fine-grained control of each finger with spatial relation against the target object. This novel grasp representation, together with several technical contributions including a fast IBS approximation, a novel vector-based reward and an effective training strategy, facilitate learning a strong control model of high-DOF grasping with good sample efficiency, dynamic adaptability, and cross-category generality. Experiments show that it generates high-quality dexterous grasp for complex shapes with smooth grasping motions. ",

First, we formally define the notion of robustness, as well as the robust MSSG model. Then, for the non-cooperative setting, we prove the existence of a robust approximate equilibrium in any such game, and provide an efficient construction thereof. For the cooperative setting, we show that any such game admits a robust approximate alpha-core, provide an efficient construction thereof, and prove that stronger types of the core may be empty. Interestingly, the robust solutions can substantially increase the defenders' utilities over those of the non-robust ones. ",

    "abstract": "In urban areas, global navigation satellite system (GNSS) signals are often reflected or blocked by buildings, thus resulting in large positioning errors. In this study, we proposed a machine learning approach for global positioning system (GPS) multipath detection that uses dual antennas. A machine learning model that could classify GPS signal reception conditions was trained with several GPS measurements selected as suggested features. We applied five features for machine learning, including a feature obtained from the dual antennas, and evaluated the classification performance of the model, after applying four machine learning algorithms: gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT), random forest, decision tree, and K-nearest neighbor (KNN). It was found that a classification accuracy of 82%-96% was achieved when the test data set was collected at the same locations as those of the training data set. However, when the test data set was collected at locations different from those of the training data, a classification accuracy of 44%-77% was obtained. ",

We add this adaptation feature to multilayer perceptrons and convolutional neural networks trained on MNIST and CIFAR-10. Surprisingly, adaptation improved the performance of these networks.

While existing methods achieve impressive results, they are limited by their strong demand for training data and their weak generalization abilities to out-of-distribution data. To overcome these limitations, in this work we propose to combine neural implicit representations for appearance modeling with neural ordinary differential equations (ODEs) for modelling physical phenomena to obtain a dynamic scene representation that can be identified directly from visual observations. Our proposed model combines several unique advantages: (i) Contrary to existing approaches that require large training datasets, we are able to identify physical parameters from only a single video. (ii) The use of neural implicit representations enables the processing of high-resolution videos and the synthesis of photo-realistic images. (iii) The embedded neural ODE has a known parametric form that allows for the identification of interpretable physical parameters, and (iv) long-term prediction in state space. (v) Furthermore, the photo-realistic rendering of novel scenes with modified physical parameters becomes possible. ",

    "abstract": "We present an approach to learn voice-face representations from the talking face videos, without any identity labels. Previous works employ cross-modal instance discrimination tasks to establish the correlation of voice and face. These methods neglect the semantic content of different videos, introducing false-negative pairs as training noise. Furthermore, the positive pairs are constructed based on the natural correlation between audio clips and visual frames. However, this correlation might be weak or inaccurate in a large amount of real-world data, which leads to deviating positives into the contrastive paradigm. To address these issues, we propose the cross-modal prototype contrastive learning (CMPC), which takes advantage of contrastive methods and resists adverse effects of false negatives and deviate positives. On one hand, CMPC could learn the intra-class invariance by constructing semantic-wise positives via unsupervised clustering in different modalities. On the other hand, by comparing the similarities of cross-modal instances from that of cross-modal prototypes, we dynamically recalibrate the unlearnable instances' contribution to overall loss. Experiments show that the proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised methods on various voice-face association evaluation protocols. Additionally, in the low-shot supervision setting, our method also has a significant improvement compared to previous instance-wise contrastive learning. ",

The model consists of a pre-trained bidirectional transformer-based encoder (BERT) and a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) with a regression head to predict the yield. We experimented on two high throughput experimentation (HTE) datasets for Buchwald-Hartwig and Suzuki-Miyaura reactions. The experiments show improvements in the prediction on both datasets compared to systems using only SMILES or chemical descriptors as input. We also tested the model's performance on out-of-sample dataset splits of Buchwald-Hartwig and achieved comparable results with the state-of-the-art. In addition to predicting the yield, we demonstrated the model's ability to suggest the optimum (highest yield) reaction conditions. The model was able to suggest conditions that achieves 94% of the optimum reported yields. This proves the model to be useful in achieving the best results in the wet lab without expensive experimentation. ",

In this work, we identify and construct an explicit set of neural network classifiers that achieve optimality. Since effective neural networks in practice are typically both wide and deep, we analyze infinitely wide networks that are also infinitely deep. In particular, using the recent connection between infinitely wide neural networks and Neural Tangent Kernels, we provide explicit activation functions that can be used to construct networks that achieve optimality. Interestingly, these activation functions are simple and easy to implement, yet differ from commonly used activations such as ReLU or sigmoid. More generally, we create a taxonomy of infinitely wide and deep networks and show that these models implement one of three well-known classifiers depending on the activation function used: (1) 1-nearest neighbor (model predictions are given by the label of the nearest training example); (2) majority vote (model predictions are given by the label of the class with greatest representation in the training set); or (3) singular kernel classifiers (a set of classifiers containing those that achieve optimality). Our results highlight the benefit of using deep networks for classification tasks, in contrast to regression tasks, where excessive depth is harmful. ",

However, due to the combinatorial nature of network topology, it is extremely difficult to obtain an optimal solution, especially since topology planning in networks also often comes with management-specific constraints. As a result, local optimization with hand-tuned heuristic methods from human experts are often adopted in practice. Yet, heuristic methods cannot cover the global topology design space while taking into account constraints, and cannot guarantee to find good solutions. In this paper, we propose a novel deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm, called Advantage Actor Critic-Graph Searching (A2C-GS), for network topology optimization. A2C-GS consists of three novel components, including a verifier to validate the correctness of a generated network topology, a graph neural network (GNN) to efficiently approximate topology rating, and a DRL actor layer to conduct a topology search. A2C-GS can efficiently search over large topology space and output topology with satisfying performance. We conduct a case study based on a real network scenario, and our experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of A2C-GS in terms of both efficiency and performance. ",

In particular, our approach allows lower clock drift than Sundial and PTP, quickly recovers from multiple failures, and reduces the time uncertainty bound by up to 5x.

We therefore propose a novel approach to SGS, which, for the first time in this domain, employs an Evolutionary Computation paradigm: EASGS. EASGS effectively searches the huge SGS solution space via suitable solution encoding in a chromosome and a specially-designed set of operators. The operators include three types of mutations, each focusing on a particular aspect of the SGS solution, optimized crossover and a local coverage improvement scheme (a memetic aspect of EASGS). We also introduce a new set of benchmark games, based on dense or locally-dense graphs that reflect real-world SGS settings.

For another, advanced domain alignment methods in both parts further enhance the performance. Thus, we propose the Object-Aware Alignment (OAA) module and the Optimal Transport based Alignment (OTA) module to achieve comprehensive domain alignment on the outputs of the backbone and the detector. The OAA module aligns the foreground regions identified by pseudo-labels in the backbone outputs, leading to domain-invariant based features.

This analysis is shown to be more accurate than principal component analysis for distinguishing between field programmable gate arrays configured with trojan free and trojan inserted logic. This framework is tested on a set of scalable trojans that we developed and measured with the QDM. Scalable and TrustHub trojans are detectable down to a minimum trojan trigger size of 0.5% of the total logic.

    "title": "Breaking the Linear Error Barrier in Differentially Private Graph  Distance Release",
    "abstract": "Releasing all pairwise shortest path (APSP) distances between vertices on general graphs under weight Differential Privacy (DP) is known as a challenging task. In the previous attempt of (Sealfon 2016}, by adding Laplace noise to each edge weight or to each output distance, to achieve DP with some fixed budget, with high probability the maximal absolute error among all published pairwise distances is roughly $O(n)$ where $n$ is the number of nodes. It was shown that this error could be reduced for some special graphs, which, however, is hard for general graphs. Therefore, whether the approximation error can be reduced to sublinear in $n$ is posted as an interesting open problem. We break the linear barrier on the distance approximation error of previous result, by proposing an algorithm that releases a constructed synthetic graph privately. Computing all pairwise distances on the constructed graph only introduces $\\tilde O(n^{1/2})$ error in answering all pairwise shortest path distances for fixed privacy parameter. Our method is based on a novel graph diameter (link length) augmentation via constructing \"shortcuts\" for the paths. By adding a set of shortcut edges to the original graph, we show that any node pair has a shortest path with link length $\\tilde O(n^{1/2})$. Then by adding noises with some positive mean to the edge weights, we show that the new graph is differentially private and can be published to answer all pairwise shortest path distances with $\\tilde O(n^{1/2})$ approximation error using standard APSP computation. Additionally, we consider the graph with small feedback vertex set number. A feedback vertex set (FVS) of a graph is a set of vertices whose removal leaves a graph without cycles, and the feedback vertex set number of a graph, $k$, is the size of a smallest feedback vertex set. We propose a DP algorithm with error rate $\\tilde O(k)$. ",

This is an important step for building resilient AI systems for safety-critical applications such as automotive, finance, and healthcare. For that purpose, we propose a multi-agent system that combines both machine and human agents. In this system, a checker agent calculates a trust score of each instance (which penalizes overconfidence and overcautiousness in predictions) using an agreement-based method and ranks it; then an improver agent filters the anomalous instances based on a human rule-based procedure (which is considered safe), gets the human labels, applies geometric data augmentation, and retrains with the augmented data using transfer learning. We evaluate the system on corrupted versions of the MNIST and FashionMNIST datasets. We get an improvement in accuracy and trust score with just few additional labels compared to a baseline approach.

    "abstract": "A multilingual tokenizer is a fundamental component of multilingual neural machine translation. It is trained from a multilingual corpus. Since a skewed data distribution is considered to be harmful, a sampling strategy is usually used to balance languages in the corpus. However, few works have systematically answered how language imbalance in tokenizer training affects downstream performance. In this work, we analyze how translation performance changes as the data ratios among languages vary in the tokenizer training corpus. We find that while relatively better performance is often observed when languages are more equally sampled, the downstream performance is more robust to language imbalance than we usually expected. Two features, UNK rate and closeness to the character level, can warn of poor downstream performance before performing the task. We also distinguish language sampling for tokenizer training from sampling for model training and show that the model is more sensitive to the latter. ",

Often interactions are only coarsely known in terms of a regulatory or signalling network topology. Consequently, ODE models of the dynamics suffer from high dimensional parameters which presents a significant obstruction to studying the global dynamics via numerical methods. Given a network topology describing state variables which regulate one another via monotone and bounded functions, we first use the Dynamic Signatures Generated by Regulatory Networks (DSGRN) software to obtain a combinatorial description which summarizes the dynamics. This summary is coarse but global and we use this information as a first pass to identify \"interesting\" subsets of parameters in which to focus. We construct an associated ODE model with high parameter dimension using our Network Dynamics Modeling and Analysis (NDMA) Python library. We introduce algorithms for efficiently investigating the dynamics in these ODE models restricted to these parameter subsets. Finally, we perform a statistical validation of the method and several interesting dynamical applications including finding saddle-node bifurcations in a 54 parameter model. ",

    "abstract": "Explanatory studies, such as randomized controlled trials, are targeted to extract the true causal effect of interventions on outcomes and are by design adjusted for covariates through randomization. On the contrary, observational studies are a representation of events that occurred without intervention. Both can be illustrated using the Structural Causal Model (SCM), and do-calculus can be employed to estimate the causal effects. Pragmatic clinical trials (PCT) fall between these two ends of the trial design spectra and are thus hard to define. Due to its pragmatic nature, no standardized representation of PCT through SCM has been yet established. In this paper, we approach this problem by proposing a generalized representation of PCT under the rubric of structural causal models (SCM). We discuss different analysis techniques commonly employed in PCT using the proposed graphical model, such as intention-to-treat, as-treated, and per-protocol analysis. To show the application of our proposed approach, we leverage an experimental dataset from a pragmatic clinical trial. Our proposition of SCM through PCT creates a pathway to leveraging do-calculus and related mathematical operations on clinical datasets. ",

This study shows how easy it is to reconstruct images for different data initialization schemes and distance measures. We show how data and model architecture influence the optimal choice of initialization scheme and distance measure configurations when working with single images. We demonstrate that the choice of initialization scheme and distance measure can significantly increase convergence speed and quality.

    "abstract": "As the global population continues to face significant negative impact by the on-going COVID-19 pandemic, there has been an increasing usage of point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) imaging as a low-cost and effective imaging modality of choice in the COVID-19 clinical workflow. A major barrier with widespread adoption of POCUS in the COVID-19 clinical workflow is the scarcity of expert clinicians that can interpret POCUS examinations, leading to considerable interest in deep learning-driven clinical decision support systems to tackle this challenge. A major challenge to building deep neural networks for COVID-19 screening using POCUS is the heterogeneity in the types of probes used to capture ultrasound images (e.g., convex vs. linear probes), which can lead to very different visual appearances. In this study, we explore the impact of leveraging extended linear-convex ultrasound augmentation learning on producing enhanced deep neural networks for COVID-19 assessment, where we conduct data augmentation on convex probe data alongside linear probe data that have been transformed to better resemble convex probe data. Experimental results using an efficient deep columnar anti-aliased convolutional neural network designed via a machined-driven design exploration strategy (which we name COVID-Net US-X) show that the proposed extended linear-convex ultrasound augmentation learning significantly increases performance, with a gain of 5.1% in test accuracy and 13.6% in AUC.

Traditionally, the selection of appropriate maskers and gain levels has been informed by expert opinion, which may not representative of the target population, or by listening tests, which can be time-consuming and labour-intensive. Furthermore, the resulting static choices of masker and gain are often inflexible to the dynamic nature of real-world soundscapes. In this work, we utilized a deep learning model to perform joint selection of the optimal masker and its gain level for a given soundscape. The proposed model was designed with highly modular building blocks, allowing for an optimized inference process that can quickly search through a large number of masker and gain combinations. In addition, we introduced the use of feature-domain soundscape augmentation conditioned on the digital gain level, eliminating the computationally expensive waveform-domain mixing process during inference time, as well as the tedious pre-calibration process required for new maskers. The proposed system was validated on a large-scale dataset of subjective responses to augmented soundscapes with more than 440 participants, ensuring the ability of the model to predict combined effect of the masker and its gain level on the perceptual pleasantness level.

Traditionally, the choice of maskers is often predicated on expert guidance or post-hoc analysis which can be time-consuming and sometimes arbitrary. Moreover, this often results in a static set of maskers that are inflexible to the dynamic nature of real-world acoustic environments. Overcoming the inflexibility of traditional soundscape augmentation is twofold. First, given a snapshot of a soundscape, the system must be able to select an optimal masker without human supervision. Second, the system must also be able to react to changes in the acoustic environment with near real-time latency. In this work, we harness the combined prowess of cloud computing and the Internet of Things (IoT) to allow in-situ listening and playback using microcontrollers while delegating computationally expensive inference tasks to the cloud. In particular, a serverless cloud architecture was used for inference, ensuring near real-time latency and scalability without the need to provision computing resources. A working prototype of the system is currently being deployed in a public area experiencing high traffic noise, as well as undergoing public evaluation for future improvements. ",

The proposed ADL consists of two auto-encoders: a denoiser and a discriminator. The denoiser removes noise from input data and the discriminator compares the denoised result to its noise-free counterpart. This process is repeated until the discriminator cannot differentiate the denoised data from the reference. Both the denoiser and the discriminator are built upon a proposed auto-encoder called Efficient-Unet. Efficient-Unet has a light architecture that uses the residual blocks and a novel pyramidal approach in the backbone to efficiently extract and re-use feature maps. During training, the textural information and contrast are controlled by two novel loss functions. The architecture of Efficient-Unet allows generalizing the proposed method to any sort of biomedical data. The 2D version of our network was trained on ImageNet and tested on biomedical datasets whose distribution is completely different from ImageNet; so, there is no need for re-training. Experimental results carried out on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), dermatoscopy, electron microscopy and X-ray datasets show that the proposed method achieved the best on each benchmark.

However, it has proven challenging to infer the interaction rules directly from data. In the field of equation discovery, the Weak form Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (WSINDy) methodology has been shown to be very computationally efficient for identifying the governing equations of complex systems, even in the presence of substantial noise. Motivated by the success of IPS models to describe the spatial movement of organisms, we develop WSINDy for second order IPSs to model the movement of communities of cells. Specifically, our approach learns the directional interaction rules that govern the dynamics of a heterogeneous population of migrating cells. Rather than aggregating cellular trajectory data into a single best-fit model, we learn the models for each individual cell. These models can then be efficiently classified according to the active classes of interactions present in the model. From these classifications, aggregated models are constructed hierarchically to simultaneously identify different species of cells present in the population and determine best-fit models for each species. We demonstrate the efficiency and proficiency of the method on several test scenarios, motivated by common cell migration experiments. ",

Existing methods for nonlinear robust control often use scenario-based approaches to formulate the control problem as nonlinear optimisation problems. Solving the resulting optimisation problems is a challenge due to the size of the problem. Mitigating the size of the problem by reducing the number of scenarios requires knowledge about how the uncertainty affects the system. This paper draws from local reduction methods used in semi-infinite optimisation to propose a new method to solve robust optimal control problems without a priori knowledge of the system or the uncertainty. By iteratively adding interim worst-case scenarios to the problem, we ensure robustness as well as provide control over the total number of scenarios. The method is validated in two case studies: temperature control in a residential building and flow control in a centrifugal compressor. In the building case study, with 590 uncertain parameters, the usual approach based on boundary values for each parameter would give $2^{590}$ scenarios. Our method only needed to include 68 scenarios in order to provide constraint satisfaction when tested for random realisations of uncertainties. In the compressor case study, the number of scenarios was reduced from 512 to nine, facilitating the numerical solution of the nonlinear optimisation problem while satisfying strict safety constraints.
