    "title": "Growing Isotropic Neural Cellular Automata",
    "abstract": "Modeling the ability of multicellular organisms to build and maintain their bodies through local interactions between individual cells (morphogenesis) is a long-standing challenge of developmental biology. Recently, the Neural Cellular Automata (NCA) model was proposed as a way to find local system rules that produce a desired global behaviour, such as growing and persisting a predefined pattern, by repeatedly applying the same rule over a grid starting from a single cell. In this work we argue that the original Growing NCA model has an important limitation: anisotropy of the learned update rule. This implies the presence of an external factor that orients the cells in a particular direction. In other words, 'physical' rules of the underlying system are not invariant to rotation, thus prohibiting the existence of differently oriented instances of the target pattern on the same grid. We propose a modified Isotropic NCA model that does not have this limitation. We demonstrate that cell systems can be trained to grow accurate asymmetrical patterns through either of two methods: by breaking symmetries using structured seeds; or by introducing a rotation-reflection invariant training objective and relying on symmetry breaking caused by asynchronous cell updates.

    "title": "Deep Sequence Modeling for Anomalous ISP Traffic Prediction",
    "abstract": "Internet traffic in the real world is susceptible to various external and internal factors which may abruptly change the normal traffic flow. Those unexpected changes are considered outliers in traffic. However, deep sequence models have been used to predict complex IP traffic, but their comparative performance for anomalous traffic has not been studied extensively. In this paper, we investigated and evaluated the performance of different deep sequence models for anomalous traffic prediction. Several deep sequences models were implemented to predict real traffic without and with outliers and show the significance of outlier detection in real-world traffic prediction. First, two different outlier detection techniques, such as the Three-Sigma rule and Isolation Forest, were applied to identify the anomaly. Second, we adjusted those abnormal data points using the Backward Filling technique before training the model. Finally, the performance of different models was compared for abnormal and adjusted traffic. LSTM_Encoder_Decoder (LSTM_En_De) is the best prediction model in our experiment, reducing the deviation between actual and predicted traffic by more than 11\\% after adjusting the outliers. All other models, including Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), LSTM_En_De with Attention layer (LSTM_En_De_Atn), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), show better prediction after replacing the outliers and decreasing prediction error by more than 29%, 24%, 19%, and 10% respectively. Our experimental results indicate that the outliers in the data can significantly impact the quality of the prediction. Thus, outlier detection and mitigation assist the deep sequence model in learning the general trend and making better predictions. ",

    "abstract": "Self-supervised pretraining has made few-shot learning possible for many NLP tasks. But the pretraining objectives are not typically adapted specifically for in-context few-shot learning. In this paper, we propose to use self-supervision in an intermediate training stage between pretraining and downstream few-shot usage with the goal to teach the model to perform in-context few shot learning. We propose and evaluate four self-supervised objectives on two benchmarks. We find that the intermediate self-supervision stage produces models that outperform strong baselines. Ablation study shows that several factors affect the downstream performance, such as the amount of training data and the diversity of the self-supervised objectives. Human-annotated cross-task supervision and self-supervision are complementary. Qualitative analysis suggests that the self-supervised-trained models are better at following task requirements. ",

    "abstract": "Semi-supervised video anomaly detection (VAD) methods formulate the task of anomaly detection as detection of deviations from the learned normal patterns. Previous works in the field (reconstruction or prediction-based methods) suffer from two drawbacks: 1) They focus on low-level features, and they (especially holistic approaches) do not effectively consider the object classes. 2) Object-centric approaches neglect some of the context information (such as location). To tackle these challenges, this paper proposes a novel two-stream object-aware VAD method that learns the normal appearance and motion patterns through image translation tasks. The appearance branch translates the input image to the target semantic segmentation map produced by Mask-RCNN, and the motion branch associates each frame with its expected optical flow magnitude. Any deviation from the expected appearance or motion in the inference stage shows the degree of potential abnormality. We evaluated our proposed method on the ShanghaiTech, UCSD-Ped1, and UCSD-Ped2 datasets and the results show competitive performance compared with state-of-the-art works. Most importantly, the results show that, as significant improvements to previous methods, detections by our method are completely explainable and anomalies are localized accurately in the frames. ",

In this work, we theoretically analyze the mean squared error of DNNs that use memristor crossbars to compute MVM. We take into account both the quantization noise, due to the necessity of reducing the DNN model size, and the programming noise, stemming from the variability during the programming of the memristance value. Simulations on pre-trained DNN models showcase the accuracy of the analytical prediction. Furthermore the proposed method is almost two order of magnitude faster than Monte-Carlo simulation, thus making it possible to optimize the implementation parameters to achieve minimal error for a given power constraint.

    "abstract": "Deep learning (DL) is being used extensively for text classification. However, researchers have demonstrated the vulnerability of such classifiers to adversarial attacks. Attackers modify the text in a way which misleads the classifier while keeping the original meaning close to intact. State-of-the-art (SOTA) attack algorithms follow the general principle of making minimal changes to the text so as to not jeopardize semantics. Taking advantage of this we propose a novel and intuitive defense strategy called Sample Shielding. It is attacker and classifier agnostic, does not require any reconfiguration of the classifier or external resources and is simple to implement. Essentially, we sample subsets of the input text, classify them and summarize these into a final decision. We shield three popular DL text classifiers with Sample Shielding, test their resilience against four SOTA attackers across three datasets in a realistic threat setting. Even when given the advantage of knowing about our shielding strategy the adversary's attack success rate is <=10% with only one exception and often < 5%. Additionally, Sample Shielding maintains near original accuracy when applied to original texts. Crucially, we show that the `make minimal changes' approach of SOTA attackers leads to critical vulnerabilities that can be defended against with an intuitive sampling strategy. ",

    "title": "In Defense of Image Pre-Training for Spatiotemporal Recognition",
    "abstract": "Image pre-training, the current de-facto paradigm for a wide range of visual tasks, is generally less favored in the field of video recognition. By contrast, a common strategy is to directly train with spatiotemporal convolutional neural networks (CNNs) from scratch. Nonetheless, interestingly, by taking a closer look at these from-scratch learned CNNs, we note there exist certain 3D kernels that exhibit much stronger appearance modeling ability than others, arguably suggesting appearance information is already well disentangled in learning. Inspired by this observation, we hypothesize that the key to effectively leveraging image pre-training lies in the decomposition of learning spatial and temporal features, and revisiting image pre-training as the appearance prior to initializing 3D kernels. In addition, we propose Spatial-Temporal Separable (STS) convolution, which explicitly splits the feature channels into spatial and temporal groups, to further enable a more thorough decomposition of spatiotemporal features for fine-tuning 3D CNNs. Our experiments show that simply replacing 3D convolution with STS notably improves a wide range of 3D CNNs without increasing parameters and computation on both Kinetics-400 and Something-Something V2. Moreover, this new training pipeline consistently achieves better results on video recognition with significant speedup. For instance, we achieve +0.6% top-1 of Slowfast on Kinetics-400 over the strong 256-epoch 128-GPU baseline while fine-tuning for only 50 epochs with 4 GPUs.

While the relationship between a pair of AUs can be complex and unique, existing approaches fail to specifically and explicitly represent such cues for each pair of AUs in each facial display. This paper proposes an AU relationship modelling approach that deep learns a unique graph to explicitly describe the relationship between each pair of AUs of the target facial display. Our approach first encodes each AU's activation status and its association with other AUs into a node feature. Then, it learns a pair of multi-dimensional edge features to describe multiple task-specific relationship cues between each pair of AUs. During both node and edge feature learning, our approach also considers the influence of the unique facial display on AUs' relationship by taking the full face representation as an input. Experimental results on BP4D and DISFA datasets show that both node and edge feature learning modules provide large performance improvements for CNN and transformer-based backbones, with our best systems achieving the state-of-the-art AU recognition results. Our approach not only has a strong capability in modelling relationship cues for AU recognition but also can be easily incorporated into various backbones. Our PyTorch code is made available. ",

A CCT utilizes a convolutional layer that introduces inductive biases and shared weights into a network, allowing a transformer architecture to perform well with fewer data samples used for training. The CCT uses an attention mechanism to incorporate information from all parts of a signal under analysis. Trained on both genuine human voice signals and synthesized human voice signals, we demonstrate that our CCT approach successfully differentiates between genuine and synthesized speech signals. ",

Heterophily is the tendency of unlike individuals to form social ties. Conversely, populations in spatial areas with significant hazard exposure similarity, homophily, would lack sufficient resourcefulness to aid each other to lessen the impact of hazards. In the context of the Houston metropolitan area, we use Meta's Social Connectedness data to construct a socio-spatial network in juxtaposition with flood exposure data from National Flood Hazard Layer to analyze flood hazard exposure of spatial areas. The results reveal the extent and spatial variation of hazard-exposure heterophily in the study area. Notably, the results show that lower-income areas have lower hazard-exposure heterophily possibly caused by income segregation and the tendency of affordable housing development to be located in flood zones. Less resourceful social ties due to high hazard-exposure homophily may inhibit low-income areas from better coping with hazard impacts and could contribute to their slower recovery. Overall, the results underscore the significance of characterizing hazard-exposure heterophily in socio-spatial networks to reveal community vulnerability and resilience to hazards. ",

    "abstract": "Research on knowledge graph embedding (KGE) has emerged as an active field in which most existing KGE approaches mainly focus on static structural data and ignore the influence of temporal variation involved in time-aware triples. In order to deal with this issue, several temporal knowledge graph embedding (TKGE) approaches have been proposed to integrate temporal and structural information in recent years. However, these methods only employ a uniformly random sampling to construct negative facts. As a consequence, the corrupted samples are often too simplistic for training an effective model. In this paper, we propose a new temporal knowledge graph embedding framework by introducing adversarial learning to further refine the performance of traditional TKGE models. In our framework, a generator is utilized to construct high-quality plausible quadruples and a discriminator learns to obtain the embeddings of entities and relations based on both positive and negative samples. Meanwhile, we also apply a Gumbel-Softmax relaxation and the Wasserstein distance to prevent vanishing gradient problems on discrete data; an inherent flaw in traditional generative adversarial networks. Through comprehensive experimentation on temporal datasets, the results indicate that our proposed framework can attain significant improvements based on benchmark models and also demonstrate the effectiveness and applicability of our framework.

Drawing inspiration from the developments in SSL, we introduce Crystal Twins (CT): an SSL method for crystalline materials property prediction. Using a large unlabeled dataset, we pre-train a Graph Neural Network (GNN) by applying the redundancy reduction principle to the graph latent embeddings of augmented instances obtained from the same crystalline system.

In light of the rapid development in machine learning, there is a rise in the need to explore automated solutions to prevent crimes. With the increasing availability of both fine-grained urban and public service data, there is a recent surge in fusing such cross-domain information to facilitate crime prediction. By capturing the information about social structure, environment, and crime trends, existing machine learning predictive models have explored the dynamic crime patterns from different views. However, these approaches mostly convert such multi-source knowledge into implicit and latent representations (e.g., learned embeddings of districts), making it still a challenge to investigate the impacts of explicit factors for the occurrences of crimes behind the scenes. In this paper, we present a Spatial-Temporal Metapath guided Explainable Crime prediction (STMEC) framework to capture dynamic patterns of crime behaviours and explicitly characterize how the environmental and social factors mutually interact to produce the forecasts. Extensive experiments show the superiority of STMEC compared with other advanced spatiotemporal models, especially in predicting felonies (e.g., robberies and assaults with dangerous weapons). ",

It is a type of gesture recognition where the dictionary corresponds to letters in a specific language. In particular, airwriting recognition using sensor data from wrist-worn devices can be used as a medium of user input for applications in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). Recognition of in-air trajectories using such wrist-worn devices is limited in literature and forms the basis of the current work. In this paper, we propose an airwriting recognition framework by first encoding the time-series data obtained from a wearable Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) on the wrist as images and then utilizing deep learning-based models for identifying the written alphabets. The signals recorded from 3-axis accelerometer and gyroscope in IMU are encoded as images using different techniques such as Self Similarity Matrix (SSM), Gramian Angular Field (GAF) and Markov Transition Field (MTF) to form two sets of 3-channel images. These are then fed to two separate classification models and letter prediction is made based on an average of the class conditional probabilities obtained from the two models. Several standard model architectures for image classification such as variants of ResNet, DenseNet, VGGNet, AlexNet and GoogleNet have been utilized. Experiments performed on two publicly available datasets demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed strategy.

These skills not only enable humans to perform complex tasks, but also provide powerful priors for guiding their behaviors when learning new tasks. This is in stark contrast to what is common practice in physics-based character animation, where control policies are most typically trained from scratch for each task. In this work, we present a large-scale data-driven framework for learning versatile and reusable skill embeddings for physically simulated characters. Our approach combines techniques from adversarial imitation learning and unsupervised reinforcement learning to develop skill embeddings that produce life-like behaviors, while also providing an easy to control representation for use on new downstream tasks. Our models can be trained using large datasets of unstructured motion clips, without requiring any task-specific annotation or segmentation of the motion data. By leveraging a massively parallel GPU-based simulator, we are able to train skill embeddings using over a decade of simulated experiences, enabling our model to learn a rich and versatile repertoire of skills. We show that a single pre-trained model can be effectively applied to perform a diverse set of new tasks. Our system also allows users to specify tasks through simple reward functions, and the skill embedding then enables the character to automatically synthesize complex and naturalistic strategies in order to achieve the task objectives.

Characterizing and improving our understanding of phenotypes could reveal factors related to tumor progression and their underpinning biological processes, ultimately improving diagnosis and treatment. In recent years, the field of histological deep learning applications has seen great progress, yet most of these applications focus on a supervised approach, relating tissue and associated sample annotations. Supervised approaches have their impact limited by two factors. Firstly, high-quality labels are expensive in time and effort, which makes them not easily scalable. Secondly, these methods focus on predicting annotations from histological images, fundamentally restricting the discovery of new tissue phenotypes. These limitations emphasize the importance of using new methods that can characterize tissue by the features enclosed in the image, without pre-defined annotation or supervision. We present Phenotype Representation Learning (PRL), a methodology to extract histomorphological phenotypes through self-supervised learning and community detection. PRL creates phenotype clusters by identifying tissue patterns that share common morphological and cellular features, allowing to describe whole slide images through compositional representations of cluster contributions. We used this framework to analyze histopathology slides of LUAD and LUSC lung cancer subtypes from TCGA and NYU cohorts. We show that PRL achieves a robust lung subtype prediction providing statistically relevant phenotypes for each lung subtype. We further demonstrate the significance of these phenotypes in lung adenocarcinoma overall and recurrence free survival, relating clusters with patient outcomes, cell types, grown patterns, and omic-based immune signatures.

Spam domain detection is a race: as soon as the spam mails are sent, taking down the domain or blacklisting it is of relative use, as spammers have to register a new domain for their next campaign. To prevent malicious actors from sending mails, we need to detect them as fast as possible and, ideally, even before the campaign is launched. In this paper, using near-real-time passive DNS data from Farsight Security, we monitor the DNS traffic of newly registered domains and the contents of their TXT records, in particular, the configuration of the Sender Policy Framework, an anti-spoofing protocol for domain names and the first line of defense against devastating Business Email Compromise scams. Because spammers and benign domains have different SPF rules and different traffic profiles, we build a new method to detect spam domains using features collected from passive DNS traffic. Using the SPF configuration and the traffic to the TXT records of a domain, we accurately detect a significant proportion of spam domains with a low false positives rate demonstrating its potential in real-world deployments. Our classification scheme can detect spam domains before they send any mail, using only a single DNS query and later on, it can refine its classification by monitoring more traffic to the domain name.

However, how P2P to be integrated into the existing power systems remains to be investigated. In this paper, we apply network charge as a means for the grid operator to attribute transmission loss and ensure network constraints for empowering P2P transaction. The interaction between the grid operator and the prosumers is modeled as a Stackelberg game, which yields a bi-level optimization problem. We prove that the Stackelberg game admits an equilibrium network charge price. Besides, we propose a method to obtain the network charge price by converting the bi-level optimization into a single-level mixed-integer quadratic programming (MIQP), which can handle a reasonable scale of prosumers efficiently. Simulations on the IEEE bus systems show that the proposed optimal network charge is favorable as it can benefit both the grid operator and the prosumers for empowering the P2P market, and achieves near-optimal social welfare. Moreover, the results show that the presence of energy storage will make the prosumers more sensitive to the network charge price changes. ",

Under data-type aware conditions, the privacy mechanism provides a one-hot encoding of categorical features, representing exactly one class, while under data-type ignorant conditions the categorical variables are represented by a collection of scores, one for each class. We use a neural network architecture consisting of a generator and a discriminator, where the generator consists of an encoder-decoder pair, and the discriminator consists of an adversary and a utility provider. Unlike previous research considering this kind of architecture, which leverages autoencoders (AEs) without introducing any randomness, or variational autoencoders (VAEs) based on learning latent representations which are then forced into a Gaussian assumption, our proposed technique introduces randomness and removes the Gaussian assumption restriction on the latent variables, only focusing on the end-to-end stochastic mapping of the input to privatized data. We test our framework on different datasets: MNIST, FashionMNIST, UCI Adult, and US Census Demographic Data, providing a wide range of possible private and utility attributes. We use multiple adversaries simultaneously to test our privacy mechanism -- some trained from the ground truth data and some trained from the perturbed data generated by our privacy mechanism. Through comparative analysis, our results demonstrate better privacy and utility guarantees than the existing works under similar, data-type ignorant conditions, even when the latter are considered under their original restrictive single-adversary model.

Constrained networks are an integral part of many emerging application domains, from IoT meshes to satellite networks. A particularly difficult challenge is how to enforce timely revocation of compromised or faulty devices. Unfortunately, current solutions and techniques cannot cope with idiosyncrasies of constrained networks, since they mandate frequent real-time communication with centralized entities, storage and maintenance of large amounts of revocation information, and incur considerable bandwidth overhead. To address the shortcomings of existing solutions, we design V'CER, a secure and efficient scheme for certificate validation that augments and benefits a PKI for constrained networks. V'CER utilizes unique features of Sparse Merkle Trees (SMTs) to perform lightweight revocation checks, while enabling collaborative operations among devices to keep them up-to-date when connectivity to external authorities is limited. V'CER can complement any PKI scheme to increase its flexibility and applicability, while ensuring fast dissemination of validation information independent of the network routing or topology. V'CER requires under 3KB storage per node covering 106 certificates. We developed and deployed a prototype of V'CER on an in-orbit satellite and our large-scale simulations demonstrate that V'CER decreases the number of requests for updates from external authorities by over 93%, when nodes are intermittently connected.

Such interactive agents are often trained via reinforcement learning to optimize task performance, even when such rewards may lead to agent behaviors that violate societal norms -- causing harm either to the agent itself or other entities in the environment. Social value alignment refers to creating agents whose behaviors conform to expected moral and social norms for a given context and group of people -- in our case, it means agents that behave in a manner that is less harmful and more beneficial for themselves and others. We build on the Jiminy Cricket benchmark (Hendrycks et al. 2021), a set of 25 annotated interactive narratives containing thousands of morally salient scenarios covering everything from theft and bodily harm to altruism. We introduce the GALAD (Game-value ALignment through Action Distillation) agent that uses the social commonsense knowledge present in specially trained language models to contextually restrict its action space to only those actions that are aligned with socially beneficial values. An experimental study shows that the GALAD agent makes decisions efficiently enough to improve state-of-the-art task performance by 4% while reducing the frequency of socially harmful behaviors by 25% compared to strong contemporary value alignment approaches.

Alternatively the calibration can be transferred using low-cost, mobile sensors, often at very low cost.

We propose a variational approach to model the calibration across the network of sensors. We demonstrate the approach on both synthetic and real air pollution data, and find it can perform better than the state of the art (multi-hop calibration). We extend it to categorical data, combining classifications of insects by non-expert citizen scientists. Achieving uncertainty-quantified calibration has been one of the major barriers to low-cost sensor deployment and citizen-science research.

In this survey, we provide a comprehensive systematization of poisoning attacks and defenses in machine learning, reviewing more than 200 papers published in the field in the last 15 years.

    "abstract": "Systems like Voice-command based conversational agents are characterized by a pre-defined set of skills or intents to perform user specified tasks. In the course of time, newer intents may emerge requiring retraining. However, the newer intents may not be explicitly announced and need to be inferred dynamically. Thus, there are two important tasks at hand (a). identifying emerging new intents, (b). annotating data of the new intents so that the underlying classifier can be retrained efficiently. The tasks become specially challenging when a large number of new intents emerge simultaneously and there is a limited budget of manual annotation. In this paper, we propose MNID (Multiple Novel Intent Detection) which is a cluster based framework to detect multiple novel intents with budgeted human annotation cost. Empirical results on various benchmark datasets (of different sizes) demonstrate that MNID, by intelligently using the budget for annotation, outperforms the baseline methods in terms of accuracy and F1-score.

    "abstract": "Recognizing transformation types applied to a video clip (RecogTrans) is a long-established paradigm for self-supervised video representation learning, which achieves much inferior performance compared to instance discrimination approaches (InstDisc) in recent works. However, based on a thorough comparison of representative RecogTrans and InstDisc methods, we observe the great potential of RecogTrans on both semantic-related and temporal-related downstream tasks. Based on hard-label classification, existing RecogTrans approaches suffer from noisy supervision signals in pre-training. To mitigate this problem, we developed TransRank, a unified framework for recognizing Transformations in a Ranking formulation. TransRank provides accurate supervision signals by recognizing transformations relatively, consistently outperforming the classification-based formulation. Meanwhile, the unified framework can be instantiated with an arbitrary set of temporal or spatial transformations, demonstrating good generality. With a ranking-based formulation and several empirical practices, we achieve competitive performance on video retrieval and action recognition. Under the same setting, TransRank surpasses the previous state-of-the-art method by 6.4% on UCF101 and 8.3% on HMDB51 for action recognition (Top1 Acc); improves video retrieval on UCF101 by 20.4% (R@1). The promising results validate that RecogTrans is still a worth exploring paradigm for video self-supervised learning. Codes will be released at https://github.com/kennymckormick/TransRank. ",

    "abstract": "Recent years have witnessed increasing interest in code representation learning, which aims to represent the semantics of source code into distributed vectors. Currently, various works have been proposed to represent the complex semantics of source code from different views, including plain text, Abstract Syntax Tree (AST), and several kinds of code graphs (e.g., Control/Data Flow Graph). However, most of them only consider a single view of source code independently, ignoring the correspondences among different views. In this paper, we propose to integrate different views with the natural-language description of source code into a unified framework with Multi-View contrastive Pre-training, and name our model as CODE-MVP. Specifically, we first extract multiple code views using compiler tools, and learn the complementary information among them under a contrastive learning framework. Inspired by the type checking in compilation, we also design a fine-grained type inference objective in the pre-training. Experiments on three downstream tasks over five datasets demonstrate the superiority of CODE-MVP when compared with several state-of-the-art baselines. For example, we achieve 2.4/2.3/1.1 gain in terms of MRR/MAP/Accuracy metrics on natural language code retrieval, code similarity, and code defect detection tasks, respectively. ",

In this work, we propose a super-resolution method for such multi-exposure sequences, a problem that has received very little attention in the literature. The proposed method can handle the signal-dependent noise in the inputs, process sequences of any length, and be robust to inaccuracies in the exposure times. Furthermore, it can be trained end-to-end with self-supervision, without requiring ground truth high resolution frames, which makes it especially suited to handle real data. Central to our method are three key contributions: i) a base-detail decomposition for handling errors in the exposure times, ii) a noise-level-aware feature encoding for improved fusion of frames with varying signal-to-noise ratio and iii) a permutation invariant fusion strategy by temporal pooling operators. We evaluate the proposed method on synthetic and real data and show that it outperforms by a significant margin existing single-exposure approaches that we adapted to the multi-exposure case. ",

Identifying important keyphrase is the central component of the keyphrase extraction task, and its main challenge is how to represent information comprehensively and discriminate importance accurately. In this paper, to address these issues, we design a new hyperbolic matching model (HyperMatch) to represent phrases and documents in the same hyperbolic space and explicitly estimate the phrase-document relevance via the Poincar\\'e distance as the important score of each phrase. Specifically, to capture the hierarchical syntactic and semantic structure information, HyperMatch takes advantage of the hidden representations in multiple layers of RoBERTa and integrates them as the word embeddings via an adaptive mixing layer. Meanwhile, considering the hierarchical structure hidden in the document, HyperMatch embeds both phrases and documents in the same hyperbolic space via a hyperbolic phrase encoder and a hyperbolic document encoder. This strategy can further enhance the estimation of phrase-document relevance due to the good properties of hyperbolic space. In this setting, the keyphrase extraction can be taken as a matching problem and effectively implemented by minimizing a hyperbolic margin-based triplet loss. Extensive experiments are conducted on six benchmarks and demonstrate that HyperMatch outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines. ",

Of these, one popular category in SSL is distillation networks such as BYOL. This work proposes RSDnet, which applies the distillation network (BYOL) in the remote sensing (RS) domain where data is non-trivially different from natural RGB images. Since Multi-spectral (MS) and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) sensors provide varied spectral and spatial resolution information, we utilised them as an implicit augmentation to learn invariant feature embeddings. In order to learn RS based invariant features with SSL, we trained RSDnet in two ways, i.e., single channel feature learning and three channel feature learning. This work explores the usefulness of single channel feature learning from random MS and SAR bands compared to the common notion of using three or more bands. In our linear evaluation, these single channel features reached a 0.92 F1 score on the EuroSAT classification task and 59.6 mIoU on the DFC segmentation task for certain single bands. We also compared our results with ImageNet weights and showed that the RS based SSL model outperforms the supervised ImageNet based model. We further explored the usefulness of multi-modal data compared to single modality data, and it is shown that utilising MS and SAR data learn better invariant representations than utilising only MS data.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we for the first time investigate the random access problem for a delay-constrained heterogeneous wireless network. We begin with a simple two-device problem where two devices deliver delay-constrained traffic to an access point (AP) via a common unreliable collision channel. By assuming that one device (called Device 1) adopts ALOHA, we aim to optimize the random access scheme of the other device (called Device 2). The most intriguing part of this problem is that Device 2 does not know the information of Device 1 but needs to maximize the system timely throughput. We first propose a Markov Decision Process (MDP) formulation to derive a model-based upper bound so as to quantify the performance gap of certain random access schemes. We then utilize reinforcement learning (RL) to design an R-learning-based random access scheme, called tiny state-space R-learning random access (TSRA), which is subsequently extended for the tackling of the general multi-device problem. We carry out extensive simulations to show that the proposed TSRA simultaneously achieves higher timely throughput, lower computation complexity, and lower power consumption than the existing baseline--deep-reinforcement learning multiple access (DLMA). This indicates that our proposed TSRA scheme is a promising means for efficient random access over massive mobile devices with limited computation and battery capabilities. ",

    "abstract": "Differential privacy (DP) is considered a de-facto standard for protecting users' privacy in data analysis, machine, and deep learning. Existing DP-based privacy-preserving training approaches consist of adding noise to the clients' gradients before sharing them with the server. However, implementing DP on the gradient is not efficient as the privacy leakage increases by increasing the synchronization training epochs due to the composition theorem. Recently researchers were able to recover images used in the training dataset using Generative Regression Neural Network (GRNN) even when the gradient was protected by DP. In this paper, we propose two layers of privacy protection approach to overcome the limitations of the existing DP-based approaches. The first layer reduces the dimension of the training dataset based on Hensel's Lemma. We are the first to use Hensel's Lemma for reducing the dimension (i.e., compress) of a dataset. The new dimensionality reduction method allows reducing the dimension of a dataset without losing information since Hensel's Lemma guarantees uniqueness. The second layer applies DP to the compressed dataset generated by the first layer. The proposed approach overcomes the problem of privacy leakage due to composition by applying DP only once before the training; clients train their local model on the privacy-preserving dataset generated by the second layer. Experimental results show that the proposed approach ensures strong privacy protection while achieving good accuracy. The new dimensionality reduction method achieves an accuracy of 97%, with only 25 % of the original data size. ",

With the increasing availability of sensor data from industrial systems, being able to detecting anomalies from streams of multivariate time series data is of significant importance. Given the scarcity of anomalies in real-world applications, the majority of literature has been focusing on modeling normality. The learned normal representations can empower anomaly detection as the model has learned to capture certain key underlying data regularities. A typical formulation is to learn a predictive model, i.e., use a window of time series data to predict future data values. In this paper, we propose an alternative self-supervised learning task. By randomly masking a portion of the inputs and training a model to estimate them using the remaining ones, MAD is an improvement over the traditional left-to-right next step prediction (NSP) task. Our experimental results demonstrate that MAD can achieve better anomaly detection rates over traditional NSP approaches when using exactly the same neural network (NN) base models, and can be modified to run as fast as NSP models during test time on the same hardware, thus making it an ideal upgrade for many existing NSP-based NN anomaly detection models.

Moreover, from the little research that has been done at the intersection of neuroevolution and evolutionary multi-objective optimization (EMO), all the research that has been carried out has focused predominantly on the use of one type of DNN: convolutional neural networks (CNNs), using well-established standard benchmark problems such as MNIST.

Purely grid-based detection models operate on a bird's-eye-view (BEV) projection of the input point cloud. These approaches suffer from a loss of detailed information through the discrete grid resolution. This applies in particular to radar object detection, where relatively coarse grid resolutions are commonly used to account for the sparsity of radar point clouds. In contrast, point-based models are not affected by this problem as they continuously process point clouds. However, they generally exhibit worse detection performances than grid-based methods. We show that a point-based model can extract neighborhood features, leveraging the exact relative positions of points, before grid rendering. This has significant benefits for a following convolutional detection backbone. In experiments on the public nuScenes dataset our hybrid architecture achieves improvements in terms of detection performance and orientation estimates over networks from previous literature. ",

Accurately predicting VPS information plays a crucial role in intelligent parking guidance systems, which can help drivers find parking space quickly, reducing unnecessary waste of time and excessive environmental pollution. Through the simple analysis of historical data, we found that there not only exists a obvious temporal correlation in each parking lot, but also a clear spatial correlation between different parking lots. In view of this, this paper proposed a graph data-based model ST-GBGRU (Spatial-Temporal Graph Based Gated Recurrent Unit), the number of VPSs can be predicted both in short-term (i.e., within 30 min) and in long-term (i.e., over 30min). On the one hand, the temporal correlation of historical VPS data is extracted by GRU, on the other hand, the spatial correlation of historical VPS data is extracted by GCN inside GRU. Two prediction methods, namely direct prediction and iterative prediction, are combined with the proposed model. Finally, the prediction model is applied to predict the number VPSs of 8 public parking lots in Santa Monica. The results show that in the short-term and long-term prediction tasks, ST-GBGRU model can achieve high accuracy and have good application prospects. ",

    "abstract": "The information of spiking neural networks (SNNs) are propagated between the adjacent biological neuron by spikes, which provides a computing paradigm with the promise of simulating the human brain. Recent studies have found that the time delay of neurons plays an important role in the learning process. Therefore, configuring the precise timing of the spike is a promising direction for understanding and improving the transmission process of temporal information in SNNs. However, most of the existing learning methods for spiking neurons are focusing on the adjustment of synaptic weight, while very few research has been working on axonal delay. In this paper, we verify the effectiveness of integrating time delay into supervised learning and propose a module that modulates the axonal delay through short-term memory. To this end, a rectified axonal delay (RAD) module is integrated with the spiking model to align the spike timing and thus improve the characterization learning ability of temporal features. Experiments on three neuromorphic benchmark datasets : NMNIST, DVS Gesture and N-TIDIGITS18 show that the proposed method achieves the state-of-the-art performance while using the fewest parameters.

    "abstract": "The output of Deep Neural Networks (DNN) can be altered by a small perturbation of the input in a black box setting by making multiple calls to the DNN. However, the high computation and time required makes the existing approaches unusable. This work seeks to improve the One-pixel (few-pixel) black-box adversarial attacks to reduce the number of calls to the network under attack. The One-pixel attack uses a non-gradient optimization algorithm to find pixel-level perturbations under the constraint of a fixed number of pixels, which causes the network to predict the wrong label for a given image. We show through experimental results how the choice of the optimization algorithm and initial positions to search can reduce function calls and increase attack success significantly, making the attack more practical in real-world settings.

    "abstract": "This paper presents a few comprehensive experimental studies for automated Structural Damage Detection (SDD) in extreme events using deep learning methods for processing 2D images. In the first study, a 152-layer Residual network (ResNet) is utilized to classify multiple classes in eight SDD tasks, which include identification of scene levels, damage levels, material types, etc. The proposed ResNet achieved high accuracy for each task while the positions of the damage are not identifiable. In the second study, the existing ResNet and a segmentation network (U-Net) are combined into a new pipeline, cascaded networks, for categorizing and locating structural damage. The results show that the accuracy of damage detection is significantly improved compared to only using a segmentation network. In the third and fourth studies, end-to-end networks are developed and tested as a new solution to directly detect cracks and spalling in the image collections of recent large earthquakes. One of the proposed networks can achieve an accuracy above 67.6% for all tested images at various scales and resolutions, and shows its robustness for these human-free detection tasks. As a preliminary field study, we applied the proposed method to detect damage in a concrete structure that was tested to study its progressive collapse performance. The experiments indicate that these solutions for automatic detection of structural damage using deep learning methods are feasible and promising. The training datasets and codes will be made available for the public upon the publication of this paper. ",

A significant subset of these approaches incorporate differentially private mechanisms to perturb word embeddings, thus replacing individual words in a sentence. While these methods represent very important contributions, have various advantages over other techniques and do show anonymization capabilities, they have several shortcomings. In this paper, we investigate these weaknesses and demonstrate significant mathematical constraints diminishing the theoretical privacy guarantee as well as major practical shortcomings with regard to the protection against deanonymization attacks, the preservation of content of the original sentences as well as the quality of the language output. Finally, we propose a new method for text anonymization based on transformer based language models fine-tuned for paraphrasing that circumvents most of the identified weaknesses and also offers a formal privacy guarantee. We evaluate the performance of our method via thorough experimentation and demonstrate superior performance over the discussed mechanisms. ",

Besides, a clause graph is also established to model coarse-grained semantic relations between clauses. Experimental results indicate that MGSAG surpasses the existing state-of-the-art ECPE models. Especially, MGSAG outperforms other models significantly in the condition of position-insensitive data. ",

However, the best way to use data to search network architectures is still unclear and under exploration. Previous work [19, 46] has analyzed the necessity of having ground-truth labels in NAS and inspired broad interest. In this work, we take a further step to question whether real data is necessary for NAS to be effective. The answer to this question is important for applications with limited amount of accessible data, and can help people improve NAS by leveraging the extra flexibility of data generation. To explore if NAS needs real data, we construct three types of unreal datasets using: 1) randomly labeled real images; 2) generated images and labels; and 3) generated Gaussian noise with random labels. These datasets facilitate to analyze the generalization and expressivity of the searched architectures. We study the performance of architectures searched on these constructed datasets using popular differentiable NAS methods. Extensive experiments on CIFAR, ImageNet and CheXpert [12] show that the searched architectures can achieve promising results compared with those derived from the conventional NAS pipeline with real labeled data, suggesting the feasibility of performing NAS with unreal data.

Here we modeled texts co-occurrence networks, where nodes are words and edges are established either by contextual or semantical similarity. We compared two embedding approaches -- Word2vec and BERT -- to check whether edges created via word embeddings can improve the quality of the keyword extraction method. We found that, in fact, the use of virtual edges can improve the discriminability of co-occurrence networks. The best performance was obtained when we considered low percentages of addition of virtual (embedding) edges. A comparative analysis of structural and dynamical network metrics revealed the degree, PageRank, and accessibility are the metrics displaying the best performance in the model enriched with virtual edges.

Further, we propose a decomposition-based approach to solve stage-graphical games in a scalable and decentralized fashion by approximating virtual, mean neighborhoods.

    "abstract": "Using ideas from Generalized Degrees of Freedom (GDoF) analyses and extremal network theory, this work studies the extremal gain of optimal power control over binary power control, especially in large interference networks, in search of new theoretical insights. Whereas numerical studies have established that in most practical settings binary power control is close to optimal, the extremal analysis shows not only there exist settings where the gain from optimal power control can be quite significant, but also bounds the extremal values of such gains from a GDoF perspective. As its main contribution, we explicitly characterizes the extremal GDoF gain of optimal over binary power control as $\\Theta(\\sqrt{K})$ for all $K$. In particular, the extremal gain is bounded between $\\lfloor \\sqrt{K}\\rfloor$ and $2.5\\sqrt{K}$ for every $K$. For $K=2,3,4,5,6$ users, the precise extremal gain is $1, 3/2, 2, 9/4$ and $41/16$, respectively. Networks shown to achieve the extremal gain may be interpreted as multi-tier heterogeneous networks. It is worthwhile to note that because of their focus on asymptotic analysis, the sharp characterizations of extremal gains are valuable primarily from a theoretical perspective, and not as contradictions to the conventional wisdom that binary power control is generally close to optimal in practical, non-asymptotic settings.

The proposed drop-max layer eliminates unstable features and helps learn representations that are robust to image perturbations.

The estimation of price-sensitivity parameters of this model via direct one-stage regression techniques may lead to biased estimates. We propose a two-stage estimation methodology which makes the estimation of the price-sensitivity parameters robust to biases in the nuisance parameters of the model. In the first-stage we construct the estimators of observed purchases and price given the feature vector using sophisticated ML estimators like deep neural networks. Utilizing the estimators from the first-stage, in the second-stage we leverage a Bayesian dynamic generalized linear model to estimate the price-sensitivity parameters.

This dissertation is concerned with theoretical justification and practical application of the APG algorithms for solving processing network control optimization problems. Processing network control problems are typically formulated as Markov decision process (MDP) or semi-Markov decision process (SMDP) problems that have several unconventional for RL features: infinite state spaces, unbounded costs, long-run average cost objectives. Policy improvement bounds play a crucial role in the theoretical justification of the APG algorithms. In this thesis we refine existing bounds for MDPs with finite state spaces and prove novel policy improvement bounds for classes of MDPs and SMDPs used to model processing network operations. We consider two examples of processing network control problems and customize the PPO algorithm to solve them. First, we consider parallel-server and multiclass queueing networks controls. Second, we consider the drivers repositioning problem in a ride-hailing service system. For both examples the PPO algorithm with auxiliary modifications consistently generates control policies that outperform state-of-art heuristics. ",

One possible alternative in this context is to utilize operator learning algorithm that directly learn nonlinear mapping between two functional spaces; this facilitates real-time prediction of naturally arising complex evolutionary dynamics. In this work, we introduce a novel operator learning algorithm referred to as the Wavelet Neural Operator (WNO) that blends integral kernel with wavelet transformation. WNO harnesses the superiority of the wavelets in time-frequency localization of the functions and enables accurate tracking of patterns in spatial domain and effective learning of the functional mappings. Since the wavelets are localized in both time/space and frequency, WNO can provide high spatial and frequency resolution. This offers learning of the finer details of the parametric dependencies in the solution for complex problems. The efficacy and robustness of the proposed WNO are illustrated on a wide array of problems involving Burger's equation, Darcy flow, Navier-Stokes equation, Allen-Cahn equation, and Wave advection equation. Comparative study with respect to existing operator learning frameworks are presented. Finally, the proposed approach is used to build a digital twin capable of predicting Earth's air temperature based on available historical data. ",
