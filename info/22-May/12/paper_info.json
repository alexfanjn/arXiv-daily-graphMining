    "abstract": "Cosine similarity of contextual embeddings is used in many NLP tasks (e.g., QA, IR, MT) and metrics (e.g., BERTScore). Here, we uncover systematic ways in which word similarities estimated by cosine over BERT embeddings are understated and trace this effect to training data frequency. We find that relative to human judgements, cosine similarity underestimates the similarity of frequent words with other instances of the same word or other words across contexts, even after controlling for polysemy and other factors. We conjecture that this underestimation of similarity for high frequency words is due to differences in the representational geometry of high and low frequency words and provide a formal argument for the two-dimensional case.

    "abstract": "We propose a robust data-driven output feedback control algorithm that explicitly incorporates inherent finite-sample model estimate uncertainties into the control design. The algorithm has three components: (1) a subspace identification nominal model estimator; (2) a bootstrap resampling method that quantifies non-asymptotic variance of the nominal model estimate; and (3) a non-conventional robust control design method comprising a coupled optimal dynamic output feedback filter and controller with multiplicative noise. A key advantage of the proposed approach is that the system identification and robust control design procedures both use stochastic uncertainty representations, so that the actual inherent statistical estimation uncertainty directly aligns with the uncertainty the robust controller is being designed against. Moreover, the control design method accommodates a highly structured uncertainty representation that can capture uncertainty shape more effectively than existing approaches. We show through numerical experiments that the proposed robust data-driven output feedback controller can significantly outperform a certainty equivalent controller on various measures of sample complexity and stability robustness.

    "abstract": "The vast majority of text transformation techniques in NLP are inherently limited in their ability to expand input space coverage due to an implicit constraint to preserve the original class label. In this work, we propose the notion of sibylvariance (SIB) to describe the broader set of transforms that relax the label-preserving constraint, knowably vary the expected class, and lead to significantly more diverse input distributions. We offer a unified framework to organize all data transformations, including two types of SIB: (1) Transmutations convert one discrete kind into another, (2) Mixture Mutations blend two or more classes together. To explore the role of sibylvariance within NLP, we implemented 41 text transformations, including several novel techniques like Concept2Sentence and SentMix. Sibylvariance also enables a unique form of adaptive training that generates new input mixtures for the most confused class pairs, challenging the learner to differentiate with greater nuance. Our experiments on six benchmark datasets strongly support the efficacy of sibylvariance for generalization performance, defect detection, and adversarial robustness. ",

This strategy limits their performance in case of out-of-distribution/adversarial data. Humans, meanwhile learn abstract concepts and are mostly unaffected by even extreme image distortions. Humans and networks employ strikingly different strategies to solve visual tasks. To probe this, we introduce a novel set of image transforms and evaluate humans and networks on an object recognition task. We found performance for a few common networks quickly decreases while humans are able to recognize objects with a high accuracy. ",

We propose Gaussian mixture information maximization (GMIM) which utilizes a mutual information maximization approach for node embedding. Meanwhile, it assumes that the representation space follows a Mixture of Gaussians (MoG) distribution. The clustering part of our objective tries to fit a Gaussian distribution to each community.

ConfLab contains high fidelity data of 49 people during a real-life professional networking event capturing a diverse mix of status, acquaintanceship, and networking motivations at an international conference. Recording such a dataset is challenging due to the delicate trade-off between participant privacy and fidelity of the data, and the technical and logistic challenges involved. We improve upon prior datasets in the fidelity of most of our modalities: 8-camera overhead setup, personal wearable sensors recording body motion (9-axis IMU), Bluetooth-based proximity, and low-frequency audio. Additionally, we use a state-of-the-art hardware synchronization solution and time-efficient continuous technique for annotating body keypoints and actions at high frequencies. We argue that our improvements are essential for a deeper study of interaction dynamics at finer time scales. Our research tasks showcase some of the open challenges related to in-the-wild privacy-preserving social data analysis: keypoints detection from overhead camera views, skeleton based no-audio speaker detection, and F-formation detection. With the ConfLab dataset, we aim to bridge the gap between traditional computer vision tasks and in-the-wild ecologically valid socially-motivated tasks. ",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence literature suggests that minority and fragile communities in society can be negatively impacted by machine learning algorithms due to inherent biases in the design process, which lead to socially exclusive decisions and policies. Faced with similar challenges in dealing with an increasingly diversified audience, the museum sector has seen changes in theory and practice, particularly in the areas of representation and meaning-making. While rarity and grandeur used to be at the centre stage of the early museum practices, folk life and museums' relationships with the diverse communities they serve become a widely integrated part of the contemporary practices. These changes address issues of diversity and accessibility in order to offer more socially inclusive services. Drawing on these changes and reflecting back on the AI world, we argue that the museum experience provides useful lessons for building AI with socially inclusive approaches, especially in situations in which both a collection and access to it will need to be curated or filtered, as frequently happens in search engines, recommender systems and digital libraries. We highlight three principles: (1) Instead of upholding the value of neutrality, practitioners are aware of the influences of their own backgrounds and those of others on their work. By not claiming to be neutral but practising cultural humility, the chances of addressing potential biases can be increased. (2) There should be room for situational interpretation beyond the stages of data collection and machine learning. Before applying models and predictions, the contexts in which relevant parties exist should be taken into account. (3) Community participation serves the needs of communities and has the added benefit of bringing practitioners and communities together. ",

The ability to accurately predict how long accidents will last can provide significant benefits to both end-users in their route choice and traffic operation managers in handling of non-recurrent traffic congestion. This paper presents a novel bi-level machine learning framework enhanced with outlier removal and intra-extra joint optimisation for predicting the incident duration on three heterogeneous data sets collected for both arterial roads and motorways from Sydney, Australia and San-Francisco, U.S.A. Firstly, we use incident data logs to develop a binary classification prediction approach, which allows us to classify traffic incidents as short-term or long-term. We find the optimal threshold between short-term versus long-term traffic incident duration, targeting both class balance and prediction performance while also comparing the binary versus multi-class classification approaches. Secondly, for more granularity of the incident duration prediction to the minute level, we propose a new Intra-Extra Joint Optimisation algorithm (IEO-ML) which extends multiple baseline ML models tested against several regression scenarios across the data sets. Final results indicate that: a) 40-45 min is the best split threshold for identifying short versus long-term incidents and that these incidents should be modelled separately, b) our proposed IEO-ML approach significantly outperforms baseline ML models in $66\\%$ of all cases showcasing its great potential for accurate incident duration prediction. Lastly, we evaluate the feature importance and show that time, location, incident type, incident reporting source and weather at among the top 10 critical factors which influence how long incidents will last.

Existing research efforts dedicated to the IM problem depend on a strong assumption: the selected seed users are willing to spread the information after receiving benefits from a company or organization. In reality, however, some seed users may be reluctant to spread the information, or need to be paid higher to be motivated. Furthermore, the existing IM works pay little attention to capture user's influence propagation in the future period as well. In this paper, we target a new research problem, named Reconnecting Top-l Relationships (RTlR) query, which aims to find l number of previous existing relationships but being stranged later, such that reconnecting these relationships will maximize the expected benefit of influenced users by the given group in a future period. We prove that the RTlR problem is NP-hard. An efficient greedy algorithm is proposed to answer the RTlR queries with the influence estimation technique and the well-chosen link prediction method to predict the near future network structure. We also design a pruning method to reduce unnecessary probing from candidate edges. Further, a carefully designed order-based algorithm is proposed to accelerate the RTlR queries. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on real-world datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed methods. ",

In this paper, we work on bounding-box based weakly-supervised saliency detection to relieve the labeling effort. Given the bounding box annotation, we observe that pixels inside the bounding box may contain extensive labeling noise. However, as a large amount of background is excluded, the foreground bounding box region contains a less complex background, making it possible to perform handcrafted features-based saliency detection with only the cropped foreground region. As the conventional handcrafted features are not representative enough, leading to noisy saliency maps, we further introduce structure-aware self-supervised loss to regularize the structure of the prediction. Further, we claim that pixels outside the bounding box should be background, thus partial cross-entropy loss function can be used to accurately localize the accurate background region. Experimental results on six benchmark RGB saliency datasets illustrate the effectiveness of our model. ",

And this related associations knowledge for process monitoring is often implicit in these dynamic monitoring data which always have richer operation condition information and have not been paid enough attention in current research. To this end, a new process monitoring method based on spatial-based graph convolution neural network (SGCN) is proposed to describe the characteristics of the dynamic associations which can be used to represent the operation status over time. Spatia-temporal graphs are firstly defined, which can be used to represent the characteristics of node attributes (dynamic edge features) dynamically changing with time. Then, the associations between monitoring variables at a certain time can be considered as the node attributes to define a snapshot of the static graph network at the certain time. Finally, the snapshot containing graph structure and node attributes is used as model inputs which are processed to implement graph classification by spatial-based convolution graph neural network with aggregate and readout steps. The feasibility and applicability of this proposed method are demonstrated by our experimental results of benchmark and practical case application. ",

Our method mainly consists of a boundary proposal module and an iteratively optimized boundary transformer module. The boundary proposal module consisting of multi-layer dilated convolutions will compute important prior information (including classification map, distance field, and direction field) for generating coarse boundary proposals meanwhile guiding the optimization of boundary transformer. The boundary transformer module adopts an encoder-decoder structure, in which the encoder is constructed by multi-layer transformer blocks with residual connection while the decoder is a simple multi-layer perceptron network (MLP). Under the guidance of prior information, the boundary transformer module will gradually refine the coarse boundary proposals via boundary deformation in an iterative manner. Furthermore, we propose a novel boundary energy loss (BEL) which introduces an energy minimization constraint and an energy monotonically decreasing constraint for every boundary optimization step. Extensive experiments on publicly available and challenging datasets demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance and promising efficiency of our method. ",

Generally, for a certain node in a given graph, a traditional GNN layer can be regarded as an aggregation from one-hop neighbors, thus a set of stacked layers are able to fetch and update node status within multi-hops. For nodes with sparse connectivity, it is difficult to obtain enough information through a single GNN layer as not only there are only few nodes directly connected to them but also can not propagate the high-order neighbor information. However, as the number of layer increases, the GNN model is prone to over-smooth for nodes with the dense connectivity, which resulting in the decrease of accuracy. To tackle this issue, in this thesis, we define a novel framework that allows the normal GNN model to accommodate more layers. Specifically, a node-degree based gate is employed to adjust weight of layers dynamically, that try to enhance the information aggregation ability and reduce the probability of over-smoothing. Experimental results show that our proposed model can effectively increase the model depth and perform well on several datasets. ",

    "abstract": "Sensors from smart consumer devices have demonstrated high potential to serve as digital biomarkers in the identification of movement disorders in recent years. With the usage of broadly available smartwatches we have recorded participants performing technology-based assessments in a prospective study to research Parkinson's Disease (PD). In total, 504 participants, including PD patients, differential diagnoses (DD) and healthy controls (HC), were captured with a comprehensive system utilizing two smartwatches and two smartphones. To the best of our knowledge, this study provided the largest PD sample size of two-hand synchronous smartwatch measurements. To establish a future easy-to use home-based assessment system in PD screening, we systematically evaluated the performance of the system based on a significantly reduced set of assessments with only one-sided measures and assessed, whether we can maintain classification accuracy.

    "abstract": "Imposing physical constraints on neural networks as a method of knowledge embedding has achieved great progress in solving physical problems described by governing equations. However, for many engineering problems, governing equations often have complex forms, including complex partial derivatives or stochastic physical fields, which results in significant inconveniences from the perspective of implementation. In this paper, a scientific machine learning framework, called AutoKE, is proposed, and a reservoir flow problem is taken as an instance to demonstrate that this framework can effectively automate the process of embedding physical knowledge. In AutoKE, an emulator comprised of deep neural networks (DNNs) is built for predicting the physical variables of interest. An arbitrarily complex equation can be parsed and automatically converted into a computational graph through the equation parser module, and the fitness of the emulator to the governing equation is evaluated via automatic differentiation. Furthermore, the fixed weights in the loss function are substituted with adaptive weights by incorporating the Lagrangian dual method. Neural architecture search (NAS) is also introduced into the AutoKE to select an optimal network architecture of the emulator according to the specific problem. Finally, we apply transfer learning to enhance the scalability of the emulator. In experiments, the framework is verified by a series of physical problems in which it can automatically embed physical knowledge into an emulator without heavy hand-coding. The results demonstrate that the emulator can not only make accurate predictions, but also be applied to similar problems with high efficiency via transfer learning. ",

    "abstract": "Nowadays, the analysis of complex phenomena modeled by graphs plays a crucial role in many real-world application domains where decisions can have a strong societal impact. However, numerous studies and papers have recently revealed that machine learning models could lead to potential disparate treatment between individuals and unfair outcomes. In that context, algorithmic contributions for graph mining are not spared by the problem of fairness and present some specific challenges related to the intrinsic nature of graphs: (1) graph data is non-IID, and this assumption may invalidate many existing studies in fair machine learning, (2) suited metric definitions to assess the different types of fairness with relational data and (3) algorithmic challenge on the difficulty of finding a good trade-off between model accuracy and fairness. This survey is the first one dedicated to fairness for relational data. It aims to present a comprehensive review of state-of-the-art techniques in fairness on graph mining and identify the open challenges and future trends. In particular, we start by presenting several sensible application domains and the associated graph mining tasks with a focus on edge prediction and node classification in the sequel. We also recall the different metrics proposed to evaluate potential bias at different levels of the graph mining process; then we provide a comprehensive overview of recent contributions in the domain of fair machine learning for graphs, that we classify into pre-processing, in-processing and post-processing models. We also propose to describe existing graph data, synthetic and real-world benchmarks. Finally, we present in detail five potential promising directions to advance research in studying algorithmic fairness on graphs. ",

However, in maritime surveillance applications, reliably quantifying the prediction uncertainty can be as important as obtaining high accuracy. This paper extends deep learning frameworks for trajectory prediction tasks by exploring how recurrent encoder-decoder neural networks can be tasked not only to predict but also to yield a corresponding prediction uncertainty via Bayesian modeling of epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties. We compare the prediction performance of two different models based on labeled or unlabeled input data to highlight how uncertainty quantification and accuracy can be improved by using, if available, additional information on the intention of the ship (e.g., its planned destination).

Network automation has been widely discussed in the networking community, and it is a sensible means to manage the complex communication network.

To tackle the above issues, in this article we propose a new knowledge-powered framework that provides a human-understandable explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) agent for network automation. A case study of path selection is developed to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed framework. Research on network automation is still in its infancy.

In this work, we propose a system for the multi-label classification and similarity search of logo images. The method allows obtaining the most similar logos on the basis of their shape, color, business sector, semantics, general characteristics, or a combination of such features established by the user. This is done by employing a set of multi-label networks specialized in certain characteristics of logos. The features extracted from these networks are combined to perform the similarity search according to the search criteria established. Since the text of logos is sometimes irrelevant for the classification, a preprocessing stage is carried out to remove it, thus improving the overall performance. The proposed approach is evaluated using the European Union Trademark (EUTM) dataset, structured with the hierarchical Vienna classification system, which includes a series of metadata with which to index trademarks. We also make a comparison between well known logo topologies and Vienna in order to help designers understand their correspondences. The experimentation carried out attained reliable performance results, both quantitatively and qualitatively, which outperformed the state-of-the-art results. In addition, since the semantics and classification of brands can often be subjective, we also surveyed graphic design students and professionals in order to assess the reliability of the proposed method.

    "abstract": "The traditional design principle for Internet protocols indicates: \"Be strict when sending and tolerant when receiving\" [RFC1958], and DNS is no exception to this. The transparency of DNS in handling the DNS records, also standardised specifically for DNS [RFC3597], is one of the key features that made it such a popular platform facilitating a constantly increasing number of new applications. An application simply creates a new DNS record and can instantly start distributing it over DNS without requiring any changes to the DNS servers and platforms. Our Internet wide study confirms that more than 1.3M (96% of tested) open DNS resolvers are standard compliant and treat DNS records transparently. In this work we show that this `transparency' introduces a severe vulnerability in the Internet: we demonstrate a new method to launch string injection attacks by encoding malicious payloads into DNS records. We show how to weaponise such DNS records to attack popular applications. For instance, we apply string injection to launch a new type of DNS cache poisoning attack, which we evaluated against a population of open resolvers and found 105K to be vulnerable. Such cache poisoning cannot be prevented with common setups of DNSSEC. Our attacks apply to internal as well as to public services, for instance, we reveal that all eduroam services are vulnerable to our injection attacks, allowing us to launch exploits ranging from unauthorised access to eduroam networks to resource starvation. Depending on the application, our attacks cause system crashes, data corruption and leakage, degradation of security, and can introduce remote code execution and arbitrary errors. In our evaluation of the attacks in the Internet we find that all the standard compliant open DNS resolvers we tested allow our injection attacks against applications and users on their networks. ",

However, very few works study the detection of incrementally appearing deepfakes in the real-world scenarios. To simulate the wild scenes, this paper suggests a continual deepfake detection benchmark (CDDB) over a new collection of deepfakes from both known and unknown generative models. The suggested CDDB designs multiple evaluations on the detection over easy, hard, and long sequence of deepfake tasks, with a set of appropriate measures. In addition, we exploit multiple approaches to adapt multiclass incremental learning methods, commonly used in the continual visual recognition, to the continual deepfake detection problem. We evaluate several methods, including the adapted ones, on the proposed CDDB. Within the proposed benchmark, we explore some commonly known essentials of standard continual learning. Our study provides new insights on these essentials in the context of continual deepfake detection. The suggested CDDB is clearly more challenging than the existing benchmarks, which thus offers a suitable evaluation avenue to the future research. Our benchmark dataset and the source code will be made publicly available. ",

The developed training method allowed for effective learning of the correlation between the spatial conditions (i.e. non-stationary maps) and the realizations implicitly without using additional loss terms or solving a costly optimization problem at the realization generation phase. Our models, trained on real and artificial datasets were able to generate geologically-plausible realizations beyond the training samples with a strong correlation with the target maps. ",

Moreover, we study the robustness of winning alternatives in two ways: First, we consider whether we can make a limited number of changes to the preferences cast by the delegating or directly voting agents such that a given alternative becomes a winner in one/in all delegations, and second, whether we can make a limited number of changes to a selected delegation to make a given alternative a winner.

More specifically, we present an SSL scheme to achieve scene consistency, while exploring considerable data augmentation and shuffling methods to boost the model generalizability.

Self-supervised grasp learning is one of the most promising approaches to human-like robotic grasp. However, due to inadequate feedback on grasp quality, almost the existing self-supervised grasp learning methods are coarse-grained. This paper proposes a fine-grained antipodal grasp learning (FAGL) method with augmented learning feedback. First, an indicator called antipodal degree of a grasp (ADG) is defined by a non-increasing monotonous function. ADG reflecting fine-grained grasp quality is evaluated indirectly by the destructive effect of a grasp on the environment via scene images. Next, we design a restorative sampling strategy to collect the samples of fine-grained antipodal grasps and propose a refined affordance network to generate grasp affordance maps for FAGL to decide grasp policies. Finally, in grasping actual metal workpieces, FAGL outperforms its peers in terms of grasp success rate and ADG in cluttered and adversarial scenarios by reducing the grasp effects on the surroundings. The results of extensive experiments show that our method has great potential for industrial application. ",

The follow-up research adapted similar methods like masked image modeling in vision transformer and demonstrated improvements in the image classification task. Such simple self-supervised methods are not exhaustively studied for object detection transformers (DETR, Deformable DETR) as their transformer encoder modules take input in the convolutional neural network (CNN) extracted feature space rather than the image space as in general vision transformers. However, the CNN feature maps still maintain the spatial relationship and we utilize this property to design self-supervised learning approaches to train the encoder of object detection transformers in pretraining and multi-task learning settings. We explore common self-supervised methods based on image reconstruction, masked image modeling and jigsaw. Preliminary experiments in the iSAID dataset demonstrate faster convergence of DETR in the initial epochs in both pretraining and multi-task learning settings; nonetheless, similar improvement is not observed in the case of multi-task learning with Deformable DETR.

    "abstract": "Autonomous driving requires efficient reasoning about the Spatio-temporal nature of the semantics of the scene. Recent approaches have successfully amalgamated the traditional modular architecture of an autonomous driving stack comprising perception, prediction, and planning in an end-to-end trainable system. Such a system calls for a shared latent space embedding with interpretable intermediate trainable projected representation. One such successfully deployed representation is the Bird's-Eye View(BEV) representation of the scene in ego-frame. However, a fundamental assumption for an undistorted BEV is the local coplanarity of the world around the ego-vehicle. This assumption is highly restrictive, as roads, in general, do have gradients. The resulting distortions make path planning inefficient and incorrect. To overcome this limitation, we propose Neural Manifold Representation (NMR), a representation for the task of autonomous driving that learns to infer semantics and predict way-points on a manifold over a finite horizon, centered on the ego-vehicle. We do this using an iterative attention mechanism applied on a latent high dimensional embedding of surround monocular images and partial ego-vehicle state. This representation helps generate motion and behavior plans consistent with and cognizant of the surface geometry. We propose a sampling algorithm based on edge-adaptive coverage loss of BEV occupancy grid and associated guidance flow field to generate the surface manifold while incurring minimal computational overhead. We aim to test the efficacy of our approach on CARLA and SYNTHIA-SF. ",

    "abstract": "In many practical cases face detection on smartphones or other highly portable devices is a necessity. Applications include mobile face access control systems, driver status tracking, emotion recognition, etc. Mobile devices have limited processing power and should have long-enough battery life even with face detection application running. Thus, striking the right balance between algorithm quality and complexity is crucial. In this work we adapt 5 algorithms to mobile. These algorithms are based on handcrafted or neural-network-based features and include: Viola-Jones (Haar cascade), LBP, HOG, MTCNN, BlazeFace. We analyze inference time of these algorithms on different devices with different input image resolutions. We provide guidance, which algorithms are the best fit for mobile face access control systems and potentially other mobile applications. Interestingly, we note that cascaded algorithms perform faster on scenes without faces, while BlazeFace is slower on empty scenes. Exploiting this behavior might be useful in practice. ",

Prosodic features such as energy and pitch have been shown to be useful for DAC. Despite their importance, little research has explored neural approaches to integrate prosodic features into end-to-end (E2E) DAC models which infer dialogue acts directly from audio signals. In this work, we propose an E2E neural architecture that takes into account the need for characterizing prosodic phenomena co-occurring at different levels inside an utterance. A novel part of this architecture is a learnable gating mechanism that assesses the importance of prosodic features and selectively retains core information necessary for E2E DAC. Our proposed model improves DAC accuracy by 1.07% absolute across three publicly available benchmark datasets. ",

    "abstract": "In an upward-planar L-drawing of a directed acyclic graph (DAG) each edge $e$ is represented as a polyline composed of a vertical segment with its lowest endpoint at the tail of $e$ and of a horizontal segment ending at the head of $e$. Distinct edges may overlap, but not cross. Recently, upward-planar L-drawings have been studied for $st$-graphs, i.e., planar DAGs with a single source $s$ and a single sink $t$ containing an edge directed from $s$ to $t$. It is known that a plane $st$-graph, i.e., an embedded $st$-graph in which the edge $(s,t)$ is incident to the outer face, admits an upward-planar L-drawing if and only if it admits a bitonic $st$-ordering, which can be tested in linear time. We study upward-planar L-drawings of DAGs that are not necessarily $st$-graphs. On the combinatorial side, we show that a plane DAG admits an upward-planar L-drawing if and only if it is a subgraph of a plane $st$-graph admitting a bitonic $st$-ordering. This allows us to show that not every tree with a fixed bimodal embedding admits an upward-planar L-drawing. Moreover, we prove that any acyclic cactus with a single source (or a single sink) admits an upward-planar L-drawing, which respects a given outerplanar embedding if there are no transitive edges. On the algorithmic side, we consider DAGs with a single source (or a single sink). We give linear-time testing algorithms for these DAGs in two cases: (i) when the drawing must respect a prescribed embedding and (ii) when no restriction is given on the embedding, but each biconnected component is series-parallel.

    "abstract": "With the increasing prevalence of encrypted network traffic, cyber security analysts have been turning to machine learning (ML) techniques to elucidate the traffic on their networks. However, ML models can become stale as known traffic features can shift between networks and as new traffic emerges that is outside of the distribution of the training set. In order to reliably adapt in this dynamic environment, ML models must additionally provide contextualized uncertainty quantification to their predictions, which has received little attention in the cyber security domain. Uncertainty quantification is necessary both to signal when the model is uncertain about which class to choose in its label assignment and when the traffic is not likely to belong to any pre-trained classes. We present a new, public dataset of network traffic that includes labeled, Virtual Private Network (VPN)-encrypted network traffic generated by 10 applications and corresponding to 5 application categories. We also present an ML framework that is designed to rapidly train with modest data requirements and provide both calibrated, predictive probabilities as well as an interpretable ``out-of-distribution'' (OOD) score to flag novel traffic samples. We describe how to compute a calibrated OOD score from p-values of the so-called relative Mahalanobis distance. We demonstrate that our framework achieves an F1 score of 0.98 on our dataset and that it can extend to an enterprise network by testing the model: (1) on data from similar applications, (2) on dissimilar application traffic from an existing category, and (3) on application traffic from a new category. The model correctly flags uncertain traffic and, upon retraining, accurately incorporates the new data. We additionally demonstrate good performance (F1 score of 0.97) when packet sizes are made to be uniform, as occurs for certain encryption protocols. ",

    "abstract": "This paper explores training efficient VGG-style super-resolution (SR) networks with the structural re-parameterization technique. The general pipeline of re-parameterization is to train networks with multi-branch topology first, and then merge them into standard 3x3 convolutions for efficient inference. In this work, we revisit those primary designs and investigate essential components for re-parameterizing SR networks. First of all, we find that batch normalization (BN) is important to bring training non-linearity and improve the final performance. However, BN is typically ignored in SR, as it usually degrades the performance and introduces unpleasant artifacts. We carefully analyze the cause of BN issue and then propose a straightforward yet effective solution. In particular, we first train SR networks with mini-batch statistics as usual, and then switch to using population statistics at the later training period. While we have successfully re-introduced BN into SR, we further design a new re-parameterizable block tailored for SR, namely RepSR. It consists of a clean residual path and two expand-and-squeeze convolution paths with the modified BN. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our simple RepSR is capable of achieving superior performance to previous SR re-parameterization methods among different model sizes. In addition, our RepSR can achieve a better trade-off between performance and actual running time (throughput) than previous SR methods.

There has been a flurry of algorithms that try to solve this practical problem, each being claimed effective in some ways. Yet, a benchmark to compare those algorithms directly is lacking, mainly due to the complexity of the algorithms and some custom settings such as the particular network configuration or training procedure. A fair benchmark is important for the further development of channel pruning. Meanwhile, recent investigations reveal that the channel configurations discovered by pruning algorithms are at least as important as the pre-trained weights. This gives channel pruning a new role, namely searching the optimal channel configuration. In this paper, we try to determine the channel configuration of the pruned models by random search. The proposed approach provides a new way to compare different methods, namely how well they behave compared with random pruning. We show that this simple strategy works quite well compared with other channel pruning methods. We also show that under this setting, there are surprisingly no clear winners among different channel importance evaluation methods, which then may tilt the research efforts into advanced channel configuration searching methods.

We improve the best known lower bound to $5$ and present the first asymptotic improvement over the trivial $O(n)$ upper bound, where $n$ denotes the number of vertices in $G$. Specifically, we first prove that the page number of every upward planar graph is bounded in terms of its width, as well as its height.

However, when multiple candidate speakers are visible this traditionally requires solving a separate problem, namely active speaker detection (ASD), which entails selecting at each moment in time which of the visible faces corresponds to the audio. Recent work has shown that we can solve both problems simultaneously by employing an attention mechanism over the competing video tracks of the speakers' faces, at the cost of sacrificing some accuracy on active speaker detection. This work closes this gap in active speaker detection accuracy by presenting a single model that can be jointly trained with a multi-task loss. By combining the two tasks during training we reduce the ASD classification accuracy by approximately 25%, while simultaneously improving the ASR performance when compared to the multi-person baseline trained exclusively for ASR.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we consider a general class of two-stage distributionally robust optimization (DRO) problems which includes prominent problem instances such as task scheduling, the assemble-to-order system, and supply chain network design. The ambiguity set is constrained by fixed marginal distributions that are not necessarily discrete. We develop a numerical algorithm for computing approximately optimal solutions of such problems. Through replacing the marginal constraints by a finite collection of linear constraints, we derive a relaxed-version of the two-stage DRO problem which serves as its upper bound. We can control the error incurred by the relaxation to be arbitrarily close to 0. Subsequently, we develop duality results tailored to this setting and transform the inf-sup problem into an inf-inf problem. This leads to a numerical algorithm for two-stage DRO problems with marginal constraints which solves a linear semi-infinite optimization problem via a cutting-plane method. Besides an approximately optimal solution, the proposed algorithm computes both an upper bound and a lower bound for the optimal value of the problem. The difference between the computed bounds provides us with a direct estimate of the sub-optimality of the computed solution. Most importantly, one is able to choose the inputs of the algorithm such that the sub-optimality is controlled to be arbitrarily small. In our numerical examples, we apply the proposed algorithm to task scheduling, the assemble-to-order system, and supply chain network design. The ambiguity sets in these problems involve a large number of marginals, which include both discrete and continuous distributions. The numerical results showcase that the proposed algorithm computes high-quality robust decisions along with their corresponding sub-optimality estimates with practically reasonable magnitudes that are not over-conservative.

We consider the problem of identifying alterations of brain functional connectivity for a single MDD patient. This is particularly difficult since the amount of data collected during an fMRI scan is too limited to provide sufficient information for individual analysis. Additionally, rs-fMRI data usually has the characteristics of incompleteness, sparsity, variability, high dimensionality and high noise. To address these problems, we proposed a multitask Gaussian Bayesian network (MTGBN) framework capable for identifying individual disease-induced alterations for MDD patients. We assume that such disease-induced alterations show some degrees of similarity with the tool to learn such network structures from observations to understanding of how system are structured jointly from related tasks. First, we treat each patient in a class of observation as a task and then learn the Gaussian Bayesian networks (GBNs) of this data class by learning from all tasks that share a default covariance matrix that encodes prior knowledge. This setting can help us to learn more information from limited data. Next, we derive a closed-form formula of the complete likelihood function and use the Monte-Carlo Expectation-Maximization(MCEM) algorithm to search for the approximately best Bayesian network structures efficiently.

However, when sets of seeds are selected according to the greedy optimization strategy, the influence function behaves effectively as a submodular function. Specifically, violations of the necessary conditions for submodularity are never observed in real networks, and only rarely in synthetic ones. The direct comparison with exact solutions obtained via brute-force search indicate that the greedy strategy provides approximate solutions that are well within the optimality gap guaranteed for strictly submodular functions. Greedy optimization appears therefore an effective strategy for the maximization of influence on temporal networks. ",

Methods: Evaluation of the software was performed on a dataset of 7195 nonmydriatic fundus images from 6325 eyes of 3189 diabetic patients attending our screening program between February to December of 2019. The software generated a DR severity score for each colour fundus image which was combined into an eye-level score. This score was then compared with a reference standard as set by a human expert using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. Results: The artificial intelligence (AI) software achieved an area under the ROC curve (AUC) value of 0.988 [0.981:0.993] for the detection of referable DR. At the proposed operating point, the sensitivity of the RetCAD software for DR is 90.53% and specificity is 97.13%. A workload reduction of 96% could be achieved at the cost of only 6 false negatives. Conclusions: The AI software correctly identified the vast majority of referable DR cases, with a workload reduction of 96% of the cases that would need to be checked, while missing almost no true cases, so it may therefore be used as an instrument for triage.

More specifically, our $\\beta$-VAE can improve PVAE's capacity of disentangling different latent variables from the observed signal without the trade-off problem between disentanglement and signal reconstruction. This trade-off problem widely exists in previous $\\beta$-VAE algorithms. Unlike the previous $\\beta$-VAE algorithms, the proposed $\\beta$-VAE strategy can also be used to optimize the DNN's structure. This means that the proposed method can not only improve PVAE's SE performance but also reduce the number of PVAE training parameters. The experimental results show that the proposed method can acquire better speech and noise latent representation than PVAE. Meanwhile, it also obtains a higher scale-invariant signal-to-distortion ratio, speech quality, and speech intelligibility. ",

    "title": "Quantum Self-Attention Neural Networks for Text Classification",
    "abstract": "An emerging direction of quantum computing is to establish meaningful quantum applications in various fields of artificial intelligence, including natural language processing (NLP). Although some efforts based on syntactic analysis have opened the door to research in Quantum NLP (QNLP), limitations such as heavy syntactic preprocessing and syntax-dependent network architecture make them impracticable on larger and real-world data sets. In this paper, we propose a new simple network architecture, called the quantum self-attention neural network (QSANN), which can make up for these limitations. Specifically, we introduce the self-attention mechanism into quantum neural networks and then utilize a Gaussian projected quantum self-attention serving as a sensible quantum version of self-attention. As a result, QSANN is effective and scalable on larger data sets and has the desirable property of being implementable on near-term quantum devices. In particular, our QSANN outperforms the best existing QNLP model based on syntactic analysis as well as a simple classical self-attention neural network in numerical experiments of text classification tasks on public data sets. We further show that our method exhibits robustness to low-level quantum noises. ",
