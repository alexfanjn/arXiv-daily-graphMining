    "abstract": "Recent efforts within the AI community have yielded impressive results towards \"soft theorem proving\" over natural language sentences using language models. We propose a novel, generative adversarial framework for probing and improving these models' reasoning capabilities. Adversarial attacks in this domain suffer from the logical inconsistency problem, whereby perturbations to the input may alter the label. Our Logically consistent AdVersarial Attacker, LAVA, addresses this by combining a structured generative process with a symbolic solver, guaranteeing logical consistency. Our framework successfully generates adversarial attacks and identifies global weaknesses common across multiple target models. Our analyses reveal naive heuristics and vulnerabilities in these models' reasoning capabilities, exposing an incomplete grasp of logical deduction under logic programs. Finally, in addition to effective probing of these models, we show that training on the generated samples improves the target model's performance. ",

    "abstract": "Low-volume Denial-of-Service ({\\mu}DoS) attacks have been demonstrated to fundamentally bypass traditional DoS mitigation schemes based on the flow and volume of network packets. In this paper, we propose a data-driven approach, called ROKI, that accurately tracks internal resource utilization and allocation associated with each packet (or session), making it possible to tame resource exhaustion caused by {\\mu}DoS attacks. Since ROKI focuses on capturing the symptom of DoS, it can effectively mitigate previously unknown {\\mu}DoS attacks. To enable a finer-grain resource tracking, ROKI provided in concept the accounting capabilities to each packet itself, so we called data-driven: it monitors resource utilization at the link, network, transport layers in the kernel, as well as application layers, and attributes back to the associated packet. Given the resource usages of each packet, ROKI can reclaim (or prevent) the system resources from malicious packets (or attackers) whenever it encounters system-wide resource exhaustion. To provide lightweight resource tracking, ROKI carefully multiplexes hardware performance counters whenever necessary. Our evaluation shows that ROKI's approach is indeed effective in mitigating real-world {\\mu}DoS attacks with negligible performance overheads - incurring 3%-4% throughput and latency overheads on average when the system is throttled.

Therefore, we gathered data on eleven community biolabs by interviewing sixteen lab managers and members. These labs represent half of identified organizations in scope worldwide. Participants detailed their practices and motivations, outlining the constraints and opportunities of their community biolabs. We found that lab members conducted technically challenging project work with access to high-end equipment and professional expertise. We found that the unique nature of biowork exacerbated challenges for cooperative work, partially due to the particular time sensitivities of work with living organisms.

For detection of an airborne UAV we apply a convolutional neural network YOLO trained on a collected and processed dataset of 10,000 images. The trained network is capable of detecting various multirotor UAVs in indoor, outdoor and simulation environments. Furthermore, detection results are improved with Kalman filter which ensures steady and reliable information about position and velocity of a target UAV. Preserving the target UAV in the field of view (FOV) and at required distance is accomplished by a simple nonlinear controller based on visual servoing strategy. The proposed system achieves a real-time performance on Neural Compute Stick 2 with a speed of 20 frames per second (FPS) for the detection of an UAV.

    "abstract": "This paper aims at jointly addressing two seemly conflicting issues in federated learning: differential privacy (DP) and Byzantine-robustness, which are particularly challenging when the distributed data are non-i.i.d. (independent and identically distributed). The standard DP mechanisms add noise to the transmitted messages, and entangles with robust stochastic gradient aggregation to defend against Byzantine attacks. In this paper, we decouple the two issues via robust stochastic model aggregation, in the sense that our proposed DP mechanisms and the defense against Byzantine attacks have separated influence on the learning performance. Leveraging robust stochastic model aggregation, at each iteration, each worker calculates the difference between the local model and the global one, followed by sending the element-wise signs to the master node, which enables robustness to Byzantine attacks. Further, we design two DP mechanisms to perturb the uploaded signs for the purpose of privacy preservation, and prove that they are $(\\epsilon,0)$-DP by exploiting the properties of noise distributions. With the tools of Moreau envelop and proximal point projection, we establish the convergence of the proposed algorithm when the cost function is nonconvex. We analyze the trade-off between privacy preservation and learning performance, and show that the influence of our proposed DP mechanisms is decoupled with that of robust stochastic model aggregation. Numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. ",

To address these concerns, prior work has used privacy-preserving speech features. However, using a subset of features can lead to information loss and, consequently, non-optimal model performance. Furthermore, prior work relies on a centralized approach to support continuous model updates, posing privacy risks. This paper proposes to use Federated Learning (FL) to enable decentralized, privacy-preserving speech analysis to assess depression. Using an existing dataset (DAIC-WOZ), we show that FL models enable a robust assessment of depression with only 4--6% accuracy loss compared to a centralized approach. These models also outperform prior work using the same dataset. Furthermore, the FL models have short inference latency and small memory footprints while being energy-efficient. These models, thus, can be deployed on mobile devices for real-time, continuous, and privacy-preserving depression assessment at scale. ",

    "abstract": "Early detection of lung nodules with computed tomography (CT) is critical for the longer survival of lung cancer patients and better quality of life. Computer-aided detection/diagnosis (CAD) is proven valuable as a second or concurrent reader in this context. However, accurate detection of lung nodules remains a challenge for such CAD systems and even radiologists due to not only the variability in size, location, and appearance of lung nodules but also the complexity of lung structures. This leads to a high false-positive rate with CAD, compromising its clinical efficacy. Motivated by recent computer vision techniques, here we present a self-supervised region-based 3D transformer model to identify lung nodules among a set of candidate regions. Specifically, a 3D vision transformer (ViT) is developed that divides a CT image volume into a sequence of non-overlap cubes, extracts embedding features from each cube with an embedding layer, and analyzes all embedding features with a self-attention mechanism for the prediction. To effectively train the transformer model on a relatively small dataset, the region-based contrastive learning method is used to boost the performance by pre-training the 3D transformer with public CT images. Our experiments show that the proposed method can significantly improve the performance of lung nodule screening in comparison with the commonly used 3D convolutional neural networks. ",

    "abstract": "The supervised training of deep neural networks (DNNs) by noisy labels has been studied extensively in image classification but much less in image segmentation. So far, our understanding of the learning behavior of DNNs trained by noisy segmentation labels remains limited. In this study, we address this deficiency in both binary segmentation of biological microscopy images and multi-class segmentation of natural images. We classify segmentation labels according to their noise transition matrices (NTM) and compare performance of DNNs trained by different types of labels. When we randomly sample a small fraction (e.g., 10%) or flipping a large fraction (e.g., 90%) of the ground-truth labels to train DNNs, their segmentation performance remains largely the same. This indicates that DNNs learn structures hidden in labels rather than pixel-level labels per se in their supervised training for semantic segmentation. We call these hidden structures \"meta-structures\". When we use labels with different perturbations to the meta-structures to train DNNs, their performance in feature extraction and segmentation degrades consistently. In contrast, addition of meta-structure information substantially improves performance of an unsupervised model in binary semantic segmentation. We formulate meta-structures mathematically as spatial density distributions and quantify semantic information of different types of labels, which we find to correlate strongly with ranks of their NTM. We show theoretically and experimentally how this formulation explains key observed learning behavior of DNNs. ",

Although there already exist works studying this setup and proposing coded caching scheme to reduce transmission loads, two main problems are remained to address: 1) the optimal communication load under the uncoded placement for the first hop, denoted by $R_1$, is still unknown. 2) the previous schemes are based on Maddah-Ali and Niesen's data placement and delivery, which requires high subpacketization level. How to achieve the well tradeoff between transmission loads and subpacketization level for the hierarchical caching system is unclear. In this paper, we aim to address these two problems. We first propose a new combination structure named hierarchical placement delivery array (HPDA), which characterizes the data placement and delivery for any hierarchical caching system. Then we construct two classes of HPDAs, where the first class leads to a scheme achieving the optimal $R_1$ for some cases, and the second class requires a smaller subpacketization level at the cost of slightly increasing transmission loads.

The novel idea here is to advocate a range-shrink strategy to perfectly avoid the influence of unobservable robots while filtering the input. To that end, we develop consecutive algorithms to determine a feasible constant robot subset from the changing robot set within the observation range, and estimate the formation input and the interaction range. Then, an ordinary least squares based local topology estimator is designed with the previously inferred information. Resorting to the concentration measure, we prove the convergence rate and accuracy of the proposed estimator, taking the estimation errors of previous steps into account. Extensions on nonidentical observation slots and more complicated scenarios are also analyzed. Comprehensive simulation tests and method comparisons corroborate the theoretical findings. ",

Self-supervised contrastive learning has been proposed to address the problem of requiring annotated data by mining intrinsic information hidden within the given data. However, the existing contrastive learning methods are inadequate for heterogeneous graphs because they construct contrastive views only based on data perturbation or pre-defined structural properties (e.g., meta-path) in graph data while ignore the noises that may exist in both node attributes and graph topologies. We develop for the first time a novel and robust heterogeneous graph contrastive learning approach, namely HGCL, which introduces two views on respective guidance of node attributes and graph topologies and integrates and enhances them by reciprocally contrastive mechanism to better model heterogeneous graphs. In this new approach, we adopt distinct but most suitable attribute and topology fusion mechanisms in the two views, which are conducive to mining relevant information in attributes and topologies separately. We further use both attribute similarity and topological correlation to construct high-quality contrastive samples.

Conventional 2D lane detection from a monocular image yields poor performance of following planning and control tasks in autonomous driving due to the case of uneven road. Predicting the 3D lane layout is thus necessary and enables effective and safe driving. However, existing 3D lane detection datasets are either unpublished or synthesized from a simulated environment, severely hampering the development of this field. In this paper, we take steps towards addressing these issues. By exploiting the explicit relationship between point clouds and image pixels, a dataset annotation pipeline is designed to automatically generate high-quality 3D lane locations from 2D lane annotations in 211K road scenes. In addition, we present an extrinsic-free, anchor-free method, called SALAD, regressing the 3D coordinates of lanes in image view without converting the feature map into the bird's-eye view (BEV). To facilitate future research on 3D lane detection, we benchmark the dataset and provide a novel evaluation metric, performing extensive experiments of both existing approaches and our proposed method. The aim of our work is to revive the interest of 3D lane detection in a real-world scenario. We believe our work can lead to the expected and unexpected innovations in both academia and industry. ",

    "abstract": "Transformer-based pre-trained models with millions of parameters require large storage. Recent approaches tackle this shortcoming by training adapters, but these approaches still require a relatively large number of parameters. In this study, AdapterBias, a surprisingly simple yet effective adapter architecture, is proposed. AdapterBias adds a token-dependent shift to the hidden output of transformer layers to adapt to downstream tasks with only a vector and a linear layer. Extensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of AdapterBias. The experiments show that our proposed method can dramatically reduce the trainable parameters compared to the previous works with a minimal decrease in task performances compared with fine-tuned pre-trained models. We further find that AdapterBias automatically learns to assign more significant representation shifts to the tokens related to the task in consideration. ",

    "abstract": "The United States have some of the highest rates of gun violence among developed countries. Yet, there is a disagreement about the extent to which firearms should be regulated. In this study, we employ social media signals to examine the predictors of offline political activism, at both population and individual level. We show that it is possible to classify the stance of users on the gun issue, especially accurately when network information is available. Alongside socioeconomic variables, network information such as the relative size of the two sides of the debate is also predictive of state-level gun policy. On individual level, we build a statistical model using network, content, and psycho-linguistic features that predicts real-life political action, and explore the most predictive linguistic features. Thus, we argue that, alongside demographics and socioeconomic indicators, social media provides useful signals in the holistic modeling of political engagement around the gun debate. ",

Fairness-aware recommendation mitigates a variety of algorithmic biases in the learning of user preferences. This paper aims at bringing a marriage between SR and algorithmic fairness. We propose a novel fairness-aware sequential recommendation task, in which a new metric, interaction fairness, is defined to estimate how recommended items are fairly interacted by users with different protected attribute groups. We propose a multi-task learning based deep end-to-end model, FairSR, which consists of two parts. One is to learn and distill personalized sequential features from the given user and her item sequence for SR. The other is fairness-aware preference graph embedding (FPGE). The aim of FPGE is two-fold: incorporating the knowledge of users' and items' attributes and their correlation into entity representations, and alleviating the unfair distributions of user attributes on items. Extensive experiments conducted on three datasets show FairSR can outperform state-of-the-art SR models in recommendation performance. In addition, the recommended items by FairSR also exhibit promising interaction fairness. ",

While these metrics are useful, it becomes difficult to identify using them where the model is failing, and how to resolve it. To enable more targeted diagnostic insights of such multilingual hate speech models, we introduce a set of functionalities for the purpose of evaluation.

To aid in the design of such a response scheme, our tool provides sufficient lengths for these periods of time in order to ensure safety with a particular probability. We provide a conservative upper bound on how long the system can remain under stealthy attack before the safety constraints are violated. Furthermore, we show how a detector limits the set of biases an attacker can exert on the system while still remaining stealthy, aiding a system operator in the design of the detector.

    "abstract": "Detection of rare objects (e.g., traffic cones, traffic barrels and traffic warning triangles) is an important perception task to improve the safety of autonomous driving. Training of such models typically requires a large number of annotated data which is expensive and time consuming to obtain. To address the above problem, an emerging approach is to apply data augmentation to automatically generate cost-free training samples. In this work, we propose a systematic study on simple Copy-Paste data augmentation for rare object detection in autonomous driving. Specifically, local adaptive instance-level image transformation is introduced to generate realistic rare object masks from source domain to the target domain. Moreover, traffic scene context is utilized to guide the placement of masks of rare objects. To this end, our data augmentation generates training data with high quality and realistic characteristics by leveraging both local and global consistency. In addition, we build a new dataset named NM10k consisting 10k training images, 4k validation images and the corresponding labels with a diverse range of scenarios in autonomous driving. Experiments on NM10k show that our method achieves promising results on rare object detection. We also present a thorough study to illustrate the effectiveness of our local-adaptive and global constraints based Copy-Paste data augmentation for rare object detection.

    "abstract": "Micro-expression recognition (MER) is valuable because the involuntary nature of micro-expressions (MEs) can reveal genuine emotions. Most works recognize MEs by taking RGB videos or images as input. In fact, the activated facial regions in ME images are very small and the subtle motion can be easily submerged in the unrelated information. Facial landmarks are a low-dimensional and compact modality, which leads to much lower computational cost and can potentially concentrate more on ME-related features. However, the discriminability of landmarks for MER is not clear. Thus, this paper explores the contribution of facial landmarks and constructs a new framework to efficiently recognize MEs with sole facial landmark information. Specially, we design a separate structure module to separately aggregate the spatial and temporal information in the geometric movement graph based on facial landmarks, and a Geometric Two-Stream Graph Network is constructed to aggregate the low-order geometric information and high-order semantic information of facial landmarks. Furthermore, two core components are proposed to enhance features. Specifically, a semantic adjacency matrix can automatically model the relationship between nodes even long-distance nodes in a self-learning fashion; and an Adaptive Action Unit loss is introduced to guide the learning process such that the learned features are forced to have a synchronized pattern with facial action units. Notably, this work tackles MER only utilizing geometric features, processed based on a graph model, which provides a new idea with much higher efficiency to promote MER. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve competitive or even superior performance with a significantly reduced computational cost, and facial landmarks can significantly contribute to MER and are worth further study for efficient ME analysis.

    "abstract": "Trust is a fundamental concept in large-scale distributed systems like the Internet of Things (IoT). Trust helps to resolve choices into a decision. However, the trust calculation depends on the amount of uncertainty present in data sources. Trust in an IoT network is proportional to the amount of uncertainty generated by such sources as hardware malfunctions, network stability, adversarial issues, and the nature of data exchanged between the entities. The relationship between trust and uncertainty warrants approaches designed to maximize the former quality whilst minimizing the latter. Unfortunately, there is no consensus on an approach to ensure the trustworthiness of IoT networks, in particular, addressing the uncertainty issues in a fine-grained way. This paper aims to explore a generalized framework designed to manage trust in IoT networks of varying scales. In the proposed framework, several sources of uncertainty are expressed as quantities, trust ratings are calculated for individual entities in an IoT network, and a network model capable of effectively distributing workloads to trustworthy nodes is proposed. We consider a practical use case of smart vehicular networks. By realizing this paper, a standardized approach to building trustworthy IoT networks can be established, which can further guide subsequent works in the field of trust management under uncertainty.

    "abstract": "Grant-free protocols exploiting compressed sensing (CS) multi-user detection (MUD) are appealing for solving the random access problem in massive machine-type communications (mMTC) with sporadic device activity. Such protocols would greatly benefit from a prior deterministic knowledge of the sparsity level, i.e., instantaneous number of simultaneously active devices $K$. Aiming at this, herein we introduce a framework relying on coordinated pilot transmissions (CPT) over a short phase at the beginning of the transmission block for detecting $K$ in mMTC scenarios under Rayleigh fading. CPT can be implemented either as: i) U-CPT, which exploits only uplink transmissions, or A-CPT, which includes also downlink transmissions for channel state information (CSI) acquisition that resolve fading uncertainty. We discuss two specific implementations of A-CPT: ii) A-CPT-F, which implements CSI-based phase corrections while leveraging the same statistical inverse power control used by U-CPT, and iii) A-CPT-D, which implements a dynamic CSI-based inverse power control, although it requires some active devices to remain in silence if their corresponding channels are too faded. We derive a signal sparsity level detector for each CPT mechanism by relaxing the original integer detection/classification problem to an estimation problem in the continuous real domain followed by a rounding operation. We show that the variance of the relaxed estimator increases with $K^2$ and $K$ when operating with U-CPT and A-CPT mechanisms, respectively. The distribution of the estimators under U-CPT, A-CPT-F and A-CPT-D is found to follow an exponential, Gaussian, and Student's $t-$like distribution, respectively. Analyses evince the superiority of A-CPT-D, which is also corroborated via numerical results. We reveal several interesting trade-offs and highlight potential research directions. ",

    "abstract": "Program classification can be regarded as a high-level abstraction of code, laying a foundation for various tasks related to source code comprehension, and has a very wide range of applications in the field of software engineering, such as code clone detection, code smell classification, defects classification, etc. The cross-language program classification can realize code transfer in different programming languages, and can also promote cross-language code reuse, thereby helping developers to write code quickly and reduce the development time of code transfer. Most of the existing studies focus on the semantic learning of the code, whilst few studies are devoted to cross-language tasks. The main challenge of cross-language program classification is how to extract semantic features of different programming languages. In order to cope with this difficulty, we propose a Unified Abstract Syntax Tree (namely UAST in this paper) neural network. In detail, the core idea of UAST consists of two unified mechanisms. First, UAST learns an AST representation by unifying the AST traversal sequence and graph-like AST structure for capturing semantic code features. Second, we construct a mechanism called unified vocabulary, which can reduce the feature gap between different programming languages, so it can achieve the role of cross-language program classification. Besides, we collect a dataset containing 20,000 files of five programming languages, which can be used as a benchmark dataset for the cross-language program classification task. We have done experiments on two datasets, and the results show that our proposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines in terms of four evaluation metrics (Precision, Recall, F1-score, and Accuracy).

    "abstract": "Spiking Neural Network (SNN) is a promising energy-efficient AI model when implemented on neuromorphic hardware. However, it is a challenge to efficiently train SNNs due to their non-differentiability. Most existing methods either suffer from high latency (i.e., long simulation time steps), or cannot achieve as high performance as Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). In this paper, we propose the Differentiation on Spike Representation (DSR) method, which could achieve high performance that is competitive to ANNs yet with low latency. First, we encode the spike trains into spike representation using (weighted) firing rate coding. Based on the spike representation, we systematically derive that the spiking dynamics with common neural models can be represented as some sub-differentiable mapping. With this viewpoint, our proposed DSR method trains SNNs through gradients of the mapping and avoids the common non-differentiability problem in SNN training. Then we analyze the error when representing the specific mapping with the forward computation of the SNN. To reduce such error, we propose to train the spike threshold in each layer, and to introduce a new hyperparameter for the neural models. With these components, the DSR method can achieve state-of-the-art SNN performance with low latency on both static and neuromorphic datasets, including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, ImageNet, and DVS-CIFAR10.

    "abstract": "Causal inference methods that control for text-based confounders are becoming increasingly important in the social sciences and other disciplines where text is readily available. However, these methods rely on a critical assumption that there is no treatment leakage: that is, the text only contains information about the confounder and no information about treatment assignment. When this assumption does not hold, methods that control for text to adjust for confounders face the problem of post-treatment (collider) bias. However, the assumption that there is no treatment leakage may be unrealistic in real-world situations involving text, as human language is rich and flexible. Language appearing in a public policy document or health records may refer to the future and the past simultaneously, and thereby reveal information about the treatment assignment. In this article, we define the treatment-leakage problem, and discuss the identification as well as the estimation challenges it raises. Second, we delineate the conditions under which leakage can be addressed by removing the treatment-related signal from the text in a pre-processing step we define as text distillation. Lastly, using simulation, we show how treatment leakage introduces a bias in estimates of the average treatment effect (ATE) and how text distillation can mitigate this bias. ",

    "abstract": "k-nearest-neighbor machine translation (NN-MT), proposed by Khandelwal et al. (2021), has achieved many state-of-the-art results in machine translation tasks. Although effective, NN-MT requires conducting NN searches through the large datastore for each decoding step during inference, prohibitively increasing the decoding cost and thus leading to the difficulty for the deployment in real-world applications. In this paper, we propose to move the time-consuming NN search forward to the preprocessing phase, and then introduce Nearest Neighbor Knowledge Distillation (NN-KD) that trains the base NMT model to directly learn the knowledge of NN. Distilling knowledge retrieved by NN can encourage the NMT model to take more reasonable target tokens into consideration, thus addressing the overcorrection problem. Extensive experimental results show that, the proposed method achieves consistent improvement over the state-of-the-art baselines including NN-MT, while maintaining the same training and decoding speed as the standard NMT model.

    "abstract": "Early fault detection (EFD) of rotating machines is important to decrease the maintenance cost and improve the mechanical system stability. One of the key points of EFD is developing a generic model to extract robust and discriminative features from different equipment for early fault detection. Most existing EFD methods focus on learning fault representation by one type of feature. However, a combination of multiple features can capture a more comprehensive representation of system state. In this paper, we propose an EFD method based on multiple feature fusion with stacking architecture (M2FSA). The proposed method can extract generic and discriminiative features to detect early faults by combining time domain (TD), frequency domain (FD), and time-frequency domain (TFD) features. In order to unify the dimensions of the different domain features, Stacked Denoising Autoencoder (SDAE) is utilized to learn deep features in three domains. The architecture of the proposed M2FSA consists of two layers. The first layer contains three base models, whose corresponding inputs are different deep features. The outputs of the first layer are concatenated to generate the input to the second layer, which consists of a meta model. The proposed method is tested on three bearing datasets. The results demonstrate that the proposed method is better than existing methods both in sensibility and reliability. ",

    "abstract": "Precise and timely traffic flow prediction plays a critical role in developing intelligent transportation systems and has attracted considerable attention in recent decades. Despite the significant progress in this area brought by deep learning, challenges remain. Traffic flows usually change dramatically in a short period, which prevents the current methods from accurately capturing the future trend and likely causes the over-fitting problem, leading to unsatisfied accuracy. To this end, this paper proposes a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) based method that can forecast the short-term traffic flow precisely and avoid local optimum problems during training. Specifically, instead of using the non-stationary raw traffic data directly, we first decompose them into sub-components, where each one is less noisy than the original input. Afterward, Sample Entropy (SE) is employed to merge similar components to reduce the computation cost. The merged features are fed into the LSTM, and we then introduce a spatiotemporal module to consider the neighboring relationships in the recombined signals to avoid strong autocorrelation. During training, we utilize the Grey Wolf Algorithm (GWO) to optimize the parameters of LSTM, which overcome the overfitting issue. We conduct the experiments on a UK public highway traffic flow dataset, and the results show that the proposed method performs favorably against other state-of-the-art methods with better adaption performance on extreme outliers, delay effects, and trend-changing responses.

An alternative route is to use simpler, more transparent white box models, in which task-specific feature construction replaces the more opaque feature discovery process performed automatically within deep learning models. Using data from the Groningen Gas Field in the Netherlands, we build on an existing logistic regression model by the addition of four further features discovered using elastic net driven data mining within the catch22 time series analysis package. We then evaluate the performance of the augmented logistic regression model relative to a deep (CNN) model, pre-trained on the Groningen data, on progressively increasing noise-to-signal ratios. We discover that, for each ratio, our logistic regression model correctly detects every earthquake, while the deep model fails to detect nearly 20 % of seismic events, thus justifying at least a degree of caution in the application of deep models, especially to data with higher noise-to-signal ratios.

Therefore, service classification and separation are essential to guarantee the required QoS level to each traffic sub-flow through the appropriate network trunk.

The federated gateways of 3D network help to enhance the global knowledge of network traffic to improve the accuracy of anomaly and intrusion detection and service identification of a new traffic flow.

In a canonical application, for example, planning for autonomous vehicles is used to automate the static or continuous planning towards performance, resource management, or functional goals (e.g., arriving at the destination, managing fuel fuel consumption). Existing planning algorithms assume non-adversarial settings; a least-cost plan is developed based on available environmental information (i.e., the input instance). Yet, it is unclear how such algorithms will perform in the face of adversaries attempting to thwart the planner. In this paper, we explore the security of planning algorithms used in cyber- and cyber-physical systems. We present two $\\textit{adversarial planning}$ algorithms-one static and one adaptive-that perturb input planning instances to maximize cost (often substantially so). We evaluate the performance of the algorithms against two dominant planning algorithms used in commercial applications (D* Lite and Fast Downward) and show both are vulnerable to extremely limited adversarial action. Here, experiments show that an adversary is able to increase plan costs in 66.9% of instances by only removing a single action from the actions space (D* Lite) and render 70% of instances from an international planning competition unsolvable by removing only three actions (Fast Forward). Finally, we show that finding an optimal perturbation in any search-based planning system is NP-hard. ",

This allows for an efficient evaluation of inputs that prevents unneeded feature acquisition. To approximate an intractable combinatorial problem, current approaches to budgeted classification rely on well-behaved loss functions that account for two primary objectives (processing cost and error). These approaches offer improved efficiency over traditional classifiers but are limited by analytic constraints in formulation and do not manage additional performance objectives. Notably, such methods do not explicitly account for an important aspect of real-time detection systems -- the fraction of \"accepted\" predictions satisfying a confidence criterion imposed by a risk-averse monitor. We propose a problem-specific genetic algorithm to build budgeted, sequential classifiers with confidence-based reject options. Three objectives -- accuracy, processing time/cost, and coverage -- are considered. The algorithm emphasizes Pareto efficiency while accounting for a notion of aggregate performance via a unique scalarization. Experiments show our method can quickly find globally Pareto optimal solutions in very large search spaces and is competitive with existing approaches while offering advantages for selective, budgeted deployment scenarios.

In particular, the present work is motivated by the goal of reducing energy dissipation in turbulent flows, and the example considered is the spatiotemporally chaotic dynamics of the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation (KSE). A major challenge associated with RL is that substantial training data must be generated by repeatedly interacting with the target system, making it costly when the system is computationally or experimentally expensive. We mitigate this challenge in a data-driven manner by combining dimensionality reduction via an autoencoder with a neural ODE framework to obtain a low-dimensional dynamical model from just a limited data set. We substitute this data-driven reduced-order model (ROM) in place of the true system during RL training to efficiently estimate the optimal policy, which can then be deployed on the true system. For the KSE actuated with localized forcing (\"jets\") at four locations, we demonstrate that we are able to learn a ROM that accurately captures the actuated dynamics as well as the underlying natural dynamics just from snapshots of the KSE experiencing random actuations. Using this ROM and a control objective of minimizing dissipation and power cost, we extract a control policy from it using deep RL. We show that the ROM-based control strategy translates well to the true KSE and highlight that the RL agent discovers and stabilizes an underlying forced equilibrium solution of the KSE system. We show that this forced equilibrium captured in the ROM and discovered through RL is related to an existing known equilibrium solution of the natural KSE. ",

Using raw and post-processed data as an input, our approach produces viable symbolic expressions that closely model the target behavior. Our approach is composed of two phases. In the first, a graph neural network (GNN) is trained to extract an approximation of the target behavior. In the second phase, the GNN is used to produce data for a nested evolutionary algorithm called macro-micro evolution (MME). The macro layer of this algorithm selects candidate symbolic expressions, while the micro layer tunes its parameters. Experimental evaluation shows that our approach outperforms competing solutions for symbolic regression, making it possible to extract compact expressions for complex swarm behaviors. ",

This post-processing step is crucial for producing clean transcripts and high performance on downstream tasks (e.g. machine translation).

We propose a streaming BERT-based sequence tagging model that, combined with a novel training objective, is capable of detecting disfluencies in real-time while balancing accuracy and latency. This is accomplished by training the model to decide whether to immediately output a prediction for the current input or to wait for further context. Essentially, the model learns to dynamically size its lookahead window. Our results demonstrate that our model produces comparably accurate predictions and does so sooner than our baselines, with lower flicker. Furthermore, the model attains state-of-the-art latency and stability scores when compared with recent work on incremental disfluency detection. ",

One of the important tools in understanding network topology is community detection. Although there are numerous works on community detection in single layer networks, existing work on multiplex community detection mostly focuses on learning a common community structure across layers without taking the heterogeneity of the different layers into account. In this paper, we introduce a new multiplex community detection approach that can identify communities that are common across layers as well as those that are unique to each layer. The proposed algorithm employs Orthogonal Nonnegative Matrix Tri-Factorization to model each layer's adjacency matrix as the sum of two low-rank matrix factorizations, corresponding to the common and private communities, respectively.

While widely used WMFC approaches have shown good performance using classical machine learning techniques, recent advances in deep learning reveal a promising direction towards fast and effective WMFC. In this work, we propose a novel deep learning framework for WMFC, Deep Fiber Clustering (DFC), which solves the unsupervised clustering problem as a self-supervised learning task with a domain-specific pretext task to predict pairwise fiber distances. This accelerates the fiber representation learning to handle a known challenge in WMFC, i.e., the sensitivity of clustering results to the point ordering along fibers. We design a novel network architecture that represents input fibers as point clouds and allows the incorporation of additional sources of input information from gray matter parcellation. Thus DFC makes use of the combined white matter fiber geometry and gray matter anatomical parcellation to improve anatomical coherence of fiber clusters. In addition, DFC conducts outlier removal in a natural way by rejecting fibers with low cluster assignment probabilities. We evaluate DFC on three independently acquired cohorts (including data from 220 subjects) and compare it to several state-of-the-art WMFC algorithms. Experimental results demonstrate superior performance of DFC in terms of cluster compactness, generalization ability, anatomical coherence, and computational efficiency. In addition, DFC parcellates whole brain tractography with 50k fibers in about 1.5 minutes, providing a fast and efficient tool for large data analysis. ",

The main challenge when designing equivariant models for point clouds is how to trade-off the performance of the model and the complexity.

The main aim of this study is to build a general procedure to introduce group equivariant property to SOTA models for 3D point clouds. The group equivariant models built form our procedure are simple to implement, less complexity in comparison with the existing ones, and they preserve the strengths of the original SOTA backbone. From the results of the experiments on object classification, it is shown that our methods are superior to other group equivariant models in performance and complexity. Moreover, our method also helps to improve the mIoU of semantic segmentation models. Overall, by using a combination of only-finite-rotation equivariance and augmentation, our models can outperform existing full $SO(3)$-equivariance models with much cheaper complexity and GPU memory. The proposed procedure is general and forms a fundamental approach to group equivariant neural networks. We believe that it can be easily adapted to other SOTA models in the future. ",

    "abstract": "Fine-tuning pretrained language models (PLMs) on downstream tasks has become common practice in natural language processing. However, most of the PLMs are vulnerable, e.g., they are brittle under adversarial attacks or imbalanced data, which hinders the application of the PLMs on some downstream tasks, especially in safe-critical scenarios. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective fine-tuning method called Match-Tuning to force the PLMs to be more robust. For each instance in a batch, we involve other instances in the same batch to interact with it. To be specific, regarding the instances with other labels as a perturbation, Match-Tuning makes the model more robust to noise at the beginning of training. While nearing the end, Match-Tuning focuses more on performing an interpolation among the instances with the same label for better generalization. Extensive experiments on various tasks in GLUE benchmark show that Match-Tuning consistently outperforms the vanilla fine-tuning by $1.64$ scores. Moreover, Match-Tuning exhibits remarkable robustness to adversarial attacks and data imbalance. ",

    "abstract": "Deep Neural Network (DNN) are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. As a countermeasure, adversarial training aims to achieve robustness based on the min-max optimization problem and it has shown to be one of the most effective defense strategies. However, in this work, we found that compared with natural training, adversarial training fails to learn better feature representations for either clean or adversarial samples, which can be one reason why adversarial training tends to have severe overfitting issues and less satisfied generalize performance. Specifically, we observe two major shortcomings of the features learned by existing adversarial training methods:(1) low intra-class feature similarity; and (2) conservative inter-classes feature variance. To overcome these shortcomings, we introduce a new concept of adversarial training graph (ATG) with which the proposed adversarial training with feature separability (ATFS) enables to coherently boost the intra-class feature similarity and increase inter-class feature variance. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed ATFS framework significantly improves both clean and robust performance. ",

    "abstract": "Noisy labels are inevitable yet problematic in machine learning society. It ruins the generalization power of a classifier by making the classifier be trained to be overfitted to wrong labels. Existing methods on noisy label have focused on modifying classifier training procedure. It results in two possible problems. First, these methods are not applicable to a pre-trained classifier without further access into training. Second, it is not easy to train a classifier and remove all of negative effects from noisy labels simultaneously. From these problems, we suggests a new branch of approach, Noisy Prediction Calibration (NPC) in learning with noisy labels. Through the introduction and estimation of a new type of transition matrix via generative model, NPC corrects the noisy prediction from the pre-trained classifier to the true label as a post-processing scheme. We prove that NPC theoretically aligns with the transition matrix based methods. Yet, NPC provides more accurate pathway to estimate true label, even without involvement in classifier learning. Also, NPC is applicable to any classifier trained with noisy label methods, if training instances and its predictions are available. Our method, NPC, boosts the classification performances of all baseline models on both synthetic and real-world datasets. ",

Machine translation, however, is intrinsically uncertain: the same source sentence can have multiple semantically equivalent translations. Therefore, we propose to replace the softmax activation with a multi-label classification layer that can model ambiguity more effectively. We call our loss function Single-label Contrastive Objective for Non-Exclusive Sequences (SCONES). We show that the multi-label output layer can still be trained on single reference training data using the SCONES loss function. SCONES yields consistent BLEU score gains across six translation directions, particularly for medium-resource language pairs and small beam sizes. By using smaller beam sizes we can speed up inference by a factor of 3.9x and still match or improve the BLEU score obtained using softmax. Furthermore, we demonstrate that SCONES can be used to train NMT models that assign the highest probability to adequate translations, thus mitigating the \"beam search curse\". Additional experiments on synthetic language pairs with varying levels of uncertainty suggest that the improvements from SCONES can be attributed to better handling of ambiguity. ",

However, annotating lidar data is resource-consuming, and depending only on supervised learning limits the applicability of trained models. Against this backdrop, here we propose using a self-supervised training strategy to learn a general point cloud backbone model for downstream 3D vision tasks. 3D scene flow can be estimated with self-supervised learning using cycle consistency, which removes labelled data requirements. Moreover, the perception of objects in the traffic scenarios heavily relies on making sense of the sparse data in the spatio-temporal context. Our main contribution leverages learned flow and motion representations and combines a self-supervised backbone with a 3D detection head focusing mainly on the relation between the scene flow and detection tasks. In this way, self-supervised scene flow training constructs point motion features in the backbone, which help distinguish objects based on their different motion patterns used with a 3D detection head. Experiments on KITTI and nuScenes benchmarks show that the proposed self-supervised pre-training increases 3D detection performance significantly. ",

    "abstract": "Machine reading comprehension has aroused wide concerns, since it explores the potential of model for text understanding. To further equip the machine with the reasoning capability, the challenging task of logical reasoning is proposed. Previous works on logical reasoning have proposed some strategies to extract the logical units from different aspects. However, there still remains a challenge to model the long distance dependency among the logical units. Also, it is demanding to uncover the logical structures of the text and further fuse the discrete logic to the continuous text embedding. To tackle the above issues, we propose an end-to-end model Logiformer which utilizes a two-branch graph transformer network for logical reasoning of text. Firstly, we introduce different extraction strategies to split the text into two sets of logical units, and construct the logical graph and the syntax graph respectively. The logical graph models the causal relations for the logical branch while the syntax graph captures the co-occurrence relations for the syntax branch. Secondly, to model the long distance dependency, the node sequence from each graph is fed into the fully connected graph transformer structures. The two adjacent matrices are viewed as the attention biases for the graph transformer layers, which map the discrete logical structures to the continuous text embedding space. Thirdly, a dynamic gate mechanism and a question-aware self-attention module are introduced before the answer prediction to update the features. The reasoning process provides the interpretability by employing the logical units, which are consistent with human cognition. The experimental results show the superiority of our model, which outperforms the state-of-the-art single model on two logical reasoning benchmarks. ",

For accurately modeling such applications, multilayer networks have been proposed. Community search allows for personalized community discovery and has a wide range of applications in large real-world networks. While community search has been widely explored for single-layer graphs, the problem for multilayer graphs has just recently attracted attention. Existing community models in multilayer graphs have several limitations, including disconnectivity, free-rider effect, resolution limits, and inefficiency. To address these limitations, we study the problem of community search over large multilayer graphs. We first introduce FirmTruss, a novel dense structure in multilayer networks, which extends the notion of truss to multilayer graphs. We show that FirmTrusses possess nice structural and computational properties and bring many advantages compared to the existing models. Building on this, we present a new community model based on FirmTruss, called FTCS, and show that finding an FTCS community is NP-hard. We propose two efficient 2-approximation algorithms, and show that no polynomial-time algorithm can have a better approximation guarantee unless P = NP. We propose an index-based method to further improve the efficiency of the algorithms. We then consider attributed multilayer networks and propose a new community model based on network homophily. We show that community search in attributed multilayer graphs is NP-hard and present an effective and efficient approximation algorithm. Experimental studies on real-world graphs with ground-truth communities validate the quality of the solutions we obtain and the efficiency of the proposed algorithms. ",

In this work, we build conversations as graphs to overcome implicit contextual modelling of the original entailment style. Following the previous work, we further introduce the emotion information into graphs. Emotion information can markedly promote the detection of causal utterances whose emotion is the same as the targeted utterance. However, it is still hard to detect causal utterances with different emotions, especially neutral ones. The reason is that models are limited in reasoning causal clues and passing them between utterances. To alleviate this problem, we introduce social commonsense knowledge (CSK) and propose a Knowledge Enhanced Conversation graph (KEC). KEC propagates the CSK between two utterances. As not all CSK is emotionally suitable for utterances, we therefore propose a sentiment-realized knowledge selecting strategy to filter CSK. To process KEC, we further construct the Knowledge Enhanced Directed Acyclic Graph networks. Experimental results show that our method outperforms baselines and infers more causes with different emotions from the targeted utterance. ",

We implemented a deep learning data-driven framework that learns from a few hand-designed robotic bodily expressions and can generate numerous new ones of similar believability and lifelikeness. The framework uses the Conditional Variational Autoencoder model and a sampling approach based on the geometric properties of the model's latent space to condition the generative process on targeted levels of valence and arousal. The evaluation study found that the anthropomorphism and animacy of the generated expressions are not perceived differently from the hand-designed ones, and the emotional conditioning was adequately differentiable between most levels except the pairs of neutral-positive valence and low-medium arousal. Furthermore, an exploratory analysis of the results reveals a possible impact of the conditioning on the perceived dominance of the robot, as well as on the participants' attention. ",

This enables the connected vehicles (CVs) to stay informed about their surroundings while moving. However, the inter-vehicle communication channels significantly broaden the attack surface. The inter-vehicle network enables an attacker to remotely launch attacks. An attacker can create collision as well as hamper performance by reducing the traffic efficiency. Thus, security vulnerabilities must be taken into consideration in the early phase of the development cycle of CVs. To the best of our knowledge, there exists no such automated simulation tool using which engineers can verify the performance of CV prototypes in the presence of an attacker.

    "abstract": "Multi-hop reasoning over real-life knowledge graphs (KGs) is a highly challenging problem as traditional subgraph matching methods are not capable to deal with noise and missing information. To address this problem, it has been recently introduced a promising approach based on jointly embedding logical queries and KGs into a low-dimensional space to identify answer entities. However, existing proposals ignore critical semantic knowledge inherently available in KGs, such as type information. To leverage type information, we propose a novel TypE-aware Message Passing (TEMP) model, which enhances the entity and relation representations in queries, and simultaneously improves generalization, deductive and inductive reasoning. Remarkably, TEMP is a plug-and-play model that can be easily incorporated into existing embedding-based models to improve their performance. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate TEMP's effectiveness. ",

    "abstract": "Ultra-reliability and low-latency are pivotal requirements of the new generation of communication networks. Over the past years, to increase throughput, adaptive active antennas were introduced in advanced wireless communications, specifically in the domain of millimeter-wave (mmWave). Consequently, new lower-layer techniques were proposed to cope with the higher dimensional and electronic steerable beams. The transition from omni-directional to highly directional antennas presents a new type of wireless systems that deliver high bandwidth, but that are susceptible to high losses and high latency variation. Classical approaches cannot close the rising gap between high throughput and low delay in those advanced systems. In this work, we incorporate effective sliding window network coding solutions in mmWave communications. While legacy systems such as rateless codes improve delay, our results show that they do not provide low latency communications (LLC - below 10 ms), but fixed sliding window random linear network coding (RLNC), does. Moreover, adaptive sliding window RLNC obtains ultra-reliable LLC (URLLC - LLC with maximum delay below 10 ms with more than 99% probability). ",

    "abstract": "Recent years have seen more critical applications designed to protect human lives (e.g., environmental sensing, emergency response, and tactical defense) being deployed over wireless networks. These critical deployments expect higher data rates, ultra-low latency, and ultra-high reliability. 6G wireless networks are expected to fill the gap in terms of the first two aspects (i.e., higher data rates and ultra-low latency), however providing ultra-high reliability is a wide open challenge. All is well when everything works but when there is a failure or a security attack, the entire system collapses exposing the associated human lives to imminent danger. Avoiding this requires the strongest of assurances that safety and security aspects are protected no matter what. Large scale critical applications are waiting for this piece of the puzzle to be solved. At this juncture, we envision the bold theme of La R\\'esistance 6G (LR6G) that would pave the way for deploying mission-critical applications and services over 6G networks. It aims to achieve ultra-high reliability and resiliency to any disruptions, be it failures or security attacks. A few disruptions are easy to handle such as a cloud VM or primary link failure. In both of these cases, applications can be restored by activating the standby resource. However, some disruptions can be detrimental such as when a cut-vertex fails or when the disruption leaves the critical application to fail without access to a standby resource. These critical applications (e.g. Smart Manufacturing, Smart City, Ocean monitoring, Wildfire monitoring, etc.) are highly distributed in nature. They must continue to deliver their mission objectives during a disruption to protect human lives. In this paper, we present our LR6G vision and outline the challenges towards achieving this vision.

Since we target GPU, we name the NAS optimized models as GPUNet, which establishes a new SOTA Pareto frontier in inference latency and accuracy. Within 1$ms$, GPUNet is 2x faster than EfficientNet-X and FBNetV3 with even better accuracy. We also validate GPUNet on detection tasks, and GPUNet consistently outperforms EfficientNet-X and FBNetV3 on COCO detection tasks in both latency and accuracy. All of these data validate that our NAS system is effective and generic to handle different design tasks.

    "abstract": "We consider a weighted counting problem on matchings, denoted $\\textrm{PrMatching}(\\mathcal{G})$, on an arbitrary fixed graph family $\\mathcal{G}$. The input consists of a graph $G\\in \\mathcal{G}$ and of rational probabilities of existence on every edge of $G$, assuming independence. The output is the probability of obtaining a matching of $G$ in the resulting distribution, i.e., a set of edges that are pairwise disjoint. It is known that, if $\\mathcal{G}$ has bounded treewidth, then $\\textrm{PrMatching}(\\mathcal{G})$ can be solved in polynomial time. In this paper we show that, under some assumptions, bounded treewidth in fact characterizes the tractable graph families for this problem. More precisely, we show intractability for all graph families $\\mathcal{G}$ satisfying the following treewidth-constructibility requirement: given an integer $k$ in unary, we can construct in polynomial time a graph $G \\in \\mathcal{G}$ with treewidth at least $k$. Our hardness result is then the following: for any treewidth-constructible graph family $\\mathcal{G}$, the problem $\\textrm{PrMatching}(\\mathcal{G})$ is intractable. This generalizes known hardness results for weighted matching counting under some restrictions that do not bound treewidth, e.g., being planar, 3-regular, or bipartite; it also answers a question left open in Amarilli, Bourhis and Senellart (PODS'16). We also obtain a similar lower bound for the weighted counting of edge covers. ",

After the filters are stacked, the embedded distribution is destroyed, and graph smoothing occurs. To address these challenges, we propose a new framework that leverages network motifs to learn deep features of the network from low-level embeddings under the assumption of network homogeneity and transitivity, and then combines local neighborhood information with deeper Global information fusion results in accurate representation of nodes.

To this end, we propose positive-unlabeled learning with adversarial data augmentation (PUDA) for KGC. In particular, PUDA tailors positive-unlabeled risk estimator for the KGC task to deal with the false negative issue. Furthermore, to address the data sparsity issue, PUDA achieves a data augmentation strategy by unifying adversarial training and positive-unlabeled learning under the positive-unlabeled minimax game.

We argue that a better contrastive scheme should be tailored to the characteristics of graph neural networks (e.g., neighborhood aggregation) and propose a simple yet effective method named FastGCL. Specifically, by constructing weighted-aggregated and non-aggregated neighborhood information as positive and negative samples respectively, FastGCL identifies the potential semantic information of data without disturbing the graph topology and node attributes, resulting in faster training and convergence speeds.

Considering the small intra-class variance of products in the same production line, from the perspective of differences and commonalities, MemSeg introduces artificially simulated abnormal samples and memory samples to assist the learning of the network. In the training phase, MemSeg explicitly learns the potential differences between normal and simulated abnormal images to obtain a robust classification hyperplane. At the same time, inspired by the mechanism of human memory, MemSeg uses a memory pool to store the general patterns of normal samples. By comparing the similarities and differences between input samples and memory samples in the memory pool to give effective guesses about abnormal regions; In the inference phase, MemSeg directly determines the abnormal regions of the input image in an end-to-end manner. Through experimental validation, MemSeg achieves the state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on MVTec AD datasets with AUC scores of 99.56% and 98.84% at the image-level and pixel-level, respectively. In addition, MemSeg also has a significant advantage in inference speed benefiting from the end-to-end and straightforward network structure, which better meets the real-time requirement in industrial scenarios.

Tar spot has proven to be an impactful disease in terms of reducing crop yield. To quantify disease progression, experts usually have to visually phenotype leaves from the plant. This process is very time-consuming and is difficult to incorporate in any high-throughput phenotyping system. Deep neural networks could provide quick, automated tar spot detection with sufficient ground truth. However, manually labeling tar spots in images to serve as ground truth is also tedious and time-consuming. In this paper we first describe an approach that uses automated image analysis tools to generate ground truth images that are then used for training a Mask R-CNN. We show that a Mask R-CNN can be used effectively to detect tar spots in close-up images of leaf surfaces. We additionally show that the Mask R-CNN can also be used for in-field images of whole leaves to capture the number of tar spots and area of the leaf infected by the disease. ",

Yet, existing works overlook the importance of detection itself and often result in missed detections when confronted by occlusions or motion blurs. The missed detections affect not only detection performance but also tracking performance due to inconsistent tracklets. Hence, we propose a new JDT model that recovers the missed detections while associating the detection candidates of consecutive frames by learning object-level spatio-temporal consistency through edge features in a Graph Neural Network (GNN). Our proposed model Sparse Graph Tracker (SGT) converts video data into a graph, where the nodes are top-$K$ scored detection candidates, and the edges are relations between the nodes at different times, such as position difference and visual similarity. Two nodes are connected if they are close in either a Euclidean or feature space, generating a sparsely connected graph. Without motion prediction or Re-Identification (ReID), the association is performed by predicting an edge score representing the probability that two connected nodes refer to the same object. Under the online setting, our SGT achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) on the MOT17/20 Detection and MOT16/20 benchmarks in terms of AP and MOTA, respectively. Especially, SGT surpasses the previous SOTA on the crowded dataset MOT20 where partial occlusion cases are dominant, showing the effectiveness of detection recovery against partial occlusion.

Recently, based on a \"solve-then-discretize\" paradigm, an operator analogue of the FEAST method has been proposed for DEPs without discretization of the coefficient operators. Compared to conventional \"discretize-then-solve\" approaches that discretize the operators and solve the resulting matrix problem, the operator analogue of FEAST exhibits much higher accuracy; however, it involves solving a large number of ordinary differential equations (ODEs). In this paper, to reduce the computational costs, we propose operation analogues of Sakurai-Sugiura-type complex moment-based eigensolvers for DEPs using higher-order complex moments and analyze the error bound of the proposed methods. We show that the number of ODEs to be solved can be reduced by a factor of the degree of complex moments without degrading accuracy, which is verified by numerical results. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed methods are over five times faster compared with the operator analogue of FEAST for several DEPs while maintaining almost the same high accuracy.

In those recommender systems, knowledge graph information often contains fruitful facts and inherent semantic relatedness among items. However, the success of such methods relies on the high quality knowledge graphs, and may not learn quality representations with two challenges: i) The long-tail distribution of entities results in sparse supervision signals for KG-enhanced item representation; ii) Real-world knowledge graphs are often noisy and contain topic-irrelevant connections between items and entities. Such KG sparsity and noise make the item-entity dependent relations deviate from reflecting their true characteristics, which significantly amplifies the noise effect and hinders the accurate representation of user's preference. To fill this research gap, we design a general Knowledge Graph Contrastive Learning framework (KGCL) that alleviates the information noise for knowledge graph-enhanced recommender systems. Specifically, we propose a knowledge graph augmentation schema to suppress KG noise in information aggregation, and derive more robust knowledge-aware representations for items. In addition, we exploit additional supervision signals from the KG augmentation process to guide a cross-view contrastive learning paradigm, giving a greater role to unbiased user-item interactions in gradient descent and further suppressing the noise. Extensive experiments on three public datasets demonstrate the consistent superiority of our KGCL over state-of-the-art techniques. KGCL also achieves strong performance in recommendation scenarios with sparse user-item interactions, long-tail and noisy KG entities.

Then, the problem asks whether there exists a sequence of independent sets that transforms $I_s$ into $I_t$ where at each step we are allowed to slide one token from a vertex to a neighboring vertex. In this paper, we focus on the parameterized complexity of Token Sliding parameterized by $k$. As shown by Bartier et al., the problem is W[1]-hard on graphs of girth four or less, and the authors posed the question of whether there exists a constant $p \\geq 5$ such that the problem becomes fixed-parameter tractable on graphs of girth at least $p$. We answer their question positively and prove that the problem is indeed fixed-parameter tractable on graphs of girth five or more, which establishes a full classification of the tractability of Token Sliding parameterized by the number of tokens based on the girth of the input graph.

    "abstract": "Learning solutions of partial differential equations (PDEs) with Physics-Informed Neural Networks(PINNs) is an attractive alternative approach to traditional solvers due to its flexibility and ease of incorporating observed data. Despite the success of PINNs in accurately solving a wide variety of PDEs, the method still requires improvements in terms of computational efficiency. One possible improvement idea is to optimize the generation of training point sets. Residual-based adaptive sampling and quasi-uniform sampling approaches have been each applied to improve the training effects of PINNs, respectively. To benefit from both methods, we propose the Residual-based Adaptive Node Generation (RANG) approach for efficient training of PINNs, which is based on a variable density nodal distribution method for RBF-FD. The method is also enhanced by a memory mechanism to further improve training stability. We conduct experiments on three linear PDEs and three nonlinear PDEs with various node generation methods, through which the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method compared to the predominant uniform sampling approach is verified numerically.

    "abstract": "Delirium occurs in about 80% cases in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and is associated with a longer hospital stay, increased mortality and other related issues. Delirium does not have any biomarker-based diagnosis and is commonly treated with antipsychotic drugs (APD). However, multiple studies have shown controversy over the efficacy or safety of APD in treating delirium. Since randomized controlled trials (RCT) are costly and time-expensive, we aim to approach the research question of the efficacy of APD in the treatment of delirium using retrospective cohort analysis. We plan to use the Causal inference framework to look for the underlying causal structure model, leveraging the availability of large observational data on ICU patients. To explore safety outcomes associated with APD, we aim to build a causal model for delirium in the ICU using large observational data sets connecting various covariates correlated with delirium. We utilized the MIMIC III database, an extensive electronic health records (EHR) dataset with 53,423 distinct hospital admissions. Our null hypothesis is: there is no significant difference in outcomes for delirium patients under different drug-group in the ICU. Through our exploratory, machine learning based and causal analysis, we had findings such as: mean length-of-stay and max length-of-stay is higher for patients in Haloperidol drug group, and haloperidol group has a higher rate of death in a year compared to other two-groups. Our generated causal model explicitly shows the functional relationships between different covariates. For future work, we plan to do time-varying analysis on the dataset. ",

There have been numerous attempts to facilitate the training process of PINNs by adjusting the weight of each component of the loss function, called adaptive loss balancing algorithms. In this paper, we propose an Augmented Lagrangian relaxation method for PINNs (AL-PINNs). We treat the initial and boundary conditions as constraints for the optimization problem of the PDE residual. By employing Augmented Lagrangian relaxation, the constrained optimization problem becomes a sequential max-min problem so that the learnable parameters $\\lambda$'s adaptively balance each loss component. Our theoretical analysis reveals that the sequence of minimizers of the proposed loss functions converges to an actual solution for the Helmholtz, viscous Burgers, and Klein--Gordon equations. We demonstrate through various numerical experiments that AL-PINNs yields a much smaller relative error compared with that of state-of-the-art adaptive loss balancing algorithms. ",

    "abstract": "Despite the increasing popularity of massive open online courses (MOOCs), many suffer from high dropout and low success rates. Early prediction of student success for targeted intervention is therefore essential to ensure no student is left behind in a course. There exists a large body of research in success prediction for MOOCs, focusing mainly on training models from scratch for individual courses. This setting is impractical in early success prediction as the performance of a student is only known at the end of the course. In this paper, we aim to create early success prediction models that can be transferred between MOOCs from different domains and topics. To do so, we present three novel strategies for transfer: 1) pre-training a model on a large set of diverse courses, 2) leveraging the pre-trained model by including meta information about courses, and 3) fine-tuning the model on previous course iterations. Our experiments on 26 MOOCs with over 145,000 combined enrollments and millions of interactions show that models combining interaction data and course information have comparable or better performance than models which have access to previous iterations of the course. With these models, we aim to effectively enable educators to warm-start their predictions for new and ongoing courses. ",

This can be problematic given the increasing use of neural networks in high stakes decision-making such as in climate change applications. We address both issues by successfully implementing a Bayesian Neural Network (BNN), where parameters are distributions rather than deterministic, and applying novel implementations of explainable AI (XAI) techniques. The uncertainty analysis from the BNN provides a comprehensive overview of the prediction more suited to practitioners' needs than predictions from a classical neural network. Using a BNN means we can calculate the entropy (i.e. uncertainty) of the predictions and determine if the probability of an outcome is statistically significant. To enhance trustworthiness, we also spatially apply the two XAI techniques of Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) and SHapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP) values. These XAI methods reveal the extent to which the BNN is suitable and/or trustworthy. Using two techniques gives a more holistic view of BNN skill and its uncertainty, as LRP considers neural network parameters, whereas SHAP considers changes to outputs. We verify these techniques using comparison with intuition from physical theory. The differences in explanation identify potential areas where new physical theory guided studies are needed. ",

First, the exponential convergence result leads to the guaranteed convergence rate, which is much desired in practice. Second, since exponential stability is equivalent to uniform asymptotic stability, the strengthened result implies that the error system is totally stable and hence being able to withstand small disturbances. These two advantages are achieved by establishing the exponential stability of two classes of linear time-varying systems, which may have other applications. ",

To address this challenge we propose several novel NN architectures, which we show guarantee local stability while retaining the semi-global approximation capacity to learn the optimal feedback policy. The proposed architectures are compared against standard NN feedback controllers through numerical simulations of two high-dimensional nonlinear optimal control problems (OCPs): stabilization of an unstable Burgers-type partial differential equation (PDE), and altitude and course tracking for a six degree-of-freedom (6DoF) unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). The simulations demonstrate that standard NNs can fail to stabilize the dynamics even when trained well, while the proposed architectures are always at least locally stable.

We provide a detailed analysis of a computer-free, all-optical imaging method for seeing through random, unknown phase diffusers using diffractive neural networks, covering different deep learning-based training strategies. By analyzing various diffractive networks designed to image through random diffusers with different correlation lengths, a trade-off between the image reconstruction fidelity and distortion reduction capability of the diffractive network was observed. During its training, random diffusers with a range of correlation lengths were used to improve the diffractive network's generalization performance. Increasing the number of random diffusers used in each epoch reduced the overfitting of the diffractive network's imaging performance to known diffusers. We also demonstrated that the use of additional diffractive layers improved the generalization capability to see through new, random diffusers. Finally, we introduced deliberate misalignments in training to 'vaccinate' the network against random layer-to-layer shifts that might arise due to the imperfect assembly of the diffractive networks. These analyses provide a comprehensive guide in designing diffractive networks to see through random diffusers, which might profoundly impact many fields, such as biomedical imaging, atmospheric physics, and autonomous driving.

During the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 epidemic there has been much debate about policy, including how and when to impose restrictions on behavior. Under such circumstances policymakers must balance a complex spectrum of objectives, suggesting a need for quantitative tools. Whether health services might be 'overwhelmed' has emerged as a key consideration yet formal modelling of optimal policy has so far largely ignored this. Here we show how costly interventions, such as taxes or subsidies on behaviour, can be used to exactly align individuals' decision making with government preferences even when these are not aligned. We assume that choices made by individuals give rise to Nash equilibrium behavior. We focus on a situation in which the capacity of the healthcare system to treat patients is limited and identify conditions under which the disease dynamics respect the capacity limit. In particular we find an extremely sharp drop in peak infections as the maximum infection cost in the government's objective function is increased. This is in marked contrast to the gradual reduction without government intervention. The infection costs at which this switch occurs depend on how costly the intervention is to the government. We find optimal interventions that are quite different to the case when interventions are cost-free. Finally, we identify a novel analytic solution for the Nash equilibrium behavior for constant infection cost. ",

    "abstract": "We propose a system that transcribes the conversation of a typical meeting scenario that is captured by a set of initially unsynchronized microphone arrays at unknown positions. It consists of subsystems for signal synchronization, including both sampling rate and sampling time offset estimation, diarization based on speaker and microphone array position estimation, multi-channel speech enhancement, and automatic speech recognition. With the estimated diarization information, a spatial mixture model is initialized that is used to estimate beamformer coefficients for source separation. Simulations show that the speech recognition accuracy can be improved by synchronizing and combining multiple distributed microphone arrays compared to a single compact microphone array. Furthermore, the proposed informed initialization of the spatial mixture model delivers a clear performance advantage over random initialization. ",

    "abstract": "Blockchain finance has become a part of the world financial system, most typically manifested in the attention to the price of Bitcoin. However, a great deal of work is still limited to using technical indicators to capture Bitcoin price fluctuation, with little consideration of historical relationships and interactions between related cryptocurrencies. In this work, we propose a generic Cross-Cryptocurrency Relationship Mining module, named C2RM, which can effectively capture the synchronous and asynchronous impact factors between Bitcoin and related Altcoins. Specifically, we utilize the Dynamic Time Warping algorithm to extract the lead-lag relationship, yielding Lead-lag Variance Kernel, which will be used for aggregating the information of Altcoins to form relational impact factors. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that our C2RM can help existing price prediction methods achieve significant performance improvement, suggesting the effectiveness of Cross-Cryptocurrency interactions on benefitting Bitcoin price prediction.

    "abstract": "Previous electroencephalogram (EEG) emotion recognition relies on single-task learning, which may lead to overfitting and learned emotion features lacking generalization. In this paper, a graph-based multi-task self-supervised learning model (GMSS) for EEG emotion recognition is proposed. GMSS has the ability to learn more general representations by integrating multiple self-supervised tasks, including spatial and frequency jigsaw puzzle tasks, and contrastive learning tasks. By learning from multiple tasks simultaneously, GMSS can find a representation that captures all of the tasks thereby decreasing the chance of overfitting on the original task, i.e., emotion recognition task. In particular, the spatial jigsaw puzzle task aims to capture the intrinsic spatial relationships of different brain regions. Considering the importance of frequency information in EEG emotional signals, the goal of the frequency jigsaw puzzle task is to explore the crucial frequency bands for EEG emotion recognition. To further regularize the learned features and encourage the network to learn inherent representations, contrastive learning task is adopted in this work by mapping the transformed data into a common feature space. The performance of the proposed GMSS is compared with several popular unsupervised and supervised methods. Experiments on SEED, SEED-IV, and MPED datasets show that the proposed model has remarkable advantages in learning more discriminative and general features for EEG emotional signals. ",

    "abstract": "In the classic literature of change-detection, changes in the statistical properties of a stochastic process are assumed to occur via change-points, which demark instantaneous moments of complete and total process transition. In contrast many real world processes undergo such changes gradually. With this observation in mind, we introduce a novel change-dynamic model for the online detection of gradual change, in which classical change-points are identified in a hierarchal model. On both real and synthetic data we find that this model can allow for faster and more accurate identification of gradual change than traditional change-point models allow, and investigate empirically how delay in detection of this gradual change relates to alarm confidence.
