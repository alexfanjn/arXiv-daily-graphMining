    "title": "Strategic Latency Reduction in Blockchain Peer-to-Peer Networks",
    "abstract": "Most permissionless blockchain networks run on peer-to-peer (P2P) networks, which offer flexibility and decentralization at the expense of performance (e.g., network latency). Historically, this tradeoff has not been a bottleneck for most blockchains. However, an emerging host of blockchain-based applications (e.g., decentralized finance) are increasingly sensitive to latency; users who can reduce their network latency relative to other users can accrue (sometimes significant) financial gains. In this work, we initiate the study of strategic latency reduction in blockchain P2P networks. We first define two classes of latency that are of interest in blockchain applications. We then show empirically that a strategic agent who controls only their local peering decisions can manipulate both types of latency, achieving 60\\% of the global latency gains provided by the centralized, paid service bloXroute, or, in targeted scenarios, comparable gains. Finally, we show that our results are not due to the poor design of existing P2P networks. Under a simple network model, we theoretically prove that an adversary can always manipulate the P2P network's latency to their advantage, provided the network experiences sufficient peer churn and transaction activity.

    "abstract": "There is enormous growth in various fields of research. This development is accompanied by new problems. To solve these problems efficiently and in an optimized manner, algorithms are created and described by researchers in the scientific literature. Scientific algorithms are vital for understanding and reusing existing work in numerous domains. However, algorithms are generally challenging to find. Also, the comparison among similar algorithms is difficult because of the disconnected documentation. Information about algorithms is mostly present in websites, code comments, and so on. There is an absence of structured metadata to portray algorithms. As a result, sometimes redundant or similar algorithms are published, and the researchers build them from scratch instead of reusing or expanding upon the already existing algorithm. In this paper, we introduce an approach for automatically developing a knowledge graph (KG) for algorithmic problems from unstructured data. Because it captures information more clearly and extensively, an algorithm KG will give additional context and explainability to the algorithm metadata. ",

However, it is difficult to train these models on complex dynamical systems from data alone due to their low data efficiency and sensitivity to hyperparameters and initialisation. This work demonstrates that injection of partially known information at an intermediate layer in a DNN can improve model accuracy, reduce model uncertainty, and yield improved convergence during the training. The value of these physics-guided neural networks has been demonstrated by learning the dynamics of a wide variety of nonlinear dynamical systems represented by five well-known equations in nonlinear systems theory: the Lotka-Volterra, Duffing, Van der Pol, Lorenz, and Henon-Heiles systems.

    "abstract": "A Backdoor attack (BA) is an important type of adversarial attack against deep neural network classifiers, wherein test samples from one or more source classes will be (mis)classified to the attacker's target class when a backdoor pattern (BP) is embedded. In this paper, we focus on the post-training backdoor defense scenario commonly considered in the literature, where the defender aims to detect whether a trained classifier was backdoor attacked, without any access to the training set. To the best of our knowledge, existing post-training backdoor defenses are all designed for BAs with presumed BP types, where each BP type has a specific embedding function. They may fail when the actual BP type used by the attacker (unknown to the defender) is different from the BP type assumed by the defender. In contrast, we propose a universal post-training defense that detects BAs with arbitrary types of BPs, without making any assumptions about the BP type. Our detector leverages the influence of the BA, independently of the BP type, on the landscape of the classifier's outputs prior to the softmax layer. For each class, a maximum margin statistic is estimated using a set of random vectors; detection inference is then performed by applying an unsupervised anomaly detector to these statistics. Thus, our detector is also an advance relative to most existing post-training methods by not needing any legitimate clean samples, and can efficiently detect BAs with arbitrary numbers of source classes. These advantages of our detector over several state-of-the-art methods are demonstrated on four datasets, for three different types of BPs, and for a variety of attack configurations. Finally, we propose a novel, general approach for BA mitigation once a detection is made. ",

    "abstract": "\\emph{Session types} have proved viable in expressing and verifying the protocols of message-passing systems. While message passing is a dominant concurrency paradigm in practice, real world software is written without session types. A limitation of existing session type libraries in mainstream languages is their restriction to linear session types, precluding application scenarios that demand sharing and thus aliasing of channel references. This paper introduces Ferrite, a shallow embedding of session types in Rust that supports both \\emph{linear} and \\emph{shared} sessions. The formal foundation of Ferrite constitutes the shared session type calculus $\\sills$, which Ferrite encodes via a novel \\emph{judgmental embedding} technique. The fulcrum of the embedding is the notion of a typing judgment that allows reasoning about shared and linear resources to type a session. Typing rules are then encoded as functions over judgments, with a valid typing derivation manifesting as a well-typed Rust program. This Rust program generated by Ferrite serves as a \\emph{certificate}, ensuring that the application will proceed according to the protocol defined by the session type. The paper details the features and implementation of Ferrite and includes a case study on implementing Servo's canvas component in Ferrite. ",

    "abstract": "Self-supervised learning (SSL) is currently one of the premier techniques to create data representations that are actionable for transfer learning in the absence of human annotations. Despite their success, the underlying geometry of these representations remains elusive, which obfuscates the quest for more robust, trustworthy, and interpretable models. In particular, mainstream SSL techniques rely on a specific deep neural network architecture with two cascaded neural networks: the encoder and the projector. When used for transfer learning, the projector is discarded since empirical results show that its representation generalizes more poorly than the encoder's. In this paper, we investigate this curious phenomenon and analyze how the strength of the data augmentation policies affects the data embedding. We discover a non-trivial relation between the encoder, the projector, and the data augmentation strength: with increasingly larger augmentation policies, the projector, rather than the encoder, is more strongly driven to become invariant to the augmentations. It does so by eliminating crucial information about the data by learning to project it into a low-dimensional space, a noisy estimate of the data manifold tangent plane in the encoder representation. This analysis is substantiated through a geometrical perspective with theoretical and empirical results. ",

Automatic fact-checking systems fall short here, and their predictions like \"half-true\" are not very useful in isolation, since we have no idea which parts of the claim are true and which are not. In this work, we focus on decomposing a complex claim into a comprehensive set of yes-no subquestions whose answers influence the veracity of the claim. We present ClaimDecomp, a dataset of decompositions for over 1000 claims. Given a claim and its verification paragraph written by fact-checkers, our trained annotators write subquestions covering both explicit propositions of the original claim and its implicit facets, such as asking about additional political context that changes our view of the claim's veracity. We study whether state-of-the-art models can generate such subquestions, showing that these models generate reasonable questions to ask, but predicting the comprehensive set of subquestions from the original claim without evidence remains challenging. We further show that these subquestions can help identify relevant evidence to fact-check the full claim and derive the veracity through their answers, suggesting that they can be useful pieces of a fact-checking pipeline.

    "abstract": "Balancing the trade-off between safety and efficiency is of significant importance for path planning under uncertainty. Many risk-aware path planners have been developed to explicitly limit the probability of collision to an acceptable bound in uncertain environments. However, convex obstacles or Gaussian uncertainties are usually assumed to make the problem tractable in the existing method. These assumptions limit the generalization and application of path planners in real-world implementations. In this article, we propose to apply deep learning methods to the sampling-based planner, developing a novel risk bounded near-optimal path planning algorithm named neural risk-aware RRT (NR-RRT). Specifically, a deterministic risk contours map is maintained by perceiving the probabilistic nonconvex obstacles, and a neural network sampler is proposed to predict the next most-promising safe state. Furthermore, the recursive divide-and-conquer planning and bidirectional search strategies are used to accelerate the convergence to a near-optimal solution with guaranteed bounded risk. Worst-case theoretical guarantees can also be proven owing to a standby safety guaranteed planner utilizing a uniform sampling distribution. Simulation experiments demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art remarkably for finding risk bounded low-cost paths in seen and unseen environments with uncertainty and nonconvex constraints.

Considering users' privacy, model sharing-based federated learning (FL) that migrates model parameters but not private data from edge devices to a central cloud is particularly attractive for edge-intelligent networks. Due to multiple rounds of iterative updating of high-dimensional model parameters between base station (BS) and edge devices, the communication reliability is a critical issue of FL for edge-intelligent networks. We reveal the impacts of the errors generated during model broadcast and model aggregation via wireless channels caused by channel fading, interference and noise on the accuracy of FL, especially when there exists channel uncertainty. To alleviate the impacts, we propose a robust FL algorithm for edge-intelligent networks with channel uncertainty, which is formulated as a worst-case optimization problem with joint device selection and transceiver design. Finally, simulation results validate the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. ",

This system allows the user to interact with the device by making simple static and dynamic hand gestures. Each gesture triggers a different action in the system, such as object recognition, scene description or image scaling (e.g., pointing a finger at an object will show a description of it). The system is based on a multi-head neural network architecture, which initially detects and classifies the gestures, and subsequently, depending on the gesture detected, performs a second stage that carries out the corresponding action. This multi-head architecture optimizes the resources required to perform different tasks simultaneously, and takes advantage of the information obtained from an initial backbone to perform different processes in a second stage. To train and evaluate the system, a dataset with about 40k images was manually compiled and labeled including different types of hand gestures, backgrounds (indoors and outdoors), lighting conditions, etc. This dataset contains synthetic gestures (whose objective is to pre-train the system in order to improve the results) and real images captured using different mobile phones. The results obtained and the comparison made with the state of the art show competitive results as regards the different actions performed by the system, such as the accuracy of classification and localization of gestures, or the generation of descriptions for objects and scenes.

    "abstract": "The usage of deep learning is being escalated in many applications. Due to its outstanding performance, it is being used in a variety of security and privacy-sensitive areas in addition to conventional applications. One of the key aspects of deep learning efficacy is to have abundant data. This trait leads to the usage of data which can be highly sensitive and private, which in turn causes wariness with regard to deep learning in the general public. Membership inference attacks are considered lethal as they can be used to figure out whether a piece of data belongs to the training dataset or not. This can be problematic with regards to leakage of training data information and its characteristics. To highlight the significance of these types of attacks, we propose an enhanced methodology for membership inference attacks based on adversarial robustness, by adjusting the directions of adversarial perturbations through label smoothing under a white-box setting. We evaluate our proposed method on three datasets: Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100. Our experimental results reveal that the performance of our method surpasses that of the existing adversarial robustness-based method when attacking normally trained models. Additionally, through comparing our technique with the state-of-the-art metric-based membership inference methods, our proposed method also shows better performance when attacking adversarially trained models.

Recent semi-supervised approaches have demonstrated promising results by employing consistency regularization, pseudo-labeling techniques, and adversarial learning. These methods primarily attempt to learn the distribution of labeled and unlabeled data by enforcing consistency in the predictions or embedding context. However, previous approaches have focused only on local discrepancy minimization or context relations across single classes. In this paper, we introduce a novel adversarial learning-based semi-supervised segmentation method that effectively embeds both local and global features from multiple hidden layers and learns context relations between multiple classes. Our voxel-wise adversarial learning method utilizes a voxel-wise feature discriminator, which considers multilayer voxel-wise features (involving both local and global features) as an input by embedding class-specific voxel-wise feature distribution. Furthermore, we improve our previous representation learning method by overcoming information loss and learning stability problems, which enables rich representations of labeled data. Our method outperforms current best-performing state-of-the-art semi-supervised learning approaches on the image segmentation of the left atrium (single class) and multiorgan datasets (multiclass). Moreover, our visual interpretation of the feature space demonstrates that our proposed method enables a well-distributed and separated feature space from both labeled and unlabeled data, which improves the overall prediction results.

Existing defense approaches mostly focus on detecting whether a neural network is 'backdoored' based on heuristics, e.g., activation patterns. To the best of our knowledge, the only line of work which certifies the absence of backdoor is based on randomized smoothing, which is known to significantly reduce neural network performance.

Currently, the message passing neural network based mean field variational Bayesian methodology is the ubiquitous solution for such a task, in which the variational inference objective is often assumed to be the classical evidence lower bound. However, the variational approximation inferred from such loose objective generally underestimates the underlying posterior, which often leads to inferior generation performance. In this paper, we propose a novel importance weighted structure learning method aiming to approximate the underlying log-partition function with a tighter importance weighted lower bound, which is computed from multiple samples drawn from a reparameterizable Gumbel-Softmax sampler. A generic entropic mirror descent algorithm is applied to solve the resulting constrained variational inference task. The proposed method achieves the state-of-the-art performance on various popular scene graph generation benchmarks. ",

We make the first attempt to propose a Generalization Assessment Index for SR networks, namely SRGA. SRGA exploits the statistical characteristics of internal features of deep networks, not output images to measure the generalization ability. Specially, it is a non-parametric and non-learning metric. To better validate our method, we collect a patch-based image evaluation set (PIES) that includes both synthetic and real-world images, covering a wide range of degradations. With SRGA and PIES dataset, we benchmark existing SR models on the generalization ability. This work could lay the foundation for future research on model generalization in low-level vision. ",

As a result, numerous self-supervision methods are proposed to learn more robust image representations.

Therefore, we propose an Object-Aware Self-Supervision (OASS) method to obtain more fine-grained representations for multi-label learning, dynamically generating auxiliary tasks based on object locations. Secondly, the robust representation learned by OASS can be leveraged to efficiently generate Class-Specific Instances (CSI) in a proposal-free fashion to better guide multi-label supervision signal transfer to instances.

    "abstract": "The spread of fake news has caused great harm to society in recent years. So the quick detection of fake news has become an important task. Some current detection methods often model news articles and other related components as a static heterogeneous information network (HIN) and use expensive message-passing algorithms. However, in the real-world, quickly identifying fake news is of great significance and the network may vary over time in terms of dynamic nodes and edges. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel Dynamic Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network (DHGNN) for fake news quick detection. More specifically, we first implement BERT and fine-tuned BERT to get a semantic representation of the news article contents and author profiles and convert it into graph data. Then, we construct the heterogeneous news-author graph to reflect contextual information and relationships. Additionally, we adapt ideas from personalized PageRank propagation and dynamic propagation to heterogeneous networks in order to reduce the time complexity of back-propagating through many nodes during training. Experiments on three real-world fake news datasets show that DHGNN can outperform other GNN-based models in terms of both effectiveness and efficiency. ",

Using our approach, we isolate morpho-syntactic features from counfounders in sentences, e.g. topic, which will then allow us to causally probe pre-trained models. We apply this methodology to analyze causal effects of gender and number on contextualized representations extracted from pre-trained models -- BERT, RoBERTa and GPT-2. Our experiments suggest that naturalistic intervention can give us stable estimates of causal effects, which varies across different words in a sentence. We further show the utility of our estimator in investigating gender bias in adjectives, and answering counterfactual questions in masked prediction. Our probing experiments highlights the importance of conducting causal probing in determining if a particular property is encoded in representations. ",

The developed neural architecture is capable not only to solve the decoding problem in unknown channels, but also to return an estimate of the average MI achieved with the coding scheme, as well as the decoding error probability.

    "abstract": "Corrosion is a form of damage that often appears on the surface of metal-made objects used in industrial applications. Those damages can be critical depending on the purpose of the used object. Optical-based testing systems provide a form of non-contact data acquisition, where the acquired data can then be used to analyse the surface of an object. In the field of industrial image processing, this is called surface inspection. We provide a testing setup consisting of a rotary table which rotates the object by 360 degrees, as well as industrial RGB cameras and laser triangulation sensors for the acquisition of 2D and 3D data as our multi-sensor system. These sensors acquire data while the object to be tested takes a full rotation. Further on, data augmentation is applied to prepare new data or enhance already acquired data. In order to evaluate the impact of a laser triangulation sensor for corrosion detection, one challenge is to at first fuse the data of both domains. After the data fusion process, 5 different channels can be utilized to create a 5D feature space. Besides the red, green and blue channels of the image (1-3), additional range data from the laser triangulation sensor is incorporated (4). As a fifth channel, said sensor provides additional intensity data (5). With a multi-channel image classification, a 5D feature space will lead to slightly superior results opposed to a 3D feature space, composed of only the RGB channels of the image. ",

Providing multiple access to an increasing number of uncoordinated users and sharing the limited resources become essential in this context. In this work, we revisit the random access (RA) problem and exploit the continuous angular group sparsity feature of wireless channels to propose a novel RA strategy that provides low latency, high reliability, and massive access with limited bandwidth resources in an all-in-one package. To this end, we first design a reconstruction-free goal-oriented optimization problem, which only preserves the angular information required to identify the active devices. To solve this, we propose an alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) and derive closed-form expressions for each ADMM step. Then, we design a clustering algorithm that assigns the users in specific groups from which we can identify active stationary devices by their angles. For mobile devices, we propose an alternating minimization algorithm to recover their data and their channel gains simultaneously, which allows us to identify active mobile users. Simulation results show significant performance gains in terms of active user detection and false alarm probabilities as compared to state-of-the-art RA schemes, even with limited number of preambles. Moreover, unlike prior work, the performance of the proposed blind goal-oriented massive access does not depend on the number of devices. ",

We propose a robust curb detection and filtering technique based on the fusion of camera semantics and dense lidar point clouds. The lidar point clouds are collected by fusing multiple lidars for robust feature detection. The camera semantics are based on a modified EfficientNet architecture which is trained with labeled data collected from onboard fisheye cameras. The point clouds are associated with the closest curb segment with $L_2$-norm analysis after projecting into the image space with the fisheye model projection. Next, the selected points are clustered using unsupervised density-based spatial clustering to detect different curb regions. As new curb points are detected in consecutive frames they are associated with the existing curb clusters using temporal reachability constraints. If no reachability constraints are found a new curb cluster is formed from these new points. This ensures we can detect multiple curbs present in road segments consisting of multiple lanes if they are in the sensors' field of view. Finally, Delaunay filtering is applied for outlier removal and its performance is compared to traditional RANSAC-based filtering. An objective evaluation of the proposed solution is done using a high-definition map containing ground truth curb points obtained from a commercial map supplier. The proposed system has proven capable of detecting curbs of any orientation in complex urban road scenarios comprising straight roads, curved roads, and intersections with traffic isles. ",

Gait cycle detection based on these signals has applications in various areas, including authentication, health monitoring, and activity detection. Template-based studies focus on how the entire gait cycle represents walking patterns, but these are compute-intensive. Aggregate feature-based studies extract features in the time domain and frequency domain from the entire gait cycle to reduce the number of features. However, these methods may miss critical structural information needed to appropriately represent the intricacies of walking patterns. To the best of our knowledge, no study has formally proposed a structure to capture variations within gait cycles or phases from accelerometer readings. We propose a new structure named the PQRST Complex, which corresponds to the swing phase in a gait cycle and matches the foot movements during this phase, thus capturing the changes in foot position. In our experiments, based on the nine features derived from this structure, the accelerometer-based gait authentication system outperforms many state-of-the-art gait cycle-based authentication systems. Our work opens up a new paradigm of capturing the structure of gait and opens multiple areas of research and practice using gait analogous to the \"QRS complex\" structure of ECG signals related to the heart.

Further, baseline models and models that have higher number of trainable layers performed similarly in certain architectures. Model need to be fine tuned at different levels and a specific training ratio is required for a model to be termed ideal. Different architectures had different responses to the change in the number of trainable layers w.r.t accuracies.

Search-and-rescue after a disaster and intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) are two examples where the UAV nodes need to send their collected data cooperatively into a central decision maker unit. Recently proposed SDN-based solutions show incredible performance in managing different aspects of such networks. Alas, the routing problem for the highly dynamic UAV networks has not been addressed adequately. An optimal, reliable, and adaptive routing algorithm compatible with the SDN design and highly dynamic nature of such networks is required to improve the network performance. This paper proposes a load-balanced optimized predictive and adaptive routing (LB-OPAR), an SDN-based routing solution for cooperative UAV networks. LB-OPAR is the extension of our recently published routing algorithm (OPAR) that balances the network load and optimizes the network performance in terms of throughput, success rate, and flow completion time (FCT). We analytically model the routing problem in highly dynamic UAV network and propose a lightweight algorithmic solution to find the optimal solution with $O(|E|^2)$ time complexity where $|E|$ is the total number of network links. We exhaustively evaluate the proposed algorithm's performance using ns-3 network simulator. Results show that LB-OPAR outperforms the benchmark algorithms by $20\\%$ in FCT, by $30\\%$ in flow success rate on average, and up to $400\\%$ in throughput. ",

Owing to the different sizes of scientific datasets and the privacy issue concerning some of these datasets, it is essential to find a data placement strategy that can minimize data transmission time. Some state-of-the-art data placement strategies combine edge computing and cloud computing to distribute scientific datasets. However, the dynamic distribution of newly generated datasets to appropriate datacenters and exiting the spent datasets are still a challenge during workflows execution. To address this challenge, this study not only constructs a data placement model that includes shared datasets within individual and among multiple workflows across various geographical regions, but also proposes a data placement strategy (DYM-RL-DPS) based on algorithms of two stages. First, during the build-time stage of workflows, we use the discrete particle swarm optimization algorithm with differential evolution to pre-allocate initial datasets to proper datacenters. Then, we reformulate the dynamic datasets distribution problem as a Markov decision process and provide a reinforcement learning-based approach to learn the optimal strategy in the runtime stage of scientific workflows. Through simulating heterogeneous edge-cloud computing environments, we designed comprehensive experiments to demonstrate the superiority of DYM-RL-DPS.

Because of long video durations and limited GPU memory, most action detectors can only operate on pre-extracted features rather than the original videos, and they still require a lot of computation to achieve high detection performance. To alleviate the heavy computation problem in TAD, in this work, we first propose an efficient action detector with detector proposal sampling, based on the observation that performance saturates at a small number of proposals. This detector is designed with several important techniques, such as LSTM-boosted temporal aggregation and cascaded proposal refinement to achieve high detection quality as well as low computational cost. To enable joint optimization of this action detector and the feature encoder, we also propose encoder gradient sampling, which selectively back-propagates through video snippets and tremendously reduces GPU memory consumption. With the two sampling strategies and the effective detector, we build a unified framework for efficient end-to-end temporal action detection (ETAD), making real-world untrimmed video understanding tractable. ETAD achieves state-of-the-art performance on both THUMOS-14 and ActivityNet-1.3. Interestingly, on ActivityNet-1.3, it reaches 37.78% average mAP, while only requiring 6 mins of training time and 1.23 GB memory based on pre-extracted features. With end-to-end training, it reduces the GPU memory footprint by more than 70% with even higher performance (38.21% average mAP), as compared with traditional end-to-end methods.

    "title": "Exploring Generalizability of Fine-Tuned Models for Fake News Detection",
    "abstract": "The Covid-19 pandemic has caused a dramatic and parallel rise in dangerous misinformation, denoted an `infodemic' by the CDC and WHO. Misinformation tied to the Covid-19 infodemic changes continuously; this can lead to performance degradation of fine-tuned models due to concept drift. Degredation can be mitigated if models generalize well-enough to capture some cyclical aspects of drifted data. In this paper, we explore generalizability of pre-trained and fine-tuned fake news detectors across 9 fake news datasets. We show that existing models often overfit on their training dataset and have poor performance on unseen data. However, on some subsets of unseen data that overlap with training data, models have higher accuracy. Based on this observation, we also present KMeans-Proxy, a fast and effective method based on K-Means clustering for quickly identifying these overlapping subsets of unseen data. KMeans-Proxy improves generalizability on unseen fake news datasets by 0.1-0.2 f1-points across datasets. We present both our generalizability experiments as well as KMeans-Proxy to further research in tackling the fake news problem. ",

Recently, since the multi-head attention mechanism applied in the Transformer model can effectively capture longer contextual information, Transformer-based models have become the mainstream methods and have achieved significant performance in this task. Unfortunately, although these models can capture effective global context information, they are still limited in the local feature and position information extraction, which is critical in NER. In this paper, to address this limitation, we propose a novel Hero-Gang Neural structure (HGN), including the Hero and Gang module, to leverage both global and local information to promote NER. Specifically, the Hero module is composed of a Transformer-based encoder to maintain the advantage of the self-attention mechanism, and the Gang module utilizes a multi-window recurrent module to extract local features and position information under the guidance of the Hero module. Afterward, the proposed multi-window attention effectively combines global information and multiple local features for predicting entity labels.

    "abstract": "Growing interests in RGB-D salient object detection (RGB-D SOD) have been witnessed in recent years, owing partly to the popularity of depth sensors and the rapid progress of deep learning techniques. Unfortunately, existing RGB-D SOD methods typically demand large quantity of training images being thoroughly annotated at pixel-level. The laborious and time-consuming manual annotation has become a real bottleneck in various practical scenarios. On the other hand, current unsupervised RGB-D SOD methods still heavily rely on handcrafted feature representations. This inspires us to propose in this paper a deep unsupervised RGB-D saliency detection approach, which requires no manual pixel-level annotation during training. It is realized by two key ingredients in our training pipeline. First, a depth-disentangled saliency update (DSU) framework is designed to automatically produce pseudo-labels with iterative follow-up refinements, which provides more trustworthy supervision signals for training the saliency network. Second, an attentive training strategy is introduced to tackle the issue of noisy pseudo-labels, by properly re-weighting to highlight the more reliable pseudo-labels. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior efficiency and effectiveness of our approach in tackling the challenging unsupervised RGB-D SOD scenarios. Moreover, our approach can also be adapted to work in fully-supervised situation. Empirical studies show the incorporation of our approach gives rise to notably performance improvement in existing supervised RGB-D SOD models. ",

Essentially, the target of deepfake detection problem is to represent natural faces and fake faces at the representation space discriminatively, and it reminds us whether we could optimize the feature extraction procedure at the representation space through constraining intra-class consistence and inter-class inconsistence to bring the intra-class representations close and push the inter-class representations apart? Therefore, inspired by contrastive representation learning, we tackle the deepfake detection problem through learning the invariant representations of both classes and propose a novel real-centric consistency learning method. We constraint the representation from both the sample level and the feature level. At the sample level, we take the procedure of deepfake synthesis into consideration and propose a novel forgery semantical-based pairing strategy to mine latent generation-related features. At the feature level, based on the centers of natural faces at the representation space, we design a hard positive mining and synthesizing method to simulate the potential marginal features. Besides, a hard negative fusion method is designed to improve the discrimination of negative marginal features with the help of supervised contrastive margin loss we developed. The effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method has been demonstrated through extensive experiments. ",

    "abstract": "Recent period of pandemic has brought person identification even with occluded face image a great importance with increased number of mask usage. This paper aims to recognize the occlusion of one of four types in face images. Various transfer learning methods were tested, and the results show that MobileNet V2 with Gated Recurrent Unit(GRU) performs better than any other Transfer Learning methods, with a perfect accuracy of 99% in classification of images as with or without occlusion and if with occlusion, then the type of occlusion. In parallel, identifying the Region of interest from the device captured image is done. This extracted Region of interest is utilised in face identification. Such a face identification process is done using the ResNet model with its Caffe implementation. To reduce the execution time, after the face occlusion type was recognized the person was searched to confirm their face image in the registered database. The face label of the person obtained from both simultaneous processes was verified for their matching score. If the matching score was above 90, the recognized label of the person was logged into a file with their name, type of mask, date, and time of recognition. MobileNetV2 is a lightweight framework which can also be used in embedded or IoT devices to perform real time detection and identification in suspicious areas of investigations using CCTV footages. When MobileNetV2 was combined with GRU, a reliable accuracy was obtained. The data provided in the paper belong to two categories, being either collected from Google Images for occlusion classification, face recognition, and facial landmarks, or collected in fieldwork. The motive behind this research is to identify and log person details which could serve surveillance activities in society-based e-governance. ",

    "abstract": "Deep reinforcement learning methods for multi-agent systems make optimal decisions dependent on states observed by agents, but a little uncertainty on the observations can possibly mislead agents into taking wrong actions. The mean-field actor-critic reinforcement learning (MFAC) is very famous in the multi-agent field since it can effectively handle the scalability problem. However, this paper finds that it is also sensitive to state perturbations which can significantly degrade the team rewards. This paper proposes a robust learning framework for MFAC called RoMFAC that has two innovations: 1) a new objective function of training actors, composed of a \\emph{policy gradient function} that is related to the expected cumulative discount reward on sampled clean states and an \\emph{action loss function} that represents the difference between actions taken on clean and adversarial states; and 2) a repetitive regularization of the action loss that ensures the trained actors obtain a good performance. Furthermore, we prove that the proposed action loss function is convergent. Experiments show that RoMFAC is robust against adversarial perturbations while maintaining its good performance in environments without perturbations. ",

    "abstract": "In this paper, the physical layer security of a dual-hop unmanned aerial vehicle-based wireless network, subject to imperfect channel state information (CSI) and mobility effects, is analyzed. Specifically, a source node $(S)$ communicates with a destination node $(D)$ through a decode-and-forward relay $(R)$, in the presence of two wiretappers $\\left(E_{1},E_{2}\\right)$ independently trying to compromise the two hops. Furthermore, the transmit nodes $\\left(S,R\\right) $ have a single transmit antenna, while the receivers $\\left(R,D,E_{1},E_{2}\\right) $ are equipped with multiple receive antennas. Based on the per-hop signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) and correlated secrecy capacities' statistics, a closed-form expression for the secrecy intercept probability (IP) metric is derived, in terms of key system parameters. Additionally, asymptotic expressions are revealed for two scenarios, namely (i) mobile nodes with imperfect CSI and (ii) static nodes with perfect CSI. The results show that a zero secrecy diversity order is manifested for the first scenario, due to the presence of a ceiling value of the average SNR, while the IP drops linearly at high average SNR in the second one, where the achievable diversity order depends on the fading parameters and number of antennas of the legitimate links/nodes. Furthermore, for static nodes, the system can be castigated by a $15$ dB secrecy loss at IP$=3\\times10^{-3},$ when the CSI imperfection power raises from $0$ to $10^{-3}$. Lastly, the higher the legitimate nodes' speed, carrier frequency, delay, and/or relay's decoding threshold SNR, the worse is the system's secrecy. Monte Carlo simulations endorse the derived analytical results. ",

To explore this issue, we consider two approaches: 1) variance control to make the residual network behave like identity mapping and 2) stable optimization through the improvement of effective learning rate. Through two analyses, we specify the desirable and undesirable gamma to apply L2 regularization and propose four guidelines for managing them. In several experiments, we observed the increase and decrease in performance caused by applying L2 regularization to gamma of four categories, which is consistent with our four guidelines.

    "abstract": "Most graph neural networks (GNNs) rely on the message passing paradigm to propagate node features and build interactions. Recent works point out that different graph learning tasks require different ranges of interactions between nodes. To investigate its underlying mechanism, we explore the capacity of GNNs to capture pairwise interactions between nodes under contexts with different complexities, especially for their graph-level and node-level applications in scientific domains like biochemistry and physics. When formulating pairwise interactions, we study two common graph construction methods in scientific domains, i.e., \\emph{K-nearest neighbor} (KNN) graphs and \\emph{fully-connected} (FC) graphs. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the inductive bias introduced by KNN-graphs and FC-graphs hinders GNNs to learn the most informative order of interactions. {Such a phenomenon is broadly shared by several GNNs for different graph learning tasks and forbids GNNs to achieve the global minimum loss, so we name it a \\emph{representation bottleneck}.} To overcome that, we propose a novel graph rewiring approach based on the pairwise interaction strengths to dynamically adjust the reception fields of each node. Extensive experiments in molecular property prediction and dynamic system forecast prove the superiority of our method over state-of-the-art GNN baselines. More importantly, this paper provides a reasonable explanation of why subgraphs play an important role in the determination of graph properties. ",

In this paper, we propose a novel training technique for the CWI task based on domain adaptation to improve the target character and context representations. This technique addresses the problem of working with multiple domains, inasmuch as it creates a way of smoothing the differences between the explored datasets. Moreover, we also propose a similar auxiliary task, namely text simplification, that can be used to complement lexical complexity prediction. Our model obtains a boost of up to 2.42% in terms of Pearson Correlation Coefficients in contrast to vanilla training techniques, when considering the CompLex from the Lexical Complexity Prediction 2021 dataset. At the same time, we obtain an increase of 3% in Pearson scores, while considering a cross-lingual setup relying on the Complex Word Identification 2018 dataset.

However, labels from weak supervision can be rather noisy and the high capacity of DNNs makes them easy to overfit the noisy labels. Recent methods leverage self-training techniques to train noise-robust models, where a teacher trained on noisy labels is used to teach a student. However, the teacher from such models might fit a substantial amount of noise and produce wrong pseudo-labels with high confidence, leading to error propagation. In this work, we propose Meta Self-Refinement (MSR), a noise-resistant learning framework, to effectively combat noisy labels from weak supervision sources. Instead of purely relying on a fixed teacher trained on noisy labels, we keep updating the teacher to refine its pseudo-labels. At each training step, it performs a meta gradient descent on the current mini-batch to maximize the student performance on a clean validation set. Extensive experimentation on eight NLP benchmarks demonstrates that MSR is robust against noise in all settings and outperforms the state-of-the-art up to 11.4% in accuracy and 9.26% in F1 score. ",

However, it is a significant challenge to set personalized neighborhood sizes for different nodes. Further, for other homophilous nodes excluded in the neighborhood, they are ignored for information aggregation. To address these problems, we propose two models GloGNN and GloGNN++, which generate a node's embedding by aggregating information from global nodes in the graph. In each layer, both models learn a coefficient matrix to capture the correlations between nodes, based on which neighborhood aggregation is performed. The coefficient matrix allows signed values and is derived from an optimization problem that has a closed-form solution. We further accelerate neighborhood aggregation and derive a linear time complexity. We theoretically explain the models' effectiveness by proving that both the coefficient matrix and the generated node embedding matrix have the desired grouping effect. We conduct extensive experiments to compare our models against 11 other competitors on 15 benchmark datasets in a wide range of domains, scales and graph heterophilies. Experimental results show that our methods achieve superior performance and are also very efficient. ",

    "abstract": "Graph convolutional networks (GCNs) have shown remarkable learning capabilities when processing graph-structured data found inherently in many application areas. GCNs distribute the outputs of neural networks embedded in each vertex over multiple iterations to take advantage of the relations captured by the underlying graphs. Consequently, they incur a significant amount of computation and irregular communication overheads, which call for GCN-specific hardware accelerators. To this end, this paper presents a communication-aware in-memory computing architecture (COIN) for GCN hardware acceleration. Besides accelerating the computation using custom compute elements (CE) and in-memory computing, COIN aims at minimizing the intra- and inter-CE communication in GCN operations to optimize the performance and energy efficiency. Experimental evaluations with widely used datasets show up to 105x improvement in energy consumption compared to state-of-the-art GCN accelerator. ",

Here we discuss the machine learning approach to building an anomaly-based IDS using the CSE-CIC-IDS2018 dataset. Since the publication of this dataset a relatively large number of papers have been published, most of them presenting IDS architectures and results based on complex machine learning methods, like deep neural networks, gradient boosting classifiers, or hidden Markov models. Here we show that similar results can be obtained using a very simple nearest neighbor classification approach, avoiding the inherent complications of training such complex models. The advantages of the nearest neighbor algorithm are: (1) it is very simple to implement; (2) it is extremely robust; (3) it has no parameters, and therefore it cannot overfit the data. This result also shows that currently there is a trend of developing over-engineered solutions in the machine learning community. Such solutions are based on complex methods, like deep learning neural networks, without even considering baseline solutions corresponding to simple, but efficient methods. ",

In this paper, we build on this previous work with a novel strategy that allows the use of measurements affected by systematic errors in perceived depth (similarly to what might be generated by vision-based sensors), as opposed to accurate displacement measurements. As a result, our new method has the advantage of providing more robust performance (with quantitative guarantees) when inaccurate sensors are used.

    "abstract": "Automatic food detection is an emerging topic of interest due to its wide array of applications ranging from detecting food images on social media platforms to filtering non-food photos from the users in dietary assessment apps. Recently, during the COVID-19 pandemic, it has facilitated enforcing an eating ban by automatically detecting eating activities from cameras in public places. Therefore, to tackle the challenge of recognizing food images with high accuracy, we proposed the idea of a hybrid framework for extracting and selecting optimal features from an efficient neural network. There on, a nonlinear classifier is employed to discriminate between linearly inseparable feature vectors with great precision. In line with this idea, our method extracts features from MobileNetV3, selects an optimal subset of attributes by using Shapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) values, and exploits kernel extreme learning machine (KELM) due to its nonlinear decision boundary and good generalization ability. However, KELM suffers from the 'curse of dimensionality problem' for large datasets due to the complex computation of kernel matrix with large numbers of hidden nodes. We solved this problem by proposing a novel multicolumn kernel extreme learning machine (MCKELM) which exploited the k-d tree algorithm to divide data into N subsets and trains separate KELM on each subset of data. Then, the method incorporates KELM classifiers into parallel structures and selects the top k nearest subsets during testing by using the k-d tree search for classifying input instead of the whole network. For evaluating a proposed framework large food/non-food dataset is prepared using nine publically available datasets. Experimental results showed the superiority of our method on an integrated set of measures while solving the problem of 'curse of dimensionality in KELM for large datasets. ",

In contrast, many known properties, such as spatial smoothness or seasonality, are straightforward to model by choosing an appropriate kernel in a Gaussian process (GP). Many deep learning applications could be enhanced by modeling such known properties. For example, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are frequently used in remote sensing, which is subject to strong seasonal effects. We propose to blend the strengths of deep learning and the clear modeling capabilities of GPs by using a composite kernel that combines a kernel implicitly defined by a neural network with a second kernel function chosen to model known properties (e.g., seasonality). Then, we approximate the resultant GP by combining a deep network and an efficient mapping based on the Nystrom approximation, which we call Implicit Composite Kernel (ICK). ICK is flexible and can be used to include prior information in neural networks in many applications. We demonstrate the strength of our framework by showing its superior performance and flexibility on both synthetic and real-world data sets.

Recent top-performing 3D object detectors mainly rely on point-based or 3D voxel-based convolutions, which are both computationally inefficient for onboard deployment. In contrast, pillar-based methods use merely 2D convolutions, which consume less computation resources, but they lag far behind their voxel-based counterparts in detection accuracy. In this paper, by examining the primary performance gap between pillar- and voxel-based detectors, we develop a real-time and high-performance pillar-based detector, dubbed PillarNet. The proposed PillarNet consists of a powerful encoder network for effective pillar feature learning, a neck network for spatial-semantic feature fusion and the commonly used detect head. Using only 2D convolutions, PillarNet is flexible to an optional pillar size and compatible with classical 2D CNN backbones, such as VGGNet and ResNet. Additionally, PillarNet benefits from an orientation-decoupled IoU regression loss along with the IoU-aware prediction branch. Extensive experimental results on the large-scale nuScenes Dataset and Waymo Open Dataset demonstrate that the proposed PillarNet performs well over the state-of-the-art 3D detectors in terms of effectiveness and efficiency.

In correspondence-based point cloud registration, matching correspondences by point feature techniques may lead to an extremely high outlier ratio. Current methods still suffer from low efficiency, accuracy, and recall rate. We use a simple and intuitive method to describe the 6-DOF (degree of freedom) curtailment process in point cloud registration and propose an outlier removal strategy based on the reliability of the correspondence graph. The method constructs the corresponding graph according to the given correspondences and designs the concept of the reliability degree of the graph node for optimal candidate selection and the reliability degree of the graph edge to obtain the global maximum consensus set. The presented method could achieve fast and accurate outliers removal along with gradual aligning parameters estimation. Extensive experiments on simulations and challenging real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed method can still perform effective point cloud registration even the correspondence outlier ratio is over 99%, and the efficiency is better than the state-of-the-art.

We find that, as expected on theoretical grounds and shown empirically by other authors, Metropolis Monte Carlo can train a neural net with an accuracy comparable to that of gradient descent, if not necessarily as quickly. The Metropolis algorithm does not fail automatically when the number of parameters of a neural network is large. It can fail when a neural network's structure or neuron activations are strongly heterogenous, and we introduce an adaptive Monte Carlo algorithm, aMC, to overcome these limitations. The intrinsic stochasticity of the Monte Carlo method allows aMC to train neural networks in which the gradient is too small to allow training by gradient descent. We suggest that, as for molecular simulation, Monte Carlo methods offer a complement to gradient-based methods for training neural networks, allowing access to a distinct set of network architectures and principles.

In particular, we formulate a candidate set which contains the diffusion source for sure, and propose the method, Percolation-based Evolutionary Framework (PrEF), to minimize such set. Hence one could further conduct more intensive investigation on only a few nodes to target the source. To achieve that, we first demonstrate that there are some similarities between the DSL problem and the network immunization problem. We find that the minimization of the candidate set is equivalent to the minimization of the order parameter if we view the observer set as the removal node set. Hence, PrEF is developed based on the network percolation and evolutionary algorithm. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated on both model and empirical networks in regard to varied circumstances. Our results show that the developed approach could achieve a much smaller candidate set compared to the state of the art in almost all cases. Meanwhile, our approach is also more stable, i.e., it has similar performance irrespective of varied infection probabilities, diffusion models, and outbreak ranges. More importantly, our approach might provide a new framework to tackle the DSL problem in extreme large networks. ",

Using these optimizers we fit the function y = sinc(10x) using a neural network with a few parameters. This function has a variable amplitude and a constant frequency. We observe that the higher amplitude components of the function are fitted first and the Adam, BFGS and LBFGS struggle to fit the lower amplitude components of the function. We also solve the Burgers equation using a physics informed neural network(PINN) with the BFGS and LM optimizers. For our example problems with a small to medium number of weights, we find that the LM algorithm is able to rapidly converge to machine precision offering significant benefits over other optimizers. We further investigated the Adam optimizer with a range of models and found that Adam optimiser requires much deeper models with large numbers of hidden units containing up to 26x more parameters, in order to achieve a model fit close that achieved by the LM optimizer. The LM optimizer results illustrate that it may be possible build models with far fewer parameters. We have implemented all our methods in Keras and TensorFlow 2. ",

However, the end-to-end training of such frameworks is notoriously unstable due to the lack of strong supervision of detection and the inappropriate coupling between detection and description. The problem is magnified in cross-modal scenarios, in which most methods heavily rely on the pre-training. In this paper, we recouple independent constraints of detection and description of multimodal feature learning with a mutual weighting strategy, in which the detected probabilities of robust features are forced to peak and repeat, while features with high detection scores are emphasized during optimization. Different from previous works, those weights are detached from back propagation so that the detected probability of indistinct features would not be directly suppressed and the training would be more stable. Moreover, we propose the Super Detector, a detector that possesses a large receptive field and is equipped with learnable non-maximum suppression layers, to fulfill the harsh terms of detection. Finally, we build a benchmark that contains cross visible, infrared, near-infrared and synthetic aperture radar image pairs for evaluating the performance of features in feature matching and image registration tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that features trained with the recoulped detection and description, named ReDFeat, surpass previous state-of-the-arts in the benchmark, while the model can be readily trained from scratch.

But their formalization is not sufficiently expressive enough to model explanations via causal analysis of mental states as it ignores a crucial aspect of theory of mind, namely motivations. In this paper, we build on their work to support causal reasoning about conative effects. In our framework, one can reason about causes of motivational states, and we allow motivation-altering actions to be causes of observed effects.

The freshness of information available at each monitor is quantified in terms of the Age of Information (AoI), and the vector of AoI processes at the monitors (or equivalently the age vector) models the continuous state of the system. While the marginal distributional properties of each AoI process have been studied for a variety of settings using the stochastic hybrid system (SHS) approach, we lack a counterpart of this approach to systematically study their joint distributional properties. Developing such a framework is the main contribution of this paper. In particular, we model the discrete state of the system as a finite-state continuous-time Markov chain, and describe the coupled evolution of the system's continuous and discrete states by a piecewise linear SHS with linear reset maps. We start our analysis by deriving first-order linear differential equations for the temporal evolution of both the joint moments and the joint moment generating function (MGF) of all possible pairwise combinations formed by the age vector components. We then derive the conditions under which the derived differential equations are asymptotically stable. Finally, we apply our framework to characterize the stationary joint MGF in a multi-source updating system under several queueing disciplines including non-preemptive and source-agnostic/source-aware preemptive in service queueing disciplines.

These methods do not make assumptions on the form of attack and the classification model, and thus can defend pre-existing classifiers against unseen threats. However, their performance currently falls behind adversarial training methods. In this work, we propose DiffPure that uses diffusion models for adversarial purification: Given an adversarial example, we first diffuse it with a small amount of noise following a forward diffusion process, and then recover the clean image through a reverse generative process. To evaluate our method against strong adaptive attacks in an efficient and scalable way, we propose to use the adjoint method to compute full gradients of the reverse generative process. Extensive experiments on three image datasets including CIFAR-10, ImageNet and CelebA-HQ with three classifier architectures including ResNet, WideResNet and ViT demonstrate that our method achieves the state-of-the-art results, outperforming current adversarial training and adversarial purification methods, often by a large margin.

    "title": "Gradient Descent Optimizes Infinite-Depth ReLU Implicit Networks with  Linear Widths",
    "abstract": "Implicit deep learning has recently become popular in the machine learning community since these implicit models can achieve competitive performance with state-of-the-art deep networks while using significantly less memory and computational resources. However, our theoretical understanding of when and how first-order methods such as gradient descent (GD) converge on \\textit{nonlinear} implicit networks is limited. Although this type of problem has been studied in standard feed-forward networks, the case of implicit models is still intriguing because implicit networks have \\textit{infinitely} many layers. The corresponding equilibrium equation probably admits no or multiple solutions during training. This paper studies the convergence of both gradient flow (GF) and gradient descent for nonlinear ReLU activated implicit networks. To deal with the well-posedness problem, we introduce a fixed scalar to scale the weight matrix of the implicit layer and show that there exists a small enough scaling constant, keeping the equilibrium equation well-posed throughout training. As a result, we prove that both GF and GD converge to a global minimum at a linear rate if the width $m$ of the implicit network is \\textit{linear} in the sample size $N$, i.e., $m=\\Omega(N)$. ",

    "title": "Robust Representation via Dynamic Feature Aggregation",
    "abstract": "Deep convolutional neural network (CNN) based models are vulnerable to the adversarial attacks. One of the possible reasons is that the embedding space of CNN based model is sparse, resulting in a large space for the generation of adversarial samples. In this study, we propose a method, denoted as Dynamic Feature Aggregation, to compress the embedding space with a novel regularization. Particularly, the convex combination between two samples are regarded as the pivot for aggregation. In the embedding space, the selected samples are guided to be similar to the representation of the pivot. On the other side, to mitigate the trivial solution of such regularization, the last fully-connected layer of the model is replaced by an orthogonal classifier, in which the embedding codes for different classes are processed orthogonally and separately. With the regularization and orthogonal classifier, a more compact embedding space can be obtained, which accordingly improves the model robustness against adversarial attacks. An averaging accuracy of 56.91% is achieved by our method on CIFAR-10 against various attack methods, which significantly surpasses a solid baseline (Mixup) by a margin of 37.31%. More surprisingly, empirical results show that, the proposed method can also achieve the state-of-the-art performance for out-of-distribution (OOD) detection, due to the learned compact feature space. An F1 score of 0.937 is achieved by the proposed method, when adopting CIFAR-10 as in-distribution (ID) dataset and LSUN as OOD dataset.

    "abstract": "We consider the problem of robustly testing the norm of a high-dimensional sparse signal vector under two different observation models. In the first model, we are given $n$ i.i.d. samples from the distribution $\\mathcal{N}\\left(\\theta,I_d\\right)$ (with unknown $\\theta$), of which a small fraction has been arbitrarily corrupted. Under the promise that $\\|\\theta\\|_0\\le s$, we want to correctly distinguish whether $\\|\\theta\\|_2=0$ or $\\|\\theta\\|_2>\\gamma$, for some input parameter $\\gamma>0$. We show that any algorithm for this task requires $n=\\Omega\\left(s\\log\\frac{ed}{s}\\right)$ samples, which is tight up to logarithmic factors. We also extend our results to other common notions of sparsity, namely, $\\|\\theta\\|_q\\le s$ for any $0 < q < 2$. In the second observation model that we consider, the data is generated according to a sparse linear regression model, where the covariates are i.i.d. Gaussian and the regression coefficient (signal) is known to be $s$-sparse. Here too we assume that an $\\epsilon$-fraction of the data is arbitrarily corrupted. We show that any algorithm that reliably tests the norm of the regression coefficient requires at least $n=\\Omega\\left(\\min(s\\log d,{1}/{\\gamma^4})\\right)$ samples. Our results show that the complexity of testing in these two settings significantly increases under robustness constraints. This is in line with the recent observations made in robust mean testing and robust covariance testing. ",

    "abstract": "Recommender systems suffer from confounding biases when there exist confounders affecting both item features and user feedback (e.g., like or not). Existing causal recommendation methods typically assume confounders are fully observed and measured, forgoing the possible existence of hidden confounders in real applications. For instance, product quality is a confounder since affecting both item prices and user ratings, but is hidden for the third-party e-commerce platform due to the difficulty of large-scale quality inspection; ignoring it could result in the bias effect of over-recommending high-price items. This work analyzes and addresses the problem from a causal perspective. The key lies in modeling the causal effect of item features on a user's feedback. To mitigate hidden confounding effects, it is compulsory but challenging to estimate the causal effect without measuring the confounder. Towards this goal, we propose a Hidden Confounder Removal (HCR) framework that leverages front-door adjustment to decompose the causal effect into two partial effects, according to the mediators between item features and user feedback. The partial effects are independent from the hidden confounder and identifiable. During training, HCR performs multi-task learning to infer the partial effects from historical interactions. We instantiate HCR for two scenarios and conduct experiments on three real-world datasets. Empirical results show that the HCR framework provides more accurate recommendations, especially for less-active users. We will release the code once accepted. ",

    "abstract": "A planar orthogonal drawing of a planar 4-graph G (i.e., a planar graph with vertex-degree at most four) is a crossing-free drawing that maps each vertex of G to a distinct point of the plane and each edge of $G$ to a sequence of horizontal and vertical segments between its end-points. A longstanding open question in Graph Drawing, dating back over 30 years, is whether there exists a linear-time algorithm to compute an orthogonal drawing of a plane 4-graph with the minimum number of bends. The term \"plane\" indicates that the input graph comes together with a planar embedding, which must be preserved by the drawing (i.e., the drawing must have the same set of faces as the input graph). In this paper, we positively answer the question above for the widely-studied class of series-parallel graphs. Our linear-time algorithm is based on a characterization of the planar series-parallel graphs that admit an orthogonal drawing without bends. This characterization is given in terms of the orthogonal spirality that each type of triconnected component of the graph can take; the orthogonal spirality of a component measures how much that component is \"rolled-up\" in an orthogonal drawing of the graph.

However, while existing methods include some information from the physical and social domains, they do not provide a comprehensive representation of cyberspace. Existing reasoning methods are also based on expert-given rules, resulting in inefficiency and a low degree of intelligence. To address this challenge, we create a Knowledge Graph (KG) of multiple domain cyberspace in order to provide a standard semantic description of the multiple domain cyberspace. Following that, we proposed a user's permissions reasoning method based on reinforcement learning. All permissions in cyberspace are represented as nodes, and an agent is trained to find all permissions that user can have according to user's initial permissions and cyberspace KG. We set 10 reward setting rules based on the features of cyberspace KG in the reinforcement learning of reward information setting, so that the agent can better locate user's all permissions and avoid blindly finding user's permissions. The results of the experiments showed that the proposed method can successfully reason about user's permissions and increase the intelligence level of the user's permissions reasoning method. At the same time, the F1 value of the proposed method is 6% greater than that of the Translating Embedding (TransE) method. ",

    "abstract": "Deep learning based approaches has achieved great performance in single image super-resolution (SISR). However, recent advances in efficient super-resolution focus on reducing the number of parameters and FLOPs, and they aggregate more powerful features by improving feature utilization through complex layer connection strategies. These structures may not be necessary to achieve higher running speed, which makes them difficult to be deployed to resource-constrained devices. In this work, we propose a novel Residual Local Feature Network (RLFN). The main idea is using three convolutional layers for residual local feature learning to simplify feature aggregation, which achieves a good trade-off between model performance and inference time. Moreover, we revisit the popular contrastive loss and observe that the selection of intermediate features of its feature extractor has great influence on the performance. Besides, we propose a novel multi-stage warm-start training strategy. In each stage, the pre-trained weights from previous stages are utilized to improve the model performance. Combined with the improved contrastive loss and training strategy, the proposed RLFN outperforms all the state-of-the-art efficient image SR models in terms of runtime while maintaining both PSNR and SSIM for SR. In addition, we won the first place in the runtime track of the NTIRE 2022 efficient super-resolution challenge. Code will be available at https://github.com/fyan111/RLFN. ",

One type of issue that may impact the quality of software is code smells. Yet, little is known about the extent to which code smells are identified during modern code review. To investigate the concept behind code smells identified in modern code review and what actions reviewers suggest and developers take in response to the identified smells, we conducted a study of code smells in code reviews by analyzing reviews from four large open source projects from the OpenStack (Nova and Neutron) and Qt (Qt Base and Qt Creator) communities. We manually checked a total of 25,415 code review comments obtained by keywords search and random selection, and identified 1,539 smell-related reviews. Our analysis found that 1) code smells were not commonly identified in code reviews, 2) smells were usually caused by violation of coding conventions, 3) reviewers usually provided constructive feedback, including fixing (refactoring) recommendations to help developers remove smells, 4) developers generally followed those recommendations and actioned the changes, 5) once identified by reviewers, it usually takes developers less than one week to fix the smells, and 6) the main reason why developers chose to ignore the identified smells is not worth fixing the smell. Our results suggest that: 1) developers should closely follow coding conventions in their projects to avoid introducing code smells, 2) review-based detection of code smells is perceived to be a trustworthy approach by developers, mainly because reviews are context-sensitive (as reviewers are more aware of the context of the code given that they are part of the project's development team), and 3) program context needs to be fully considered in order to make a decision of whether to fix the identified code smell immediately.

Recent studies have been using social media to map values and attributes conveyed by public to cultural heritage.

This study presents a methodological workflow for constructing such multi-modal datasets using posts and images on Flickr for graph-based machine learning (ML) tasks concerning heritage values and attributes. After data pre-processing using state-of-the-art ML models, the multi-modal information of visual contents and textual semantics are modelled as node features and labels, while their social relationships and spatiotemporal contexts are modelled as links in Multi-Graphs. The workflow is tested in three cities containing UNESCO World Heritage properties - Amsterdam, Suzhou, and Venice, which yielded datasets with high consistency for semi-supervised learning tasks. The entire process is formally described with mathematical notations, ready to be applied in provisional tasks both as ML problems with technical relevance and as urban/heritage study questions with societal interests. This study could also benefit the understanding and mapping of heritage values and attributes for future research in global cases, aiming at inclusive heritage management practices. ",

In this paper, we propose a new training scheme that extends the standard VAE via novel stochastic dequantization and quantization, called stochastically quantized variational autoencoder (SQ-VAE). In SQ-VAE, we observe a trend that the quantization is stochastic at the initial stage of the training but gradually converges toward a deterministic quantization, which we call self-annealing. Our experiments show that SQ-VAE improves codebook utilization without using common heuristics. Furthermore, we empirically show that SQ-VAE is superior to VAE and VQ-VAE in vision- and speech-related tasks. ",

The analysis of the performance and of the behavioral strategies displayed by the agents trained with the two methods on benchmark problems enable us to demonstrate qualitative differences which were not identified in previous studies, to identify the relative weakness of the two methods, and to propose ways to ameliorate some of those weakness. We show that the characteristics of the reward function has a strong impact which vary qualitatively not only for the OpenAI-ES and the PPO but also for alternative reinforcement learning algorithms, thus demonstrating the importance of optimizing the characteristic of the reward function to the algorithm used.

In this work, we adopt a principled way and study the robustness of DRL policies to adversarial attacks from the perspective of robust optimization. Within the framework of robust optimization, optimal adversarial attacks are given by minimizing the expected return of the policy, and correspondingly a good defense mechanism should be realized by improving the worst-case performance of the policy. Considering that attackers generally have no access to the training environment, we propose a greedy attack algorithm, which tries to minimize the expected return of the policy without interacting with the environment, and a defense algorithm, which performs adversarial training in a max-min form. Experiments on Atari game environments show that our attack algorithm is more effective and leads to worse return of the policy than existing attack algorithms, and our defense algorithm yields policies more robust than existing defense methods to a range of adversarial attacks (including our proposed attack algorithm).

Price change potentially generates conflicts with customers. In this paper, we present KnowGraph-PM, a knowledge graph-based dynamic pricing model. The semantic model uses the potential of faster delivery and shorter lead times to define premium prices, thus entail increased profits based on the customer profile. The knowledge graph enables the integration of customer-related information, e.g., customer class and location to customer order data. The pricing algorithm is realized as a SPARQL query that relies on customer profile and order behavior to determine the corresponding price premium. We evaluate the approach by calculating the revenue generated after applying the pricing algorithm. Based on competency questions that translate to SPARQL queries, we validate the created knowledge graph. We demonstrate that semantic data integration enables customer-tailored revenue management. ",

    "abstract": "Intent detection and slot filling are two main tasks in natural language understanding and play an essential role in task-oriented dialogue systems. The joint learning of both tasks can improve inference accuracy and is popular in recent works. However, most joint models ignore the inference latency and cannot meet the need to deploy dialogue systems at the edge. In this paper, we propose a Fast Attention Network (FAN) for joint intent detection and slot filling tasks, guaranteeing both accuracy and latency. Specifically, we introduce a clean and parameter-refined attention module to enhance the information exchange between intent and slot, improving semantic accuracy by more than 2%. FAN can be implemented on different encoders and delivers more accurate models at every speed level. Our experiments on the Jetson Nano platform show that FAN inferences fifteen utterances per second with a small accuracy drop, showing its effectiveness and efficiency on edge devices. ",

Hyperdimensional (HD) computing is an emerging ML paradigm inspired by neuroscience research with various aspects interesting for IoT devices and biomedical applications. Here we explore the not yet addressed topic of optimal encoding of spatio-temporal data, such as electroencephalogram (EEG) signals, and all information it entails to the HD vectors. Further, we demonstrate how the HD computing framework can be used to perform feature selection by choosing an adequate encoding. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first approach to performing feature selection using HD computing in the literature. As a result, we believe it can support the ML community to further foster the research in multiple directions related to feature and channel selection, as well as model interpretability. ",

In this paper, we decided to investigate the capabilities of the recently proposed deep embedding model L3-Net to automatically extract meaningful features from raw respiratory audio recordings in order to improve the performances of standard machine learning classifiers in discriminating between COVID-19 positive and negative subjects from smartphone data. We evaluated the proposed model on 3 datasets, comparing the obtained results with those of two reference works. Results show that the combination of L3-Net with hand-crafted features overcomes the performance of the other works of 28.57% in terms of AUC in a set of subject-independent experiments. This result paves the way to further investigation on different deep audio embeddings, also for the automatic detection of different diseases. ",

The success of deep learning based object detectors relies on the availability of large-scale annotated datasets, which is time-consuming and expensive to compile, especially for 3D bounding box annotation. In this work, we investigate diversity-based active learning (AL) as a potential solution to alleviate the annotation burden. Given limited annotation budget, only the most informative frames and objects are automatically selected for human to annotate. Technically, we take the advantage of the multimodal information provided in an AV dataset, and propose a novel acquisition function that enforces spatial and temporal diversity in the selected samples. We benchmark the proposed method against other AL strategies under realistic annotation cost measurement, where the realistic costs for annotating a frame and a 3D bounding box are both taken into consideration. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method on the nuScenes dataset and show that it outperforms existing AL strategies significantly. ",

    "abstract": "Recently, a class of machine learning methods called physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) has been proposed and gained great prevalence in solving various scientific computing problems. This approach enables the solution of partial differential equations (PDEs) via embedding physical laws into the loss function of neural networks. Many inverse problems can also be tackled by simply combining the observational data from real life scenarios with existing PINN algorithms. In this paper, we present a multi-task learning method to improve the training stability of PINNs for linear elastic problems, and the homoscedastic uncertainty is introduced as a basis for weighting losses. Furthermore, we demonstrate an application of PINNs to a practical inverse problem in tunnel engineering: prediction of external loading distributions of tunnel rings based on a limited number of displacement monitoring points. To this end, we first determine a simplified tunneling scenario at the offline stage. By setting unknown boundary conditions as learnable parameters, PINNs can predict the external loads applied on the tunnel lining with the support of enough measurement data. When it comes to the online stage in real tunnel projects, the Kriging method is adopted to reconstruct the whole displacement field based on very limited measurements. Then transfer learning is employed to fine-tune the pre-trained model from offline stage. Our results show that, although the reconstructed displacement field generated from gappy measurements is accompanied by errors, satisfactory results can still be obtained from the PINN model due to the dual regularization of physics laws and prior knowledge, which exhibits better robustness compared to traditional analysis methods. The convergence of training is also accelerated, thus making it possible for PINNs to be applied in actual tunnel projects. ",

The traditional multi-ship air defense model does not consider the coordination between ships, and the model assumptions are often too simple to effectively describe the capabilities of the multi-ship cooperative air defense system in realistic combat scenarios. In response to the above problems, this paper proposes a multi-ship cooperative air defense model, which effectively integrates the attack and defense parameters of both sides such as missile launch rate, missile flight speed, missile launch direction, ship interception rate, ship interception range, and the number of ship interception fire units. Then, the cooperative interception capability among ships is modeled by the method of task assignment. Based on the queuing theory, this paper strictly deduces the penetration probability of the cooperative air defense system, and provides an analytical calculation model for the analysis and design of the cooperative air defense system. Finally, through simulation experiments in typical scenarios, this paper studies and compares the air defense capabilities of the system in two different modes with and without coordination, and verifies the superiority of the multi-ship cooperative air defense model in reducing the probability of missile penetration; Further, the ability changes of the defense system under different parameters such as missile speed, speed, angle, ship interception rate, range, and number of fire units are studied, and the weak points of the defense formation, defense range settings, and interception settings are obtained.

    "abstract": "High-resolution (HR) MRI is critical in assisting the doctor's diagnosis and image-guided treatment, but is hard to obtain in a clinical setting due to long acquisition time. Therefore, the research community investigated deep learning-based super-resolution (SR) technology to reconstruct HR MRI images with shortened acquisition time. However, training such neural networks usually requires paired HR and low-resolution (LR) in-vivo images, which are difficult to acquire due to patient movement during and between the image acquisition. Rigid movements of hard tissues can be corrected with image-registration, whereas the alignment of deformed soft tissues is challenging, making it impractical to train the neural network with such authentic HR and LR image pairs. Therefore, most of the previous studies proposed SR reconstruction by employing authentic HR images and synthetic LR images downsampled from the HR images, yet the difference in degradation representations between synthetic and authentic LR images suppresses the performance of SR reconstruction from authentic LR images. To mitigate the aforementioned problems, we propose a novel Unsupervised DEgradation Adaptation Network (UDEAN). Our model consists of two components: the degradation learning network and the SR reconstruction network. The degradation learning network downsamples the HR images by addressing the degradation representation of the misaligned or unpaired LR images, and the SR reconstruction network learns the mapping from the downsampled HR images to their original HR images. As a result, the SR reconstruction network can generate SR images from the LR images and achieve comparable quality to the HR images. Experimental results show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art models and can potentially be applied in real-world clinical settings. ",

    "abstract": "CT-based bronchial tree analysis plays an important role in the computer-aided diagnosis for respiratory diseases, as it could provide structured information for clinicians. The basis of airway analysis is bronchial tree reconstruction, which consists of bronchus segmentation and classification. However, there remains a challenge for accurate bronchial analysis due to the individual variations and the severe class imbalance. In this paper, we propose a region and structure prior embedded framework named BronchusNet to achieve accurate segmentation and classification of bronchial regions in CT images. For bronchus segmentation, we propose an adaptive hard region-aware UNet that incorporates multi-level prior guidance of hard pixel-wise samples in the general Unet segmentation network to achieve better hierarchical feature learning. For the classification of bronchial branches, we propose a hybrid point-voxel graph learning module to fully exploit bronchial structure priors and to support simultaneous feature interactions across different branches. To facilitate the study of bronchial analysis, we contribute~\\textbf{BRSC}: an open-access benchmark of \\textbf{BR}onchus imaging analysis with high-quality pixel-wise \\textbf{S}egmentation masks and the \\textbf{C}lass of bronchial segments. Experimental results on BRSC show that our proposed method not only achieves the state-of-the-art performance for binary segmentation of bronchial region but also exceeds the best existing method on bronchial branches classification by 6.9\\%.

    "abstract": "In many variants of the game of Cops and Robbers on graphs, multiple cops play against a single robber. In 2019, Cox and Sanaei introduced a variant of the game that gives the robber a more active role than simply evading the cop. In their version, the robber tries to damage as many vertices as possible and the cop attempts to minimize this damage. While the damage variant was originally studied with one cop and one robber, it was later extended to play with multiple cops by Carlson et. al in 2021. We take a different approach by studying the damage variant with multiple robbers against one cop. Specifically, we introduce the $s$-robber damage number of a graph and obtain a variety of bounds on this parameter. Applying these bounds, we determine the $s$-robber damage number for a variety of graph families and characterize graphs with extreme $2$-robber damage number. ",

Classical simulation of quantum programs has enabled the design and analysis of algorithms and implementation strategies targeting current and anticipated quantum device architectures. In this paper, we present a graph-based approach to achieve efficient quantum circuit simulation. Our approach involves partitioning the graph representation of a given quantum circuit into acyclic sub-graphs/circuits that exhibit better data locality. Simulation of each sub-circuit is organized hierarchically, with the iterative construction and simulation of smaller state vectors, improving overall performance. Also, this partitioning reduces the number of passes through data, improving the total computation time. We present three partitioning strategies and observe that acyclic graph partitioning typically results in the best time-to-solution. In contrast, other strategies reduce the partitioning time at the expense of potentially increased simulation times. Experimental evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach. ",

    "abstract": "Label scarcity has been a long-standing issue for biomedical image segmentation, due to high annotation costs and professional requirements. Recently, active learning (AL) strategies strive to reduce annotation costs by querying a small portion of data for annotation, receiving much traction in the field of medical imaging. However, most of the existing AL methods have to initialize models with some randomly selected samples followed by active selection based on various criteria, such as uncertainty and diversity. Such random-start initialization methods inevitably introduce under-value redundant samples and unnecessary annotation costs. For the purpose of addressing the issue, we propose a novel self-supervised assisted active learning framework in the cold-start setting, in which the segmentation model is first warmed up with self-supervised learning (SSL), and then SSL features are used for sample selection via latent feature clustering without accessing labels. We assess our proposed methodology on skin lesions segmentation task. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach is capable of achieving promising performance with substantial improvements over existing baselines. ",

The main challenges with this approach are the vagueness of annotated change points caused by the silences between speaker turns and imbalanced data due to the majority of frames not including a speaker change. Conventional training methods tackle these by artificially increasing the proportion of positive labels in the training data. Instead, the proposed method uses an objective function which encourages the model to predict a single positive label within a specified collar. This is done by marginalizing over all possible subsequences that have exactly one positive label within the collar. Experiments on English and Estonian datasets show large improvements over the conventional training method. Additionally, the model outputs have peaks concentrated to a single frame, removing the need for post-processing to find the exact predicted change point which is particularly useful for streaming applications.

Phys. 42, 1291-1302 (1981)]. To find the free parameters of the latter, an unconstrained optimization problem is defined as a condition of thermodynamic consistency based on the compressibility and solved using Evolutionary Algorithms. For the hard-sphere fluid, the results show good agreement when compared with mean-field equations of state and accurate computer simulation results; at high densities, i.e., close to the freezing transition, expected (small) deviations are seen. In the case of the square-well fluid, a good agreement is observed at low and high densities when compared with event-driven molecular dynamics computer simulations. For intermediate densities, the explored closure relations vary in terms of accuracy. Our findings suggest that a modification of the optimization problem to include, for example, additional thermodynamic consistency criteria could improve the results for the type of fluids here explored.

We also propose an alternating projected gradient descent algorithm. Based on analyzing our objective functions on manifolds with bounded curvature, we show that the algorithm is guaranteed to converge, all accumulation points of the iterates have estimation errors in the order of $O(1/\\sqrt{n})$ asymptotically and substantially attaining the minimax rate. Our theoretical analysis can be applied to general optimization problems on manifolds with bounded curvature and can be considered an important technical contribution to this work.

In our case the differential equation is a drift-diffusion model. Computational methods for quantum graphs require a careful discretization of the differential operator that also incorporates the node conditions, in our case Kirchhoff-Neumann conditions. Traditional numerical schemes are rather mature but have to be tailored manually when the differential equation becomes the constraint in an optimization problem. Recently, physics informed neural networks (PINNs) have emerged as a versatile tool for the solution of partial differential equations from a range of applications. They offer flexibility to solve parameter identification or optimization problems by only slightly changing the problem formulation used for the forward simulation. We compare several PINN approaches for solving the drift-diffusion on the metric graph. ",

It is the first review that summarizes the different GANs methods and the lungs images datasets for COVID-19. It attempts to answer the questions related to applications of GANs, popular GAN architectures, frequently used image modalities, and the availability of source code. This review included 57 full-text studies that reported the use of GANs for different applications in COVID-19 lungs images data. Most of the studies (n=42) used GANs for data augmentation to enhance the performance of AI techniques for COVID-19 diagnosis. Other popular applications of GANs were segmentation of lungs and super-resolution of the lungs images. The cycleGAN and the conditional GAN were the most commonly used architectures used in nine studies each. 29 studies used chest X-Ray images while 21 studies used CT images for the training of GANs. For majority of the studies (n=47), the experiments were done and results were reported using publicly available data. A secondary evaluation of the results by radiologists/clinicians was reported by only two studies. Conclusion: Studies have shown that GANs have great potential to address the data scarcity challenge for lungs images of COVID-19. Data synthesized with GANs have been helpful to improve the training of the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models trained for the diagnosis of COVID-19. Besides, GANs have also contributed to enhancing the CNNs performance through the super-resolution of the images and segmentation. This review also identified key limitations of the potential transformation of GANs based methods in clinical applications. ",

    "abstract": "Inspired by the great success of deep neural networks, learning-based methods have gained promising performances for metal artifact reduction (MAR) in computed tomography (CT) images. However, most of the existing approaches put less emphasis on modelling and embedding the intrinsic prior knowledge underlying this specific MAR task into their network designs. Against this issue, we propose an adaptive convolutional dictionary network (ACDNet), which leverages both model-based and learning-based methods. Specifically, we explore the prior structures of metal artifacts, e.g., non-local repetitive streaking patterns, and encode them as an explicit weighted convolutional dictionary model. Then, a simple-yet-effective algorithm is carefully designed to solve the model. By unfolding every iterative substep of the proposed algorithm into a network module, we explicitly embed the prior structure into a deep network, \\emph{i.e.,} a clear interpretability for the MAR task. Furthermore, our ACDNet can automatically learn the prior for artifact-free CT images via training data and adaptively adjust the representation kernels for each input CT image based on its content. Hence, our method inherits the clear interpretability of model-based methods and maintains the powerful representation ability of learning-based methods. Comprehensive experiments executed on synthetic and clinical datasets show the superiority of our ACDNet in terms of effectiveness and model generalization. {\\color{blue}{{\\textit{Code is available at {\\url{https://github.com/hongwang01/ACDNet}}.}}}} ",

These classifiers are often trained and validated to obtain optimal accuracy, however we show that the optimal accuracy classifier does not generally coincide with a classifier that provides the lowest detection limit, nor the lowest quantification uncertainty.

These methods use a deep neural network (DNN) as an image generator to learn non-linear mapping from compressed measurements to the spectral image. For instance, the deep spectral prior approach uses a convolutional autoencoder network (CAE) in the optimization algorithm to recover the spectral image by using a non-linear representation. However, the CAE training is detached from the recovery problem, which does not guarantee optimal representation of the spectral images for the CSI problem. This work proposes a joint non-linear representation and recovery network (JR2net), linking the representation and recovery task into a single optimization problem. JR2net consists of an optimization-inspired network following an ADMM formulation that learns a non-linear low-dimensional representation and simultaneously performs the spectral image recovery, trained via the end-to-end approach.

In this paper, we formulate a theoretical framework for the expressive ability of data re-uploading quantum neural networks that consist of interleaved encoding circuit blocks and trainable circuit blocks. First, we prove that single-qubit quantum neural networks can approximate any univariate function by mapping the model to a partial Fourier series. Beyond previous works' understanding of existence, we in particular establish the exact correlations between the parameters of the trainable gates and the working Fourier coefficients, by exploring connections to quantum signal processing. Second, we discuss the limitations of single-qubit native QNNs on approximating multivariate functions by analyzing the frequency spectrum and the flexibility of Fourier coefficients. We further demonstrate the expressivity and limitations of single-qubit native QNNs via numerical experiments. As applications, we introduce natural extensions to multi-qubit quantum neural networks, which exhibit the capability of classifying real-world multi-dimensional data. We believe these results would improve our understanding of QNNs and provide a helpful guideline for designing powerful QNNs for machine learning tasks. ",
