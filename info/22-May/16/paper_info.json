    "abstract": "User evaluations include a significant quantity of information across online platforms. This information source has been neglected by the majority of existing recommendation systems, despite its potential to ease the sparsity issue and enhance the quality of suggestions. This work presents a deep model for concurrently learning item attributes and user behaviour from review text. Deep Cooperative Neural Networks (DeepCoNN) is the suggested model consisting of two parallel neural networks connected in their final layers. One of the networks focuses on learning user behaviour from reviews submitted by the user, while the other network learns item attributes from user reviews. On top, a shared layer is added to connect these two networks. Similar to factorization machine approaches, the shared layer allows latent factors acquired for people and things to interact with each other. On a number of datasets, DeepCoNN surpasses all baseline recommendation systems, according to experimental findings. ",

    "abstract": "A large body of research has shown that machine learning models are vulnerable to membership inference (MI) attacks that violate the privacy of the participants in the training data. Most MI research focuses on the case of a single standalone model, while production machine-learning platforms often update models over time, on data that often shifts in distribution, giving the attacker more information. This paper proposes new attacks that take advantage of one or more model updates to improve MI. A key part of our approach is to leverage rich information from standalone MI attacks mounted separately against the original and updated models, and to combine this information in specific ways to improve attack effectiveness. We propose a set of combination functions and tuning methods for each, and present both analytical and quantitative justification for various options. Our results on four public datasets show that our attacks are effective at using update information to give the adversary a significant advantage over attacks on standalone models, but also compared to a prior MI attack that takes advantage of model updates in a related machine-unlearning setting. We perform the first measurements of the impact of distribution shift on MI attacks with model updates, and show that a more drastic distribution shift results in significantly higher MI risk than a gradual shift.

We formulate our data poisoning attack as a bilevel optimization problem, whose solution is the set of poisoning inputs; and we propose a contrastive-learning-tailored method to approximately solve it. Our evaluation on multiple datasets shows that PoisonedEncoder achieves high attack success rates while maintaining the testing accuracy of the downstream classifiers built upon the poisoned encoder for non-attacker-chosen inputs. We also evaluate five defenses against PoisonedEncoder, including one pre-processing, three in-processing, and one post-processing defenses. Our results show that these defenses can decrease the attack success rate of PoisonedEncoder, but they also sacrifice the utility of the encoder or require a large clean pre-training dataset. ",

We employ a hypernetwork to parameterize the posterior distribution of weights given conditional inputs and minimize a variational objective of this Bayesian neural network. To further reduce the network sizes, we propose a new input-output group sparsity factorization of weights to encourage more sparseness in the generated weights.

    "abstract": "Cross-Domain Recommendation (CDR) has been popularly studied to utilize different domain knowledge to solve the cold-start problem in recommender systems. Most of the existing CDR models assume that both the source and target domains share the same overlapped user set for knowledge transfer. However, only few proportion of users simultaneously activate on both the source and target domains in practical CDR tasks. In this paper, we focus on the Partially Overlapped Cross-Domain Recommendation (POCDR) problem, that is, how to leverage the information of both the overlapped and non-overlapped users to improve recommendation performance. Existing approaches cannot fully utilize the useful knowledge behind the non-overlapped users across domains, which limits the model performance when the majority of users turn out to be non-overlapped. To address this issue, we propose an end-to-end dual-autoencoder with Variational Domain-invariant Embedding Alignment (VDEA) model, a cross-domain recommendation framework for the POCDR problem, which utilizes dual variational autoencoders with both local and global embedding alignment for exploiting domain-invariant user embedding. VDEA first adopts variational inference to capture collaborative user preferences, and then utilizes Gromov-Wasserstein distribution co-clustering optimal transport to cluster the users with similar rating interaction behaviors. Our empirical studies on Douban and Amazon datasets demonstrate that VDEA significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art models, especially under the POCDR setting. ",

An analysis of modularity in neural networks produced by machine learning algorithms can offer valuable insight into the workings of such algorithms and how modularity can be leveraged to improve performance. However, this property is often overlooked in the neuroevolutionary literature, so the modular nature of many learning algorithms is unknown. This property was assessed on the popular algorithm \"NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies\" (NEAT) for standard simulation benchmark control problems due to NEAT's ability to optimise network topology. This paper shows that NEAT networks seem to rapidly increase in modularity over time with the rate and convergence dependent on the problem. Interestingly, NEAT tends towards increasingly modular networks even when network fitness converges. It was shown that the ideal level of network modularity in the explored parameter space is highly dependent on other network variables, dispelling theories that modularity has a straightforward relationship to network performance. This is further proven in this paper by demonstrating that rewarding modularity directly did not improve fitness. ",

To this end, we propose the Relation-based Embedding Propagation (REP) method. It is a post-processing technique to adapt pre-trained KG embeddings with graph context. As relations in KGs are directional, we model the incoming head context and the outgoing tail context separately. Accordingly, we design relational context functions with no external parameters. Besides, we use averaging to aggregate context information, making REP more computation-efficient. We theoretically prove that such designs can avoid information distortion during propagation. Extensive experiments also demonstrate that REP has significant scalability while improving or maintaining prediction quality. Notably, it averagely brings about 10% relative improvement to triplet-based embedding methods on OGBL-WikiKG2 and takes 5%-83% time to achieve comparable results as the state-of-the-art GC-OTE. ",

However, due to the memorability of the training data, ML is susceptible to various attacks, especially Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs), the objective of which is to infer the model's training data. So far, most of the membership inference attacks against ML classifiers leverage the shadow model with the same structure as the target model. However, empirical results show that these attacks can be easily mitigated if the shadow model is not clear about the network structure of the target model. In this paper, We present attacks based on black-box access to the target model. We name our attack \\textbf{l-Leaks}. The l-Leaks follows the intuition that if an established shadow model is similar enough to the target model, then the adversary can leverage the shadow model's information to predict a target sample's membership.The logits of the trained target model contain valuable sample knowledge. We build the shadow model by learning the logits of the target model and making the shadow model more similar to the target model. Then shadow model will have sufficient confidence in the member samples of the target model. We also discuss the effect of the shadow model's different network structures to attack results. Experiments over different networks and datasets demonstrate that both of our attacks achieve strong performance. ",

In addition to prediction outputs, these APIs can also provide other information in a more human-understandable way, such as counterfactual explanations (CF). However, such extra information inevitably causes the cloud models to be more vulnerable to extraction attacks which aim to steal the internal functionality of models in the cloud. Due to the black-box nature of cloud models, however, a vast number of queries are inevitably required by existing attack strategies before the substitute model achieves high fidelity. In this paper, we propose a novel simple yet efficient querying strategy to greatly enhance the querying efficiency to steal a classification model. This is motivated by our observation that current querying strategies suffer from decision boundary shift issue induced by taking far-distant queries and close-to-boundary CFs into substitute model training. We then propose DualCF strategy to circumvent the above issues, which is achieved by taking not only CF but also counterfactual explanation of CF (CCF) as pairs of training samples for the substitute model. Extensive and comprehensive experimental evaluations are conducted on both synthetic and real-world datasets. The experimental results favorably illustrate that DualCF can produce a high-fidelity model with fewer queries efficiently and effectively. ",

This procedure is noisy for small windows, hence prone to induce false positives and not able to deal with more than one drift event in a window.

    "title": "Addressing Confounding Feature Issue for Causal Recommendation",
    "abstract": "In recommender system, some feature directly affects whether an interaction would happen, making the happened interactions not necessarily indicate user preference. For instance, short videos are objectively easier to be finished even though the user does not like the video. We term such feature as confounding feature, and video length is a confounding feature in video recommendation. If we fit a model on such interaction data, just as done by most data-driven recommender systems, the model will be biased to recommend short videos more, and deviate from user actual requirement. This work formulates and addresses the problem from the causal perspective. Assuming there are some factors affecting both the confounding feature and other item features, e.g., the video creator, we find the confounding feature opens a backdoor path behind user item matching and introduces spurious correlation. To remove the effect of backdoor path, we propose a framework named Deconfounding Causal Recommendation (DCR), which performs intervened inference with do-calculus. Nevertheless, evaluating do calculus requires to sum over the prediction on all possible values of confounding feature, significantly increasing the time cost. To address the efficiency challenge, we further propose a mixture-of experts (MoE) model architecture, modeling each value of confounding feature with a separate expert module. Through this way, we retain the model expressiveness with few additional costs. We demonstrate DCR on the backbone model of neural factorization machine (NFM), showing that DCR leads to more accurate prediction of user preference with small inference time cost. ",

Commercial products aim to increase programmers' productivity, without being able to measure it directly. In this case study, we asked users of GitHub Copilot about its impact on their productivity, and sought to find a reflection of their perception in directly measurable user data. We find that the rate with which shown suggestions are accepted, rather than more specific metrics regarding the persistence of completions in the code over time, drives developers' perception of productivity.

    "title": "A Self-aware Personal Assistant for Making Personalized Privacy  Decisions",
    "abstract": "Many software systems, such as online social networks enable users to share information about themselves. While the action of sharing is simple, it requires an elaborate thought process on privacy: what to share, with whom to share, and for what purposes. Thinking about these for each piece of content to be shared is tedious. Recent approaches to tackle this problem build personal assistants that can help users by learning what is private over time and recommending privacy labels such as private or public to individual content that a user considers sharing. However, privacy is inherently ambiguous and highly personal. Existing approaches to recommend privacy decisions do not address these aspects of privacy sufficiently. Ideally, a personal assistant should be able to adjust its recommendation based on a given user, considering that user's privacy understanding. Moreover, the personal assistant should be able to assess when its recommendation would be uncertain and let the user make the decision on her own. Accordingly, this paper proposes a personal assistant that uses evidential deep learning to classify content based on its privacy label. An important characteristic of the personal assistant is that it can model its uncertainty in its decisions explicitly, determine that it does not know the answer, and delegate from making a recommendation when its uncertainty is high. By factoring in the user's own understanding of privacy, such as risk factors or own labels, the personal assistant can personalize its recommendations per user. We evaluate our proposed personal assistant using a well-known data set. Our results show that our personal assistant can accurately identify uncertain cases, personalize them to its user's needs, and thus helps users preserve their privacy well. ",

In this paper, we aim to systematically and scientifically study this bias from both data and algorithm aspects. First, using the dermatologist approved Fitzpatrick Skin Type classification system and Individual Typology Angle, we contribute a benchmark called Identity Shades (IDS) database, which effectively quantifies the degree of the bias with respect to skin tone in existing face recognition algorithms and commercial APIs. Further, we provide two skin-tone aware training datasets, called BUPT-Globalface dataset and BUPT-Balancedface dataset, to remove bias in training data. Finally, to mitigate the algorithmic bias, we propose a novel meta-learning algorithm, called Meta Balanced Network (MBN), which learns adaptive margins in large margin loss such that the model optimized by this loss can perform fairly across people with different skin tones. To determine the margins, our method optimizes a meta skewness loss on a clean and unbiased meta set and utilizes backward-on-backward automatic differentiation to perform a second order gradient descent step on the current margins. Extensive experiments show that MBN successfully mitigates bias and learns more balanced performance for people with different skin tones in face recognition.

However, real-world scanned oracle data are rare and few experts are available for annotation which make the automatic recognition of scanned oracle characters become a challenging task. Therefore, we aim to explore unsupervised domain adaptation to transfer knowledge from handprinted oracle data, which are easy to acquire, to scanned domain. We propose a structure-texture separation network (STSN), which is an end-to-end learning framework for joint disentanglement, transformation, adaptation and recognition. First, STSN disentangles features into structure (glyph) and texture (noise) components by generative models, and then aligns handprinted and scanned data in structure feature space such that the negative influence caused by serious noises can be avoided when adapting. Second, transformation is achieved via swapping the learned textures across domains and a classifier for final classification is trained to predict the labels of the transformed scanned characters. This not only guarantees the absolute separation, but also enhances the discriminative ability of the learned features. Extensive experiments on Oracle-241 dataset show that STSN outperforms other adaptation methods and successfully improves recognition performance on scanned data even when they are contaminated by long burial and careless excavation.

    "abstract": "Knowledge graph embedding research has mainly focused on learning continuous representations of entities and relations tailored towards the link prediction problem. Recent results indicate an ever increasing predictive ability of current approaches on benchmark datasets. However, this effectiveness often comes with the cost of over-parameterization and increased computationally complexity. The former induces extensive hyperparameter optimization to mitigate malicious overfitting. The latter magnifies the importance of winning the hardware lottery. Here, we investigate a remedy for the first problem. We propose a technique based on Kronecker decomposition to reduce the number of parameters in a knowledge graph embedding model, while retaining its expressiveness. Through Kronecker decomposition, large embedding matrices are split into smaller embedding matrices during the training process. Hence, embeddings of knowledge graphs are not plainly retrieved but reconstructed on the fly. The decomposition ensures that elementwise interactions between three embedding vectors are extended with interactions within each embedding vector. This implicitly reduces redundancy in embedding vectors and encourages feature reuse. To quantify the impact of applying Kronecker decomposition on embedding matrices, we conduct a series of experiments on benchmark datasets. Our experiments suggest that applying Kronecker decomposition on embedding matrices leads to an improved parameter efficiency on all benchmark datasets. Moreover, empirical evidence suggests that reconstructed embeddings entail robustness against noise in the input knowledge graph. To foster reproducible research, we provide an open-source implementation of our approach, including training and evaluation scripts as well as pre-trained models in our knowledge graph embedding framework (https://github.com/dice-group/dice-embeddings).

In real-world applications such as medical diagnosis and industrial defect detection, anomalies only present in a fraction of the images. To extend the reconstruction-based anomaly detection architecture to the localized anomalies, we propose a self-supervised learning approach through random masking and then restoring, named Self-Supervised Masking (SSM) for unsupervised anomaly detection and localization. SSM not only enhances the training of the inpainting network but also leads to great improvement in the efficiency of mask prediction at inference. Through random masking, each image is augmented into a diverse set of training triplets, thus enabling the autoencoder to learn to reconstruct with masks of various sizes and shapes during training. To improve the efficiency and effectiveness of anomaly detection and localization at inference, we propose a novel progressive mask refinement approach that progressively uncovers the normal regions and finally locates the anomalous regions. The proposed SSM method outperforms several state-of-the-arts for both anomaly detection and anomaly localization, achieving 98.3% AUC on Retinal-OCT and 93.9% AUC on MVTec AD, respectively. ",

Pooling will also be studied. As a result, we prove that the sufficient condition established in arXiv:2107.12530, 2109.13542 is still sufficient for the leaky ReLU networks.

It is of mathematical interest and practical meaning to understand the convergence of deep ResNets. We aim at characterizing the convergence of deep ResNets as the depth tends to infinity in terms of the parameters of the networks. Toward this purpose, we first give a matrix-vector description of general deep neural networks with shortcut connections and formulate an explicit expression for the networks by using the notions of activation domains and activation matrices. The convergence is then reduced to the convergence of two series involving infinite products of non-square matrices. By studying the two series, we establish a sufficient condition for pointwise convergence of ResNets. Our result is able to give justification for the design of ResNets.

    "abstract": "Existing approaches on Question Answering over Knowledge Graphs (KGQA) have weak generalizability. That is often due to the standard i.i.d. assumption on the underlying dataset. Recently, three levels of generalization for KGQA were defined, namely i.i.d., compositional, zero-shot. We analyze 25 well-known KGQA datasets for 5 different Knowledge Graphs (KGs). We show that according to this definition many existing and online available KGQA datasets are either not suited to train a generalizable KGQA system or that the datasets are based on discontinued and out-dated KGs. Generating new datasets is a costly process and, thus, is not an alternative to smaller research groups and companies. In this work, we propose a mitigation method for re-splitting available KGQA datasets to enable their applicability to evaluate generalization, without any cost and manual effort. We test our hypothesis on three KGQA datasets, i.e., LC-QuAD, LC-QuAD 2.0 and QALD-9). Experiments on re-splitted KGQA datasets demonstrate its effectiveness towards generalizability.

Although the classic numerical integration method, \\textit{i.e.} time-domain simulation (TDS), has been widely used in industry practice, it is inevitably trapped in a high computational complexity due to the high latitude sophistication of the power system. In this work, a data-driven power system estimation method is proposed to quickly predict the stability of the power system before TDS reaches the end of simulating time windows, which can reduce the average simulation time of stability assessment without loss of accuracy. As the topology of the power system is in the form of graph structure, graph neural network based representation learning is naturally suitable for learning the status of the power system. Motivated by observing the distribution information of crucial active power and reactive power on the power system's bus nodes, we thus propose a distribution-aware learning~(DAL) module to explore an informative graph representation vector for describing the status of a power system. Then, TSA is re-defined as a binary classification task, and the stability of the system is determined directly from the resulting graph representation without numerical integration. Finally, we apply our method to the online TSA task. The case studies on the IEEE 39-bus system and Polish 2383-bus system demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method. ",

To tackle this issue, we propose an auxiliary gloss regularizer module to BERT pre-training (GR-BERT), to enhance word semantic similarity. By predicting masked words and aligning contextual embeddings to corresponding glosses simultaneously, the word similarity can be explicitly modeled. We design two architectures for GR-BERT and evaluate our model in downstream tasks. Experimental results show that the gloss regularizer benefits BERT in word-level and sentence-level semantic representation. The GR-BERT achieves new state-of-the-art in lexical substitution task and greatly promotes BERT sentence representation in both unsupervised and supervised STS tasks. ",

The chosen set is typically determined by separately trained alignment model parameters, independent of the source-sentence context at inference time. While vocabulary selection appears competitive with respect to automatic quality metrics in prior work, we show that it can fail to select the right set of output words, particularly for semantically non-compositional linguistic phenomena such as idiomatic expressions, leading to reduced translation quality as perceived by humans. Trading off latency for quality by increasing the size of the allowed set is often not an option in real-world scenarios. We propose a model of vocabulary selection, integrated into the neural translation model, that predicts the set of allowed output words from contextualized encoder representations. This restores translation quality of an unconstrained system, as measured by human evaluations on WMT newstest2020 and idiomatic expressions, at an inference latency competitive with alignment-based selection using aggressive thresholds, thereby removing the dependency on separately trained alignment models.

However, due to their high mobility, vehicles may drive out of the coverage of RSUs before receiving the task processing results. In this paper, we propose a mobile edge computing-assisted vehicular network, where vehicles can offload their tasks to a nearby vehicle via a vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) link or a nearby RSU via a vehicle-to-infrastructure link. These tasks are also migrated by a V2V link or an infrastructure-to-infrastructure (I2I) link to avoid the scenario where the vehicles cannot receive the processed task from the RSUs. Considering mutual interference from the same link of offloading tasks and migrating tasks, we construct a vehicle offloading decision-based game to minimize the computation overhead. We prove that the game can always achieve Nash equilibrium and convergence by exploiting the finite improvement property. We then propose a task migration (TM) algorithm that includes three task-processing methods and two task-migration methods. Based on the TM algorithm, computation overhead minimization offloading (COMO) algorithm is presented. Extensive simulation results show that the proposed TM and COMO algorithms reduce the computation overhead and increase the success rate of task processing. ",

However, this involves the risk of accessing and potentially disclosing sensitive information of individuals to the apps that may lead to privacy breaches. In this paper, we aim to minimize privacy leakages that may lead to user identification on mobile devices through user tracking and distinguishability while preserving the functionality of apps and services. We propose a privacy-preserving mechanism that effectively handles the sensor data fluctuations (e.g., inconsistent sensor readings while walking, sitting, and running at different times) by formulating the data as time-series modeling and forecasting. The proposed mechanism also uses the notion of correlated noise-series against noise filtering attacks from an adversary, which aims to filter out the noise from the perturbed data to re-identify the original data. Unlike existing solutions, our mechanism keeps running in isolation without the interaction of a user or a service provider. We perform rigorous experiments on benchmark datasets and show that our proposed mechanism limits user tracking and distinguishability threats to a significant extent compared to the original data while maintaining a reasonable level of utility of functionalities. In general, we show that our obfuscation mechanism reduces the user trackability threat by 60\\% across all the datasets while maintaining the utility loss below 0.5 Mean Absolute Error (MAE). We also observe that our mechanism is more effective in large datasets. For example, with the Swipes dataset, the distinguishability risk is reduced by 60\\% on average while the utility loss is below 0.5 MAE. ",

In this work, the heat flux is firstly decomposed into two components along the two eigenvectors of the diffusion tensor, thus the anisotropic heat flux approximation is converted into the approximation of two isotropic components. Moreover, to handle the possible jump of the diffusion tensor across the interface, the weighted first-order formulation is obtained by multiplying this first-order formulation by a weighted function. By the decaying property of the weighted function, the weighted first-order formulation is always well-defined in the pointwise way. Finally, the weighted first-order formulation is solved with deep neural network approximation. Compared to the neural network approximation with the original second-order elliptic formulation, the proposed method can significantly improve the accuracy, especially for the discontinuous anisotropic diffusion problems.

    "title": "FLAD: Adaptive Federated Learning for DDoS Attack Detection",
    "abstract": "Federated Learning (FL) has been recently receiving increasing consideration from the cybersecurity community as a way to collaboratively train deep learning models with distributed profiles of cyberthreats, with no disclosure of training data. Nevertheless, the adoption of FL in cybersecurity is still in its infancy, and a range of practical aspects have not been properly addressed yet. Indeed, the Federated Averaging algorithm at the core of the FL concept requires the availability of test data to control the FL process. Although this might be feasible in some domains, test network traffic of newly discovered attacks cannot be always shared without disclosing sensitive information. In this paper, we address the convergence of the FL process in dynamic cybersecurity scenarios, where the trained model must be frequently updated with new recent attack profiles to empower all members of the federation with latest detection features. To this aim, we propose FLAD (adaptive Federated Learning Approach to DDoS attack detection), a FL solution for cybersecurity applications based on an adaptive mechanism that orchestrates the FL process by dynamically assigning more computation to those members whose attacks profiles are harder to learn, without the need of sharing any test data to monitor the performance of the trained model. Using a recent dataset of DDoS attacks, we demonstrate that FLAD outperforms the original FL algorithm in terms of convergence time and accuracy across a range of unbalanced datasets of heterogeneous DDoS attacks. We also show the robustness of our approach in a realistic scenario, where we retrain the deep learning model multiple times to introduce the profiles of new attacks on a pre-trained model. ",

    "abstract": "In the course of under a year, the European Commission has launched some of the most important regulatory proposals to date on platform governance. The Commission's goals behind cross-sectoral regulation of this sort include the protection of markets and democracies alike. While all these acts propose sophisticated rules for setting up new enforcement institutions and procedures, one aspect remains highly unclear: how digital enforcement will actually take place in practice. Focusing on the Digital Services Act (DSA), this discussion paper critically addresses issues around social media data access for the purpose of digital enforcement and proposes the use of a legal compliance application programming interface (API) as a means to facilitate compliance with the DSA and complementary European and national regulation. To contextualize this discussion, the paper pursues two scenarios that exemplify the harms arising out of content monetization affecting a particularly vulnerable category of social media users: children. The two scenarios are used to further reflect upon essential issues surrounding data access and legal compliance with the DSA and further applicable legal standards in the field of labour and consumer law.

    "abstract": "Classical multiple instance learning (MIL) methods are often based on the identical and independent distributed assumption between instances, hence neglecting the potentially rich contextual information beyond individual entities. On the other hand, Transformers with global self-attention modules have been proposed to model the interdependencies among all instances. However, in this paper we question: Is global relation modeling using self-attention necessary, or can we appropriately restrict self-attention calculations to local regimes in large-scale whole slide images (WSIs)? We propose a general-purpose local attention graph-based Transformer for MIL (LA-MIL), introducing an inductive bias by explicitly contextualizing instances in adaptive local regimes of arbitrary size. Additionally, an efficiently adapted loss function enables our approach to learn expressive WSI embeddings for the joint analysis of multiple biomarkers. We demonstrate that LA-MIL achieves state-of-the-art results in mutation prediction for gastrointestinal cancer, outperforming existing models on important biomarkers such as microsatellite instability for colorectal cancer. This suggests that local self-attention sufficiently models dependencies on par with global modules. Our implementation will be published. ",

The resulting videos may be used to spread misinformation, reduce trust in media, or as a form of blackmail. These threats necessitate automated methods of deepfake video detection. This paper investigates whether temporal information can improve the deepfake detection performance of deep learning models. To investigate this, we propose a framework that classifies new and existing approaches by their defining characteristics. These are the types of feature extraction: automatic or manual, and the temporal relationship between frames: dependent or independent. We apply this framework to investigate the effect of temporal dependency on a model's deepfake detection performance. We find that temporal dependency produces a statistically significant (p < 0.05) increase in performance in classifying real images for the model using automatic feature selection, demonstrating that spatio-temporal information can increase the performance of deepfake video detection models.

Anomalies are intuitively understood to be something unusual or inconsistent, whose occurrence sparks immediate attention. More formally anomalies are those observations-under appropriate random variable modelling-whose expectation of occurrence with respect to a grouping of prior interest is less than one; such a definition and understanding has been used to develop the parameter-free perception anomaly detection algorithm. The present work seeks to establish important and practical connections between the approach used by the perception algorithm and prior decades of research in neurophysiology and computational neuroscience; particularly that of information processing in the retina and visual cortex. The algorithm is conceptualised as a neuron model which forms the kernel of an unsupervised neural network that learns to signal unexpected observations as anomalies. Both the network and neuron display properties observed in biological processes including: immediate intelligence; parallel processing; redundancy; global degradation; contrast invariance; parameter-free computation, dynamic thresholds and non-linear processing. A robust and accurate model for anomaly detection in univariate and multivariate data is built using this network as a concrete application. ",

Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been at the forefront of the recent advances in this field. One popular CNN-based approach involves the application of generated kernels to the input frames to obtain an interpolated frame. Despite all the benefits interpolation methods offer, many of these networks require a lot of parameters, with more parameters meaning a heavier computational burden. Reducing the size of the model typically impacts performance negatively. This paper presents a method for parameter reduction for a popular flow-less kernel-based network (Adaptive Collaboration of Flows). Through our technique of removing the layers that require the most parameters and replacing them with smaller encoders, we reduce the number of parameters of the network and even achieve better performance compared to the original method. This is achieved by deploying rotation to force each individual encoder to learn different features from the input images. Ablations are conducted to justify design choices and an evaluation on how our method performs on full-length videos is presented. ",

We performed a literature analysis that selected factors that were noted to significantly influence either user perception or task efficiency and propose a set of design considerations and recommendations that address those factors by combining anthropomorphic and non-anthropomorphic virtual gestures based on the motivation of the interaction, visibility of the target and robot, salience of the target, and distance between the target and robot.

    "abstract": "Information-theoretic fitness functions are becoming increasingly popular to produce generally useful, task-independent behaviors. One such universal function, dubbed empowerment, measures the amount of control an agent exerts on its environment via its sensorimotor system. Specifically, empowerment attempts to maximize the mutual information between an agent's actions and its received sensor states at a later point in time. Traditionally, empowerment has been applied to a conventional sensorimotor apparatus, such as a robot. Here, we expand the approach to a distributed, multi-agent sensorimotor system embodied by a neural cellular automaton (NCA). We show that the addition of empowerment as a secondary objective in the evolution of NCA to perform the task of morphogenesis, growing and maintaining a pre-specified shape, results in higher fitness compared to evolving for morphogenesis alone. Results suggest there may be a synergistic relationship between morphogenesis and empowerment. That is, indirectly selecting for coordination between neighboring cells over the duration of development is beneficial to the developmental process itself. Such a finding may have applications in developmental biology by providing potential mechanisms of communication between cells during growth from a single cell to a multicellular, target morphology.

To this end, this paper proposes a holistic framework to help designers partition real-time applications on heterogeneous platforms with hardware accelerators. The proposed model is inspired by a realistic setup of an advanced driving assistance system presented in the WATERS 2019 Challenge by Bosch, further generalized to encompass a broader range of heterogeneous architectures. The resulting analysis is linearized and used to encode an optimization problem that jointly (i) guarantees timing constraints, (ii) finds a suitable task-to-core mapping, (iii) assigns a priority to each task, and (iv) selects which computations to accelerate, seeking for the most convenient trade-off between the smaller worst-case execution time provided by accelerators and synchronization and queuing delays.

In this paper, we present a technique to automatically quantify the relative importance of different root causes of call graph unsoundness for a set of target applications. The technique works by identifying the dynamic function data flows relevant to each call edge missed by the static analysis, correctly handling cases with multiple root causes and inter-dependent calls. We apply our approach to perform a detailed study of the recall of a state-of-the-art call graph construction technique on a set of framework-based web applications. The study yielded a number of useful insights. We found that while dynamic property accesses were the most common root cause of missed edges across the benchmarks, other root causes varied in importance depending on the benchmark, potentially useful information for an analysis designer. Further, with our approach, we could quickly identify and fix a recall issue in the call graph builder we studied, and also quickly assess whether a recent analysis technique for Node.js-based applications would be helpful for browser-based code.

To avoid data loss due to device failures, an $[n,k]$ erasure code is used to encode $k$ data symbols into a codeword of $n$ symbols that are stored across different devices. However, device failure rates change throughout the life of the data, and tuning $n$ and $k$ according to these changes has been shown to save significant storage space. Code conversion is the process of converting multiple codewords of an initial $[n^I,k^I]$ code into codewords of a final $[n^F,k^F]$ code that decode to the same set of data symbols. In this paper, we study conversion bandwidth, defined as the total amount of data transferred between nodes during conversion. In particular, we consider the case where the initial and final codes are MDS and a single initial codeword is split into several final codewords ($k^I=\\lambda^F k^F$ for integer $\\lambda^F \\geq 2$), called the split regime. We derive lower bounds on the conversion bandwidth in the split regime and propose constructions that significantly reduce conversion bandwidth and are optimal for certain parameters. ",

Most other works using reinforcement learning to control or schedule transmissions use some centralized control mechanism, whereas our approach is fully distributed. Each transmitter node is an independent reinforcement learning agent and does not have direct knowledge of the actions taken by other agents. We consider the case where only a subset of agents can successfully transmit at a time, so each agent must learn to act cooperatively with other agents. An agent may decide to transmit a certain number of steps into the future, but this decision is not communicated to the other agents, so it the task of the individual agents to attempt to transmit at appropriate times. We achieve this collaborative behavior through studying the effects of different actions spaces. We are agnostic to the physical layer, which makes our approach applicable to many types of networks. We submit that approaches similar to ours may be useful in other domains that use multi-agent reinforcement learning with independent agents. ",

    "abstract": "Symbolic Regression searches for a function form that approximates a dataset often using Genetic Programming. Since there is usually no restriction to what form the function can have, Genetic Programming may return a hard to understand model due to non-linear function chaining or long expressions. A novel representation called Interaction-Transformation was recently proposed to alleviate this problem. In this representation, the function form is restricted to an affine combination of terms generated as the application of a single univariate function to the interaction of selected variables. This representation obtained competing solutions on standard benchmarks. Despite the initial success, a broader set of benchmarking functions revealed the limitations of the constrained representation. In this paper we propose an extension to this representation, called Transformation-Interaction-Rational representation that defines a new function form as the rational of two Interaction-Transformation functions. Additionally, the target variable can also be transformed with an univariate function. The main goal is to improve the approximation power while still constraining the overall complexity of the expression. We tested this representation with a standard Genetic Programming with crossover and mutation. The results show a great improvement when compared to its predecessor and a state-of-the-art performance for a large benchmark. ",

    "title": "Nearly Optimal Algorithms for Linear Contextual Bandits with Adversarial  Corruptions",
    "abstract": "We study the linear contextual bandit problem in the presence of adversarial corruption, where the reward at each round is corrupted by an adversary, and the corruption level (i.e., the sum of corruption magnitudes over the horizon) is $C\\geq 0$. The best-known algorithms in this setting are limited in that they either are computationally inefficient or require a strong assumption on the corruption, or their regret is at least $C$ times worse than the regret without corruption. In this paper, to overcome these limitations, we propose a new algorithm based on the principle of optimism in the face of uncertainty. At the core of our algorithm is a weighted ridge regression where the weight of each chosen action depends on its confidence up to some threshold. We show that for both known $C$ and unknown $C$ cases, our algorithm with proper choice of hyperparameter achieves a regret that nearly matches the lower bounds. Thus, our algorithm is nearly optimal up to logarithmic factors for both cases. Notably, our algorithm achieves the near-optimal regret for both corrupted and uncorrupted cases ($C=0$) simultaneously. ",

    "abstract": "Can a micron sized sack of interacting molecules understand, and adapt to a constantly-fluctuating environment? Cellular life provides an existence proof in the affirmative, but the principles that allow for life's existence are far from being proven. One challenge in engineering and understanding biochemical computation is the intrinsic noise due to chemical fluctuations. In this paper, we draw insights from machine learning theory, chemical reaction network theory, and statistical physics to show that the broad and biologically relevant class of detailed balanced chemical reaction networks is capable of representing and conditioning complex distributions. These results illustrate how a biochemical computer can use intrinsic chemical noise to perform complex computations. Furthermore, we use our explicit physical model to derive thermodynamic costs of inference. ",

    "title": "Personalized Adversarial Data Augmentation for Dysarthric and Elderly  Speech Recognition",
    "abstract": "Despite the rapid progress of automatic speech recognition (ASR) technologies targeting normal speech, accurate recognition of dysarthric and elderly speech remains highly challenging tasks to date. It is difficult to collect large quantities of such data for ASR system development due to the mobility issues often found among these users. To this end, data augmentation techniques play a vital role. In contrast to existing data augmentation techniques only modifying the speaking rate or overall shape of spectral contour, fine-grained spectro-temporal differences between dysarthric, elderly and normal speech are modelled using a novel set of speaker dependent (SD) generative adversarial networks (GAN) based data augmentation approaches in this paper. These flexibly allow both: a) temporal or speed perturbed normal speech spectra to be modified and closer to those of an impaired speaker when parallel speech data is available; and b) for non-parallel data, the SVD decomposed normal speech spectral basis features to be transformed into those of a target elderly speaker before being re-composed with the temporal bases to produce the augmented data for state-of-the-art TDNN and Conformer ASR system training. Experiments are conducted on four tasks: the English UASpeech and TORGO dysarthric speech corpora; the English DementiaBank Pitt and Cantonese JCCOCC MoCA elderly speech datasets. The proposed GAN based data augmentation approaches consistently outperform the baseline speed perturbation method by up to 0.91% and 3.0% absolute (9.61% and 6.4% relative) WER reduction on the TORGO and DementiaBank data respectively. Consistent performance improvements are retained after applying LHUC based speaker adaptation. ",

    "abstract": "Diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) is an important tool in characterizing tissue microstructure based on biophysical models, which are complex and highly non-linear. Resolving microstructures with optimization techniques is prone to estimation errors and requires dense sampling in the q-space. Deep learning based approaches have been proposed to overcome these limitations. Motivated by the superior performance of the Transformer, in this work, we present a learning-based framework based on Transformer, namely, a Microstructure Estimation Transformer with Sparse Coding (METSC) for dMRI-based microstructure estimation with downsampled q-space data. To take advantage of the Transformer while addressing its limitation in large training data requirements, we explicitly introduce an inductive bias - model bias into the Transformer using a sparse coding technique to facilitate the training process. Thus, the METSC is composed with three stages, an embedding stage, a sparse representation stage, and a mapping stage. The embedding stage is a Transformer-based structure that encodes the signal to ensure the voxel is represented effectively. In the sparse representation stage, a dictionary is constructed by solving a sparse reconstruction problem that unfolds the Iterative Hard Thresholding (IHT) process. The mapping stage is essentially a decoder that computes the microstructural parameters from the output of the second stage, based on the weighted sum of normalized dictionary coefficients where the weights are also learned. We tested our framework on two dMRI models with downsampled q-space data, including the intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM) model and the neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging (NODDI) model. The proposed method achieved up to 11.25 folds of acceleration in scan time and outperformed the other state-of-the-art learning-based methods. ",

    "abstract": "Recent work in mathematical neuroscience has calculated the directed graph homology of the directed simplicial complex given by the brains sparse adjacency graph, the so called connectome. These biological connectomes show an abundance of both high-dimensional directed simplices and Betti-numbers in all viable dimensions - in contrast to Erd\\H{o}s-R\\'enyi-graphs of comparable size and density. An analysis of synthetically trained connectomes reveals similar findings, raising questions about the graphs comparability and the nature of origin of the simplices. We present a new method capable of delivering insight into the emergence of simplices and thus simplicial abundance. Our approach allows to easily distinguish simplex-rich connectomes of different origin. The method relies on the novel concept of an almost-d-simplex, that is, a simplex missing exactly one edge, and consequently the almost-d-simplex closing probability by dimension. We also describe a fast algorithm to identify almost-d-simplices in a given graph. Applying this method to biological and artificial data allows us to identify a mechanism responsible for simplex emergence, and suggests this mechanism is responsible for the simplex signature of the excitatory subnetwork of a statistical reconstruction of the mouse primary visual cortex. Our highly optimised code for this new method is publicly available. ",

By representing model comparison games semantically as comonads, they allow important logical and combinatorial properties to be exressed in terms of their Eilenberg-Moore coalgebras. As a result, a number of results from finite model theory, such as preservation theorems and homomorphism counting theorems, have been formalised and parameterised by comonads, giving rise to new results simply by varying the comonad. In this paper we study the limits of the comonadic approach in the combinatorial and homomorphism-counting aspect of the theory, regardless of whether any model comparison games are involved. We show that any standard graph parameter has a corresponding comonad, classifying the same class. This comonad is constructed via a simple Kan extension formula, making it the initial solution to this problem and, furthermore, automatically admitting a homomorphism-counting theorem. ",

While proponents of a well-functioning market predictors believe that it is difficult to accurately predict market prices but many scholars disagree. Robust and accurate prediction systems will not only be helpful to the businesses but also to the individuals in making their financial investments. This paper presents an LSTM model with two different input approaches for predicting the short-term stock prices of two Indian companies, Reliance Industries and Infosys Ltd. Ten years of historic data (2012-2021) is taken from the yahoo finance website to carry out analysis of proposed approaches. In the first approach, closing prices of two selected companies are directly applied on univariate LSTM model. For the approach second, technical indicators values are calculated from the closing prices and then collectively applied on Multivariate LSTM model. Short term market behaviour for upcoming days is evaluated. Experimental outcomes revel that approach one is useful to determine the future trend but multivariate LSTM model with technical indicators found to be useful in accurately predicting the future price behaviours.

Currently, classification consists of supervised machine learning algorithms whose performance is limited by the number of existing annotations of astronomical objects and their highly imbalanced class distributions. In this work, we propose a data augmentation methodology based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to generate a variety of synthetic light curves from variable stars. Our novel contributions, consisting of a resampling technique and an evaluation metric, can assess the quality of generative models in unbalanced datasets and identify GAN-overfitting cases that the Fr\\'echet Inception Distance does not reveal. We applied our proposed model to two datasets taken from the Catalina and Zwicky Transient Facility surveys. The classification accuracy of variable stars is improved significantly when training with synthetic data and testing with real data with respect to the case of using only real data. ",

    "title": "Multiple Domain Causal Networks",
    "abstract": "Observational studies are regarded as economic alternatives to randomized trials, often used in their stead to investigate and determine treatment efficacy. Due to lack of sample size, observational studies commonly combine data from multiple sources or different sites/centers. Despite the benefits of an increased sample size, a naive combination of multicenter data may result in incongruities stemming from center-specific protocols for generating cohorts or reactions towards treatments distinct to a given center, among other things. These issues arise in a variety of other contexts, including capturing a treatment effect related to an individual's unique biological characteristics. Existing methods for estimating heterogeneous treatment effects have not adequately addressed the multicenter context, but rather treat it simply as a means to obtain sufficient sample size. Additionally, previous approaches to estimating treatment effects do not straightforwardly generalize to the multicenter design, especially when required to provide treatment insights for patients from a new, unobserved center. To address these shortcomings, we propose Multiple Domain Causal Networks (MDCN), an approach that simultaneously strengthens the information sharing between similar centers while addressing the selection bias in treatment assignment through learning of a new feature embedding. In empirical evaluations, MDCN is consistently more accurate when estimating the heterogeneous treatment effect in new centers compared to benchmarks that adjust solely based on treatment imbalance or general center differences. Finally, we justify our approach by providing theoretical analyses that demonstrate that MDCN improves on the generalization bound of the new, unobserved target center. ",
