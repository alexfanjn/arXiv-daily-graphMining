    "title": "Computing Traffic Accident High-Risk Locations Using Graph Analytics",
    "abstract": "Analysis of the dynamic relationship between traffic accident events and road network topology based on connectivity and graph analytics offers a new approach to identifying, ranking and profiling traffic accident high risk-locations at different levels of space and time granularities. Previous studies on traffic accident hot spots have mostly adopted spatial statistics and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) where spatial point patterns are discovered based only on spatial dependence with no recognition of the temporal dependence of the events. A limitation arises from the fact that the results are either under or over-estimated because of the temporal aggregation of the events to an absolute time point. Furthermore, the existing methods apart from the Network Kernel Density Estimation (NETKDE), consider traffic accident events as events randomly on a 2-D geographic space. However, traffic accident events are network constrained events that happens majorly on the road network space. Therefore, in this paper, we adopt the connectivity of graph on a network space approach that identifies accident high risk-locations based on space-time-varying connectivity between traffic accident events and the road network geometry. A simple but extensible traffic accident space time-varying graph (STVG) model is developed and implemented for this study. Traffic accident high risk-locations are identified and ranked in space and time using time-dependent degree centrality and PageRank centrality graph metrics respectively through time-incremental graph queries. This study offers urban traffic accident analysts with a new and efficient approach to identify, rank and profile accident-prone areas in space and time at different scales. ",

    "abstract": "Automated disease detection in medical images using deep learning holds promise to improve the diagnostic ability of radiologists, but routinely collected clinical data frequently contains technical and demographic confounding factors that differ between hospitals, negatively affecting the robustness of diagnostic deep learning models. Thus, there is a critical need for deep learning models that can train on imbalanced datasets without overfitting to site-specific confounding factors. In this work, we developed a novel deep learning architecture, MUCRAN (Multi-Confound Regression Adversarial Network), to train a deep learning model on highly heterogeneous clinical data while regressing demographic and technical confounding factors. We trained MUCRAN using 16,821 clinical T1 Axial brain MRIs collected from Massachusetts General Hospital before 2019 and tested it using post-2019 data to distinguish Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients, identified using both prescriptions of AD drugs and ICD codes, from a non-medicated control group. In external validation tests using MRI data from other hospitals, the model showed a robust performance of over 90% accuracy on newly collected data. This work shows the feasibility of deep learning-based diagnosis in real-world clinical data. ",

    "abstract": "The success of deep learning depends heavily on the availability of large datasets, but in robotic manipulation there are many learning problems for which such datasets do not exist. Collecting these datasets is time-consuming and expensive, and therefore learning from small datasets is an important open problem. Within computer vision, a common approach to a lack of data is data augmentation. Data augmentation is the process of creating additional training examples by modifying existing ones. However, because the types of tasks and data differ, the methods used in computer vision cannot be easily adapted to manipulation. Therefore, we propose a data augmentation method for robotic manipulation. We argue that augmentations should be valid, relevant, and diverse. We use these principles to formalize augmentation as an optimization problem, with the objective function derived from physics and knowledge of the manipulation domain. This method applies rigid body transformations to trajectories of geometric state and action data. We test our method in two scenarios: 1) learning the dynamics of planar pushing of rigid cylinders, and 2) learning a constraint checker for rope manipulation. These two scenarios have different data and label types, yet in both scenarios, training on our augmented data significantly improves performance on downstream tasks. We also show how our augmentation method can be used on real-robot data to enable more data-efficient online learning. ",

Phishing websites are those that are made with a similar user interface and a near similar address to trustworthy websites in order to persuade users to input their private data for potential future misuse by attackers. Detecting phishing websites with intelligent systems is an important goal to protect users, companies, and other online services that use the HTTP protocol. An intelligent model needs to distinguish features that are important as input to predict phishing sites. In this research, using correlation-based networks, we provide a novel network-based method to find features that are more important in phishing detection. The networks are trained and tested on an established phishing dataset. Three different networks are made by partitioning the dataset by its data instance labels. The important features are found by discovering the hubs of these networks, and the results are presented and analysed. This is the first time using a network-based approach for feature selection which is a fast and accurate way to do so. ",

    "abstract": "Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) leverage neural-networks to find the solutions of partial differential equation (PDE)-constrained optimization problems with initial conditions and boundary conditions as soft constraints. These soft constraints are often considered to be the sources of the complexity in the training phase of PINNs. Here, we demonstrate that the challenge of training (i) persists even when the boundary conditions are strictly enforced, and (ii) is closely related to the Kolmogorov n-width associated with problems demonstrating transport, convection, traveling waves, or moving fronts. Given this realization, we describe the mechanism underlying the training schemes such as those used in eXtended PINNs (XPINN), curriculum regularization, and sequence-to-sequence learning. For an important category of PDEs, i.e., governed by non-linear convection-diffusion equation, we propose reformulating PINNs on a Lagrangian frame of reference, i.e., LPINNs, as a PDE-informed solution. A parallel architecture with two branches is proposed. One branch solves for the state variables on the characteristics, and the second branch solves for the low-dimensional characteristics curves. The proposed architecture conforms to the causality innate to the convection, and leverages the direction of travel of the information in the domain. Finally, we demonstrate that the loss landscapes of LPINNs are less sensitive to the so-called \"complexity\" of the problems, compared to those in the traditional PINNs in the Eulerian framework. ",

    "abstract": "This paper introduces a framework designed to accurately predict piecewise linear mappings of arbitrary meshes via a neural network, enabling training and evaluating over heterogeneous collections of meshes that do not share a triangulation, as well as producing highly detail-preserving maps whose accuracy exceeds current state of the art. The framework is based on reducing the neural aspect to a prediction of a matrix for a single given point, conditioned on a global shape descriptor. The field of matrices is then projected onto the tangent bundle of the given mesh, and used as candidate jacobians for the predicted map. The map is computed by a standard Poisson solve, implemented as a differentiable layer with cached pre-factorization for efficient training. This construction is agnostic to the triangulation of the input, thereby enabling applications on datasets with varying triangulations. At the same time, by operating in the intrinsic gradient domain of each individual mesh, it allows the framework to predict highly-accurate mappings. We validate these properties by conducting experiments over a broad range of scenarios, from semantic ones such as morphing, registration, and deformation transfer, to optimization-based ones, such as emulating elastic deformations and contact correction, as well as being the first work, to our knowledge, to tackle the task of learning to compute UV parameterizations of arbitrary meshes. The results exhibit the high accuracy of the method as well as its versatility, as it is readily applied to the above scenarios without any changes to the framework. ",

    "abstract": "Modeling and manipulating elasto-plastic objects are essential capabilities for robots to perform complex industrial and household interaction tasks (e.g., stuffing dumplings, rolling sushi, and making pottery). However, due to the high degree of freedom of elasto-plastic objects, significant challenges exist in virtually every aspect of the robotic manipulation pipeline, e.g., representing the states, modeling the dynamics, and synthesizing the control signals. We propose to tackle these challenges by employing a particle-based representation for elasto-plastic objects in a model-based planning framework. Our system, RoboCraft, only assumes access to raw RGBD visual observations. It transforms the sensing data into particles and learns a particle-based dynamics model using graph neural networks (GNNs) to capture the structure of the underlying system. The learned model can then be coupled with model-predictive control (MPC) algorithms to plan the robot's behavior. We show through experiments that with just 10 minutes of real-world robotic interaction data, our robot can learn a dynamics model that can be used to synthesize control signals to deform elasto-plastic objects into various target shapes, including shapes that the robot has never encountered before. We perform systematic evaluations in both simulation and the real world to demonstrate the robot's manipulation capabilities and ability to generalize to a more complex action space, different tool shapes, and a mixture of motion modes. We also conduct comparisons between RoboCraft and untrained human subjects controlling the gripper to manipulate deformable objects in both simulation and the real world. Our learned model-based planning framework is comparable to and sometimes better than human subjects on the tested tasks. ",

Experiments with the introduced architectures (RecHePIMs) were applied to the NP-hard problem of sorting permutations by reversals, using four different BAs, namely, simple Genetic Algorithm, Double-point crossover Genetic Algorithm, Differential Evolution, and self-adjusting Particle Swarm Optimization.

Besides, rationally understanding the evolution of the physical world is inherently linked with the idea of causality. It follows that decision making applications based on automated planning, especially if they integrate references to ethical norms, have inevitably to deal with causality. Despite these considerations, much of the work in computational ethics relegates causality to the background, if not ignores it completely. This paper contribution is double. The first one is to link up two research topics$\\unicode{x2014}$automated planning and causality$\\unicode{x2014}$by proposing an actual causation definition suitable for action languages. This definition is a formalisation of Wright's NESS test of causation. The second is to link up computational ethics and causality by showing the importance of causality in the simulation of ethical reasoning and by enabling the domain to deal with situations that were previously out of reach thanks to the actual causation definition proposed.

For the strong formulation, the solution is directly parameterized with a neural network and optimized by minimizing the PDE residual. It can be proved that the convergence of the optimization problem guarantees the convergence of the approximate solution in the $L^1$ sense. The weak formulations are derived following Brenier, Y., 2020, which characterizes the very weak solutions of QPME. Specifically speaking, the solutions are represented with intermediate functions who are parameterized with neural networks and are trained to optimize the weak formulations. Extensive numerical tests are further carried out to investigate the pros and cons of each formulation in low and high dimensions. This is an initial exploration made along the line of solving high-dimensional nonlinear PDEs with neural network based methods, which we hope can provide some useful experience for future investigations.

A known issue of self-supervised depth estimation is that it suffers in low-light/over-exposure conditions and in large homogeneous regions. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel ordinal distillation loss that distills the ordinal information from a large teacher model. Such a teacher model, since having been trained on a large amount of diverse data, can capture the depth ordering information well, but lacks in preserving accurate scene geometry. Combined with self-supervised losses, we show that our model can not only generate reasonable depth maps in challenging environments but also better recover the scene geometry. We further leverage the fisheye cameras of an AR-Glasses device to collect an indoor dataset to facilitate evaluation. ",

    "abstract": "Federated learning (FL) is a promising solution to enable many AI applications, where sensitive datasets from distributed clients are needed for collaboratively training a global model. FL allows the clients to participate in the training phase, governed by a central server, without sharing their local data. One of the main challenges of FL is the communication overhead, where the model updates of the participating clients are sent to the central server at each global training round. Over-the-air computation (AirComp) has been recently proposed to alleviate the communication bottleneck where the model updates are sent simultaneously over the multiple-access channel. However, simple averaging of the model updates via AirComp makes the learning process vulnerable to random or intended modifications of the local model updates of some Byzantine clients. In this paper, we propose a transmission and aggregation framework to reduce the effect of such attacks while preserving the benefits of AirComp for FL. For the proposed robust approach, the central server divides the participating clients randomly into groups and allocates a transmission time slot for each group. The updates of the different groups are then aggregated using a robust aggregation technique. We extend our approach to handle the case of non-i.i.d. local data, where a resampling step is added before robust aggregation. We analyze the convergence of the proposed approach for both cases of i.i.d. and non-i.i.d. data and demonstrate that the proposed algorithm converges at a linear rate to a neighborhood of the optimal solution. Experiments on real datasets are provided to confirm the robustness of the proposed approach. ",

Different from most existing image outpainting works, we approach the above task by understanding and completing image semantics at the scene graph level. In particular, we propose a novel network of Scene Graph Transformer (SGT), which is designed to take node and edge features as inputs for modeling the associated structural information. To better understand and process graph-based inputs, our SGT uniquely performs feature attention at both node and edge levels. While the former views edges as relationship regularization, the latter observes the co-occurrence of nodes for guiding the attention process. We demonstrate that, given a partial input image with its layout and scene graph, our SGT can be applied for scene graph expansion and its conversion to a complete layout. Following state-of-the-art layout-to-image conversions works, the task of image outpainting can be completed with sufficient and practical semantics introduced. Extensive experiments are conducted on the datasets of MS-COCO and Visual Genome, which quantitatively and qualitatively confirm the effectiveness of our proposed SGT and outpainting frameworks. ",

Since there are close connections between point clouds captured from different viewpoints, registration performance can be enhanced if these connections be harnessed properly. Therefore, this paper models the registration problem as multi-task optimization, and proposes a novel bi-channel knowledge sharing mechanism for effective and efficient problem solving. The modeling of multi-view point cloud registration as multi-task optimization are twofold. By simultaneously considering the local accuracy of two point clouds as well as the global consistency posed by all the point clouds involved, a fitness function with an adaptive threshold is derived. Also a framework of the co-evolutionary search process is defined for the concurrent optimization of multiple fitness functions belonging to related tasks. To enhance solution quality and convergence speed, the proposed bi-channel knowledge sharing mechanism plays its role. The intra-task knowledge sharing introduces aiding tasks that are much simpler to solve, and useful information is shared within tasks, accelerating the search process. The inter-task knowledge sharing explores commonalities buried among tasks, aiming to prevent tasks from getting stuck to local optima. Comprehensive experiments conducted on model object as well as scene point clouds show the efficacy of the proposed method. ",

    "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved tremendous success in a variety of real-world applications by relying on the fixed graph data as input. However, the initial input graph might not be optimal in terms of specific downstream tasks, because of information scarcity, noise, adversarial attacks, or discrepancies between the distribution in graph topology, features, and groundtruth labels. In this paper, we propose a bi-level optimization-based approach for learning the optimal graph structure via directly learning the Personalized PageRank propagation matrix as well as the downstream semi-supervised node classification simultaneously. We also explore a low-rank approximation model for further reducing the time complexity. Empirical evaluations show the superior efficacy and robustness of the proposed model over all baseline methods. ",

    "abstract": "Educators are rapidly switching to remote proctoring and examination software for their testing needs, both due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the expanding virtualization of the education sector. State boards are increasingly utilizing these software for high stakes legal and medical licensing exams. Three key concerns arise with the use of these complex software: exam integrity, exam procedural fairness, and exam-taker security and privacy. We conduct the first technical analysis of each of these concerns through a case study of four primary proctoring suites used in U.S. law school and state attorney licensing exams. We reverse engineer these proctoring suites and find that despite promises of high-security, all their anti-cheating measures can be trivially bypassed and can pose significant user security risks. We evaluate current facial recognition classifiers alongside the classifier used by Examplify, the legal exam proctoring suite with the largest market share, to ascertain their accuracy and determine whether faces with certain skin tones are more readily flagged for cheating. Finally, we offer recommendations to improve the integrity and fairness of the remotely proctored exam experience. ",

    "abstract": "We propose the generative adversarial neural operator (GANO), a generative model paradigm for learning probabilities on infinite-dimensional function spaces. The natural sciences and engineering are known to have many types of data that are sampled from infinite-dimensional function spaces, where classical finite-dimensional deep generative adversarial networks (GANs) may not be directly applicable. GANO generalizes the GAN framework and allows for the sampling of functions by learning push-forward operator maps in infinite-dimensional spaces. GANO consists of two main components, a generator neural operator and a discriminator neural functional. The inputs to the generator are samples of functions from a user-specified probability measure, e.g., Gaussian random field (GRF), and the generator outputs are synthetic data functions. The input to the discriminator is either a real or synthetic data function. In this work, we instantiate GANO using the Wasserstein criterion and show how the Wasserstein loss can be computed in infinite-dimensional spaces. We empirically study GANOs in controlled cases where both input and output functions are samples from GRFs and compare its performance to the finite-dimensional counterpart GAN. We empirically study the efficacy of GANO on real-world function data of volcanic activities and show its superior performance over GAN. Furthermore, we find that for the function-based data considered, GANOs are more stable to train than GANs and require less hyperparameter optimization. ",

    "abstract": "It is a challenging research endeavor to infer causal relationships in multivariate observational time-series. Such data may be represented by graphs, where nodes represent time-series, and edges directed causal influence scores between them. If the number of nodes exceeds the number of temporal observations, conventional methods, such as standard Granger causality, are of limited value, because estimating free parameters of time-series predictors lead to underdetermined problems. A typical example for this situation is functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI), where the number of nodal observations is large, usually ranging from $10^2$ to $10^5$ time-series, while the number of temporal observations is low, usually less than $10^3$. Hence, innovative approaches are required to address the challenges arising from such data sets. Recently, we have proposed the large-scale Extended Granger Causality (lsXGC) algorithm, which is based on augmenting a dimensionality-reduced representation of the system's state-space by supplementing data from the conditional source time-series taken from the original input space. Here, we apply lsXGC on synthetic fMRI data with known ground truth and compare its performance to state-of-the-art methods by leveraging the benefits of information-theoretic approaches. Our results suggest that the proposed lsXGC method significantly outperforms existing methods, both in diagnostic accuracy with Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (AUROC = $0.849$ vs.~$[0.727, 0.762]$ for competing methods, $p<\\!10^{-8}$), and computation time ($3.4$ sec vs.~[$9.7$, $4.8 \\times 10^3$] sec for competing methods) benchmarks, demonstrating the potential of lsXGC for analyzing large-scale networks in neuroimaging studies of the human brain.

Despite recent progress in continual classification, the researches of continual object detection are impeded by the diverse sizes and numbers of objects in each image. Different from previous works that tune the whole network for all tasks, in this work, we present a simple and flexible framework for continual object detection via pRotOtypical taSk corrElaTion guided gaTing mechAnism (ROSETTA). Concretely, a unified framework is shared by all tasks while task-aware gates are introduced to automatically select sub-models for specific tasks. In this way, various knowledge can be successively memorized by storing their corresponding sub-model weights in this system. To make ROSETTA automatically determine which experience is available and useful, a prototypical task correlation guided Gating Diversity Controller(GDC) is introduced to adaptively adjust the diversity of gates for the new task based on class-specific prototypes. GDC module computes class-to-class correlation matrix to depict the cross-task correlation, and hereby activates more exclusive gates for the new task if a significant domain gap is observed. Comprehensive experiments on COCO-VOC, KITTI-Kitchen, class-incremental detection on VOC and sequential learning of four tasks show that ROSETTA yields state-of-the-art performance on both task-based and class-based continual object detection.

Generally, fake news on social networks is multi-modal and has various connections with other entities such as users and posts. The heterogeneity in both news content and the relationship with other entities in social networks brings challenges to designing a model that comprehensively captures the local multi-modal semantics of entities in social networks and the global structural representation of the propagation patterns, so as to classify fake news effectively and accurately. In this paper, we propose a novel Transformer-based model: HetTransformer to solve the fake news detection problem on social networks, which utilises the encoder-decoder structure of Transformer to capture the structural information of news propagation patterns. We first capture the local heterogeneous semantics of news, post, and user entities in social networks. Then, we apply Transformer to capture the global structural representation of the propagation patterns in social networks for fake news detection. Experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that our model is able to outperform the state-of-the-art baselines in fake news detection. ",

Deep neural networks are increasingly being used for node classification on graphs, wherein nodes with similar features have to be given the same label. Graph convolutional networks (GCNs) are one such widely studied neural network architecture that perform well on this task. However, powerful link-stealing attacks on GCNs have recently shown that even with black-box access to the trained model, inferring which links (or edges) are present in the training graph is practical. In this paper, we present a new neural network architecture called LPGNet for training on graphs with privacy-sensitive edges. LPGNet provides differential privacy (DP) guarantees for edges using a novel design for how graph edge structure is used during training. We empirically show that LPGNet models often lie in the sweet spot between providing privacy and utility: They can offer better utility than \"trivially\" private architectures which use no edge information (e.g., vanilla MLPs) and better resilience against existing link-stealing attacks than vanilla GCNs which use the full edge structure. LPGNet also offers consistently better privacy-utility tradeoffs than DPGCN, which is the state-of-the-art mechanism for retrofitting differential privacy into conventional GCNs, in most of our evaluated datasets.

Fake news can seriously impact society in many fields including politics, finance, sports, etc. Many studies have been conducted to help detect fake news in English, but research conducted on fake news detection in the Arabic language is scarce. Our contribution is twofold: first, we have constructed a large and diverse Arabic fake news dataset. Second, we have developed and evaluated transformer-based classifiers to identify fake news while utilizing eight state-of-the-art Arabic contextualized embedding models. The majority of these models had not been previously used for Arabic fake news detection. We conduct a thorough analysis of the state-of-the-art Arabic contextualized embedding models as well as comparison with similar fake news detection systems. Experimental results confirm that these state-of-the-art models are robust, with accuracy exceeding 98%. ",

In this article, the arrival curve and service curve of network calculus can well characterize the stochastic nature of wireless channels, the tail behavior of wireless systems and the E2E service curve of network calculus can model the tail characteristic of the delay distribution in UbiI. Specifically, we first propose demands and challenges facing 6G, edge computing (EC), edge deep learning (DL), and UbiI. Then, we propose the hierarchical architecture, the network model, and the service delay model of the UbiI system based on network calculus. In addition, two case studies demonstrate the usefulness and effectiveness of the network calculus approach in analyzing and modeling the latency guarantee for UbiI in 6G.

Fitness is directly measured as maximal oxygen consumption (VO2max), or indirectly assessed using heart rate response to a standard exercise test. However, such testing is costly and burdensome, limiting its utility and scalability. Fitness can also be approximated using resting heart rate and self-reported exercise habits but with lower accuracy. Modern wearables capture dynamic heart rate data which, in combination with machine learning models, could improve fitness prediction. In this work, we analyze movement and heart rate signals from wearable sensors in free-living conditions from 11,059 participants who also underwent a standard exercise test, along with a longitudinal repeat cohort of 2,675 participants. We design algorithms and models that convert raw sensor data into cardio-respiratory fitness estimates, and validate these estimates' ability to capture fitness profiles in a longitudinal cohort over time while subjects engaged in real-world (non-exercise) behaviour. Additionally, we validate our methods with a third external cohort of 181 participants who underwent maximal VO2max testing, which is considered the gold standard measurement because it requires reaching one's maximum heart rate and exhaustion level. Our results show that the developed models yield a high correlation (r = 0.82, 95CI 0.80-0.83), when compared to the ground truth in a holdout sample. These models outperform conventional non-exercise fitness models and traditional bio-markers using measurements of normal daily living without the need for a specific exercise test. Additionally, we show the adaptability and applicability of this approach for detecting fitness change over time in the longitudinal subsample that repeated measurements after 7 years. ",

Our paper aims at utilizing this progress made for English to transfers that knowledge into other languages, which is a non-trivial task due to the domain gap between English and the target languages. We propose a black-box non-intrusive method that utilizes techniques from Domain Adaptation to reduce the domain gap, without requiring any human expertise in the target language, by leveraging low-quality data in both a supervised and unsupervised manner. This allows us to rapidly achieve similar results for stance detection for the Zulu language, the target language in this work, as are found for English.

This paper evaluates the feasibility of differentially private federated learning for chest X-ray classification as a defense against privacy attacks on DenseNet121 and ResNet50 network architectures. We simulated a federated environment by distributing images from the public CheXpert and Mendeley chest X-ray datasets unevenly among 36 clients. Both non-private baseline models achieved an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.94 on the binary classification task of detecting the presence of a medical finding. We demonstrate that both model architectures are vulnerable to privacy violation by applying image reconstruction attacks to local model updates from individual clients. The attack was particularly successful during later training stages. To mitigate the risk of privacy breach, we integrated R\\'enyi differential privacy with a Gaussian noise mechanism into local model training. We evaluate model performance and attack vulnerability for privacy budgets $\\epsilon \\in$ {1, 3, 6, 10}. The DenseNet121 achieved the best utility-privacy trade-off with an AUC of 0.94 for $\\epsilon$ = 6. Model performance deteriorated slightly for individual clients compared to the non-private baseline. The ResNet50 only reached an AUC of 0.76 in the same privacy setting. Its performance was inferior to that of the DenseNet121 for all considered privacy constraints, suggesting that the DenseNet121 architecture is more robust to differentially private training. ",

We optimize the delivery scheme to minimize the average resource consumption in the network. We formulate a constrained optimization problem over the cache placement and resource allocation of the OMPMC component, as well as the multi-user beamforming scheme of the SPUC component. We apply a path-following method to find the optimal traffic offloading solution. The solutions portray a contrast between the total amount of consumed resources and service outage probability.

In the backdoor attack scenario, attackers usually implant the backdoor into the target model by manipulating the training dataset or training process. Then, the compromised model behaves normally for benign input yet makes mistakes when the pre-defined trigger appears. In this paper, we analyze the drawbacks of existing attack approaches and propose a novel imperceptible backdoor attack. We treat the trigger pattern as a special kind of noise following a multinomial distribution. A U-net-based network is employed to generate concrete parameters of multinomial distribution for each benign input. This elaborated trigger ensures that our approach is invisible to both humans and statistical detection. Besides the design of the trigger, we also consider the robustness of our approach against model diagnose-based defences. We force the feature representation of malicious input stamped with the trigger to be entangled with the benign one. We demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness against multiple state-of-the-art defences through extensive datasets and networks. Our trigger only modifies less than 1\\% pixels of a benign image while the modification magnitude is 1. Our source code is available at https://github.com/Ekko-zn/IJCAI2022-Backdoor. ",

    "abstract": "By manipulating tens of thousands of internet-of-things (IoT) enabled high-wattage electrical appliances (e.g., WiFi-controlled air-conditioners), large-scale load-altering attacks (LAAs) can cause severe disruptions to power grid operations. In this work, we present a rare-event sampling approach to identify LAAs that lead to critical network failure events (defined by the activation of a power grid emergency response (ER)). The proposed sampler is designed to \"skip\" over LAA instances that are of little interest (i.e., those that do not trigger network failure), thus significantly reducing the computational complexity in identifying the impactful LAAs. We perform extensive simulations of LAAs using the Kundur two-area system (KTAS) power network while employing the rare-event sampler. The results help us identify the victim nodes from which the attacker can launch the most impactful attacks and provide insights into how the spatial distribution of LAAs triggers the activation of ERs.

    "abstract": "The recent emergence of the promising paradigm of the Social Internet of Things (SIoT) is a result of an intelligent amalgamation of the social networking concepts with the Internet of Things (IoT) objects (also referred to as \"things\") in an attempt to unravel the challenges of network discovery, navigability, and service composition. This is realized by facilitating the IoT objects to socialize with one another, i.e., similar to the social interactions amongst the human beings. A fundamental issue that mandates careful attention is to thus establish, and over time, maintain trustworthy relationships amongst these IoT objects. Therefore, a trust framework for SIoT must include object-object interactions, the aspects of social relationships, credible recommendations, etc., however, the existing literature has only focused on some aspects of trust by primarily relying on the conventional approaches that govern linear relationships between input and output. In this paper, an artificial neural network-based trust framework, Trust-SIoT, has been envisaged for identifying the complex non-linear relationships between input and output in a bid to classify the trustworthy objects. Moreover, Trust-SIoT has been designed for capturing a number of key trust metrics as input, i.e., direct trust by integrating both current and past interactions, reliability, and benevolence of an object, credible recommendations, and the degree of relationship by employing a knowledge graph embedding. Finally, we have performed extensive experiments to evaluate the performance of Trust-SIoT vis-a-vis state-of-the-art heuristics on two real-world datasets. The results demonstrate that Trust-SIoT achieves a higher F1 and lower MAE and MSE scores. ",

    "abstract": "Development and optimization of biopharmaceutical production processes with cell cultures is cost- and time-consuming and often performed rather empirically. Efficient optimization of multiple-objectives like process time, viable cell density, number of operating steps & cultivation scales, required medium, amount of product as well as product quality depicts a promising approach. This contribution presents a workflow which couples uncertainty-based upstream simulation and Bayes optimization using Gaussian processes. Its application is demonstrated in a simulation case study for a relevant industrial task in process development, the design of a robust cell culture expansion process (seed train), meaning that despite uncertainties and variabilities concerning cell growth, low variations of viable cell density during the seed train are obtained. Compared to a non-optimized reference seed train, the optimized process showed much lower deviation rates regarding viable cell densities (<~10% instead of 41.7%) using 5 or 4 shake flask scales and seed train duration could be reduced by 56 h from 576 h to 520 h. Overall, it is shown that applying Bayes optimization allows for optimization of a multi-objective optimization function with several optimizable input variables and under a considerable amount of constraints with a low computational effort. This approach provides the potential to be used in form of a decision tool, e.g. for the choice of an optimal and robust seed train design or for further optimization tasks within process development.

However, it is not guaranteed that noise will not cascade into downstream pipelines. To understand the actual influence of noise on the entire audio pipeline, in this paper, we directly investigate the impact of noise on a different types of neural models without the preprocessing step. We measure the recognition performances of 4 different neural network models on the task of environment sound classification under the 3 types of noises: \\emph{occlusion} (to emulate intermittent noise), \\emph{Gaussian} noise (models continuous noise), and \\emph{adversarial perturbations} (worst case scenario). Our intuition is that the different ways in which these models process their input (i.e. CNNs have strong locality inductive biases, which Transformers do not have) should lead to observable differences in performance and/ or robustness, an understanding of which will enable further improvements. We perform extensive experiments on AudioSet which is the largest weakly-labeled sound event dataset available. We also seek to explain the behaviors of different models through output distribution change and weight visualization. ",

Existing approaches have relied heavily on supervised training that requires abundant annotations and pre-defined aspect categories. Instead, with the aim of leveraging the large amount of unannotated data now available on vaccination, we propose a novel semi-supervised approach for vaccine attitude detection, called VADet. A variational autoencoding architecture based on language models is employed to learn from unlabelled data the topical information of the domain. Then, the model is fine-tuned with a few manually annotated examples of user attitudes. We validate the effectiveness of VADet on our annotated data and also on an existing vaccination corpus annotated with opinions on vaccines. Our results show that VADet is able to learn disentangled stance and aspect topics, and outperforms existing aspect-based sentiment analysis models on both stance detection and tweet clustering. ",

This helps preserving Sign Language structures as much as possible before falling back on literal translations too quickly, in a generative way. The resulting translations are in the form of AZee expressions, designed to be used as input to avatar synthesis systems.

For realistic applications, these ML models consider the component-level characteristics that influence the network response during emergencies. However, such an approach could result in a large number of features and cause ML models to suffer from the `curse of dimensionality'. We present a clustering-based method that simultaneously minimizes the problem of high-dimensionality and improves the prediction accuracy of ML models developed for resilience analysis in large-scale interdependent infrastructure networks. The methodology has three parts: (a) generation of simulation dataset, (b) network component clustering, and (c) dimensionality reduction and development of prediction models. First, an interdependent infrastructure simulation model simulates the network-wide consequences of various disruptive events. The component-level features are extracted from the simulated data. Next, clustering algorithms are used to derive the cluster-level features by grouping component-level features based on their topological and functional characteristics. Finally, ML algorithms are used to develop models that predict the network-wide impacts of disruptive events using the cluster-level features. The applicability of the method is demonstrated using an interdependent power-water-transport testbed. The proposed method can be used to develop decision-support tools for post-disaster recovery of infrastructure networks. ",

While drawing motivation from recent graph learning methods that learn to solve combinatorial optimization (CO) problems such as multi-Traveling Salesman and Vehicle Routing Problems using RL, this paper seeks to provide better performance (compared to non-learning methods) and important scalability (compared to existing learning architectures) for the stated class of MRTA problems. The proposed neural architecture, called Capsule Attention-based Mechanism or CapAM acts as the policy network, and includes three main components: 1) an encoder: a Capsule Network based node embedding model to represent each task as a learnable feature vector; 2) a decoder: an attention-based model to facilitate a sequential output; and 3) context: that encodes the states of the mission and the robots. To train the CapAM model, the policy-gradient method based on REINFORCE is used. When evaluated over unseen scenarios, CapAM demonstrates better task completion performance and $>$10 times faster decision-making compared to standard non-learning based online MRTA methods. CapAM's advantage in generalizability, and scalability to test problems of size larger than those used in training, are also successfully demonstrated in comparison to a popular approach for learning to solve CO problems, namely the purely attention mechanism.

In this paper, we exploit our observation that many encrypted protocol connections are no longer tied to device IP address (e.g., the connection migration feature in QUIC, or IP roaming in WireGuard and Mosh), due to the need for performance in a mobile-first world. We design and implement a novel framework, Connection Migration Powered Splitting (CoMPS), that utilizes these performance features for enhancing user privacy. With CoMPS, we can split traffic mid-session across network paths and heterogeneous network protocols. Such traffic splitting mitigates the ability of a network-level adversary to perform traffic analysis attacks by limiting the amount of traffic they can observe. We use CoMPS to construct a website fingerprinting defense that is resilient against traffic analysis attacks by a powerful adaptive adversary in the open-world setting. We evaluate our system using both simulated splitting data and real-world traffic that is actively split using CoMPS. In our real-world experiments, CoMPS reduces the precision and recall of VarCNN to 29.9% and 36.7% respectively in the open-world setting with 100 monitored classes. CoMPS is not only immediately deployable with any unaltered server that supports connection migration, but also incurs little overhead, decreasing throughput by only 5-20%. ",

We study the average version age of this network in the presence of $\\tilde{n}$ jammers that disrupt inter-node communications. To this purpose, we construct an alternate system model of mini-rings and prove that the version age of the original model can be sandwiched between constant multiples of the version age of the alternate model. We show that when the number of jammers scales as a fractional power of the network size, i.e., $\\tilde n= cn^\\alpha$, the version age scales as $\\sqrt{n}$ when $\\alpha < \\frac{1}{2}$, and as $n^{\\alpha}$ when $\\alpha \\geq \\frac{1}{2}$.

To enhance object detection in a dark environment, we propose a novel multitask auto encoding transformation (MAET) model which is able to explore the intrinsic pattern behind illumination translation. In a self-supervision manner, the MAET learns the intrinsic visual structure by encoding and decoding the realistic illumination-degrading transformation considering the physical noise model and image signal processing (ISP). Based on this representation, we achieve the object detection task by decoding the bounding box coordinates and classes. To avoid the over-entanglement of two tasks, our MAET disentangles the object and degrading features by imposing an orthogonal tangent regularity. This forms a parametric manifold along which multitask predictions can be geometrically formulated by maximizing the orthogonality between the tangents along the outputs of respective tasks. Our framework can be implemented based on the mainstream object detection architecture and directly trained end-to-end using normal target detection datasets, such as VOC and COCO. We have achieved the state-of-the-art performance using synthetic and real-world datasets. Code is available at https://github.com/cuiziteng/MAET. ",

    "abstract": "Aerial scene classification remains challenging as: 1) the size of key objects in determining the scene scheme varies greatly; 2) many objects irrelevant to the scene scheme are often flooded in the image. Hence, how to effectively perceive the region of interests (RoIs) from a variety of sizes and build more discriminative representation from such complicated object distribution is vital to understand an aerial scene. In this paper, we propose a novel all grains, one scheme (AGOS) framework to tackle these challenges. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first work to extend the classic multiple instance learning into multi-grain formulation. Specially, it consists of a multi-grain perception module (MGP), a multi-branch multi-instance representation module (MBMIR) and a self-aligned semantic fusion (SSF) module. Firstly, our MGP preserves the differential dilated convolutional features from the backbone, which magnifies the discriminative information from multi-grains. Then, our MBMIR highlights the key instances in the multi-grain representation under the MIL formulation. Finally, our SSF allows our framework to learn the same scene scheme from multi-grain instance representations and fuses them, so that the entire framework is optimized as a whole.

    "abstract": "Learning from a few training samples is a desirable ability of an object detector, inspiring the explorations of Few-Shot Object Detection (FSOD). Most existing approaches employ a pretrain-transfer paradigm. The model is first pre-trained on base classes with abundant data and then transferred to novel classes with a few annotated samples. Despite the substantial progress, the FSOD performance is still far behind satisfactory. During pre-training, due to the co-occurrence between base and novel classes, the model is learned to treat the co-occurred novel classes as backgrounds. During transferring, given scarce samples of novel classes, the model suffers from learning discriminative features to distinguish novel instances from backgrounds and base classes. To overcome the obstacles, we propose a novel framework, Mining Implicit Novel Instances (MINI), to mine the implicit novel instances as auxiliary training samples, which widely exist in abundant base data but are not annotated. MINI comprises an offline mining mechanism and an online mining mechanism. The offline mining mechanism leverages a self-supervised discriminative model to collaboratively mine implicit novel instances with a trained FSOD network. Taking the mined novel instances as auxiliary training samples, the online mining mechanism takes a teacher-student framework to simultaneously update the FSOD network and the mined implicit novel instances on the fly. Extensive experiments on PASCAL VOC and MS-COCO datasets show MINI achieves new state-of-the-art performance on any shot and split. The significant performance improvements demonstrate the superiority of our method. ",

We obtain a best MAE of 1.417 for daily prediction of PHQ-2 scores, which specifically in the used dataset have a range of 0 to 12, using leave-one-subject-out cross-validation, as well as a best MAE of 1.914 for forecasting PHQ-2 scores using data from up to the last 7 days.

This study demonstrates that synthetic colonoscopy images generated by Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) inversion can be used as training data to improve the lesion classification performance of deep learning models. This approach inverts pairs of images with the same label to a semantically rich & disentangled latent space and manipulates latent representations to produce new synthetic images with the same label. We perform image modality translation (style transfer) between white light and narrowband imaging (NBI). We also generate realistic-looking synthetic lesion images by interpolating between original training images to increase the variety of lesion shapes in the training dataset. We show that these approaches outperform comparative colonoscopy data augmentation techniques without the need to re-train multiple generative models. This approach also leverages information from datasets that may not have been designed for the specific colonoscopy downstream task. E.g. using a bowel prep grading dataset for a polyp classification task. Our experiments show this approach can perform multiple colonoscopy data augmentations, which improve the downstream polyp classification performance over baseline and comparison methods by up to 6%.

Due to several device limitations and ethical reasons, current open-source datasets are typically collected on a limited number of patients using the same brand of sensors.

Therefore, to address the generalization problem in GI(Gastrointestinal) endoscopy, we propose a multi-domain GI dataset and a light, plug-in block called InvNorm(Invertible Normalization), which could achieve a better generalization performance in any structure. Previous DG(Domain Generalization) methods fail to achieve invertible transformation, which would lead to some misleading augmentation. Moreover, these models would be more likely to lead to medical ethics issues. Our method utilizes normalizing flow to achieve invertible and explainable style normalization to address the problem. The effectiveness of InvNorm is demonstrated on a wide range of tasks, including GI recognition, GI object detection, and natural image recognition. ",

Generative adversarial networks (GANs) offer both the potential to generate new data, as well as to use this newly generated data, without inclusion of patients' real data, for downstream applications. Approach: A series of GANs were trained and applied for a downstream computer vision spine radiograph abnormality classification task. Separate classifiers were trained with either access or no access to the original imaging. Trained GANs included a conditional StyleGAN2 with adaptive discriminator augmentation, a conditional StyleGAN2 with adaptive discriminator augmentation to generate spine radiographs conditional on lesion type, and using a novel clinical loss term for the generator a StyleGAN2 with adaptive discriminator augmentation conditional on abnormality (SpineGAN). Finally, a differential privacy imposed StyleGAN2 with adaptive discriminator augmentation conditional on abnormality was trained and an ablation study was performed on its differential privacy impositions. Key Results: We accomplish GAN generation of synthetic spine radiographs without meaningful input for the first time from a literature review. We further demonstrate the success of synthetic learning for the spine domain with a downstream clinical classification task (AUC of 0.830 using synthetic data compared to AUC of 0.886 using the real data). Importantly, the introduction of a new clinical loss term for the generator was found to increase generation recall as well as accelerate model training. Lastly, we demonstrate that, in a limited size medical dataset, differential privacy impositions severely impede GAN training, finding that this is specifically due to the requirement for gradient perturbation with noise.

    "abstract": "Ischemic strokes are often caused by large vessel occlusions (LVOs), which can be visualized and diagnosed with Computed Tomography Angiography scans. As time is brain, a fast, accurate and automated diagnosis of these scans is desirable. Human readers compare the left and right hemispheres in their assessment of strokes. A large training data set is required for a standard deep learning-based model to learn this strategy from data. As labeled medical data in this field is rare, other approaches need to be developed. To both include the prior knowledge of side comparison and increase the amount of training data, we propose an augmentation method that generates artificial training samples by recombining vessel tree segmentations of the hemispheres or hemisphere subregions from different patients. The subregions cover vessels commonly affected by LVOs, namely the internal carotid artery (ICA) and middle cerebral artery (MCA). In line with the augmentation scheme, we use a 3D-DenseNet fed with task-specific input, fostering a side-by-side comparison between the hemispheres. Furthermore, we propose an extension of that architecture to process the individual hemisphere subregions. All configurations predict the presence of an LVO, its side, and the affected subregion. We show the effect of recombination as an augmentation strategy in a 5-fold cross validated ablation study. We enhanced the AUC for patient-wise classification regarding the presence of an LVO of all investigated architectures. For one variant, the proposed method improved the AUC from 0.73 without augmentation to 0.89. The best configuration detects LVOs with an AUC of 0.91, LVOs in the ICA with an AUC of 0.96, and in the MCA with 0.91 while accurately predicting the affected side. ",

    "abstract": "Accurate virtual high-throughput screening (VHTS) of transition metal complexes (TMCs) remains challenging due to the possibility of high multi-reference (MR) character that complicates property evaluation. We compute MR diagnostics for over 5,000 ligands present in previously synthesized transition metal complexes in the Cambridge Structural Database (CSD). To accomplish this task, we introduce an iterative approach for consistent ligand charge assignment for ligands in the CSD. Across this set, we observe that MR character correlates linearly with the inverse value of the averaged bond order over all bonds in the molecule. We then demonstrate that ligand additivity of MR character holds in TMCs, which suggests that the TMC MR character can be inferred from the sum of the MR character of the ligands. Encouraged by this observation, we leverage ligand additivity and develop a ligand-derived machine learning representation to train neural networks to predict the MR character of TMCs from properties of the constituent ligands. This approach yields models with excellent performance and superior transferability to unseen ligand chemistry and compositions. ",

However, due to physical limitations on the distances of quantum links, current implementations of quantum networks are unavoidably equipped with trusted nodes. As a consequence, the quantum key distribution can be performed only on the links. Due to this, some new authentication and key exchange schemes must be considered to fully benefit from the unconditional security of links. One such approach uses Multiple Non-Overlapping Paths (MNOPs) for key exchange to mitigate the risk of an attack on a trusted node. The scope of the article is to perform a security analysis of this scheme for the case of both uncorrelated attacks and correlated attacks with finite resources. Furthermore, our analysis is extended to the case of Multiple Overlapping Paths (MOPs). We prove that introducing overlapping paths allows one to increase the security of the protocol, compared to the non-overlapping case with the same number of additional links added. This result may find application in optimising architectures of large-scale (hybrid) quantum networks. ",

To identify the preictal region that precedes the onset of seizure, a large number of annotated EEG signals are required to train DL algorithms. However, the scarcity of seizure onsets leads to significant insufficiency of data for training the DL algorithms. To overcome this data insufficiency, in this paper, we propose a preictal artificial signal synthesis algorithm based on a generative adversarial network to generate synthetic multichannel EEG preictal samples. A high-quality single-channel architecture, determined by visual and statistical evaluations, is used to train the generators of multichannel samples. The effectiveness of the synthetic samples is evaluated by comparing the ES prediction performances without and with synthetic preictal sample augmentation. The leave-one-seizure-out cross validation ES prediction accuracy and corresponding area under the receiver operating characteristic curve evaluation improve from 73.0\\% and 0.676 to 78.0\\% and 0.704 by 10$\\times$ synthetic sample augmentation, respectively.
