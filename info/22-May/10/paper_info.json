    "abstract": "A randomized algorithm for computing a data sparse representation of a given rank structured matrix $A$ (a.k.a. an $\\mathcal{H}$-matrix) is presented. The algorithm draws on the randomized singular value decomposition (RSVD), and operates under the assumption that algorithms for rapidly applying $A$ and $A^{*}$ to vectors are available. The algorithm analyzes the hierarchical tree that defines the rank structure using graph coloring algorithms to generate a set of random test vectors. The matrix is then applied to the test vectors, and in a final step the matrix itself is reconstructed by the observed input-output pairs. The method presented is an evolution of the \"peeling algorithm\" of L. Lin, J. Lu, and L. Ying, \"Fast construction of hierarchical matrix representation from matrix-vector multiplication,\" JCP, 230(10), 2011. For the case of uniform trees, the new method substantially reduces the pre-factor of the original peeling algorithm. More significantly, the new technique leads to dramatic acceleration for many non-uniform trees since it constructs sample vectors that are optimized for a given tree. The algorithm is particularly effective for kernel matrices involving a set of points restricted to a lower dimensional object than the ambient space, such as a boundary integral equation defined on a surface in three dimensions.

    "abstract": "Differential privacy (DP) is a widely used notion for reasoning about privacy when publishing aggregate data. In this paper, we observe that certain DP mechanisms are amenable to a posteriori privacy analysis that exploits the fact that some outputs leak less information about the input database than others. To exploit this phenomenon, we introduce output differential privacy (ODP) and a new composition experiment, and leverage these new constructs to obtain significant privacy budget savings and improved privacy-utility tradeoffs under composition. All of this comes at no cost in terms of privacy; we do not weaken the privacy guarantee. To demonstrate the applicability of our a posteriori privacy analysis techniques, we analyze two well-known mechanisms: the Sparse Vector Technique and the Propose-Test-Release framework. We then show how our techniques can be used to save privacy budget in more general contexts: when a differentially private iterative mechanism terminates before its maximal number of iterations is reached, and when the output of a DP mechanism provides unsatisfactory utility. Examples of the former include iterative optimization algorithms, whereas examples of the latter include training a machine learning model with a large generalization error. Our techniques can be applied beyond the current paper to refine the analysis of existing DP mechanisms or guide the design of future mechanisms. ",

    "abstract": "Out-of-Distribution (OoD) inputs are examples that do not belong to the true underlying distribution of the dataset. Research has shown that deep neural nets make confident mispredictions on OoD inputs. Therefore, it is critical to identify OoD inputs for safe and reliable deployment of deep neural nets. Often a threshold is applied on a similarity score to detect OoD inputs. One such similarity is angular similarity which is the dot product of latent representation with the mean class representation. Angular similarity encodes uncertainty, for example, if the angular similarity is less, it is less certain that the input belongs to that class. However, we observe that, different classes have different distributions of angular similarity. Therefore, applying a single threshold for all classes is not ideal since the same similarity score represents different uncertainties for different classes. In this paper, we propose norm-scaling which normalizes the logits separately for each class. This ensures that a single value consistently represents similar uncertainty for various classes. We show that norm-scaling, when used with maximum softmax probability detector, achieves 9.78% improvement in AUROC, 5.99% improvement in AUPR and 33.19% reduction in FPR95 metrics over previous state-of-the-art methods.

Inspired by the success of point-pair features, the goal of this paper is to recover the 6D pose of an object instance segmented from RGB-D images by locally matching pairs of oriented points between the model and camera space. To this end, we propose a novel Bi-directional Correspondence Mapping Network (BiCo-Net) to first generate point clouds guided by a typical pose regression, which can thus incorporate pose-sensitive information to optimize generation of local coordinates and their normal vectors. As pose predictions via geometric computation only rely on one single pair of local oriented points, our BiCo-Net can achieve robustness against sparse and occluded point clouds. An ensemble of redundant pose predictions from locally matching and direct pose regression further refines final pose output against noisy observations. Experimental results on three popularly benchmarking datasets can verify that our method can achieve state-of-the-art performance, especially for the more challenging severe occluded scenes.

    "abstract": "The progression of innovation and technology and ease of inter-connectivity among networks has allowed us to evolve towards one of the promising areas, the Internet of Vehicles. Nowadays, modern vehicles are connected to a range of networks, including intra-vehicle networks and external networks. However, a primary challenge in the automotive industry is to make the vehicle safe and reliable; particularly with the loopholes in the existing traditional protocols, cyber-attacks on the vehicle network are rising drastically. Practically every vehicle uses the universal Controller Area Network (CAN) bus protocol for the communication between electronic control units to transmit key vehicle functionality and messages related to driver safety. The CAN bus system, although its critical significance, lacks the key feature of any protocol authentication and authorization. Resulting in compromises of CAN bus security leads to serious issues to both car and driver safety. This paper discusses the security issues of the CAN bus protocol and proposes an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) that detects known attacks on in-vehicle networks. Multiple Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms are employed to provide recognition of known potential cyber-attacks based on messages, timestamps, and data packets traveling through the CAN. The main objective of this paper is to accurately detect cyberattacks by considering time-series features and attack frequency. The majority of the evaluated AI algorithms, when considering attack frequency, correctly identify known attacks with remarkable accuracy of more than 99%. However, these models achieve approximately 92% to 97% accuracy when timestamps are not taken into account. Long Short Term Memory (LSTM), Xgboost, and SVC have proved to the well-performing classifiers. ",

    "abstract": "Graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance in many graph-based tasks such as node classification and graph classification. However, many recent works have demonstrated that an attacker can mislead GNN models by slightly perturbing the graph structure. Existing attacks to GNNs are either under the less practical threat model where the attacker is assumed to access the GNN model parameters, or under the practical black-box threat model but consider perturbing node features that are shown to be not enough effective. In this paper, we aim to bridge this gap and consider black-box attacks to GNNs with structure perturbation as well as with theoretical guarantees. We propose to address this challenge through bandit techniques. Specifically, we formulate our attack as an online optimization with bandit feedback. This original problem is essentially NP-hard due to the fact that perturbing the graph structure is a binary optimization problem. We then propose an online attack based on bandit optimization which is proven to be {sublinear} to the query number $T$, i.e., $\\mathcal{O}(\\sqrt{N}T^{3/4})$ where $N$ is the number of nodes in the graph. Finally, we evaluate our proposed attack by conducting experiments over multiple datasets and GNN models. The experimental results on various citation graphs and image graphs show that our attack is both effective and efficient.

The conventional culture-based methods for bacterial colony detection usually take >24 hours to get the final read-out. Here, we demonstrate a bacterial colony-forming-unit (CFU) detection system exploiting a thin-film-transistor (TFT)-based image sensor array that saves ~12 hours compared to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)-approved methods. To demonstrate the efficacy of this CFU detection system, a lensfree imaging modality was built using the TFT image sensor with a sample field-of-view of ~10 cm^2. Time-lapse images of bacterial colonies cultured on chromogenic agar plates were automatically collected at 5-minute intervals. Two deep neural networks were used to detect and count the growing colonies and identify their species. When blindly tested with 265 colonies of E. coli and other coliform bacteria (i.e., Citrobacter and Klebsiella pneumoniae), our system reached an average CFU detection rate of 97.3% at 9 hours of incubation and an average recovery rate of 91.6% at ~12 hours. This TFT-based sensor can be applied to various microbiological detection methods. Due to the large scalability, ultra-large field-of-view, and low cost of the TFT-based image sensors, this platform can be integrated with each agar plate to be tested and disposed of after the automated CFU count. The imaging field-of-view of this platform can be cost-effectively increased to >100 cm^2 to provide a massive throughput for CFU detection using, e.g., roll-to-roll manufacturing of TFTs as used in the flexible display industry.

Although existing deep rain removal models lead to improved performance for heavy rain removal, we find that most of them ignore the detail reconstruction accuracy of rain-free images. In this paper, we propose a dual-stage progressive enhancement network (DPENet) to achieve effective deraining with structure-accurate rain-free images. Two main modules are included in our framework, namely a rain streaks removal network (R$^2$Net) and a detail reconstruction network (DRNet). The former aims to achieve accurate rain removal, and the latter is designed to recover the details of rain-free images. We introduce two main strategies within our networks to achieve trade-off between the effectiveness of deraining and the detail restoration of rain-free images. Firstly, a dilated dense residual block (DDRB) within the rain streaks removal network is presented to aggregate high/low level features of heavy rain. Secondly, an enhanced residual pixel-wise attention block (ERPAB) within the detail reconstruction network is designed for context information aggregation. We also propose a comprehensive loss function to highlight the marginal and regional accuracy of rain-free images. Extensive experiments on benchmark public datasets show both efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed method in achieving structure-preserving rain-free images for heavy rain removal.

Considering the latest inference attacks that enable stealthy and precise attacks into NDSs with observation-based learning, this article focuses on a new security aspect, i.e., how to protect control mechanism secrets from inference attacks, including state information, interaction structure and control laws. We call this security property as control mechanism secrecy, which provides protection of the vulnerabilities in the control process and fills the defense gap that traditional cyber security cannot handle. Since the knowledge of control mechanism defines the capabilities to implement attacks, ensuring control mechanism secrecy needs to go beyond the conventional data privacy to cover both transmissible data and intrinsic models in NDSs. The prime goal of this article is to summarize recent results of both inference attacks on control mechanism secrets and countermeasures. We first introduce the basic inference attack methods on the state and structure of NDSs, respectively, along with their inference performance bounds. Then, the corresponding countermeasures and performance metrics are given to illustrate how to preserve the control mechanism secrecy. Necessary conditions are derived to guide the secrecy design. Finally, thorough discussions on the control laws and open issues are presented, beckoning future investigation on reliable countermeasure design and tradeoffs between the secrecy and control performance.

Cross-lingual knowledge graph entity alignment aims to discover the cross-lingual links in the multi-language KGs, which is of great significance to the NLP applications and multi-language KGs fusion. In the task of aligning cross-language knowledge graphs, the structures of the two graphs are very similar, and the equivalent entities often have the same subgraph structure characteristics. The traditional GCN method neglects to obtain structural features through representative parts of the original graph and the use of adjacency matrix is not enough to effectively represent the structural features of the graph. In this paper, we introduce the subgraph network (SGN) method into the GCN-based cross-lingual KG entity alignment method. In the method, we extracted the first-order subgraphs of the KGs to expand the structural features of the original graph to enhance the representation ability of the entity embedding and improve the alignment accuracy.

However, this task severely suffers from the coarse and noisy dynamics and the insufficient fusion of the heterogeneous RGB and motion modalities. To address the two issues above, this paper proposes a novel framework, namely Attentive Cross-modal Interaction Network with Motion Enhancement (MEACI-Net). It follows the two-stream architecture, i.e. one for the RGB modality and the other for the motion modality. Particularly, the motion stream employs a multi-scale block embedded with a denoising module to enhance representation learning. The interaction between the two streams is then strengthened by introducing the Selective Motion Complement (SMC) and Cross-Modality Augment (CMA) modules, where SMC complements the RGB modality with spatio-temporally attentive local motion features and CMA further combines the two modalities with selective feature augmentation. Extensive experiments on the UCF-101, HMDB-51 and Kinetics-400 benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of MEACI-Net. ",

Although manual picking can produce accurate normal moveout (NMO) velocities from the velocity spectra of prestack gathers, it is time-consuming and becomes infeasible with the emergence of large amount of seismic data. Numerous automatic velocity picking methods have thus been developed. In recent years, deep learning (DL) methods have produced good results on the seismic data with medium and high signal-to-noise ratios (SNR). Unfortunately, it still lacks a picking method to automatically generate accurate velocities in the situations of low SNR. In this paper, we propose a multi-information fusion network (MIFN) to estimate stacking velocity from the fusion information of velocity spectra and stack gather segments (SGS). In particular, we transform the velocity picking problem into a semantic segmentation problem based on the velocity spectrum images. Meanwhile, the information provided by SGS is used as a prior in the network to assist segmentation. The experimental results on two field datasets show that the picking results of MIFN are stable and accurate for the scenarios with medium and high SNR, and it also performs well in low SNR scenarios.

    "abstract": "Monitoring electrocardiogram signals is of great significance for the diagnosis of arrhythmias. In recent years, deep learning and convolutional neural networks have been widely used in the classification of cardiac arrhythmias. However, the existing neural network applied to ECG signal detection usually requires a lot of computing resources, which is not friendlyF to resource-constrained equipment, and it is difficult to realize real-time monitoring. In this paper, a binarized convolutional neural network suitable for ECG monitoring is proposed, which is hardware-friendly and more suitable for use in resource-constrained wearable devices. Targeting the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database, the classifier based on this network reached an accuracy of 95.67% in the five-class test. Compared with the proposed baseline full-precision network with an accuracy of 96.45%, it is only 0.78% lower. Importantly, it achieves 12.65 times the computing speedup, 24.8 times the storage compression ratio, and only requires a quarter of the memory overhead. ",

    "abstract": "The configuration of radar networks is a complex problem that is often performed manually by experts with the help of a simulator. Different numbers and types of radars as well as different locations that the radars shall cover give rise to different instances of the radar configuration problem. The exact modeling of these instances is complex, as the quality of the configurations depends on a large number of parameters, on internal radar processing, and on the terrains on which the radars need to be placed. Classic optimization algorithms can therefore not be applied to this problem, and we rely on \"trial-and-error\" black-box approaches. In this paper, we study the performances of 13~black-box optimization algorithms on 153~radar network configuration problem instances. The algorithms perform considerably better than human experts. Their ranking, however, depends on the budget of configurations that can be evaluated and on the elevation profile of the location. We therefore also investigate automated algorithm selection approaches. Our results demonstrate that a pipeline that extracts instance features from the elevation of the terrain performs on par with the classical, far more expensive approach that extracts features from the objective function.

    "abstract": "Object detection in low-light conditions remains a challenging but important problem with many practical implications. Some recent works show that, in low-light conditions, object detectors using raw image data are more robust than detectors using image data processed by a traditional ISP pipeline. To improve detection performance in low-light conditions, one can fine-tune the detector to use raw image data or use a dedicated low-light neural pipeline trained with paired low- and normal-light data to restore and enhance the image. However, different camera sensors have different spectral sensitivity and learning-based models using raw images process data in the sensor-specific color space. Thus, once trained, they do not guarantee generalization to other camera sensors. We propose to improve generalization to unseen camera sensors by implementing a minimal neural ISP pipeline for machine cognition, named GenISP, that explicitly incorporates Color Space Transformation to a device-independent color space. We also propose a two-stage color processing implemented by two image-to-parameter modules that take down-sized image as input and regress global color correction parameters. Moreover, we propose to train our proposed GenISP under the guidance of a pre-trained object detector and avoid making assumptions about perceptual quality of the image, but rather optimize the image representation for machine cognition. At the inference stage, GenISP can be paired with any object detector. We perform extensive experiments to compare our method to other low-light image restoration and enhancement methods in an extrinsic task-based evaluation and validate that GenISP can generalize to unseen sensors and object detectors. Finally, we contribute a low-light dataset of 7K raw images annotated with 46K bounding boxes for task-based benchmarking of future low-light image restoration and object detection. ",

Accurate early prediction of AKI for patients in ICU who are more likely than others to have AKI can enable timely interventions, and reduce the complications of AKI. Much of the clinical information relevant to AKI is captured in clinical notes that are largely unstructured text and requires advanced natural language processing (NLP) for useful information extraction. On the other hand, pre-trained contextual language models such as Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) have improved performances for many NLP tasks in general domain recently. However, few have explored BERT on disease-specific medical domain tasks such as AKI early prediction. In this paper, we try to apply BERT to specific diseases and present an AKI domain-specific pre-trained language model based on BERT (AKI-BERT) that could be used to mine the clinical notes for early prediction of AKI. AKI-BERT is a BERT model pre-trained on the clinical notes of patients having risks for AKI. Our experiments on Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III) dataset demonstrate that AKI-BERT can yield performance improvements for early AKI prediction, thus expanding the utility of the BERT model from general clinical domain to disease-specific domain.

Articulated objects often come with unexpected articulation mechanisms that are inconsistent with categorical priors: for example, a drawer might rotate about a hinge joint instead of sliding open. We propose a category-independent framework for predicting the articulation models of unknown objects from sequences of RGB-D images. The prediction is performed by a two-step process: first, a visual perception module tracks object part poses from raw images, and second, a factor graph takes these poses and infers the articulation model including the current configuration between the parts as a 6D twist. We also propose a manipulation-oriented metric to evaluate predicted joint twists in terms of how well a compliant robot controller would be able to manipulate the articulated object given the predicted twist. We demonstrate that our visual perception and factor graph modules outperform baselines on simulated data and show the applicability of our factor graph on real world data. ",

This problem is closely related to the problem of finding the smallest Odd Cycle Transversal. In this work, we consider the following model of instances: starting with a set of vertices $V$, a set $S \\subseteq V$ of $k$ vertices is chosen and an arbitrary $d$-regular bipartite graph is added on it; edges between pairs of vertices in $S \\times (V \\setminus S)$ and $(V \\setminus S) \\times (V \\setminus S)$ are added with probability $p$. Since for $d=0$, the problem reduces to recovering a planted independent set, we don't expect efficient algorithms for $k=o(\\sqrt{n})$. This problem is a generalization of the planted balanced biclique problem where the bipartite graph induced on $S$ is a complete bipartite graph; [Lev18] gave an algorithm for recovering $S$ in this problem when $k=\\Omega(\\sqrt{n})$. Our main result is an efficient algorithm that recovers (w.h.p.) the planted bipartite graph when $k=\\Omega_p(\\sqrt{n \\log n})$ for a large range of parameters. Our results also hold for a natural semi-random model of instances, which involve the presence of a monotone adversary. Our proof shows that a natural SDP relaxation for the problem is integral by constructing an appropriate solution to it's dual formulation. Our main technical contribution is a new approach for constructing the dual solution where we calibrate the eigenvectors of the adjacency matrix to be the eigenvectors of the dual matrix. We believe that this approach may have applications to other recovery problems in semi-random models as well. When $k=\\Omega(\\sqrt{n})$, we give an algorithm for recovering $S$ whose running time is exponential in the number of small eigenvalues in graph induced on $S$; this algorithm is based on subspace enumeration techniques due to the works of [KT07,ABS10,Kol11].

Therefore, the importance of applying cost-effective lighting methods arises. In this paper, an optimal supplemental lighting control approach is developed considering a variational inference Bayesian Neural Network (BNN) model for sunlight prediction. The predictive model is validated through testing the model on the historical solar data of a site located at North Carolina ($R^{2}$=0.9971, RMSE=1.8%). The proposed lighting approach is shown to minimize electricity cost by considering the BNN-based sunlight prediction, plant light needs, and variable electricity pricing when solving the underlying optimization problem. For evaluation, the new strategy is compared to: 1) a Markov-based prediction method, which solves the same optimization problem, assuming a Markov model for sunlight prediction; 2) a heuristic method which aims to supply a fixed amount of light. Simulation studies are conducted to examine the electricity cost improvements of the BNN-based approach. The results show that the BNN-based approach reduces cost by (on average) 2.27% and 43.91% compared to the Markov prediction-based method and the heuristic method, respectively, throughout a year. ",

Current approaches in density-based TO for FRC use the underlying finite element mesh both for analysis and design representation. This poses several limitations while enforcing sub-element fiber spacing and generating high-resolution continuous fibers. In contrast, we propose a mesh-independent representation based on a neural network (NN) both to capture the matrix topology and fiber distribution. The implicit NN-based representation enables geometric and material queries at a higher resolution than a mesh discretization. This leads to the accurate extraction of functionally-graded continuous fibers. Further, by integrating the finite element simulations into the NN computational framework, we can leverage automatic differentiation for end-to-end automated sensitivity analysis, i.e., we no longer need to manually derive cumbersome sensitivity expressions. We demonstrate the effectiveness and computational efficiency of the proposed method through several numerical examples involving various objective functions. We also show that the optimized continuous fiber reinforced composites can be directly fabricated at high resolution using additive manufacturing. ",

    "abstract": "A number of engineering and scientific problems require representing and manipulating probability distributions over large alphabets, which we may think of as long vectors of reals summing to $1$. In some cases it is required to represent such a vector with only $b$ bits per entry. A natural choice is to partition the interval $[0,1]$ into $2^b$ uniform bins and quantize entries to each bin independently. We show that a minor modification of this procedure -- applying an entrywise non-linear function (compander) $f(x)$ prior to quantization -- yields an extremely effective quantization method. For example, for $b=8 (16)$ and $10^5$-sized alphabets, the quality of representation improves from a loss (under KL divergence) of $0.1 (0.5)$ bits/entry to $10^{-4} (10^{-9})$ bits/entry. Compared to floating point representations, our compander method improves the loss from $10^{-1}(10^{-6})$ to $10^{-4}(10^{-9})$ bits/entry. These numbers hold for both real-world data (word frequencies in books and DNA $k$-mer counts) and for synthetic randomly generated distributions. Theoretically, we set up a minimax optimality criterion and show that the compander $f(x) ~\\propto~ \\mathrm{ArcSinh}(\\sqrt{(1/2) (K \\log K) x})$ achieves near-optimal performance, attaining a KL-quantization loss of $\\asymp 2^{-2b} \\log^2 K$ for a $K$-letter alphabet and $b\\to \\infty$. Interestingly, a similar minimax criterion for the quadratic loss on the hypercube shows optimality of the standard uniform quantizer. This suggests that the $\\mathrm{ArcSinh}$ quantizer is as fundamental for KL-distortion as the uniform quantizer for quadratic distortion. ",

Our proposed Dual-Channel Consistency based Graph Convolutional Networks (DCC-GCN) uses dual-channel to extract embeddings from node features and topological structures, and then achieves reliable low-confidence and high-confidence samples selection based on dual-channel consistency. We further confirmed that the low-confidence samples obtained based on dual-channel consistency were low in accuracy, constraining the model's performance. Unlike previous studies ignoring low-confidence samples, we calibrate the feature embeddings of the low-confidence samples by using the neighborhood's high-confidence samples. Our experiments have shown that the DCC-GCN can more accurately distinguish between low-confidence and high-confidence samples, and can also significantly improve the accuracy of low-confidence samples.

SSL speech models achieve decent performance on a wide range of downstream tasks, suggesting that they extract different aspects of information from speech. However, how SSL models store various information in hidden representations without interfering is still poorly understood. Taking the recently successful SSL model, HuBERT, as an example, we explore how the SSL model processes and stores speaker information in the representation. We found that HuBERT stores speaker information in representations whose positions correspond to silences in a waveform. There are several pieces of evidence. (1) We find that the utterances with more silent parts in the waveforms have better Speaker Identification (SID) accuracy. (2) If we use the whole utterances for SID, the silence part always contributes more to the SID task. (3) If we only use the representation of a part of the utterance for SID, the silenced part has higher accuracy than the other parts. Our findings not only contribute to a better understanding of SSL models but also improve performance. By simply adding silence to the original waveform, HuBERT improved its accuracy on SID by nearly 2%. ",

However, 1) the hardware cannot withstand the ever-increasing memory requirements as the video length increases. 2) Storing lots of information inevitably introduces lots of noise, which is not conducive to reading the most important information from the memory bank. In this paper, we propose a Recurrent Dynamic Embedding (RDE) to build a memory bank of constant size. Specifically, we explicitly generate and update RDE by the proposed Spatio-temporal Aggregation Module (SAM), which exploits the cue of historical information. To avoid error accumulation owing to the recurrent usage of SAM, we propose an unbiased guidance loss during the training stage, which makes SAM more robust in long videos. Moreover, the predicted masks in the memory bank are inaccurate due to the inaccurate network inference, which affects the segmentation of the query frame. To address this problem, we design a novel self-correction strategy so that the network can repair the embeddings of masks with different qualities in the memory bank.

    "abstract": "Trajectory-User Linking (TUL), which links trajectories to users who generate them, has been a challenging problem due to the sparsity in check-in mobility data. Existing methods ignore the utilization of historical data or rich contextual features in check-in data, resulting in poor performance for TUL task. In this paper, we propose a novel Mutual distillation learning network to solve the TUL problem for sparse check-in mobility data, named MainTUL. Specifically, MainTUL is composed of a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) trajectory encoder that models sequential patterns of input trajectory and a temporal-aware Transformer trajectory encoder that captures long-term time dependencies for the corresponding augmented historical trajectories. Then, the knowledge learned on historical trajectories is transferred between the two trajectory encoders to guide the learning of both encoders to achieve mutual distillation of information. Experimental results on two real-world check-in mobility datasets demonstrate the superiority of MainTUL against state-of-the-art baselines.

    "abstract": "Visual storytelling (VST) is the task of generating a story paragraph that describes a given image sequence. Most existing storytelling approaches have evaluated their models using traditional natural language generation metrics like BLEU or CIDEr. However, such metrics based on n-gram matching tend to have poor correlation with human evaluation scores and do not explicitly consider other criteria necessary for storytelling such as sentence structure or topic coherence. Moreover, a single score is not enough to assess a story as it does not inform us about what specific errors were made by the model. In this paper, we propose 3 evaluation metrics sets that analyses which aspects we would look for in a good story: 1) visual grounding, 2) coherence, and 3) non-redundancy. We measure the reliability of our metric sets by analysing its correlation with human judgement scores on a sample of machine stories obtained from 4 state-of-the-arts models trained on the Visual Storytelling Dataset (VIST). Our metric sets outperforms other metrics on human correlation, and could be served as a learning based evaluation metric set that is complementary to existing rule-based metrics. ",

The fully-cycled Cycle-GAN architecture is widely employed to achieve promising performance on face SR, but prone to produce artifacts upon challenging cases in real-world scenarios, since joint participation in the same degradation branch will impact final performance due to huge domain gap between real-world and synthetic LR ones obtained by generators. To better exploit the powerful generative capability of GAN for real-world face SR, in this paper, we establish two independent degradation branches in the forward and backward cycle-consistent reconstruction processes, respectively, while the two processes share the same restoration branch. Our Semi-Cycled Generative Adversarial Networks (SCGAN) is able to alleviate the adverse effects of the domain gap between the real-world LR face images and the synthetic LR ones, and to achieve accurate and robust face SR performance by the shared restoration branch regularized by both the forward and backward cycle-consistent learning processes. Experiments on two synthetic and two real-world datasets demonstrate that, our SCGAN outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on recovering the face structures/details and quantitative metrics for real-world face SR.

    "abstract": "On the Internet, fake news exists in various domain (e.g., education, health). Since news in different domains has different features, researchers have be-gun to use single domain label for fake news detection recently. This emerg-ing field is called multi-domain fake news detection (MFND). Existing works show that using single domain label can improve the accuracy of fake news detection model. However, there are two problems in previous works. Firstly, they ignore that a piece of news may have features from different domains. The single domain label focuses only on the features of the news on particu-lar domain. This may reduce the performance of the model. Secondly, their model cannot transfer the domain knowledge to the other dataset without domain label. In this paper, we propose a novel model, FuDFEND, which solves the limitations above by introducing the fuzzy inference mechanism. Specifically, FuDFEND utilizes a neural network to fit the fuzzy inference process which constructs a fuzzy domain label for each news item. Then, the feature extraction module uses the fuzzy domain label to extract the multi-domain features of the news and obtain the total feature representation. Fi-nally, the discriminator module uses the total feature representation to dis-criminate whether the news item is fake news. The results on the Weibo21 show that our model works better than the model using only single domain label. In addition, our model transfers domain knowledge better to Thu da-taset which has no domain label. ",

    "abstract": "Thoracic aortic aneurysm (TAA) is a localized dilatation of the aorta resulting from compromised wall composition, structure, and function, which can lead to life-threatening dissection or rupture. Several genetic mutations and predisposing factors that contribute to TAA have been studied in mouse models to characterize specific changes in aortic microstructure and material properties that result from a wide range of mechanobiological insults. Assessments of TAA progression in vivo is largely limited to measurements of aneurysm size and growth rate. It has been shown that aortic geometry alone is not sufficient to predict the patient-specific progression of TAA but computational modeling of the evolving biomechanics of the aorta could predict future geometry and properties from initiating insults. In this work, we present an integrated framework to train a deep operator network (DeepONet)-based surrogate model to identify contributing factors for TAA by using FE-based datasets of aortic growth and remodeling resulting from prescribed insults. For training data, we investigate multiple types of TAA risk factors and spatial distributions within a constrained mixture model to generate axial--azimuthal maps of aortic dilatation and distensibility. The trained network is then capable of predicting the initial distribution and extent of the insult from a given set of dilatation and distensibility information. Two DeepONet frameworks are proposed, one trained on sparse information and one on full-field grayscale images, to gain insight into a preferred neural operator-based approach. Performance of the surrogate models is evaluated through multiple simulations carried out on insult distributions varying from fusiform to complex. We show that the proposed approach can predict patient-specific mechanobiological insult profile with a high accuracy, particularly when based on full-field images. ",

Such movements pose challenges in protecting the security and privacy of business data between access points. This paper introduces a new architecture and protocol to tackle a use case for the financial industry. The solution assumes deploying a credit assessment model on an edge server. The model accepts and processes encrypted data submitted by potential customers seeking online credit assessments. The encrypted assessment results are sent back to the customers for decryption and interpretation. The data transmission rides on asynchronous communication, and the data protection uses Homomorphic Encryption.

Existing tools fail to identify these cultural differences and are geared towards software engineering which reduces their adoption in ML projects. In our approach we attempt to resolve this problem by exploring the use of context which includes i) purpose of the source code, ii) technical domain, iii) problem domain, iv) team norms, v) operational environment, and vi) development lifecycle stage to provide contextualised error reporting for code analysis. To demonstrate our approach, we adapt Pylint as an example and apply a set of contextual transformations to the linting results based on the domain of individual project files under analysis.

    "abstract": "Face presentation attack detection (PAD) has been extensively studied by research communities to enhance the security of face recognition systems. Although existing methods have achieved good performance on testing data with similar distribution as the training data, their performance degrades severely in application scenarios with data of unseen distributions. In situations where the training and testing data are drawn from different domains, a typical approach is to apply domain adaptation techniques to improve face PAD performance with the help of target domain data. However, it has always been a non-trivial challenge to collect sufficient data samples in the target domain, especially for attack samples. This paper introduces a teacher-student framework to improve the cross-domain performance of face PAD with one-class domain adaptation. In addition to the source domain data, the framework utilizes only a few genuine face samples of the target domain. Under this framework, a teacher network is trained with source domain samples to provide discriminative feature representations for face PAD. Student networks are trained to mimic the teacher network and learn similar representations for genuine face samples of the target domain. In the test phase, the similarity score between the representations of the teacher and student networks is used to distinguish attacks from genuine ones. To evaluate the proposed framework under one-class domain adaptation settings, we devised two new protocols and conducted extensive experiments. The experimental results show that our method outperforms baselines under one-class domain adaptation settings and even state-of-the-art methods with unsupervised domain adaptation. ",

To address this issue, in this paper we propose Deep Embedded Multi-view Clustering via Jointly Learning Latent Representations and Graphs (DMVCJ), which utilizes the latent graphs to promote the performance of deep embedded MVC models from two aspects. Firstly, by learning the latent graphs and feature representations jointly, the graph convolution network (GCN) technique becomes available for our model. With the capability of GCN in exploiting the information from both graphs and features, the clustering performance of our model is significantly promoted. Secondly, based on the adjacency relations of nodes shown in the latent graphs, we design a sample-weighting strategy to alleviate the noisy issue, and further improve the effectiveness and robustness of the model. Experimental results on different types of real-world multi-view datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of DMVCJ. ",

To address this problem, we propose the first end-to-end framework for data-free adversarial knowledge distillation on graph structured data (DFAD-GNN). To be specific, our DFAD-GNN employs a generative adversarial network, which mainly consists of three components: a pre-trained teacher model and a student model are regarded as two discriminators, and a generator is utilized for deriving training graphs to distill knowledge from the teacher model into the student model.

Though optimal transportation has shown convincing results in aligning different distributions, we find that the small perturbations in the images would significantly misguide the optimal transportation and thus degrade the model performance. To relieve the misalignment, we first propose a novel adversarial data augmentation method, namely Perturbation-Guided Adversarial Alignment (PGADA), which generates the hard examples in a self-supervised manner. In addition, we introduce Regularized Optimal Transportation to derive a smooth optimal transportation plan.

The IGGNet contains two key ingredients, i.e., a Geometry-Aware Attention (GAA) module and an Iterative Cross Guidance (ICG) strategy. The GAA module relies on the epipolar geometry cues and learns the geometry-aware guidance from one view to another, which is beneficial to make the corresponding regions in two views consistent. However, learning guidance from co-existing missing regions is challenging. To address this issue, the ICG strategy is proposed, which can alternately narrow down the missing regions of the two views in an iterative manner.

However, generating hard positives, which is essential for obtaining robustness, is still limited to hard-coded or global augmentations. In this work we propose an adversarial method to guide the creation of hard positives for training image retrieval networks.

    "title": "It's the Same Old Story! Enriching Event-Centric Knowledge Graphs by  Narrative Aspects",
    "abstract": "Our lives are ruled by events of varying importance ranging from simple everyday occurrences to incidents of societal dimension. And a lot of effort is taken to exchange information and discuss about such events: generally speaking, stringent narratives are formed to reduce complexity. But when considering complex events like the current conflict between Russia and Ukraine it is easy to see that those events cannot be grasped by objective facts alone, like the start of the conflict or respective troop sizes. There are different viewpoints and assessments to consider, a different understanding of the roles taken by individual participants, etc. So how can such subjective and viewpoint-dependent information be effectively represented together with all objective information? Recently event-centric knowledge graphs have been proposed for objective event representation in the otherwise primarily entity-centric domain of knowledge graphs. In this paper we introduce a novel and lightweight structure for event-centric knowledge graphs, which for the first time allows for queries incorporating viewpoint-dependent and narrative aspects. Our experiments prove the effective incorporation of subjective attributions for event participants and show the benefits of specifically tailored indexes for narrative query processing. ",

    "abstract": "Decentralized stochastic optimization is the basic building block of modern collaborative machine learning, distributed estimation and control, and large-scale sensing. Since involved data usually contain sensitive information like user locations, healthcare records and financial transactions, privacy protection has become an increasingly pressing need in the implementation of decentralized stochastic optimization algorithms. In this paper, we propose a decentralized stochastic gradient descent algorithm which is embedded with inherent privacy protection for every participating agent against other participating agents and external eavesdroppers. This proposed algorithm builds in a dynamics based gradient-obfuscation mechanism to enable privacy protection without compromising optimization accuracy, which is in significant difference from differential-privacy based privacy solutions for decentralized optimization that have to trade optimization accuracy for privacy. The dynamics based privacy approach is encryption-free, and hence avoids incurring heavy communication or computation overhead, which is a common problem with encryption based privacy solutions for decentralized stochastic optimization. Besides rigorously characterizing the convergence performance of the proposed decentralized stochastic gradient descent algorithm under both convex objective functions and non-convex objective functions, we also provide rigorous information-theoretic analysis of its strength of privacy protection. Simulation results for a distributed estimation problem as well as numerical experiments for decentralized learning on a benchmark machine learning dataset confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

As a result researchers have proposed formal verification techniques for verifying neural network properties. While previous efforts have mainly focused on checking local robustness in neural networks, we instead study another neural network security issue, namely data poisoning. In this case an attacker inserts a trigger into a subset of the training data, in such a way that at test time, this trigger in an input causes the trained model to misclassify to some target class. We show how to formulate the check for data poisoning as a property that can be checked with off-the-shelf verification tools, such as Marabou and nneum, where counterexamples of failed checks constitute the triggers. We further show that the discovered triggers are `transferable' from a small model to a larger, better-trained model, allowing us to analyze state-of-the art performant models trained for image classification tasks.

    "abstract": "We propose a novel convolutional operator for the task of point cloud completion. One striking characteristic of our approach is that, conversely to related work it does not require any max-pooling or voxelization operation. Instead, the proposed operator used to learn the point cloud embedding in the encoder extracts permutation-invariant features from the point cloud via a soft-pooling of feature activations, which are able to preserve fine-grained geometric details. These features are then passed on to a decoder architecture. Due to the compression in the encoder, a typical limitation of this type of architectures is that they tend to lose parts of the input shape structure. We propose to overcome this limitation by using skip connections specifically devised for point clouds, where links between corresponding layers in the encoder and the decoder are established. As part of these connections, we introduce a transformation matrix that projects the features from the encoder to the decoder and vice-versa. The quantitative and qualitative results on the task of object completion from partial scans on the ShapeNet dataset show that incorporating our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in shape completion both at low and high resolutions.

In this paper, we present FOLPETTI, a MAB-based attack to dynamically follow the victim's channel selection in real-time. Compared to previous attacks implemented via DRL, FOLPETTI does not require recurrent training phases to capture the victim's behavior, allowing hence a continuous attack. We assess the validity of FOLPETTI by implementing it to launch a jamming attack. We evaluate its performance against a victim performing random channel selection and a victim implementing a MAB defence strategy. We assume that the victim detects an attack when more than $20\\%$ of the transmitted packets are not received, therefore this represents the limit for the attack to be stealthy. In this scenario, FOLPETTI achieves a $15\\%$ success rate for the victim's random channel selection strategy, close to the $17.5\\%$ obtained with a genie-aided approach. Conversely, the DRL-based approach reaches a success rate of $12.5\\%$, which is $5.5\\%$ less than FOLPETTI. We also confirm the results by confronting FOLPETTI with a MAB based channel hopping method. Finally, we show that FOLPETTI creates an additional energy demand independently from its success rate, therefore decreasing the lifetime of IoT devices. ",

In particular, we identify the ability to contest norms enforced by code as an important part of accountability in this context. Based on this analysis, we make the case for transparency enhancing technologies as security mechanisms that can support legal processes, in contrast to other types of accountability mechanisms for code.

This study shows that there are a practically infinite number of possible reconstructions, and each reconstruction leads to assigning a different identity to the respondents in the reconstructed data. The results reported by the Census Bureau researchers are based on just one of these infinite possible reconstructions and is easily refuted by an alternate reconstruction.

In this paper, we present an approach that uses synthetic training images from generative adversarial networks (GANs) for data augmentation to enhance the performance of Sorghum panicle detection and counting. Our method can generate synthetic high-resolution UAV RGB images with panicle labels by using image-to-image translation GANs with a limited ground truth dataset of real UAV RGB images.

    "abstract": "In the past few years, neural architecture search (NAS) has become an increasingly important tool within the deep learning community. Despite the many recent successes of NAS, current approaches still fall far short of the dream of automating an entire neural network architecture design from scratch. Most existing approaches require highly structured design spaces formulated manually by domain experts. In this work, we develop techniques that enable efficient NAS in a significantly larger design space. To accomplish this, we propose to perform NAS in an abstract search space of program properties. Our key insights are as follows: (1) the abstract search space is significantly smaller than the original search space, and (2) architectures with similar program properties also have similar performance; thus, we can search more efficiently in the abstract search space. To enable this approach, we also propose an efficient synthesis procedure, which accepts a set of promising program properties, and returns a satisfying neural architecture. We implement our approach, $\\alpha$NAS, within an evolutionary framework, where the mutations are guided by the program properties. Starting with a ResNet-34 model, $\\alpha$NAS produces a model with slightly improved accuracy on CIFAR-10 but 96% fewer parameters. On ImageNet, $\\alpha$NAS is able to improve over Vision Transformer (30% fewer FLOPS and parameters), ResNet-50 (23% fewer FLOPS, 14% fewer parameters), and EfficientNet (7% fewer FLOPS and parameters) without any degradation in accuracy.

Previous SOTA systems still employ a sequence-to-sequence generation method, which merely captures the table as a linear structure and is brittle when table layouts change. We seek to go beyond this paradigm by (1) effectively expressing the relations of content pieces in the table, and (2) making our model robust to content-invariant structural transformations. Accordingly, we propose an equivariance learning framework, which encodes tables with a structure-aware self-attention mechanism. This prunes the full self-attention structure into an order-invariant graph attention that captures the connected graph structure of cells belonging to the same row or column, and it differentiates between relevant cells and irrelevant cells from the structural perspective. Our framework also modifies the positional encoding mechanism to preserve the relative position of tokens in the same cell but enforce position invariance among different cells. Our technology is free to be plugged into existing table-to-text generation models, and has improved T5-based models to offer better performance on ToTTo and HiTab. Moreover, on a harder version of ToTTo, we preserve promising performance, while previous SOTA systems, even with transformation-based data augmentation, have seen significant performance drops.

Although previous approaches including these effects in model training successfully improved variation tolerance, they only considered part of the nonideal effects and relatively simple classification tasks. This paper proposes a joint hardware and software optimization strategy to design a hardware-robust IRC macro for object detection. We lower the cell current by using a low word-line voltage to enable a complete convolution calculation in one operation that minimizes the impact of nonlinear addition. We also implement ternary weight mapping and remove batch normalization for better tolerance against device variation, sense amplifier variation, and IR drop problem. An extra bias is included to overcome the limitation of the current sensing range. The proposed approach has been successfully applied to a complex object detection task with only 3.85\\% mAP drop, whereas a naive design suffers catastrophic failure under these nonideal effects. ",

First, a Gaussian-based guided training method is used to encode the quality of the grasp point and grasp angle in the grasp pose, highlighting the highest-quality grasp point position and grasp angle and reducing the generation of false-positive grasps. Simultaneously, deformable convolution is used to obtain the shape features of the object in order to guide the subsequent network to the position. Furthermore, a global-local feature fusion method is introduced in order to efficiently obtain finer features during the feature reconstruction stage, allowing the network to focus on the features of the grasped objects.

    "abstract": "This work aims to tackle Model Inversion (MI) attack on Split Federated Learning (SFL). SFL is a recent distributed training scheme where multiple clients send intermediate activations (i.e., feature map), instead of raw data, to a central server. While such a scheme helps reduce the computational load at the client end, it opens itself to reconstruction of raw data from intermediate activation by the server. Existing works on protecting SFL only consider inference and do not handle attacks during training. So we propose ResSFL, a Split Federated Learning Framework that is designed to be MI-resistant during training. It is based on deriving a resistant feature extractor via attacker-aware training, and using this extractor to initialize the client-side model prior to standard SFL training. Such a method helps in reducing the computational complexity due to use of strong inversion model in client-side adversarial training as well as vulnerability of attacks launched in early training epochs. On CIFAR-100 dataset, our proposed framework successfully mitigates MI attack on a VGG-11 model with a high reconstruction Mean-Square-Error of 0.050 compared to 0.005 obtained by the baseline system.

Specifically, we first design an Exemplar-based Deep Neural network (ExDNN) to learn local time series representations based on their compatibility with an exemplar module which consists of hidden parameters learned to capture varieties of normal patterns on each edge device. Next, a constrained clustering mechanism (FedCC) is employed on the centralized server to align and aggregate the parameters of different local exemplar modules to obtain a unified global exemplar module. Finally, the global exemplar module is deployed together with a shared feature encoder to each edge device and anomaly detection is conducted by examining the compatibility of testing data to the exemplar module. Fed-ExDNN captures local normal time series patterns with ExDNN and aggregates these patterns by FedCC, and thus can handle the heterogeneous data distributed over different edge devices simultaneously. Thoroughly empirical studies on six public datasets show that ExDNN and Fed-ExDNN can outperform state-of-the-art anomaly detection algorithms and federated learning techniques. ",

Most related prior works are on incremental object detection that rely on the availability of abundant training samples per novel class that substantially limits the scalability to real-world setting where novel data can be scarce. In this paper, we propose the Incremental-DETR that does incremental few-shot object detection via fine-tuning and self-supervised learning on the DETR object detector. To alleviate severe over-fitting with few novel class data, we first fine-tune the class-specific components of DETR with self-supervision from additional object proposals generated using Selective Search as pseudo labels. We further introduce a incremental few-shot fine-tuning strategy with knowledge distillation on the class-specific components of DETR to encourage the network in detecting novel classes without catastrophic forgetting. Extensive experiments conducted on standard incremental object detection and incremental few-shot object detection settings show that our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a large margin.

While most existing approaches ignore the visual appearance-motion information at different temporal scales, it is unknown how to incorporate the multilevel processing capacity of a deep learning model with such multiscale information. Targeting these issues, this paper proposes a novel Multilevel Hierarchical Network (MHN) with multiscale sampling for VideoQA. MHN comprises two modules, namely Recurrent Multimodal Interaction (RMI) and Parallel Visual Reasoning (PVR). With a multiscale sampling, RMI iterates the interaction of appearance-motion information at each scale and the question embeddings to build the multilevel question-guided visual representations. Thereon, with a shared transformer encoder, PVR infers the visual cues at each level in parallel to fit with answering different question types that may rely on the visual information at relevant levels. Through extensive experiments on three VideoQA datasets, we demonstrate improved performances than previous state-of-the-arts and justify the effectiveness of each part of our method. ",

Their ability to boost a model's robustness depends on two factors, viz-a-viz, the model architecture, and the type of augmentations. Augmentations are very specific to a dataset, and it is not imperative that all kinds of augmentation would necessarily produce a positive effect on a model's performance. Hence there is a need to identify augmentations that perform consistently well across a variety of datasets and also remain invariant to the type of architecture, convolutions, and the number of parameters used. Hence there is a need to identify augmentations that perform consistently well across a variety of datasets and also remain invariant to the type of architecture, convolutions, and the number of parameters used. This paper evaluates the effect of parameters using 3x3 and depth-wise separable convolutions on different augmentation techniques on MNIST, FMNIST, and CIFAR10 datasets. Statistical Evidence shows that techniques such as Cutouts and Random horizontal flip were consistent on both parametrically low and high architectures. Depth-wise separable convolutions outperformed 3x3 convolutions at higher parameters due to their ability to create deeper networks. Augmentations resulted in bridging the accuracy gap between the 3x3 and depth-wise separable convolutions, thus establishing their role in model generalization. At higher number augmentations did not produce a significant change in performance. The synergistic effect of multiple augmentations at higher parameters, with antagonistic effect at lower parameters, was also evaluated. The work proves that a delicate balance between architectural supremacy and augmentations needs to be achieved to enhance a model's performance in any given deep learning task. ",

However, due to the defects of the human-annotated language corpus, multimodal supervision remains unexplored in fully supervised object detection scenarios. In this paper, we take advantage of language prompt to introduce effective and unbiased linguistic supervision into object detection, and propose a new mechanism called multimodal knowledge learning (\\textbf{MKL}), which is required to learn knowledge from language supervision. Specifically, we design prompts and fill them with the bounding box annotations to generate descriptions containing extensive hints and context for instances recognition and localization. The knowledge from language is then distilled into the detection model via maximizing cross-modal mutual information in both image- and object-level. Moreover, the generated descriptions are manipulated to produce hard negatives to further boost the detector performance.

    "abstract": "Recent advances in 3D human shape reconstruction from single images have shown impressive results, leveraging on deep networks that model the so-called implicit function to learn the occupancy status of arbitrarily dense 3D points in space. However, while current algorithms based on this paradigm, like PiFuHD, are able to estimate accurate geometry of the human shape and clothes, they require high-resolution input images and are not able to capture complex body poses. Most training and evaluation is performed on 1k-resolution images of humans standing in front of the camera under neutral body poses. In this paper, we leverage publicly available data to extend existing implicit function-based models to deal with images of humans that can have arbitrary poses and self-occluded limbs. We argue that the representation power of the implicit function is not sufficient to simultaneously model details of the geometry and of the body pose. We, therefore, propose a coarse-to-fine approach in which we first learn an implicit function that maps the input image to a 3D body shape with a low level of detail, but which correctly fits the underlying human pose, despite its complexity. We then learn a displacement map, conditioned on the smoothed surface and on the input image, which encodes the high-frequency details of the clothes and body. In the experimental section, we show that this coarse-to-fine strategy represents a very good trade-off between shape detail and pose correctness, comparing favorably to the most recent state-of-the-art approaches. Our code will be made publicly available. ",

The achievement of combat effectiveness requires CSOS to have a good ability to deal with external interference. From the perspective of complex networks, the modeling of CSOS is carried out, and the robustness of the combat network is explored based on this. Firstly, a more realistic double-layer heterogeneous interdependent combat network model is established. Then, the conditional group dependency situation is considered to design failure rules for dependent failure, and the coupling relation between the double-layer subnets is analysed for cascading failure. Furthermore, the initial load and capacity of the node are defined, respectively, as well as the load redistribution strategy and the status judgment rules for the cascading failure model. Simulation experiments are carried out by changing the attack modes and different parameters, and the results show that the robustness of the combat network can be effectively improved by improving the tolerance limit of one-way dependency of the functional net, the node capacity of the functional net and the tolerance of the overload state. The conclusions of this paper can provide a useful reference for the network structure optimization and network security protection in military field. ",

    "abstract": "Knowledge graph completion (KGC) aims to infer missing knowledge triples based on known facts in a knowledge graph. Current KGC research mostly follows an entity ranking protocol, wherein the effectiveness is measured by the predicted rank of a masked entity in a test triple. The overall performance is then given by a micro(-average) metric over all individual answer entities. Due to the incomplete nature of the large-scale knowledge bases, such an entity ranking setting is likely affected by unlabelled top-ranked positive examples, raising questions on whether the current evaluation protocol is sufficient to guarantee a fair comparison of KGC systems. To this end, this paper presents a systematic study on whether and how the label sparsity affects the current KGC evaluation with the popular micro metrics. Specifically, inspired by the TREC paradigm for large-scale information retrieval (IR) experimentation, we create a relatively \"complete\" judgment set based on a sample from the popular FB15k-237 dataset following the TREC pooling method. According to our analysis, it comes as a surprise that switching from the original labels to our \"complete\" labels results in a drastic change of system ranking of a variety of 13 popular KGC models in terms of micro metrics. Further investigation indicates that the IR-like macro(-average) metrics are more stable and discriminative under different settings, meanwhile, less affected by label sparsity. Thus, for KGC evaluation, we recommend conducting TREC-style pooling to balance between human efforts and label completeness, and reporting also the IR-like macro metrics to reflect the ranking nature of the KGC task.

In this paper, we investigate the generalisability property of ML-based NIDSs by extensively evaluating seven supervised and unsupervised learning models on four recently published benchmark NIDS datasets. Our investigation indicates that none of the considered models is able to generalise over all studied datasets. Interestingly, our results also indicate that the generalisability has a high degree of asymmetry, i.e., swapping the source and target domains can significantly change the classification performance. Our investigation also indicates that overall, unsupervised learning methods generalise better than supervised learning models in our considered scenarios. Using SHAP values to explain these results indicates that the lack of generalisability is mainly due to the presence of strong correspondence between the values of one or more features and Attack/Benign classes in one dataset-model combination and its absence in other datasets that have different feature distributions.

This has led to research attention on domain generalization (DG), which aims to the model's generalization ability to out-of-distribution. Adversarial domain generalization is a popular approach to DG, but conventional approaches (1) struggle to sufficiently align features so that local neighborhoods are mixed across domains; and (2) can suffer from feature space over collapse which can threaten generalization performance. To address these limitations, we propose localized adversarial domain generalization with space compactness maintenance~(LADG) which constitutes two major contributions. First, we propose an adversarial localized classifier as the domain discriminator, along with a principled primary branch. This constructs a min-max game whereby the aim of the featurizer is to produce locally mixed domains. Second, we propose to use a coding-rate loss to alleviate feature space over collapse. We conduct comprehensive experiments on the Wilds DG benchmark to validate our approach, where LADG outperforms leading competitors on most datasets. ",

Federated learning models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks such as model-update attacks or data poisoning. In this work, we study an FMAB problem in the presence of Byzantine clients who can send false model updates that pose a threat to the learning process. We borrow tools from robust statistics and propose a median-of-means-based estimator: Fed-MoM-UCB, to cope with the Byzantine clients. We show that if the Byzantine clients constitute at most half the cohort, it is possible to incur a cumulative regret on the order of ${\\cal O} (\\log T)$ with respect to an unavoidable error margin, including the communication cost between the clients and the parameter server. We analyze the interplay between the algorithm parameters, unavoidable error margin, regret, communication cost, and the arms' suboptimality gaps.

However, tactile sensors on multi-fingered hands have a variety of sizes and shapes. Convolutional neural networks (CNN) can be useful for processing tactile information, but the information from multi-fingered hands needs an arbitrary pre-processing, as CNNs require a rectangularly shaped input, which may lead to unstable results. Therefore, how to process such complex shaped tactile information and utilize it for achieving manipulation skills is still an open issue. This paper presents a control method based on a graph convolutional network (GCN) which extracts geodesical features from the tactile data with complicated sensor alignments. Moreover, object property labels are provided to the GCN to adjust in-hand manipulation motions. Distributed tri-axial tactile sensors are mounted on the fingertips, finger phalanges and palm of an Allegro hand, resulting in 1152 tactile measurements. Training data is collected with a data-glove to transfer human dexterous manipulation directly to the robot hand. The GCN achieved high success rates for in-hand manipulation. We also confirmed that fragile objects were deformed less when correct object labels were provided to the GCN. When visualizing the activation of the GCN with a PCA, we verified that the network acquired geodesical features.

The key enablers of our system are two carefully designed neural networks: an IRHairNet (Implicit representation for hair using neural network) for inferring high-fidelity 3D hair geometric features (3D orientation field and 3D occupancy field) hierarchically and a GrowingNet(Growing hair strands using neural network) to efficiently generate 3D hair strands in parallel. Specifically, we perform a coarse-to-fine manner and propose a novel voxel-aligned implicit function (VIFu) to represent the global hair feature, which is further enhanced by the local details extracted from a hair luminance map. To improve the efficiency of a traditional hair growth algorithm, we adopt a local neural implicit function to grow strands based on the estimated 3D hair geometric features.

This objective encourages local neighborhood features in feature space to have similar predictions while features farther away in feature space have dissimilar predictions, leading to efficient feature clustering and cluster assignment simultaneously. For efficient training, we seek to optimize an upper-bound of the objective which contains two simple terms. Furthermore, we relate popular existing methods in domain adaptation, source-free domain adaptation and contrastive learning via the perspective of discriminability and diversity. The experimental results prove the superiority of our method, and our method can be adopted as a simple but strong baseline for future research in SFDA.

However, existing models answer poorly for complex reasoning questions with attributes or relations, which causes false attribute selection or missing relation in Figure 1(a). It is because these models cannot balance all kinds of information in scene graphs, neglecting relation and attribute information. In this paper, we introduce a novel Dual Message-passing enhanced Graph Neural Network (DM-GNN), which can obtain a balanced representation by properly encoding multi-scale scene graph information. Specifically, we (i)transform the scene graph into two graphs with diversified focuses on objects and relations; Then we design a dual structure to encode them, which increases the weights from relations (ii)fuse the encoder output with attribute features, which increases the weights from attributes; (iii)propose a message-passing mechanism to enhance the information transfer between objects, relations and attributes. We conduct extensive experiments on datasets including GQA, VG, motif-VG and achieve new state of the art. ",

    "abstract": "The performance of highly parallel applications on distributed-memory systems is influenced by many factors. Analytic performance modeling techniques aim to provide insight into performance limitations and are often the starting point of optimization efforts. However, coupling analytic models across the system hierarchy (socket, node, network) fails to encompass the intricate interplay between the program code and the hardware, especially when execution and communication bottlenecks are involved. In this paper we investigate the effect of \"bottleneck evasion\" and how it can lead to automatic overlap of communication overhead with computation. Bottleneck evasion leads to a gradual loss of the initial bulk-synchronous behavior of a parallel code so that its processes become desynchronized. This occurs most prominently in memory-bound programs, which is why we choose memory-bound benchmark and application codes, specifically an MPI-augmented STREAM Triad, sparse matrix-vector multiplication, and a collective-avoiding Chebyshev filter diagonalization code to demonstrate the consequences of desynchronization on two different supercomputing platforms. We investigate the role of idle waves as possible triggers for desynchronization and show the impact of automatic asynchronous communication for a spectrum of code properties and parameters, such as saturation point, matrix structures, domain decomposition, and communication concurrency. Our findings reveal how eliminating synchronization points (such as collective communication or barriers) precipitates performance improvements that go beyond what can be expected by simply subtracting the overhead of the collective from the overall runtime.

However, these methods assume demonstrations are optimal, and that policy stabilization can be learned via simple augmentations. In real-world scenarios, demonstrations are often of diverse-quality, and disturbance injection instead learns sub-optimal policies that fail to replicate desired behavior. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel imitation learning framework that combines both policy robustification and optimal demonstration learning. Specifically, this combinatorial approach forces policy learning and disturbance injection optimization to focus on mainly learning from high task achievement demonstrations, while utilizing low achievement ones to decrease the number of samples needed. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified through experiments using an excavation task in both simulations and a real robot, resulting in high-achieving policies that are more stable and robust to diverse-quality demonstrations. In addition, this method utilizes all of the weighted sub-optimal demonstrations without eliminating them, resulting in practical data efficiency benefits. ",

Semantic segmentation models have gained importance since they allow for more precise examination. These models, however, require large image datasets in order to achieve a fair accuracy level. In some cases, training data is sparse or lacks of sufficient annotation, a fact that especially applies to highly specialized production environments. Data augmentation represents a common strategy to extend the dataset. Still, it only varies the image within a narrow range. In this article, a novel strategy is proposed to augment small image datasets. The approach is applied to surface monitoring of carbon fibers, a specific industry use case. We apply two different methods to create binary labels: a problem-tailored trigonometric function and a WGAN model. Afterwards, the labels are translated into color images using pix2pix and used to train a U-Net. The results suggest that the trigonometric function is superior to the WGAN model. However, a precise examination of the resulting images indicate that WGAN and image-to-image translation achieve good segmentation results and only deviate to a small degree from traditional data augmentation. In summary, this study examines an industry application of data synthesization using generative adversarial networks and explores its potential for monitoring systems of production environments. \\keywords{Image-to-Image Translation, Carbon Fiber, Data Augmentation, Computer Vision, Industrial Monitoring, Adversarial Learning.

There are many challenges to accurate and timely diagnosis of the disease. This research presents a novel scheme based on a deep neural network to overcome the mentioned challenges. Due to the limited number of data, the transfer learning technique is employed with the help of two well-known architectures. In this way, a new effective model is adopted by a combination of pre-trained MobileNetV2 and Inception Networks due to their effective performance on object detection problems. The convolution layers of MoblieNetV2 and Inception modules are parallelly arranged as earlier layers to extract crucial features. In addition, the imbalance problem of classes has been solved by an augmentation strategy. The proposed scheme has a superior performance compared to other state-of-the-art models published in recent years. The accuracy of the model reaches 97%, approximately. In summary, experimental results prove the method's validity and significant performance in diagnosing disease in plant leaves. ",

Especially, construct-driven CAD -- perturbations of core features -- may induce models to ignore the context in which core features are used. Here, we test models for sexism and hate speech detection on challenging data: non-hateful and non-sexist usage of identity and gendered terms.

Recent work has pointed out two kinds of risks in these systems: that technical problems like bugs and vulnerabilities can spread through dependency links, and that relatively few developers are responsible for maintaining even the most widely used libraries. However, a more holistic diagnosis of systemic risk in software ecosystem should consider how these social and technical sources of risk interact and amplify one another. Motivated by the observation that the same individuals maintain several libraries within dependency networks, we present a methodological framework to measure risk in software ecosystems as a function of both dependencies and developers. In our models, a library's chance of failure increases as its developers leave and as its upstream dependencies fail. We apply our method to data from the Rust ecosystem, highlighting several systemically important libraries that are overlooked when only considering technical dependencies. We compare potential interventions, seeking better ways to deploy limited developer resources with a view to improving overall ecosystem health and software supply chain resilience. ",

The direct alignment problem considers whether an AI system accomplishes the goals of the entity operating it. In contrast, the social alignment problem considers the effects of an AI system on larger groups or on society more broadly. In particular, it also considers whether the system imposes externalities on others. Whereas solutions to the direct alignment problem center around more robust implementation, social alignment problems typically arise because of conflicts between individual and group-level goals, elevating the importance of AI governance to mediate such conflicts. Addressing the social alignment problem requires both enforcing existing norms on their developers and operators and designing new norms that apply directly to AI systems. ",

Self-supervised learning (SSL) is a training method to learn data-specific features without manual annotation. Several SSL-based models have been employed in medical image anomaly detection. These SSL methods effectively learn representations in several field-specific images, such as natural and industrial product images. However, owing to the requirement of medical expertise, typical SSL-based models are inefficient in medical image anomaly detection. We present an SSL-based model that enables anatomical structure-based unsupervised anomaly detection (UAD). The model employs the anatomy-aware pasting (AnatPaste) augmentation tool. AnatPaste employs a threshold-based lung segmentation pretext task to create anomalies in normal chest radiographs, which are used for model pretraining. These anomalies are similar to real anomalies and help the model recognize them. We evaluate our model on three opensource chest radiograph datasets. Our model exhibit area under curves (AUC) of 92.1%, 78.7%, and 81.9%, which are the highest among existing UAD models. This is the first SSL model to employ anatomical information as a pretext task. AnatPaste can be applied in various deep learning models and downstream tasks. It can be employed for other modalities by fixing appropriate segmentation.

In this paper, we propose the Machine Learning based Propagation Loss (MLPL) module for ns-3. Based on network traces collected in an experimental testbed, the MLPL module estimates the propagation loss as the sum of a deterministic path loss and a stochastic fast-fading loss. The MLPL module is validated with unit tests. Moreover, we test the MLPL module with real network traces, and compare the results obtained with existing propagation loss models in ns-3 and real experimental results. The results obtained show that the MLPL module can accurately predict the propagation loss observed in a real environment and reproduce the experimental conditions of a given testbed, enabling the creation of digital twins of wireless network environments in ns-3.

Most of the latest approaches in malware detection use Machine Learning (ML). Against the robustifying effort of detection systems, raise the \\emph{evasion attacks}, where an adversary changes its targeted samples so that they are misclassified as benign. This paper considers two kinds of evasion attacks: feature-space and problem-space. \\emph{Feature-space} attacks consider an adversary who manipulates ML features to evade the correct classification while minimizing or constraining the total manipulations. \\textit{Problem-space} attacks refer to evasion attacks that change the actual sample. Specifically, this paper analyzes the gap between these two types in the Android malware domain. The gap between the two types of evasion attacks is examined via the retraining process of classifiers using each one of the evasion attack types. The experiments show that the gap between these two types of retrained classifiers is dramatic and may increase to 96\\%. Retrained classifiers of feature-space evasion attacks have been found to be either less effective or completely ineffective against problem-space evasion attacks. Additionally, exploration of different problem-space evasion attacks shows that retraining of one problem-space evasion attack may be effective against other problem-space evasion attacks. ",

    "abstract": "Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) is one of the most essential techniques in many real-world robotic applications. The assumption of static environments is common in most SLAM algorithms, which however, is not the case for most applications. Recent work on semantic SLAM aims to understand the objects in an environment and distinguish dynamic information from a scene context by performing image-based segmentation. However, the segmentation results are often imperfect or incomplete, which can subsequently reduce the quality of mapping and the accuracy of localization. In this paper, we present a robust multi-modal semantic framework to solve the SLAM problem in complex and highly dynamic environments. We propose to learn a more powerful object feature representation and deploy the mechanism of looking and thinking twice to the backbone network, which leads to a better recognition result to our baseline instance segmentation model. Moreover, both geometric-only clustering and visual semantic information are combined to reduce the effect of segmentation error due to small-scale objects, occlusion and motion blur. Thorough experiments have been conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed method. The results show that our method can precisely identify dynamic objects under recognition imperfection and motion blur. Moreover, the proposed SLAM framework is able to efficiently build a static dense map at a processing rate of more than 10 Hz, which can be implemented in many practical applications.

This model is widely accepted as providing the adequate framework for formalizing the synthesis question for reactive systems. This important application motivates the question of strategy complexity: which valuations (or payoff functions) admit optimal positional strategies (without memory)? Valuations for which both players have optimal positional strategies have been characterized by Gimbert and Zielonka for finite graphs and by Colcombet and Niwi\\'nski for infinite graphs. However, for reactive synthesis, existence of optimal positional strategies for the opponent (which models an antagonistic environment) is irrelevant. Despite this fact, not much is known about valuations for which the protagonist admits optimal positional strategies, regardless of the opponent. In this work, we characterize valuations which admit such strategies over infinite graphs. Our characterization uses the vocabulary of universal graphs, which has also proved useful in understanding recent breakthrough results regarding the complexity of parity games. More precisely, we show that a valuation admitting universal graphs which are monotonic and well-ordered is positional over all game graphs, and -- more surprisingly -- that the converse is also true for valuations admitting neutral colors. We prove the applicability and elegance of the framework by unifying a number of known positionality results, proving a few stronger ones, and establishing closure under lexicographical products. ",

Nowadays, machine learning approaches show promising performance in modeling real-world complex traffic. However, most existing works assumed that model training and evaluation data came from identical distribution. But in practice, there is a high probability that the model will deal with data from a slightly or entirely unknown distribution in the deployment phase. This paper investigated and evaluated machine learning performances using eXtreme Gradient Boosting, Light Gradient Boosting Machine, Stochastic Gradient Descent, Gradient Boosting Regressor, CatBoost Regressor, and their stacked ensemble model using data from both identical and out-of distribution. Also, we proposed a hybrid machine learning model integrating wavelet decomposition for improving out-of-distribution prediction as standalone models were unable to generalize very well. Our experimental results show the best performance of the standalone ensemble model with an accuracy of 96.4%, while the hybrid ensemble model improved it by 1% for in-distribution data. But its performance dropped significantly when tested with three different datasets having a distribution shift than the training set. However, our proposed hybrid model considerably reduces the performance gap between identical and out-of-distribution evaluation compared with the standalone model, indicating the decomposition technique's effectiveness in the case of out-of-distribution generalization.

    "abstract": "We present Panoptic Neural Fields (PNF), an object-aware neural scene representation that decomposes a scene into a set of objects (things) and background (stuff). Each object is represented by an oriented 3D bounding box and a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) that takes position, direction, and time and outputs density and radiance. The background stuff is represented by a similar MLP that additionally outputs semantic labels. Each object MLPs are instance-specific and thus can be smaller and faster than previous object-aware approaches, while still leveraging category-specific priors incorporated via meta-learned initialization. Our model builds a panoptic radiance field representation of any scene from just color images. We use off-the-shelf algorithms to predict camera poses, object tracks, and 2D image semantic segmentations. Then we jointly optimize the MLP weights and bounding box parameters using analysis-by-synthesis with self-supervision from color images and pseudo-supervision from predicted semantic segmentations. During experiments with real-world dynamic scenes, we find that our model can be used effectively for several tasks like novel view synthesis, 2D panoptic segmentation, 3D scene editing, and multiview depth prediction.

    "abstract": "Automotive embedded algorithms have very high constraints in terms of latency, accuracy and power consumption. In this work, we propose to train spiking neural networks (SNNs) directly on data coming from event cameras to design fast and efficient automotive embedded applications. Indeed, SNNs are more biologically realistic neural networks where neurons communicate using discrete and asynchronous spikes, a naturally energy-efficient and hardware friendly operating mode. Event data, which are binary and sparse in space and time, are therefore the ideal input for spiking neural networks. But to date, their performance was insufficient for automotive real-world problems, such as detecting complex objects in an uncontrolled environment. To address this issue, we took advantage of the latest advancements in matter of spike backpropagation - surrogate gradient learning, parametric LIF, SpikingJelly framework - and of our new \\textit{voxel cube} event encoding to train 4 different SNNs based on popular deep learning networks: SqueezeNet, VGG, MobileNet, and DenseNet. As a result, we managed to increase the size and the complexity of SNNs usually considered in the literature. In this paper, we conducted experiments on two automotive event datasets, establishing new state-of-the-art classification results for spiking neural networks. Based on these results, we combined our SNNs with SSD to propose the first spiking neural networks capable of performing object detection on the complex GEN1 Automotive Detection event dataset. ",

    "abstract": "Efficient prediction of internet traffic is an essential part of Self Organizing Network (SON) for ensuring proactive management. There are many existing solutions for internet traffic prediction with higher accuracy using deep learning. But designing individual predictive models for each service provider in the network is challenging due to data heterogeneity, scarcity, and abnormality. Moreover, the performance of the deep sequence model in network traffic prediction with limited training data has not been studied extensively in the current works. In this paper, we investigated and evaluated the performance of the deep transfer learning technique in traffic prediction with inadequate historical data leveraging the knowledge of our pre-trained model. First, we used a comparatively larger real-world traffic dataset for source domain prediction based on five different deep sequence models: Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), LSTM Encoder-Decoder (LSTM_En_De), LSTM_En_De with Attention layer (LSTM_En_De_Atn), and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU). Then, two best-performing models, LSTM_En_De and LSTM_En_De_Atn, from the source domain with an accuracy of 96.06% and 96.05% are considered for the target domain prediction. Finally, four smaller traffic datasets collected for four particular sources and destination pairs are used in the target domain to compare the performance of the standard learning and transfer learning in terms of accuracy and execution time. According to our experimental result, transfer learning helps to reduce the execution time for most cases, while the model's accuracy is improved in transfer learning with a larger training session.

    "abstract": "Along with the popularity of Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques, an increasing number of backdoor injection attacks are designed to maliciously threaten Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) deployed in safety-critical systems. Although there exist various defense methods that can effectively erase backdoor triggers from DNNs, they still greatly suffer from a non-negligible Attack Success Rate (ASR) as well as a major loss in benign accuracy. Inspired by the observation that a backdoored DNN will form new clusters in its feature space for poisoned data, in this paper we propose a novel backdoor defense method named MCL based on model-contrastive learning. Specifically, model-contrastive learning to implement backdoor defense consists of two steps. First, we use the backdoor attack trigger synthesis technique to invert the trigger. Next, the inversion trigger is used to construct poisoned data, so that model-contrastive learning can be used, which makes the feature representations of poisoned data close to that of the benign data while staying away from the original poisoned feature representations. Through extensive experiments against five start-of-the-art attack methods on multiple benchmark datasets, using only 5% of clean data, MCL is more effective for reducing backdoor threats while maintaining higher accuracy of benign data. MCL can make the benign accuracy degenerate by less than 1%. ",

    "abstract": "Amazon Web Services (AWS) is a comprehensive and broadly adopted cloud provider, offering over 200 fully featured services, including compute, database, storage, networking and content delivery, machine learning, Internet of Things and many others. AWS SDKs provide access to AWS services through API endpoints. However, incorrect use of these APIs can lead to code defects, crashes, performance issues, and other problems. This paper presents automated static analysis rules, developed in the context of a commercial service for detection of code defects and security vulnerabilities, to identify deviations from AWS best practices in Python applications that use the AWS SDK. Such applications use the AWS SDK for Python, called \"Boto3\", to access AWS cloud services. However, precise static analysis of Python applications that use cloud SDKs requires robust type inference for inferring the types of cloud service clients. The dynamic style of Boto3 APIs poses unique challenges for type resolution, as does the interprocedural style in which service clients are used in practice. In support of our best-practices goal, we present a layered strategy for type inference that combines multiple type-resolution and tracking strategies in a staged manner. From our experiments across >3,000 popular Python GitHub repos that make use of the AWS SDK, our layered type inference system achieves 85% precision and 100% recall in inferring Boto3 clients in Python client code. Additionally, we present a representative sample of eight AWS best-practice rules that detect a wide range of issues including pagination, polling, and batch operations. We have assessed the efficacy of these rules based on real-world developer feedback. Developers have accepted more than 85% of the recommendations made by five out of eight Python rules, and almost 83% of all recommendations. ",

    "abstract": "Automatic Facial Expression Recognition (FER) has attracted increasing attention in the last 20 years since facial expressions play a central role in human communication. Most FER methodologies utilize Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) that are powerful tools when it comes to data analysis. However, despite their power, these networks are prone to overfitting, as they often tend to memorize the training data. What is more, there are not currently a lot of in-the-wild (i.e. in unconstrained environment) large databases for FER. To alleviate this issue, a number of data augmentation techniques have been proposed. Data augmentation is a way to increase the diversity of available data by applying constrained transformations on the original data. One such technique, which has positively contributed to various classification tasks, is Mixup. According to this, a DNN is trained on convex combinations of pairs of examples and their corresponding labels. In this paper, we examine the effectiveness of Mixup for in-the-wild FER in which data have large variations in head poses, illumination conditions, backgrounds and contexts. We then propose a new data augmentation strategy which is based on Mixup, called MixAugment. According to this, the network is trained concurrently on a combination of virtual examples and real examples; all these examples contribute to the overall loss function. We conduct an extensive experimental study that proves the effectiveness of MixAugment over Mixup and various state-of-the-art methods. We further investigate the combination of dropout with Mixup and MixAugment, as well as the combination of other data augmentation techniques with MixAugment. ",

In this paper, we develop a conformer-based waveform-domain neural AEC model inspired by the \"TasNet\" architecture. The model is trained by jointly optimizing Negative Scale-Invariant SNR (SISNR) and ASR losses on a large speech dataset. On a realistic rerecorded test set, we find that cascading a linear adaptive AEC and a waveform-domain neural AEC is very effective, giving 56-59% word error rate (WER) reduction over the linear AEC alone. On this test set, the 1.6M parameter waveform-domain neural AEC also improves over a larger 6.5M parameter logmel-domain neural AEC model by 20-29% in easy to moderate conditions. By operating on smaller frames, the waveform neural model is able to perform better at smaller sizes and is better suited for applications where memory is limited. ",

We demonstrate both in theory and practice that if the graphs come from different network classes, then clustering the networks into classes followed by matching the new graph to cluster-averages can yield higher fidelity matching performance than matching to the global average graph.

Recently, a new computational strategy for iterative methods called ARCHITECT was proposed by Li et al. in [1] that uses the redundant number representation to create \"stable digits\" in the Most-significant Digits (MSDs) of an iterate, allowing the future iterations to assume the stable MSDs have not changed their value, eliminating the need to recompute them. In this work, we present a theoretical analysis of how these \"stable digits\" arise in iterative methods by showing that a Fejer monotone sequence in the redundant number representation can develop stable MSDs in the elements of the sequence as the sequence grows in length. This property of Fejer monotone sequences allows us to expand the class of iterative methods known to have MSD stability when using the redundant number representation to include any fixed-point iteration of a contractive Lipschitz continuous function. We then show that this allows for the theoretical guarantee of digit stability not just in the Jacobi method that was previously analyzed by Li et al. in [2], but also in other commonly used methods such as Newton's method.

The mappings from current to voltage can be described by several kinds of models, such as accurate but inefficient physics-based models, and efficient but sometimes inaccurate equivalent circuit and black-box models. To realize accuracy and efficiency simultaneously in battery modeling, we propose to build a data-driven surrogate for a battery system while incorporating the underlying physics as constraints. In this work, we innovatively treat the functional mapping from current curve to terminal voltage as a composite of operators, which is approximated by the powerful deep operator network (DeepONet). Its learning capability is firstly verified through a predictive test for Li-ion concentration at two electrodes. In this experiment, the physics-informed DeepONet is found to be more robust than the purely data-driven DeepONet, especially in temporal extrapolation scenarios. A composite surrogate is then constructed for mapping current curve and solid diffusivity to terminal voltage with three operator networks, in which two parallel physics-informed DeepONets are firstly used to predict Li-ion concentration at two electrodes, and then based on their surface values, a DeepONet is built to give terminal voltage predictions. Since the surrogate is differentiable anywhere, it is endowed with the ability to learn from data directly, which was validated by using terminal voltage measurements to estimate input parameters. The proposed surrogate built upon operator networks possesses great potential to be applied in on-board scenarios, such as battery management system, since it integrates efficiency and accuracy by incorporating underlying physics, and also leaves an interface for model refinement through a totally differentiable model structure.

    "abstract": "Due to the sophisticated imaging process, an identical scene captured by different cameras could exhibit distinct imaging patterns, introducing distinct proficiency among the super-resolution (SR) models trained on images from different devices. In this paper, we investigate a novel and practical task coded cross-device SR, which strives to adapt a real-world SR model trained on the paired images captured by one camera to low-resolution (LR) images captured by arbitrary target devices. The proposed task is highly challenging due to the absence of paired data from various imaging devices. To address this issue, we propose an unsupervised domain adaptation mechanism for real-world SR, named Dual ADversarial Adaptation (DADA), which only requires LR images in the target domain with available real paired data from a source camera. DADA employs the Domain-Invariant Attention (DIA) module to establish the basis of target model training even without HR supervision. Furthermore, the dual framework of DADA facilitates an Inter-domain Adversarial Adaptation (InterAA) in one branch for two LR input images from two domains, and an Intra-domain Adversarial Adaptation (IntraAA) in two branches for an LR input image. InterAA and IntraAA together improve the model transferability from the source domain to the target. We empirically conduct experiments under six Real to Real adaptation settings among three different cameras, and achieve superior performance compared with existing state-of-the-art approaches. We also evaluate the proposed DADA to address the adaptation to the video camera, which presents a promising research topic to promote the wide applications of real-world super-resolution.

    "abstract": "Beamforming is a powerful tool designed to enhance speech signals from the direction of a target source. Computing the beamforming filter requires estimating spatial covariance matrices (SCMs) of the source and noise signals. Time-frequency masks are often used to compute these SCMs. Most studies of mask-based beamforming have assumed that the sources do not move. However, sources often move in practice, which causes performance degradation. In this paper, we address the problem of mask-based beamforming for moving sources. We first review classical approaches to tracking a moving source, which perform online or blockwise computation of the SCMs. We show that these approaches can be interpreted as computing a sum of instantaneous SCMs weighted by attention weights. These weights indicate which time frames of the signal to consider in the SCM computation. Online or blockwise computation assumes a heuristic and deterministic way of computing these attention weights that, although simple, may not result in optimal performance. We thus introduce a learning-based framework that computes optimal attention weights for beamforming. We achieve this using a neural network implemented with self-attention layers. We show experimentally that our proposed framework can greatly improve beamforming performance in moving source situations while maintaining high performance in non-moving situations, thus enabling the development of mask-based beamformers robust to source movements.

    "abstract": "Interplanetary coronal mass ejections (ICMEs) are one of the main drivers for space weather disturbances. In the past, different approaches have been used to automatically detect events in existing time series resulting from solar wind in situ observations. However, accurate and fast detection still remains a challenge when facing the large amount of data from different instruments. For the automatic detection of ICMEs we propose a pipeline using a method that has recently proven successful in medical image segmentation. Comparing it to an existing method, we find that while achieving similar results, our model outperforms the baseline regarding training time by a factor of approximately 20, thus making it more applicable for other datasets. The method has been tested on in situ data from the Wind spacecraft between 1997 and 2015 with a True Skill Statistic (TSS) of 0.64. Out of the 640 ICMEs, 466 were detected correctly by our algorithm, producing a total of 254 False Positives. Additionally, it produced reasonable results on datasets with fewer features and smaller training sets from Wind, STEREO-A and STEREO-B with True Skill Statistics of 0.56, 0.57 and 0.53, respectively. Our pipeline manages to find the start of an ICME with a mean absolute error (MAE) of around 2 hours and 56 minutes, and the end time with a MAE of 3 hours and 20 minutes. The relatively fast training allows straightforward tuning of hyperparameters and could therefore easily be used to detect other structures and phenomena in solar wind data, such as corotating interaction regions.

    "abstract": "The ever-growing multimedia traffic has underscored the importance of effective multimedia codecs. Among them, the up-to-date lossy video coding standard, Versatile Video Coding (VVC), has been attracting attentions of video coding community. However, the gain of VVC is achieved at the cost of significant encoding complexity, which brings the need to realize fast encoder with comparable Rate Distortion (RD) performance. In this paper, we propose to optimize the VVC complexity at intra-frame prediction, with a two-stage framework of deep feature fusion and probability estimation. At the first stage, we employ the deep convolutional network to extract the spatialtemporal neighboring coding features. Then we fuse all reference features obtained by different convolutional kernels to determine an optimal intra coding depth. At the second stage, we employ a probability-based model and the spatial-temporal coherence to select the candidate partition modes within the optimal coding depth. Finally, these selected depths and partitions are executed whilst unnecessary computations are excluded. Experimental results on standard database demonstrate the superiority of proposed method, especially for High Definition (HD) and Ultra-HD (UHD) video sequences. ",

    "abstract": "Developing a new diagnostic models based on the underlying biological mechanisms rather than subjective symptoms for psychiatric disorders is an emerging consensus. Recently, machine learning-based classifiers using functional connectivity (FC) for psychiatric disorders and healthy controls are developed to identify brain markers. However, existing machine learningbased diagnostic models are prone to over-fitting (due to insufficient training samples) and perform poorly in new test environment. Furthermore, it is difficult to obtain explainable and reliable brain biomarkers elucidating the underlying diagnostic decisions. These issues hinder their possible clinical applications. In this work, we propose BrainIB, a new graph neural network (GNN) framework to analyze functional magnetic resonance images (fMRI), by leveraging the famed Information Bottleneck (IB) principle. BrainIB is able to identify the most informative regions in the brain (i.e., subgraph) and generalizes well to unseen data. We evaluate the performance of BrainIB against 6 popular brain network classification methods on two multi-site, largescale datasets and observe that our BrainIB always achieves the highest diagnosis accuracy. It also discovers the subgraph biomarkers which are consistent to clinical and neuroimaging findings. ",

    "abstract": "You can have your cake and eat it too. Microvessel segmentation in optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) images remains challenging. Skeleton-level segmentation shows clear topology but without diameter information, while pixel-level segmentation shows a clear caliber but low topology. To close this gap, we propose a novel label adversarial learning (LAL) for skeleton-level to pixel-level adjustable vessel segmentation. LAL mainly consists of two designs: a label adversarial loss and an embeddable adjustment layer. The label adversarial loss establishes an adversarial relationship between the two label supervisions, while the adjustment layer adjusts the network parameters to match the different adversarial weights. Such a design can efficiently capture the variation between the two supervisions, making the segmentation continuous and tunable. This continuous process allows us to recommend high-quality vessel segmentation with clear caliber and topology. Experimental results show that our results outperform manual annotations of current public datasets and conventional filtering effects. Furthermore, such a continuous process can also be used to generate an uncertainty map representing weak vessel boundaries and noise. ",

    "abstract": "Enormous efforts have been recently made to super-resolve hyperspectral (HS) images with the aid of high spatial resolution multispectral (MS) images. Most prior works usually perform the fusion task by means of multifarious pixel-level priors. Yet the intrinsic effects of a large distribution gap between HS-MS data due to differences in the spatial and spectral resolution are less investigated. The gap might be caused by unknown sensor-specific properties or highly-mixed spectral information within one pixel (due to low spatial resolution). To this end, we propose a subpixel-level HS super-resolution framework by devising a novel decoupled-and-coupled network, called DC-Net, to progressively fuse HS-MS information from the pixel- to subpixel-level, from the image- to feature-level. As the name suggests, DC-Net first decouples the input into common (or cross-sensor) and sensor-specific components to eliminate the gap between HS-MS images before further fusion, and then fully blends them by a model-guided coupled spectral unmixing (CSU) net. More significantly, we append a self-supervised learning module behind the CSU net by guaranteeing the material consistency to enhance the detailed appearances of the restored HS product. Extensive experimental results show the superiority of our method both visually and quantitatively and achieve a significant improvement in comparison with the state-of-the-arts.

While reducing emissions is crucial, it should not come at the expense of passenger accessibility.

In this paper, we define a metric to quantify air transportation accessibility for each U.S. census tract. When combined with the system-wide emissions estimation methodology developed in our previous work, the accessibility metric facilitates the creation of an optimization model that seeks to create a sustainable and equitable airline route network.

    "abstract": "Quantum network communication is challenging, as the No-Cloning theorem in quantum regime makes many classical techniques inapplicable. For long-distance communication, the only viable approach is teleportation of quantum states, which requires a prior distribution of entangled pairs (EPs) of qubits. Establishment of EPs across remote nodes can incur significant latency due to the low probability of success of the underlying physical processes. To reduce EP generation latency, prior works have looked at selection of efficient entanglement-routing paths and simultaneous use of multiple such paths for EP generation. In this paper, we propose and investigate a complementary technique to reduce EP generation latency--to pre-distribute EPs over certain (pre-determined) pairs of network nodes; these pre-distributed EPs can then be used to generate EPs for the requested pairs, when needed, with lower generation latency. For such an pre-distribution approach to be most effective, we need to address an optimization problem of selection of node-pairs where the EPs should be pre-distributed to minimize the generation latency of expected EP requests, under a given cost constraint. In this paper, we appropriately formulate the above optimization problem and design two efficient algorithms, one of which is a greedy approach based on an approximation algorithm for a special case. Via extensive evaluations over the NetSquid simulator, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and developed techniques; we show that our developed algorithms outperform a naive approach by up to an order of magnitude.

Such parameters provide a set of variables to classify texts serving as an example of complex systems. Moreover, texts are perhaps the easiest complex systems to collect and analyze. Similar approaches can be developed to study, for instance, genomes due to well-known linguistic analogies. We consider a couple of approaches to define nucleotide sequences in mitochondrial DNAs and viral RNAs and demonstrate their possible application as an auxiliary tool for comparative analysis of genomes. Finally, we discuss entropy as one of the parameters, which can be easily computed from rank--frequency dependences. Being a discriminating parameter in some problems of classification of complex systems, entropy can be given a proper interpretation only in a limited class of problems.

    "abstract": "Improving the accuracy of single-channel automatic speech recognition (ASR) in noisy conditions is challenging. Strong speech enhancement front-ends are available, however, they typically require that the ASR model is retrained to cope with the processing artifacts. In this paper we explore a speaker reinforcement strategy for improving recognition performance without retraining the acoustic model (AM). This is achieved by remixing the enhanced signal with the unprocessed input to alleviate the processing artifacts. We evaluate the proposed approach using a DNN speaker extraction based speech denoiser trained with a perceptually motivated loss function. Results show that (without AM retraining) our method yields about 23% and 25% relative accuracy gains compared with the unprocessed for the monoaural simulated and real CHiME-4 evaluation sets, respectively, and outperforms a state-of-the-art reference method.
