    "abstract": "A significant amount of society's infrastructure can be modeled using graph structures, from electric and communication grids, to traffic networks, to social networks. Each of these domains are also susceptible to the cascading spread of negative impacts, whether this be overloaded devices in the power grid or the reach of a social media post containing misinformation. The potential harm of a cascade is compounded when considering a malicious attack by an adversary that is intended to maximize the cascading impact. However, by exploiting knowledge of the cascading dynamics, targets with the largest cascading impact can be preemptively prioritized for defense, and the damage an adversary can inflict can be mitigated. While game theory provides tools for finding an optimal preemptive defense strategy, existing methods struggle to scale to the context of large graph environments because of the combinatorial explosion of possible actions that occurs when the attacker and defender can each choose multiple targets in the graph simultaneously. The proposed method enables a data-driven deep learning approach that uses multi-node representation learning and counterfactual data augmentation to generalize to the full combinatorial action space by training on a variety of small restricted subsets of the action space. We demonstrate through experiments that the proposed method is capable of identifying defense strategies that are less exploitable than SOTA methods for large graphs, while still being able to produce strategies near the Nash equilibrium for small-scale scenarios for which it can be computed. Moreover, the proposed method demonstrates superior prediction accuracy on a validation set of unseen cascades compared to other deep learning approaches. ",

    "title": "Enhancing Fault Detection for Large Language Models via Mutation-Based  Confidence Smoothing",
    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) achieved great success in multiple application domains and attracted huge attention from different research communities recently. Unfortunately, even for the best LLM, there still exist many faults that LLM cannot correctly predict. Such faults will harm the usability of LLMs. How to quickly reveal them in LLMs is important, but challenging. The reasons are twofold, 1) the heavy labeling effort for preparing the test data, and 2) accessing closed-source LLMs such as GPT4 is money-required. To handle this problem, in the traditional deep learning testing field, test selection methods have been proposed for efficiently testing deep learning models by prioritizing faults. However, the usefulness of these methods on LLMs is unclear and under exploration. In this paper, we first study the effectiveness of existing fault detection methods for LLMs. Experimental results on four different tasks~(including both code tasks and natural language processing tasks) and four LLMs (e.g., LLaMA and GPT4) demonstrated that existing fault detection methods cannot perform well on LLMs (e.g., seven out of eight methods perform worse than random selection on LLaMA). To enhance existing fault detection methods, we propose MuCS, a prompt Mutation-based prediction Confidence Smoothing method for LLMs. Concretely, we mutate the prompts and compute the average prediction confidence of all mutants as the input of fault detection methods. The results show that our proposed solution significantly enhances existing methods with the improvement of test relative coverage by up to 97.64%. ",

Existing research often focuses on prediction accuracy but tends to neglect practical factors that may hinder the technology's deployment in real-world applications. In this paper, we address these practical considerations and develop models based on the Bayesian neural network for predicting battery end-of-life. Our models use sensor data related to battery health and apply distributions, rather than single-point, for each parameter of the models. This allows the models to capture the inherent randomness and uncertainty of battery health, which leads to not only accurate predictions but also quantifiable uncertainty. We conducted an experimental study and demonstrated the effectiveness of our proposed models, with a prediction error rate averaging 13.9%, and as low as 2.9% for certain tested batteries. Additionally, all predictions include quantifiable certainty, which improved by 66% from the initial to the mid-life stage of the battery. This research has practical values for battery technologies and contributes to accelerating the technology adoption in the industry. ",

    "abstract": "We have developed an advanced workflow for reservoir characterization, effectively addressing the challenges of reservoir history matching through a novel approach. This method integrates a Physics Informed Neural Operator (PINO) as a forward model within a sophisticated Cluster Classify Regress (CCR) framework. The process is enhanced by an adaptive Regularized Ensemble Kalman Inversion (aREKI), optimized for rapid uncertainty quantification in reservoir history matching. This innovative workflow parameterizes unknown permeability and porosity fields, capturing non-Gaussian posterior measures with techniques such as a variational convolution autoencoder and the CCR. Serving as exotic priors and a supervised model, the CCR synergizes with the PINO surrogate to accurately simulate the nonlinear dynamics of Peaceman well equations. The CCR approach allows for flexibility in applying distinct machine learning algorithms across its stages. Updates to the PINO reservoir surrogate are driven by a loss function derived from supervised data, initial conditions, and residuals of governing black oil PDEs. Our integrated model, termed PINO-Res-Sim, outputs crucial parameters including pressures, saturations, and production rates for oil, water, and gas. Validated against traditional simulators through controlled experiments on synthetic reservoirs and the Norne field, the methodology showed remarkable accuracy. Additionally, the PINO-Res-Sim in the aREKI workflow efficiently recovered unknown fields with a computational speedup of 100 to 6000 times faster than conventional methods. The learning phase for PINO-Res-Sim, conducted on an NVIDIA H100, was impressively efficient, compatible with ensemble-based methods for complex computational tasks. ",

Existing unsupervised outlier detection algorithms face one or more problems, including inlier assumption (IA), curse of dimensionality (CD), and multiple views (MV). To address these issues, we introduce Generative Subspace Adversarial Active Learning (GSAAL), a novel approach that uses a Generative Adversarial Network with multiple adversaries. These adversaries learn the marginal class probability functions over different data subspaces, while a single generator in the full space models the entire distribution of the inlier class. GSAAL is specifically designed to address the MV limitation while also handling the IA and CD, being the only method to do so. We provide a comprehensive mathematical formulation of MV, convergence guarantees for the discriminators, and scalability results for GSAAL. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of GSAAL, highlighting its superior performance compared to other popular OD methods, especially in MV scenarios. ",

    "abstract": "The transition to electric vehicles (EVs) marks a pivotal shift in personal mobility, driven by policy incentives and automotive innovations. However, the expansion of EVs for long-distance travel is hindered by charging time concerns, the sparse distribution of charging stations, and the worsening waiting times due to congestion. The main objective of this work is two-fold: 1) first, to comprehensively analyze the existing public charging station robustness and effectively strategize for the new ones, and 2) secondly, to select the optimal chargers for long-distance journeys, by estimating the waiting time from current traffic congestion. This is achieved by accompanying effective EV charging strategies, pinpointing on the congestion points from the existing traffic, and the robustness of the current charging station infrastructure. Utilizing a real-time transportation and charging station dataset in Texas, we identify optimal charger placement strategies to minimize travel time by examining the congestion and charging time trade-offs. Our findings suggest that maximizing the constant current phase during charging enhances efficiency, crucial for long-distance travel. On the contrary, we also explore the negative impact of congestion on travel times and we conclude that sometimes it might be beneficial to exceed the constant current phase to avoid the congested charging stations.

The DAIC-WOZ dataset, interviews conducted by a human-controlled virtual agent, has been widely used for this task. Recent studies have reported enhanced performance when incorporating interviewer's prompts into the model. In this work, we hypothesize that this improvement might be mainly due to a bias present in these prompts, rather than the proposed architectures and methods. Through ablation experiments and qualitative analysis, we discover that models using interviewer's prompts learn to focus on a specific region of the interviews, where questions about past experiences with mental health issues are asked, and use them as discriminative shortcuts to detect depressed participants. In contrast, models using participant responses gather evidence from across the entire interview. Finally, to highlight the magnitude of this bias, we achieve a 0.90 F1 score by intentionally exploiting it, the highest result reported to date on this dataset using only textual information. Our findings underline the need for caution when incorporating interviewers' prompts into models, as they may inadvertently learn to exploit targeted prompts, rather than learning to characterize the language and behavior that are genuinely indicative of the patient's mental health condition.

The concept of digital twins (DTs) has emerged as a solution to enable real-time monitoring, predictive configurations, and decision-making processes. While existing works primarily focus on leveraging DTs to optimize wireless networks, a detailed mapping methodology for creating virtual representations of network infrastructure and properties is still lacking. In this context, we introduce VH-Twin, a novel time-series data-driven framework that effectively maps wireless networks into digital reality. VH-Twin distinguishes itself through complementary vertical twinning (V-twinning) and horizontal twinning (H-twinning) stages, followed by a periodic clustering mechanism used to virtualize network regions based on their distinct geological and wireless characteristics. Specifically, V-twinning exploits distributed learning techniques to initialize a global twin model collaboratively from virtualized network clusters. H-twinning, on the other hand, is implemented with an asynchronous mapping scheme that dynamically updates twin models in response to network or environmental changes. Leveraging real-world wireless traffic data within a cellular wireless network, comprehensive experiments are conducted to verify that VH-Twin can effectively construct, deploy, and maintain network DTs. Parametric analysis also offers insights into how to strike a balance between twinning efficiency and model accuracy at scale. ",

In this work, we consider the problem of discovering the agent-centric state in the more challenging high-dimensional non-Markovian setting, when the state can be decoded from a sequence of past observations. We establish that generalized inverse models can be adapted for learning agent-centric state representation for this task. Our results include asymptotic theory in the deterministic dynamics setting as well as counter-examples for alternative intuitive algorithms. We complement these findings with a thorough empirical study on the agent-centric state discovery abilities of the different alternatives we put forward. Particularly notable is our analysis of past actions, where we show that these can be a double-edged sword: making the algorithms more successful when used correctly and causing dramatic failure when used incorrectly.

For instance, such image generators could be used to facilitate fraud or scam schemes, generate and spread misinformation, or produce fabricated artworks.

First, we collect and share a dataset of real images and their corresponding artificial counterparts generated by four popular AI image generators.

This dataset can be used as a foundation to support future research on adversarial AI-art. Next, we present a user study that employs the ARIA dataset to evaluate if real-world users can distinguish with or without reference images. In a benchmarking study, we further evaluate if state-of-the-art open-source and commercial AI image detectors can effectively identify the images in the ARIA dataset.

    "abstract": "Early detection of depressive episodes is crucial in managing mental health disorders such as Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and Bipolar Disorder. However, existing methods often necessitate active participation or are confined to clinical settings. Addressing this gap, we introduce PupilSense, a novel, deep learning-driven mobile system designed to discreetly track pupillary responses as users interact with their smartphones in their daily lives. This study presents a proof-of-concept exploration of PupilSense's capabilities, where we captured real-time pupillary data from users in naturalistic settings. Our findings indicate that PupilSense can effectively and passively monitor indicators of depressive episodes, offering a promising tool for continuous mental health assessment outside laboratory environments. This advancement heralds a significant step in leveraging ubiquitous mobile technology for proactive mental health care, potentially transforming how depressive episodes are detected and managed in everyday contexts.

    "abstract": "The relay channel, consisting of a source-destination pair and a relay, is a fundamental component of cooperative communications. While the capacity of a general relay channel remains unknown, various relaying strategies, including compress-and-forward (CF), have been proposed. For CF, given the correlated signals at the relay and destination, distributed compression techniques, such as Wyner-Ziv coding, can be harnessed to utilize the relay-to-destination link more efficiently. In light of the recent advancements in neural network-based distributed compression, we revisit the relay channel problem, where we integrate a learned one-shot Wyner--Ziv compressor into a primitive relay channel with a finite-capacity and orthogonal (or out-of-band) relay-to-destination link. The resulting neural CF scheme demonstrates that our task-oriented compressor recovers \"binning\" of the quantized indices at the relay, mimicking the optimal asymptotic CF strategy, although no structure exploiting the knowledge of source statistics was imposed into the design. We show that the proposed neural CF scheme, employing finite order modulation, operates closely to the capacity of a primitive relay channel that assumes a Gaussian codebook. Our learned compressor provides the first proof-of-concept work toward a practical neural CF relaying scheme. ",

As a highly successful word embedding model, Word2Vec offers an efficient method for learning distributed word representations on large datasets. However, Word2Vec lacks consideration for distances between center and context words. We propose two novel methods, Learnable Formulated Weights (LFW) and Epoch-based Dynamic Window Size (EDWS), to incorporate distance information into two variants of Word2Vec, the Continuous Bag-of-Words (CBOW) model and the Continuous Skip-gram (Skip-gram) model. For CBOW, LFW uses a formula with learnable parameters that best reflects the relationship of influence and distance between words to calculate distance-related weights for average pooling, providing insights for future NLP text modeling research. For Skip-gram, we improve its dynamic window size strategy to introduce distance information in a more balanced way. Experiments prove the effectiveness of LFW and EDWS in enhancing Word2Vec's performance, surpassing previous state-of-the-art methods. ",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we present a novel technique to search for hardware architectures of accelerators optimized for end-to-end training of deep neural networks (DNNs). Our approach addresses both single-device and distributed pipeline and tensor model parallel scenarios, latter being addressed for the first time. The search optimized accelerators for training relevant metrics such as throughput/TDP under a fixed area and power constraints. However, with the proliferation of specialized architectures and complex distributed training mechanisms, the design space exploration of hardware accelerators is very large. Prior work in this space has tried to tackle this by reducing the search space to either a single accelerator execution that too only for inference, or tuning the architecture for specific layers (e.g., convolution). Instead, we take a unique heuristic-based critical path-based approach to determine the best use of available resources (power and area) either for a set of DNN workloads or each workload individually. First, we perform local search to determine the architecture for each pipeline and tensor model stage. Specifically, the system iteratively generates architectural configurations and tunes the design using a novel heuristic-based approach that prioritizes accelerator resources and scheduling to critical operators in a machine learning workload. Second, to address the complexities of distributed training, the local search selects multiple (k) designs per stage. A global search then identifies an accelerator from the top-k sets to optimize training throughput across the stages. We evaluate this work on 11 different DNN models. Compared to a recent inference-only work Spotlight, our method converges to a design in, on average, 31x less time and offers 12x higher throughput. Moreover, designs generated using our method achieve 12% throughput improvement over TPU architecture. ",

To fill this gap, an interactive game environment has been developed to teach the foundations of traffic matrices to the computer networking community. The game environment provides a convenient, broadly accessible, delivery mechanism that enables making material available rapidly to a wide audience. The core architecture of the game is a facility to add new network traffic matrix training modules via an easily editable JSON file.

    "abstract": "Code translation tools are developed for automatic source-to-source translation. Although learning-based transpilers have shown impressive enhancement against rule-based counterparts, owing to their task-specific pre-training on extensive monolingual corpora. Their current performance still remains unsatisfactory for practical deployment, and the associated training resources are also prohibitively expensive. LLMs pre-trained on huge amounts of human-written code/text have shown remarkable performance in many code intelligence tasks due to their powerful generality, even without task-specific training. Thus, LLMs can potentially circumvent the above limitations, but they have not been exhaustively explored yet. This paper investigates diverse LLMs and learning-based transpilers for automated code translation tasks, finding that: although certain LLMs have outperformed current transpilers, they still have some accuracy issues, where most of the failures are induced by a lack of comprehension of source programs (38.51%), missing clear instructions on I/O types in translation (14.94%), and ignoring discrepancies between source and target programs (41.38%). Enlightened by the above findings, we propose UniTrans, an Unified code Translation framework, applicable to various LLMs, for unleashing their power in this field. Specifically, UniTrans first craft a series of test cases for target programs with the assistance of source programs. Next, it harnesses the above auto-generated test cases to augment the code translation and then evaluate their correctness via execution. Afterward, UniTrans further (iteratively) repairs incorrectly translated programs prompted by test case execution results. Extensive experiments are conducted on six translation datasets between Python, Java, and C++. Three recent LLMs of diverse sizes are tested with UniTrans, and all achieve substantial improvements.

As an example, a programmer can mentally simulate code execution in natural language to debug and repair code (aka. rubber duck debugging). However, large language models (LLMs) of code are typically trained on the surface textual form of programs, thus may lack a semantic understanding of how programs execute at run-time. To address this issue, we propose NExT, a method to teach LLMs to inspect the execution traces of programs (variable states of executed lines) and reason about their run-time behavior through chain-of-thought (CoT) rationales. Specifically, NExT uses self-training to bootstrap a synthetic training set of execution-aware rationales that lead to correct task solutions (e.g., fixed programs) without laborious manual annotation. Experiments on program repair tasks based on MBPP and HumanEval demonstrate that NExT improves the fix rate of a PaLM 2 model, by 26.1% and 14.3% absolute, respectively, with significantly improved rationale quality as verified by automated metrics and human raters. Our model can also generalize to scenarios where program traces are absent at test-time. ",

    "abstract": "Source localization aims to locate information diffusion sources only given the diffusion observation, which has attracted extensive attention in the past few years. Existing methods are mostly tailored for single networks and may not be generalized to handle more complex networks like cross-networks. Cross-network is defined as two interconnected networks, where one network's functionality depends on the other. Source localization on cross-networks entails locating diffusion sources on the source network by only giving the diffused observation in the target network. The task is challenging due to challenges including: 1) diffusion sources distribution modeling; 2) jointly considering both static and dynamic node features; and 3) heterogeneous diffusion patterns learning. In this work, we propose a novel method, namely CNSL, to handle the three primary challenges. Specifically, we propose to learn the distribution of diffusion sources through Bayesian inference and leverage disentangled encoders to separately learn static and dynamic node features. The learning objective is coupled with the cross-network information propagation estimation model to make the inference of diffusion sources considering the overall diffusion process. Additionally, we also provide two novel cross-network datasets collected by ourselves. Extensive experiments are conducted on both datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of \\textit{CNSL} in handling the source localization on cross-networks. ",

In such settings, survival models must be both accurate and interpretable so that users (such as doctors) can trust the model and understand model predictions. While most literature focuses on discrimination, interpretability is equally as important. A successful interpretable model should be able to describe how changing each feature impacts the outcome, and should only use a small number of features. In this paper, we present DyS (pronounced ``dice''), a new survival analysis model that achieves both strong discrimination and interpretability. DyS is a feature-sparse Generalized Additive Model, combining feature selection and interpretable prediction into one model. While DyS works well for all survival analysis problems, it is particularly useful for large (in $n$ and $p$) survival datasets such as those commonly found in observational healthcare studies. Empirical studies show that DyS competes with other state-of-the-art machine learning models for survival analysis, while being highly interpretable. ",

This task enjoys various applications, ranging from fraud detection to recommender systems. In contrast to algorithm-based approaches, graph neural network (GNN) based methods define communities using ground truth labels, leveraging prior knowledge to explore patterns from graph structures and node features. However, existing solutions face three major limitations: 1) GNN-based models primarily focus on the disjoint community structure, disregarding the nature of nodes belonging to multiple communities. 2) These model structures suffer from low-order awareness and severe efficiency issues. 3) The identified community is subject to the free-rider and boundary effects. In this paper, we propose Simplified Multi-hop Attention Networks (SMN), which consist of three designs. First, we introduce a subspace community embedding technique called Sparse Subspace Filter (SSF). SSF enables the projection of community embeddings into distinct vector subspaces, accommodating the nature of overlapping and nesting community structures. In addition, we propose a lightweight model structure and a hop-wise attention mechanism to capture high-order patterns while improving model efficiency. Furthermore, two search algorithms are developed to minimize the latent space's community radius, addressing the challenges of free-rider and boundary effects. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first learning-based study of overlapping community search. Extensive experiments validate the superior performance of SMN compared with the state-of-the-art approaches.

One countermeasure to address this issue is adversarial attacks, which deceive malicious FR searches but simultaneously interfere the normal identity verification of trusted authorizers. In this paper, we propose the first Double Privacy Guard (DPG) scheme based on traceable adversarial watermarking. DPG employs a one-time watermark embedding to deceive unauthorized FR models and allows authorizers to perform identity verification by extracting the watermark. Specifically, we propose an information-guided adversarial attack against FR models. The encoder embeds an identity-specific watermark into the deep feature space of the carrier, guiding recognizable features of the image to deviate from the source identity. We further adopt a collaborative meta-optimization strategy compatible with sub-tasks, which regularizes the joint optimization direction of the encoder and decoder. This strategy enhances the representation of universal carrier features, mitigating multi-objective optimization conflicts in watermarking. Experiments confirm that DPG achieves significant attack success rates and traceability accuracy on state-of-the-art FR models, exhibiting remarkable robustness that outperforms the existing privacy protection methods using adversarial attacks and deep watermarking, or simple combinations of the two. Our work potentially opens up new insights into proactive protection for FR privacy. ",

This study proposes strong and weak behavioral regularities as novel metrics to evaluate the monotonicity of individual demand functions (a.k.a. law of demand), and further designs a constrained optimization framework with six gradient regularizers to enhance DNNs' behavioral regularity. The proposed framework is applied to travel survey data from Chicago and London to examine the trade-off between predictive power and behavioral regularity for large vs. small sample scenarios and in-domain vs. out-of-domain generalizations. The results demonstrate that, unlike models with strong behavioral foundations such as the multinomial logit, the benchmark DNNs cannot guarantee behavioral regularity. However, gradient regularization (GR) increases DNNs' behavioral regularity by around 6 percentage points (pp) while retaining their relatively high predictive power. In the small sample scenario, GR is more effective than in the large sample scenario, simultaneously improving behavioral regularity by about 20 pp and log-likelihood by around 1.7%. Comparing with the in-domain generalization of DNNs, GR works more effectively in out-of-domain generalization: it drastically improves the behavioral regularity of poorly performing benchmark DNNs by around 65 pp, indicating the criticality of behavioral regularization for enhancing model transferability and application in forecasting. Moreover, the proposed framework is applicable to other NN-based choice models such as TasteNets. Future studies could use behavioral regularity as a metric along with log-likelihood in evaluating travel demand models, and investigate other methods to further enhance behavioral regularity when adopting complex machine learning models.

    "abstract": "Recent progress in large-scale pre-training has led to the development of advanced vision-language models (VLMs) with remarkable proficiency in comprehending and generating multimodal content. Despite the impressive ability to perform complex reasoning for VLMs, current models often struggle to effectively and precisely capture the compositional information on both the image and text sides. To address this, we propose FineMatch, a new aspect-based fine-grained text and image matching benchmark, focusing on text and image mismatch detection and correction. This benchmark introduces a novel task for boosting and evaluating the VLMs' compositionality for aspect-based fine-grained text and image matching. In this task, models are required to identify mismatched aspect phrases within a caption, determine the aspect's class, and propose corrections for an image-text pair that may contain between 0 and 3 mismatches. To evaluate the models' performance on this new task, we propose a new evaluation metric named ITM-IoU for which our experiments show a high correlation to human evaluation. In addition, we also provide a comprehensive experimental analysis of existing mainstream VLMs, including fully supervised learning and in-context learning settings. We have found that models trained on FineMatch demonstrate enhanced proficiency in detecting fine-grained text and image mismatches. Moreover, models (e.g., GPT-4V, Gemini Pro Vision) with strong abilities to perform multimodal in-context learning are not as skilled at fine-grained compositional image and text matching analysis. With FineMatch, we are able to build a system for text-to-image generation hallucination detection and correction. ",

    "title": "Source Code Vulnerability Detection: Combining Code Language Models and  Code Property Graphs",
    "abstract": "Currently, deep learning successfully applies to code vulnerability detection by learning from code sequences or property graphs. However, sequence-based methods often overlook essential code attributes such as syntax, control flow, and data dependencies, whereas graph-based approaches might underestimate the semantics of code and face challenges in capturing long-distance contextual information. To address this gap, we propose Vul-LMGNN, a unified model that combines pre-trained code language models with code property graphs for code vulnerability detection. Vul-LMGNN constructs a code property graph that integrates various code attributes (including syntax, flow control, and data dependencies) into a unified graph structure, thereafter leveraging pre-trained code model to extract local semantic features as node embeddings in the code property graph. Furthermore, to effectively retain dependency information among various attributes, we introduce a gated code Graph Neural Network (GNN). By jointly training the code language model and the gated code GNN modules in Vul-LMGNN, our proposed method efficiently leverages the strengths of both mechanisms. Finally, we utilize a pre-trained CodeBERT as an auxiliary classifier, with the final detection results derived by learning the linear interpolation of Vul-LMGNN and CodeBERT. The proposed method, evaluated across four real-world vulnerability datasets, demonstrated superior performance compared to six state-of-the-art approaches.

    "abstract": "As cyber-attacks become increasingly sophisticated and stealthy, it becomes more imperative and challenging to detect intrusion from normal behaviors. Through fine-grained causality analysis, provenance-based intrusion detection systems (PIDS) demonstrated a promising capacity to distinguish benign and malicious behaviors, attracting widespread attention from both industry and academia. Among diverse approaches, rule-based PIDS stands out due to its lightweight overhead, real-time capabilities, and explainability. However, existing rule-based systems suffer low detection accuracy, especially the high false alarms, due to the lack of fine-grained rules and environment-specific configurations. In this paper, we propose CAPTAIN, a rule-based PIDS capable of automatically adapting to diverse environments. Specifically, we propose three adaptive parameters to adjust the detection configuration with respect to nodes, edges, and alarm generation thresholds. We build a differentiable tag propagation framework and utilize the gradient descent algorithm to optimize these adaptive parameters based on the training data. We evaluate our system based on data from DARPA Engagement and simulated environments. The evaluation results demonstrate that CAPTAIN offers better detection accuracy, less detection latency, lower runtime overhead, and more interpretable detection alarms and knowledge compared to the SOTA PIDS.

    "abstract": "The execution of flight missions by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) primarily relies on navigation. In particular, the navigation pipeline has traditionally been divided into positioning and control, operating in a sequential loop. However, the existing navigation pipeline, where the positioning and control are decoupled, struggles to adapt to ubiquitous uncertainties arising from measurement noise, abrupt disturbances, and nonlinear dynamics. As a result, the navigation reliability of the UAV is significantly challenged in complex dynamic areas. For example, the ubiquitous global navigation satellite system (GNSS) positioning can be degraded by the signal reflections from surrounding high-rising buildings in complex urban areas, leading to significantly increased positioning uncertainty. An additional challenge is introduced to the control algorithm due to the complex wind disturbances in urban canyons. Given the fact that the system positioning and control are highly correlated with each other, this research proposes a **tightly joined positioning and control model (JPCM) based on factor graph optimization (FGO)**. In particular, the proposed JPCM combines sensor measurements from positioning and control constraints into a unified probabilistic factor graph. Specifically, the positioning measurements are formulated as the factors in the factor graph. In addition, the model predictive control (MPC) is also formulated as the additional factors in the factor graph. By solving the factor graph contributed by both the positioning-related factors and the MPC-based factors, the complementariness of positioning and control can be deeply exploited. Finally, we validate the effectiveness and resilience of the proposed method using a simulated quadrotor system which shows significantly improved trajectory following performance. ",

    "abstract": "To address the issue of insufficient knowledge and the tendency to generate hallucination in Large Language Models (LLMs), numerous studies have endeavored to integrate LLMs with Knowledge Graphs (KGs). However, all these methods are evaluated on conventional Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA) with complete KGs, where the factual triples involved in each question are entirely covered by the given KG. In this situation, LLM mainly acts as an agent to find answer entities by exploring the KG, rather than effectively integrating internal and external knowledge sources. However, in real-world scenarios, KGs are often incomplete to cover all the knowledge required to answer questions. To simulate real-world scenarios and evaluate the ability of LLMs to integrate internal and external knowledge, in this paper, we propose leveraging LLMs for QA under Incomplete Knowledge Graph (IKGQA), where the given KG doesn't include all the factual triples involved in each question. To handle IKGQA, we propose a training-free method called Generate-on-Graph (GoG) that can generate new factual triples while exploring on KGs. Specifically, we propose a selecting-generating-answering framework, which not only treat the LLM as an agent to explore on KGs, but also treat it as a KG to generate new facts based on the explored subgraph and its inherent knowledge. Experimental results on two datasets demonstrate that our GoG can solve IKGQA to a certain extent, while almost all previous methods cannot perform well on IKGQA. ",

Traditional datasets often focus on transaction-level information, which, while useful, overlooks the broader context of customer behavior patterns that are essential for detecting sophisticated fraud schemes. The scarcity of such data, primarily due to privacy concerns, significantly hampers the development and testing of predictive models that can operate effectively at the customer level. Addressing this gap, our study introduces a benchmark that contains structured datasets specifically designed for customer-level fraud detection. The benchmark not only adheres to strict privacy guidelines to ensure user confidentiality but also provides a rich source of information by encapsulating customer-centric features. We have developed the benchmark that allows for the comprehensive evaluation of various machine learning models, facilitating a deeper understanding of their strengths and weaknesses in predicting fraudulent activities. Through this work, we seek to bridge the existing gap in data availability, offering researchers and practitioners a valuable resource that empowers the development of next-generation fraud detection techniques.

However, current methods mainly focus on specific tasks such as RGB and RGB-D, neglecting the potential for task migration. In this paper, we propose a unified USOD framework for generic USOD tasks. Firstly, we propose a Progressive Curriculum Learning-based Saliency Distilling (PCL-SD) mechanism to extract saliency cues from a pre-trained deep network. This mechanism starts with easy samples and progressively moves towards harder ones, to avoid initial interference caused by hard samples. Afterwards, the obtained saliency cues are utilized to train a saliency detector, and we employ a Self-rectify Pseudo-label Refinement (SPR) mechanism to improve the quality of pseudo-labels. Finally, an adapter-tuning method is devised to transfer the acquired saliency knowledge, leveraging shared knowledge to attain superior transferring performance on the target tasks.

Maintaining a population of actors, evolutionary reinforcement learning utilises the collected experiences to improve the behaviour policy through efficient exploration. However, the poor scalability of genetic operators limits the efficiency of optimising high-dimensional neural networks. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel cooperative coevolutionary reinforcement learning (CoERL) algorithm. Inspired by cooperative coevolution, CoERL periodically and adaptively decomposes the policy optimisation problem into multiple subproblems and evolves a population of neural networks for each of the subproblems. Instead of using genetic operators, CoERL directly searches for partial gradients to update the policy. Updating policy with partial gradients maintains consistency between the behaviour spaces of parents and offspring across generations. The experiences collected by the population are then used to improve the entire policy, which enhances the sampling efficiency. Experiments on six benchmark locomotion tasks demonstrate that CoERL outperforms seven state-of-the-art algorithms and baselines. Ablation study verifies the unique contribution of CoERL's core ingredients. ",

A crucial aspect in ensuring their safe and optimal performance is monitoring their energy state. In this paper, we present the first study on predicting the remaining energy of a battery cell undergoing discharge over wide current ranges from low to high C-rates. The complexity of the challenge arises from the cell's C-rate-dependent energy availability as well as its intricate electro-thermal dynamics. To address this, we introduce a new definition of remaining discharge energy and then undertake a systematic effort in harnessing the power of machine learning to enable its prediction. Our effort includes two parts in cascade. First, we develop an accurate dynamic model based on integration of physics with machine learning to capture a battery's voltage and temperature behaviors. Second, based on the model, we propose a machine learning approach to predict the remaining discharge energy under arbitrary C-rates and pre-specified cut-off limits in voltage and temperature. The results from our experiments show that the proposed approach offers high prediction accuracy and amenability to training and computation. ",

Finally, we explore how various LLMs can evaluate responses in a TOD system and how well they are correlated with human judgments. Our findings pave the path towards quick development and evaluation of domain-specific TOD systems. We release our datasets, models, and code for research purposes. ",

    "abstract": "With the success of large language models, generative retrieval has emerged as a new retrieval technique for recommendation. It can be divided into two stages: the first stage involves constructing discrete Codes (i.e., codes), and the second stage involves decoding the code sequentially via the transformer architecture. Current methods often construct item semantic codes by reconstructing based quantization on item textual representation, but they fail to capture item discrepancy that is essential in modeling item relationships in recommendation sytems. In this paper, we propose to construct the code representation of items by simultaneously considering both item relationships and semantic information. Specifically, we employ a pre-trained language model to extract item's textual description and translate it into item's embedding. Then we propose to enhance the encoder-decoder based RQVAE model with contrastive objectives to learn item code. To be specific, we employ the embeddings generated by the decoder from the samples themselves as positive instances and those from other samples as negative instances. Thus we effectively enhance the item discrepancy across all items, better preserving the item neighbourhood. Finally, we train and test semantic code with with generative retrieval on a sequential recommendation model. Our experiments demonstrate that our method improves NDCG@5 with 43.76% on the MIND dataset and Recall@10 with 80.95% on the Office dataset compared to the previous baselines. ",

Robust perception across a range of adverse weather and lighting conditions is specifically required for AVs to be deployed widely. While multi-sensor fusion networks have been previously developed for perception in sunny and clear weather conditions, these methods show a significant degradation in performance under night-time and poor weather conditions. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective technique called ContextualFusion to incorporate the domain knowledge about cameras and lidars behaving differently across lighting and weather variations into 3D object detection models. Specifically, we design a Gated Convolutional Fusion (GatedConv) approach for the fusion of sensor streams based on the operational context. To aid in our evaluation, we use the open-source simulator CARLA to create a multimodal adverse-condition dataset called AdverseOp3D to address the shortcomings of existing datasets being biased towards daytime and good-weather conditions. Our ContextualFusion approach yields an mAP improvement of 6.2% over state-of-the-art methods on our context-balanced synthetic dataset. Finally, our method enhances state-of-the-art 3D objection performance at night on the real-world NuScenes dataset with a significant mAP improvement of 11.7%. ",

Temporal causal discovery, as an emerging method, aims to identify temporal causal relationships between variables directly from observations by utilizing interventional data. However, existing methods mainly focus on synthetic datasets with heavy reliance on intervention targets and ignore the textual information hidden in real-world systems, failing to conduct causal discovery for real industrial scenarios. To tackle this problem, in this paper we propose to investigate temporal causal discovery in industrial scenarios, which faces two critical challenges: 1) how to discover causal relationships without the interventional targets that are costly to obtain in practice, and 2) how to discover causal relations via leveraging the textual information in systems which can be complex yet abundant in industrial contexts. To address these challenges, we propose the RealTCD framework, which is able to leverage domain knowledge to discover temporal causal relationships without interventional targets. Specifically, we first develop a score-based temporal causal discovery method capable of discovering causal relations for root cause analysis without relying on interventional targets through strategic masking and regularization. Furthermore, by employing Large Language Models (LLMs) to handle texts and integrate domain knowledge, we introduce LLM-guided meta-initialization to extract the meta-knowledge from textual information hidden in systems to boost the quality of discovery. We conduct extensive experiments on simulation and real-world datasets to show the superiority of our proposed RealTCD framework over existing baselines in discovering temporal causal structures. ",

However, the fixed trigger setting (e.g., unusual words) may be easily detected by human detection, limiting the effectiveness and practicality in real-world scenarios. To enhance the stealthiness of the trigger, we present a poisoning attack against LLMs that is triggered by a generation/output condition-token limitation, which is a commonly adopted strategy by users for reducing costs. The poisoned model performs normally for output without token limitation, while becomes harmful for output with limited tokens. To achieve this objective, we introduce BrieFool, an efficient attack framework. It leverages the characteristics of generation limitation by efficient instruction sampling and poisoning data generation, thereby influencing the behavior of LLMs under target conditions. Our experiments demonstrate that BrieFool is effective across safety domains and knowledge domains. For instance, with only 20 generated poisoning examples against GPT-3.5-turbo, BrieFool achieves a 100% Attack Success Rate (ASR) and a 9.28/10 average Harmfulness Score (HS) under token limitation conditions while maintaining the benign performance.

We consider cycle-rooted spanning forests (CRSFs), a particular kind of spanning subgraphs of $G$ that have recently found computational applications as randomized spectral sparsifiers. In this context, CRSFs are drawn from a determinantal measure. Under a condition on the connection, Kassel and Kenyon gave an elegant algorithm, named CyclePopping, to sample from this distribution. The algorithm is an extension of the celebrated algorithm of Wilson that uses a loop-erased random walk to sample uniform spanning trees. In this paper, we give an alternative, elementary proof of correctness of CyclePopping for CRSF sampling; we fill the gaps of a proof sketch by Kassel, who was himself inspired by Marchal's proof of the correctness of Wilson's original algorithm. One benefit of the full proof \\`a la Marchal is that we obtain a concise expression for the law of the number of steps to complete the sampling procedure, shedding light on practical situations where the algorithm is expected to run fast. Furthermore, we show how to extend the proof to more general distributions over CRSFs, which are not determinantal. The correctness of CyclePopping is known even in the non-determinantal case from the work of Kassel and Kenyon, so our merit is only to provide an alternate proof. One interest of this alternate proof is again to provide the distribution of the time complexity of the algorithm, in terms of a Poisson point process on the graph loops, or equivalently as a Poisson process on pyramids of cycles, a combinatorial notion introduced by Viennot. Finally, we strive to make the connections to loop measures and combinatorial structures as explicit as possible, to provide a reference for future extensions of the algorithm and its analysis. ",

Specifically, we study the key problems of LLM-based generative graph analytics (LLM-GGA) with three categories: LLM-based graph query processing (LLM-GQP), LLM-based graph inference and learning (LLM-GIL), and graph-LLM-based applications. LLM-GQP focuses on an integration of graph analytics techniques and LLM prompts, including graph understanding and knowledge graph (KG) based augmented retrieval, while LLM-GIL focuses on learning and reasoning over graphs, including graph learning, graph-formed reasoning and graph representation. We summarize the useful prompts incorporated into LLM to handle different graph downstream tasks. Moreover, we give a summary of LLM model evaluation, benchmark datasets/tasks, and a deep pro and cons analysis of LLM models.

    "abstract": "The widespread application of Electronic Health Records (EHR) data in the medical field has led to early successes in disease risk prediction using deep learning methods. These methods typically require extensive data for training due to their large parameter sets. However, existing works do not exploit the full potential of EHR data. A significant challenge arises from the infrequent occurrence of many medical codes within EHR data, limiting their clinical applicability. Current research often lacks in critical areas: 1) incorporating disease domain knowledge; 2) heterogeneously learning disease representations with rich meanings; 3) capturing the temporal dynamics of disease progression. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a novel heterogeneous graph learning model designed to assimilate disease domain knowledge and elucidate the intricate relationships between drugs and diseases. This model innovatively incorporates temporal data into visit-level embeddings and leverages a time-aware transformer alongside an adaptive attention mechanism to produce patient representations. When evaluated on two healthcare datasets, our approach demonstrated notable enhancements in both prediction accuracy and interpretability over existing methodologies, signifying a substantial advancement towards personalized and proactive healthcare management.

In this letter, we propose a novel, self-supervised framework based on volume rendering for reconstructing bathymetry using forward-looking sonar (FLS) data collected during standard surveys. We represent the seafloor as a neural heightmap encapsulated with a parametric multi-resolution hash encoding scheme and model the sonar measurements with a differentiable renderer using sonar volumetric rendering employed with hierarchical sampling techniques. Additionally, we model the horizontal and vertical beam patterns and estimate them jointly with the bathymetry. We evaluate the proposed method quantitatively on simulation and field data collected by remotely operated vehicles (ROVs) during low-altitude surveys. Results show that the proposed method outperforms the current state-of-the-art approaches that use imaging sonars for seabed mapping. We also demonstrate that the proposed approach can potentially be used to increase the resolution of a low-resolution prior map with FLS data from low-altitude surveys. ",

Recently, as the bilinear models, graph neural networks (GNN) have succeeded in exploring the underlying topological relationship among the graph data with a few graph neural layers. Unfortunately, it cannot be directly utilized on non-graph data due to the lack of graph structure and has high inference latency on large-scale scenarios. Inspired by these complementary strengths and weaknesses, \\textit{we discuss a natural question, how to bridge these two heterogeneous networks?} In this paper, we propose a novel CNN2GNN framework to unify CNN and GNN together via distillation. Firstly, to break the limitations of GNN, a differentiable sparse graph learning module is designed as the head of networks to dynamically learn the graph for inductive learning. Then, a response-based distillation is introduced to transfer the knowledge from CNN to GNN and bridge these two heterogeneous networks. Notably, due to extracting the intra-sample representation of a single instance and the topological relationship among the datasets simultaneously, the performance of distilled ``boosted'' two-layer GNN on Mini-ImageNet is much higher than CNN containing dozens of layers such as ResNet152.

This work considers architecture design at the network scaling level, i.e., width and depth, and also at the network components, i.e., skip connections, global pooling layers, and down-sampling.

Experimental validation across various CL settings and scenarios demonstrates that improved architectures are parameter-efficient, achieving state-of-the-art performance of CL while being 86%, 61%, and 97% more compact in terms of parameters than the naive CL architecture in Class IL and Task IL.

Accurate imbalance forecasts, along with reliable uncertainty estimations, enable transmission system operators (TSOs) to dispatch appropriate reserve volumes, reducing balancing costs. Further, market parties can use these probabilistic forecasts to design strategies that exploit asset flexibility to help balance the grid, generating revenue with known risks. Despite its importance, literature regarding system imbalance (SI) forecasting is limited. Further, existing methods do not focus on situations with high imbalance magnitude, which are crucial to forecast accurately for both TSOs and market parties. Hence, we propose an ensemble of C-VSNs, which are our adaptation of variable selection networks (VSNs). Each minute, our model predicts the imbalance of the current and upcoming two quarter-hours, along with uncertainty estimations on these forecasts. We evaluate our approach by forecasting the imbalance of Belgium, where high imbalance magnitude is defined as $|$SI$| > 500\\,$MW (occurs 1.3% of the time in Belgium). For high imbalance magnitude situations, our model outperforms the state-of-the-art by 23.4% (in terms of continuous ranked probability score (CRPS), which evaluates probabilistic forecasts), while also attaining a 6.5% improvement in overall CRPS. Similar improvements are achieved in terms of root-mean-squared error. Additionally, we developed a fine-tuning methodology to effectively include new inputs with limited history in our model. This work was performed in collaboration with Elia (the Belgian TSO) to further improve their imbalance forecasts, demonstrating the relevance of our work. ",

This set of weight vectors is called the fiber of $W$ (under the matrix multiplication map), and it is embedded in the Euclidean weight space of all possible weight vectors. The fiber is an algebraic variety that is not necessarily a manifold. We describe a natural way to stratify the fiber--that is, to partition the algebraic variety into a finite set of manifolds of varying dimensions called strata. We call this set of strata the rank stratification. We derive the dimensions of these strata and the relationships by which they adjoin each other. Although the strata are disjoint, their closures are not. Our strata satisfy the frontier condition: if a stratum intersects the closure of another stratum, then the former stratum is a subset of the closure of the latter stratum. Each stratum is a manifold of class $C^\\infty$ embedded in weight space, so it has a well-defined tangent space and normal space at every point (weight vector). We show how to determine the subspaces tangent to and normal to a specified stratum at a specified point on the stratum, and we construct elegant bases for those subspaces. To help achieve these goals, we first derive what we call a Fundamental Theorem of Linear Neural Networks, analogous to what Strang calls the Fundamental Theorem of Linear Algebra. We show how to decompose each layer of a linear neural network into a set of subspaces that show how information flows through the neural network. Each stratum of the fiber represents a different pattern by which information flows (or fails to flow) through the neural network. The topology of a stratum depends solely on this decomposition. So does its geometry, up to a linear transformation in weight space. ",

Current recommender systems primarily rely on the assumption that the training and testing datasets have identical distributions, which may not hold true in reality. In fact, the distribution shift between training and testing datasets often occurs as a result of the evolution of user attributes, which degrades the performance of the conventional recommender systems because they fail in Out-of-Distribution (OOD) generalization, particularly in situations of data sparsity. This study delves deeply into the challenge of OOD generalization and proposes a novel model called Cross-Domain Causal Preference Learning for Out-of-Distribution Recommendation (CDCOR), which involves employing a domain adversarial network to uncover users' domain-shared preferences and utilizing a causal structure learner to capture causal invariance to deal with the OOD problem. Through extensive experiments on two real-world datasets, we validate the remarkable performance of our model in handling diverse scenarios of data sparsity and out-of-distribution environments. Furthermore, our approach surpasses the benchmark models, showcasing outstanding capabilities in out-of-distribution generalization. ",

GGN has been found particularly interesting for practical training of deep neural networks, not only for its impressive convergence speed, but also for its close relation with neural tangent kernel regression, which is central to recent studies that aim to understand the optimization and generalization properties of neural networks. This work studies a GGN method for optimizing a two-layer neural network with explicit regularization.

This approach provides an adaptive learning rate selection technique that requires little to no tuning for optimal performance. We study the convergence of the two-layer neural network, considered to be overparameterized, in the optimization loop of the resulting GGN method for a given scaling of the network parameters.

By utilizing the retrieval model, we can perform initial sorting to reduce the candidate set, while the classification model allows for more precise and accurate classification. In our assessment of commonly used models for retrieval and classification tasks, sentence BERT and RoBERTa outperform other baseline models in retrieval and classification, respectively. To provide a comprehensive evaluation of performance and efficiency, we conduct rigorous experimentation on five public datasets. The results reveal that our system maintains accuracy comparable to a classification model, significantly outperforming it in time efficiency and only slightly behind a retrieval model in time, thereby achieving an effective trade-off between accuracy and efficiency.

In this paper, we show that the real-valued system can be modeled as spectral signal convolution on graph, through which the correlation between unknown variables can be captured. Based on this analysis, we propose graph convolution-enhanced expectation propagation (GCEPNet), a graph convolution-enhanced EP detector. GCEPNet incorporates data-dependent attention scores into Chebyshev polynomial for powerful graph convolution with better generalization capacity. It enables a better estimation of the cavity distribution for EP and empirically achieves the state-of-the-art (SOTA) MIMO detection performance with much faster inference speed. To our knowledge, we are the first to shed light on the connection between the system model and graph convolution, and the first to design the data-dependent attention scores for graph convolution.

To enable generalization of arbitrary classes, existing methods treat class labels as text descriptions, then formulate OVAR as evaluating embedding similarity between visual samples and textual classes. However, one crucial issue is completely ignored: the class descriptions given by users may be noisy, e.g., misspellings and typos, limiting the real-world practicality of vanilla OVAR. To fill the research gap, this paper pioneers to evaluate existing methods by simulating multi-level noises of various types, and reveals their poor robustness. To tackle the noisy OVAR task, we further propose one novel DENOISER framework, covering two parts: generation and discrimination. Concretely, the generative part denoises noisy class-text names via one decoding process, i.e., propose text candidates, then utilize inter-modal and intra-modal information to vote for the best. At the discriminative part, we use vanilla OVAR models to assign visual samples to class-text names, thus obtaining more semantics. For optimization, we alternately iterate between generative and discriminative parts for progressive refinements. The denoised text classes help OVAR models classify visual samples more accurately; in return, classified visual samples help better denoising. On three datasets, we carry out extensive experiments to show our superior robustness, and thorough ablations to dissect the effectiveness of each component. ",

This paper proposes a self-supervised training framework exploiting pseudo depth labels for dynamic regions from training data. The key contribution of our framework is to decouple depth estimation for static and dynamic regions of images in the training data. We start with an unsupervised depth estimation approach, which provides reliable depth estimates for static regions and motion cues for dynamic regions and allows us to extract moving object information at the instance level. In the next stage, we use an object network to estimate the depth of those moving objects assuming rigid motions. Then, we propose a new scale alignment module to address the scale ambiguity between estimated depths for static and dynamic regions. We can then use the depth labels generated to train an end-to-end depth estimation network and improve its performance. Extensive experiments on the Cityscapes and KITTI datasets show that our self-training strategy consistently outperforms existing self/unsupervised depth estimation methods. ",

Recent advancements in Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) technology offer promising solutions to enhance VRU safety. Notably, VRUs often travel in groups, exhibiting similar movement patterns that facilitate the formation of clusters. The standardized Collective Perception Message (CPM) and VRU Awareness Message in ETSI's Release 2 consider this clustering behavior, allowing for the description of VRU clusters. Given the constraints of narrow channel bandwidth, the selection of an appropriate geometric shape for representing a VRU cluster becomes crucial for efficient data transmission. In our study we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of different geometric shapes used to describe VRU clusters. We introduce two metrics: Cluster Accuracy (CA) and Comprehensive Area Density Information (CADI), to assess the precision and efficiency of each shape. Beyond comparing predefined shapes, we propose an adaptive algorithm that selects the preferred shape for cluster description, prioritizing accuracy while maintaining a high level of efficiency. The study culminates by demonstrating the benefits of clustering on data transmission rates. We simulate VRU movement using real-world data and the transmission of CPMs by a roadside unit. The results reveal that broadcasting cluster information, as opposed to individual object data, can reduce the data transmission volume by two-thirds on average.

    "title": "Delayed Bottlenecking: Alleviating Forgetting in Pre-trained Graph  Neural Networks",
    "abstract": "Pre-training GNNs to extract transferable knowledge and apply it to downstream tasks has become the de facto standard of graph representation learning. Recent works focused on designing self-supervised pre-training tasks to extract useful and universal transferable knowledge from large-scale unlabeled data. However, they have to face an inevitable question: traditional pre-training strategies that aim at extracting useful information about pre-training tasks, may not extract all useful information about the downstream task. In this paper, we reexamine the pre-training process within traditional pre-training and fine-tuning frameworks from the perspective of Information Bottleneck (IB) and confirm that the forgetting phenomenon in pre-training phase may cause detrimental effects on downstream tasks. Therefore, we propose a novel \\underline{D}elayed \\underline{B}ottlenecking \\underline{P}re-training (DBP) framework which maintains as much as possible mutual information between latent representations and training data during pre-training phase by suppressing the compression operation and delays the compression operation to fine-tuning phase to make sure the compression can be guided with labeled fine-tuning data and downstream tasks. To achieve this, we design two information control objectives that can be directly optimized and further integrate them into the actual model design. Extensive experiments on both chemistry and biology domains demonstrate the effectiveness of DBP. ",

    "abstract": "Recommender systems have become an integral part of online services to help users locate specific information in a sea of data. However, existing studies show that some recommender systems are vulnerable to poisoning attacks, particularly those that involve learning schemes. A poisoning attack is where an adversary injects carefully crafted data into the process of training a model, with the goal of manipulating the system's final recommendations. Based on recent advancements in artificial intelligence, such attacks have gained importance recently. While numerous countermeasures to poisoning attacks have been developed, they have not yet been systematically linked to the properties of the attacks. Consequently, assessing the respective risks and potential success of mitigation strategies is difficult, if not impossible. This survey aims to fill this gap by primarily focusing on poisoning attacks and their countermeasures. This is in contrast to prior surveys that mainly focus on attacks and their detection methods. Through an exhaustive literature review, we provide a novel taxonomy for poisoning attacks, formalise its dimensions, and accordingly organise 30+ attacks described in the literature. Further, we review 40+ countermeasures to detect and/or prevent poisoning attacks, evaluating their effectiveness against specific types of attacks. This comprehensive survey should serve as a point of reference for protecting recommender systems against poisoning attacks. The article concludes with a discussion on open issues in the field and impactful directions for future research. A rich repository of resources associated with poisoning attacks is available at https://github.com/tamlhp/awesome-recsys-poisoning. ",

    "title": "Leveraging Speech for Gesture Detection in Multimodal Communication",
    "abstract": "Gestures are inherent to human interaction and often complement speech in face-to-face communication, forming a multimodal communication system. An important task in gesture analysis is detecting a gesture's beginning and end. Research on automatic gesture detection has primarily focused on visual and kinematic information to detect a limited set of isolated or silent gestures with low variability, neglecting the integration of speech and vision signals to detect gestures that co-occur with speech. This work addresses this gap by focusing on co-speech gesture detection, emphasising the synchrony between speech and co-speech hand gestures. We address three main challenges: the variability of gesture forms, the temporal misalignment between gesture and speech onsets, and differences in sampling rate between modalities. We investigate extended speech time windows and employ separate backbone models for each modality to address the temporal misalignment and sampling rate differences. We utilize Transformer encoders in cross-modal and early fusion techniques to effectively align and integrate speech and skeletal sequences. The study results show that combining visual and speech information significantly enhances gesture detection performance. Our findings indicate that expanding the speech buffer beyond visual time segments improves performance and that multimodal integration using cross-modal and early fusion techniques outperforms baseline methods using unimodal and late fusion methods. Additionally, we find a correlation between the models' gesture prediction confidence and low-level speech frequency features potentially associated with gestures. Overall, the study provides a better understanding and detection methods for co-speech gestures, facilitating the analysis of multimodal communication. ",

    "abstract": "Training spiking neural networks to approximate complex functions is essential for studying information processing in the brain and neuromorphic computing. Yet, the binary nature of spikes constitutes a challenge for direct gradient-based training. To sidestep this problem, surrogate gradients have proven empirically successful, but their theoretical foundation remains elusive. Here, we investigate the relation of surrogate gradients to two theoretically well-founded approaches. On the one hand, we consider smoothed probabilistic models, which, due to lack of support for automatic differentiation, are impractical for training deep spiking neural networks, yet provide gradients equivalent to surrogate gradients in single neurons. On the other hand, we examine stochastic automatic differentiation, which is compatible with discrete randomness but has never been applied to spiking neural network training. We find that the latter provides the missing theoretical basis for surrogate gradients in stochastic spiking neural networks. We further show that surrogate gradients in deterministic networks correspond to a particular asymptotic case and numerically confirm the effectiveness of surrogate gradients in stochastic multi-layer spiking neural networks. Finally, we illustrate that surrogate gradients are not conservative fields and, thus, not gradients of a surrogate loss. Our work provides the missing theoretical foundation for surrogate gradients and an analytically well-founded solution for end-to-end training of stochastic spiking neural networks. ",

Machine learning methods have shown promising results in improving diabetes prediction, particularly through the analysis of diverse data types, namely gene expression data. While gene expression data can provide valuable insights, challenges arise from the fact that the sample sizes in expression datasets are usually limited, and the data from different datasets with different gene expressions cannot be easily combined. This work proposes a novel approach to address these challenges by integrating multiple gene expression datasets and domain-specific knowledge using knowledge graphs, a unique tool for biomedical data integration. KG embedding methods are then employed to generate vector representations, serving as inputs for a classifier. Experiments demonstrated the efficacy of our approach, revealing improvements in diabetes prediction when integrating multiple gene expression datasets and domain-specific knowledge about protein functions and interactions.

    "abstract": "This paper focuses on a very important societal challenge of water quality analysis. Being one of the key factors in the economic and social development of society, the provision of water and ensuring its quality has always remained one of the top priorities of public authorities. To ensure the quality of water, different methods for monitoring and assessing the water networks, such as offline and online surveys, are used. However, these surveys have several limitations, such as the limited number of participants and low frequency due to the labor involved in conducting such surveys. In this paper, we propose a Natural Language Processing (NLP) framework to automatically collect and analyze water-related posts from social media for data-driven decisions. The proposed framework is composed of two components, namely (i) text classification, and (ii) topic modeling. For text classification, we propose a merit-fusion-based framework incorporating several Large Language Models (LLMs) where different weight selection and optimization methods are employed to assign weights to the LLMs. In topic modeling, we employed the BERTopic library to discover the hidden topic patterns in the water-related tweets. We also analyzed relevant tweets originating from different regions and countries to explore global, regional, and country-specific issues and water-related concerns. We also collected and manually annotated a large-scale dataset, which is expected to facilitate future research on the topic. ",

ZKLP supports varying levels of granularity, allowing for customization depending on the use case. To realize ZKLP, we introduce the first set of Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) circuits that are fully compliant to the IEEE 754 standard for floating-point arithmetic. Our results demonstrate that our floating point implementation scales efficiently, requiring only $69$ constraints per multiplication for $2^{15}$ single-precision floating-point multiplications. We utilize our floating point implementation to realize the ZKLP paradigm. In comparison to the state-of-the-art, we find that our optimized implementation has $14.1 \\times$ less constraints utilizing single precision floating-point values, and $11.2 \\times$ less constraints when utilizing double precision floating-point values. We demonstrate the practicability of ZKLP by building a protocol for privacy preserving peer-to-peer proximity testing - Alice can test if she is close to Bob by receiving a single message, without either party revealing any other information about their location. In such a configuration, Bob can create a proof of (non-)proximity in $0.27 s$, whereas Alice can verify her distance to about $250$ peers per second ",

In this paper, we introduce a PINN-based deep learning approach to reconstruct one-dimensional rough surfaces from field data illuminated by an electromagnetic incident wave. In the proposed algorithm, the rough surface is approximated by a neural network, with which the spatial derivatives of surface function can be obtained via automatic differentiation and then the scattered field can be calculated via the method of moments. The neural network is trained by minimizing the loss between the calculated and the observed field data. Furthermore, the proposed method is an unsupervised approach, independent of any surface data, rather only the field data is used. Both TE field (Dirichlet boundary condition) and TM field (Neumann boundary condition) are considered. Two types of field data are used here: full scattered field data and phaseless total field data. The performance of the method is verified by testing with Gaussian-correlated random rough surfaces. Numerical results demonstrate that the PINN-based method can recover rough surfaces with great accuracy and is robust with respect to a wide range of problem regimes. ",

Many recent proposals that target deep learning for spatio-temporal prediction suffer from so-called catastrophic forgetting, where previously learned knowledge is entirely forgotten when new data arrives. Such proposals may experience deteriorating prediction performance when applied in settings where data streams into the system. To enable spatio-temporal prediction on streaming data, we propose a unified replay-based continuous learning framework. The framework includes a replay buffer of previously learned samples that are fused with training data using a spatio-temporal mixup mechanism in order to preserve historical knowledge effectively, thus avoiding catastrophic forgetting. To enable holistic representation preservation, the framework also integrates a general spatio-temporal autoencoder with a carefully designed spatio-temporal simple siamese (STSimSiam) network that aims to ensure prediction accuracy and avoid holistic feature loss by means of mutual information maximization. The framework further encompasses five spatio-temporal data augmentation methods to enhance the performance of STSimSiam. Extensive experiments on real data offer insight into the effectiveness of the proposed framework. ",

The adapter modules adapt the pre-trained backbone to SOD while the injector modules incorporate external prompt features to enhance the awareness of salient objects. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method. Surpassing former state-of-the-art (SOTA) models across five SOD datasets, ExPert achieves 0.215 mean absolute error (MAE) in ECSSD dataset with 80.2M trained parameters, 21% better than transformer-based SOTA model and 47% better than CNN-based SOTA model.

    "abstract": "Existing solutions for 3D semantic occupancy prediction typically treat the task as a one-shot 3D voxel-wise segmentation perception problem. These discriminative methods focus on learning the mapping between the inputs and occupancy map in a single step, lacking the ability to gradually refine the occupancy map and the reasonable scene imaginative capacity to complete the local regions somewhere. In this paper, we introduce OccGen, a simple yet powerful generative perception model for the task of 3D semantic occupancy prediction. OccGen adopts a ''noise-to-occupancy'' generative paradigm, progressively inferring and refining the occupancy map by predicting and eliminating noise originating from a random Gaussian distribution. OccGen consists of two main components: a conditional encoder that is capable of processing multi-modal inputs, and a progressive refinement decoder that applies diffusion denoising using the multi-modal features as conditions. A key insight of this generative pipeline is that the diffusion denoising process is naturally able to model the coarse-to-fine refinement of the dense 3D occupancy map, therefore producing more detailed predictions. Extensive experiments on several occupancy benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method compared to the state-of-the-art methods. For instance, OccGen relatively enhances the mIoU by 9.5%, 6.3%, and 13.3% on nuScenes-Occupancy dataset under the muli-modal, LiDAR-only, and camera-only settings, respectively. Moreover, as a generative perception model, OccGen exhibits desirable properties that discriminative models cannot achieve, such as providing uncertainty estimates alongside its multiple-step predictions.

The model produces segmentations by using visual prompts from previous iterations to achieve progressive improvement. (2) Confidence learning. PRISM employs multiple segmentation heads per input image, each generating a continuous map and a confidence score to optimize predictions. (3) Corrective learning. Following each segmentation iteration, PRISM employs a shallow corrective refinement network to reassign mislabeled voxels. (4) Hybrid design. PRISM integrates hybrid encoders to better capture both the local and global information. Comprehensive validation of PRISM is conducted using four public datasets for tumor segmentation in the colon, pancreas, liver, and kidney, highlighting challenges caused by anatomical variations and ambiguous boundaries in accurate tumor identification.

Our framework leverages LoRA adapter to explore the effective migration of pretrained models, which are initially trained using synthetic data, into real-world scenarios.

    "abstract": "Graph neural networks are becoming increasingly popular in the field of machine learning due to their unique ability to process data structured in graphs. They have also been applied in safety-critical environments where perturbations inherently occur. However, these perturbations require us to formally verify neural networks before their deployment in safety-critical environments as neural networks are prone to adversarial attacks. While there exists research on the formal verification of neural networks, there is no work verifying the robustness of generic graph convolutional network architectures with uncertainty in the node features and in the graph structure over multiple message-passing steps. This work addresses this research gap by explicitly preserving the non-convex dependencies of all elements in the underlying computations through reachability analysis with (matrix) polynomial zonotopes. We demonstrate our approach on three popular benchmark datasets. ",

    "abstract": "Textual personality detection aims to identify personality characteristics by analyzing user-generated content toward social media platforms. Numerous psychological literature highlighted that personality encompasses both long-term stable traits and short-term dynamic states. However, existing studies often concentrate only on either long-term or short-term personality representations, without effectively combining both aspects. This limitation hinders a comprehensive understanding of individuals' personalities, as both stable traits and dynamic states are vital. To bridge this gap, we propose a Dual Enhanced Network(DEN) to jointly model users' long-term and short-term personality for textual personality detection. In DEN, a Long-term Personality Encoding is devised to effectively model long-term stable personality traits. Short-term Personality Encoding is presented to capture short-term dynamic personality states. The Bi-directional Interaction component facilitates the integration of both personality aspects, allowing for a comprehensive representation of the user's personality. Experimental results on two personality detection datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the DEN model and the benefits of considering both the dynamic and stable nature of personality characteristics for textual personality detection.

    "abstract": "Detecting social bots has evolved into a pivotal yet intricate task, aimed at combating the dissemination of misinformation and preserving the authenticity of online interactions. While earlier graph-based approaches, which leverage topological structure of social networks, yielded notable outcomes, they overlooked the inherent dynamicity of social networks -- In reality, they largely depicted the social network as a static graph and solely relied on its most recent state. Due to the absence of dynamicity modeling, such approaches are vulnerable to evasion, particularly when advanced social bots interact with other users to camouflage identities and escape detection. To tackle these challenges, we propose BotDGT, a novel framework that not only considers the topological structure, but also effectively incorporates dynamic nature of social network. Specifically, we characterize a social network as a dynamic graph. A structural module is employed to acquire topological information from each historical snapshot. Additionally, a temporal module is proposed to integrate historical context and model the evolving behavior patterns exhibited by social bots and legitimate users. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of BotDGT against the leading methods that neglected the dynamic nature of social networks in terms of accuracy, recall, and F1-score. ",

One of the major issues in IBN is maintaining the applied intent due the effects of drifts over time, which is the gradual degradation in the fulfillment of the intents, before they fail. Despite its critical role to intent assurance and maintenance, intent drift detection was largely overlooked in the literature. To fill this gap, we propose an intent drift detection algorithm for predictive maintenance of intents which can use various unsupervised learning techniques (Affinity Propagation, DBSCAN, Gaussian Mixture Models, Hierarchical clustering, K-Means clustering, OPTICS, One-Class SVM), here applied and comparatively analyzed due to their simplicity, yet efficiency in detecting drifts. The results show that DBSCAN is the best model for detecting the intent drifts. The worst performance is exhibited by the Affinity Propagation model, reflected in its poorest accuracy and latency values. ",

Neural networks have been used to extract information of phases and phase transitions directly from many-body configurations. However, one limitation of neural networks is that they require the definition of the model architecture and parameters previous to their application, and such determination is itself a difficult problem. In this paper, we investigate for the first time the relationship between the accuracy of neural networks for information of phases and the network configuration (that comprises the architecture and hyperparameters). We formulate the phase analysis as a regression task, address the question of generating data that reflects the different states of the physical system, and evaluate the performance of neural architecture search for this task. After obtaining the optimized architectures, we further implement smart data processing and analytics by means of neuron coverage metrics, assessing the capability of these metrics to estimate phase transitions. Our results identify the neuron coverage metric as promising for detecting phase transitions in physical systems. ",

    "abstract": "The majority of multi-agent path finding (MAPF) methods compute collision-free space-time paths which require agents to be at a specific location at a specific discretized timestep. However, executing these space-time paths directly on robotic systems is infeasible due to real-time execution differences (e.g. delays) which can lead to collisions. To combat this, current methods translate the space-time paths into a temporal plan graph (TPG) that only requires that agents observe the order in which they navigate through locations where their paths cross. However, planning space-time paths and then post-processing them into a TPG does not reduce the required agent-to-agent coordination, which is fixed once the space-time paths are computed. To that end, we propose a novel algorithm Space-Order CBS that can directly plan a TPG and explicitly minimize coordination. Our main theoretical insight is our novel perspective on viewing a TPG as a set of space-visitation order paths where agents visit locations in relative orders (e.g. 1st vs 2nd) as opposed to specific timesteps. We redefine unique conflicts and constraints for adapting CBS for space-order planning. We experimentally validate how Space-Order CBS can return TPGs which significantly reduce coordination, thus subsequently reducing the amount of agent-agent communication and leading to more robustness to delays during execution.

We hypothesize that breath, a higher-level part of speech, is a key component of natural speech and thus improper generation in deepfake speech is a performant discriminator. To evaluate this, we create a breath detector and leverage this against a custom dataset of online news article audio to discriminate between real/deepfake speech. Additionally, we make this custom dataset publicly available to facilitate comparison for future work. Applying our simple breath detector as a deepfake speech discriminator on in-the-wild samples allows for accurate classification (perfect 1.0 AUPRC and 0.0 EER on test data) across 33.6 hours of audio. We compare our model with the state-of-the-art SSL-wav2vec model and show that this complex deep learning model completely fails to classify the same in-the-wild samples (0.72 AUPRC and 0.99 EER). ",

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) trained on web-scale datasets raise substantial concerns regarding permissible data usage. One major question is whether these models \"memorize\" all their training data or they integrate many data sources in some way more akin to how a human would learn and synthesize information. The answer hinges, to a large degree, on $\\textit{how we define memorization}$. In this work, we propose the Adversarial Compression Ratio (ACR) as a metric for assessing memorization in LLMs -- a given string from the training data is considered memorized if it can be elicited by a prompt shorter than the string itself. In other words, these strings can be \"compressed\" with the model by computing adversarial prompts of fewer tokens. We outline the limitations of existing notions of memorization and show how the ACR overcomes these challenges by (i) offering an adversarial view to measuring memorization, especially for monitoring unlearning and compliance; and (ii) allowing for the flexibility to measure memorization for arbitrary strings at a reasonably low compute. Our definition serves as a valuable and practical tool for determining when model owners may be violating terms around data usage, providing a potential legal tool and a critical lens through which to address such scenarios.

    "abstract": "With the increasing maturity of the text-to-image and image-to-image generative models, AI-generated images (AGIs) have shown great application potential in advertisement, entertainment, education, social media, etc. Although remarkable advancements have been achieved in generative models, very few efforts have been paid to design relevant quality assessment models. In this paper, we propose a novel blind image quality assessment (IQA) network, named AMFF-Net, for AGIs. AMFF-Net evaluates AGI quality from three dimensions, i.e., \"visual quality\", \"authenticity\", and \"consistency\". Specifically, inspired by the characteristics of the human visual system and motivated by the observation that \"visual quality\" and \"authenticity\" are characterized by both local and global aspects, AMFF-Net scales the image up and down and takes the scaled images and original-sized image as the inputs to obtain multi-scale features. After that, an Adaptive Feature Fusion (AFF) block is used to adaptively fuse the multi-scale features with learnable weights. In addition, considering the correlation between the image and prompt, AMFF-Net compares the semantic features from text encoder and image encoder to evaluate the text-to-image alignment. We carry out extensive experiments on three AGI quality assessment databases, and the experimental results show that our AMFF-Net obtains better performance than nine state-of-the-art blind IQA methods. The results of ablation experiments further demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed multi-scale input strategy and AFF block. ",

    "abstract": "Recently, implicit neural representations (INR) have made significant strides in various vision-related domains, providing a novel solution for Multispectral and Hyperspectral Image Fusion (MHIF) tasks. However, INR is prone to losing high-frequency information and is confined to the lack of global perceptual capabilities. To address these issues, this paper introduces a Fourier-enhanced Implicit Neural Fusion Network (FeINFN) specifically designed for MHIF task, targeting the following phenomena: The Fourier amplitudes of the HR-HSI latent code and LR-HSI are remarkably similar; however, their phases exhibit different patterns. In FeINFN, we innovatively propose a spatial and frequency implicit fusion function (Spa-Fre IFF), helping INR capture high-frequency information and expanding the receptive field. Besides, a new decoder employing a complex Gabor wavelet activation function, called Spatial-Frequency Interactive Decoder (SFID), is invented to enhance the interaction of INR features. Especially, we further theoretically prove that the Gabor wavelet activation possesses a time-frequency tightness property that favors learning the optimal bandwidths in the decoder. Experiments on two benchmark MHIF datasets verify the state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance of the proposed method, both visually and quantitatively. Also, ablation studies demonstrate the mentioned contributions. The code will be available on Anonymous GitHub (https://anonymous.4open.science/r/FeINFN-15C9/) after possible acceptance. ",

It also means that a network only works with pre-defined and fixed input- and output sizes. This is a consequence of having the number of optimized parameters being directly dependent on the structure of the network. Structural rigidity limits the ability to optimize parameters of policies across multiple environments that do not share input and output spaces. Here, we evolve a set of neurons and plastic synapses each represented by a gated recurrent unit (GRU). During optimization, the parameters of these fundamental units of a neural network are optimized in different random structural configurations. Earlier work has shown that parameter sharing between units is important for making structurally flexible neurons We show that it is possible to optimize a set of distinct neuron- and synapse types allowing for a mitigation of the symmetry dilemma. We demonstrate this by optimizing a single set of neurons and synapses to solve multiple reinforcement learning control tasks simultaneously. ",

We employ persistent homology (PH), a topological data analysis method that helps analyze the topological information of graphs, to explain the reasons for the high performance. We propose a novel method that employs PH for LP (PHLP) focusing on how the presence or absence of target links influences the overall topology. The PHLP utilizes the angle hop subgraph and new node labeling called degree double radius node labeling (Degree DRNL), distinguishing the information of graphs better than DRNL. Using only a classifier, PHLP performs similarly to state-of-the-art (SOTA) models on most benchmark datasets. Incorporating the outputs calculated using PHLP into the existing GNN-based SOTA models improves performance across all benchmark datasets. To the best of our knowledge, PHLP is the first method of applying PH to LP without GNNs. The proposed approach, employing PH while not relying on neural networks, enables the identification of crucial factors for improving performance. ",

Despite the gravity of GBV, these women often face formidable barriers in voicing their experiences and accessing support. \"Augmented Voices\" emerges as a technological beacon, harnessing the potential of augmented reality (AR) to bridge the digital and physical realms through mobile devices, enhancing the visibility of these often-silenced voices. With its technological motivation firmly anchored in the convergence of AR and real-world interactions, \"Augmented Voices\" offers a digital platform where storytelling acts as a catalyst, bringing to the fore the experiences shared by these women. By superimposing their narratives onto physical locations via Geographic Information System (GIS) Mapping, the application \"augments their voices\" in the diaspora, providing a conduit for expression and solidarity. This project, currently at its developmental stage, aspires to elevate the stories of GBV victims to a level where their struggles are not just heard but felt, forging a powerful connection between the user and the narrative. It is designed to transcend the limitations of conventional storytelling, creating an \"augmented\" reality where voices that are often muted by societal constraints can resonate powerfully. The project underscores the urgent imperative to confront GBV, catalyzing societal transformation and fostering robust support networks for those in the margins. It is a pioneering example of how technology can become a formidable ally in the fight for social justice and the empowerment of the oppressed. Additionally, this paper delves into the AR workflow illustrating its relevance and contribution to the broader theme of site-specific AR for social justice. ",

This method effectively addresses elliptic PDEs on irregular domains, including the modified Helmholtz, Stokes, and elasticity equations. The rapid evolution of neural networks and deep learning has invigorated the exploration of numerical PDEs. An increasing interest is observed in deep learning approaches that seamlessly integrate mathematical principles for investigating numerical PDEs. We propose a hybrid KFBI method, integrating the foundational principles of the KFBI method with the capabilities of deep learning. This approach, within the framework of the boundary integral method, designs a network to approximate the solution operator for the corresponding integral equations by mapping the parameters, inhomogeneous terms and boundary information of PDEs to the boundary density functions, which can be regarded as the solution of the integral equations. The models are trained using data generated by the Cartesian grid-based KFBI algorithm, exhibiting robust generalization capabilities. It accurately predicts density functions across diverse boundary conditions and parameters within the same class of equations. Experimental results demonstrate that the trained model can directly infer the boundary density function with satisfactory precision, obviating the need for iterative steps in solving boundary integral equations. Furthermore, applying the inference results of the model as initial values for iterations is also reasonable; this approach can retain the inherent second-order accuracy of the KFBI method while accelerating the traditional KFBI approach by reducing about 50% iterations.

By applying XFT to a 1.3B model, we create a new state-of-the-art tiny code LLM (<3B) with 67.1 and 64.6 pass@1 on HumanEval and HumanEval+ respectively. With the same data and model architecture, XFT improves supervised fine-tuning (SFT) by 13% on HumanEval+, along with consistent improvements from 2% to 13% on MBPP+, MultiPL-E, and DS-1000, demonstrating its generalizability. XFT is fully orthogonal to existing techniques such as Evol-Instruct and OSS-Instruct, opening a new dimension for improving code instruction tuning.

    "abstract": "When deploying pre-trained video object detectors in real-world scenarios, the domain gap between training and testing data caused by adverse image conditions often leads to performance degradation. Addressing this issue becomes particularly challenging when only the pre-trained model and degraded videos are available. Although various source-free domain adaptation (SFDA) methods have been proposed for single-frame object detectors, SFDA for video object detection (VOD) remains unexplored. Moreover, most unsupervised domain adaptation works for object detection rely on two-stage detectors, while SFDA for one-stage detectors, which are more vulnerable to fine-tuning, is not well addressed in the literature. In this paper, we propose Spatial-Temporal Alternate Refinement with Mean Teacher (STAR-MT), a simple yet effective SFDA method for VOD. Specifically, we aim to improve the performance of the one-stage VOD method, YOLOV, under adverse image conditions, including noise, air turbulence, and haze. Extensive experiments on the ImageNetVOD dataset and its degraded versions demonstrate that our method consistently improves video object detection performance in challenging imaging conditions, showcasing its potential for real-world applications.

We present two methods for determining the threshold: the first seeks a set of edges that leaves no disconnected nodes in the network; the second seeks a causal large connected component in the data. We tested these methods both for discrete synthetic and real data, and compared the results with those obtained for the PC algorithm, which we took as the benchmark. We show that this novel algorithm is generally faster and more accurate than the PC algorithm. The algorithm for determining the thresholds requires choosing a measure of causality. We tested our methods for Fisher Correlations, commonly used in PC algorithm (for instance in \\cite{kalisch2005}), and further proposed a discrete and asymmetric measure of causality, that we called Net Influence, which provided very good results when inferring causal networks from discrete data. This metric allows for inferring directionality of the edges in the process of applying the thresholds, speeding up the inference of causal DAGs. ",

Unlike previous approaches, we do not employ the integral relation imposed by unitarity, but instead train FNOs to discover it from many samples of amplitudes with finite partial wave expansions. When trained only on true samples, the FNO correctly predicts (unique or ambiguous) phases of amplitudes with infinite partial wave expansions. When also trained on false samples, it can rate the quality of its prediction by producing a true/false classifying index. We observe that the value of this index is strongly correlated with the violation of the unitarity constraint for the predicted phase, and present examples where it delineates the boundary between allowed and disallowed profiles of the modulus. Our application of FNOs is unconventional: it involves a simultaneous regression-classification task and emphasizes the role of statistics in ensembles of NOs.

We demonstrate this phenomenon on a prototypical stochastic second-order algorithm, called Mini-Batch Stochastic Variance-Reduced Newton ($\\texttt{Mb-SVRN}$), which combines variance-reduced gradient estimates with access to an approximate Hessian oracle. In particular, we show that when the data size $n$ is sufficiently large, i.e., $n\\gg \\alpha^2\\kappa$, where $\\kappa$ is the condition number and $\\alpha$ is the Hessian approximation factor, then $\\texttt{Mb-SVRN}$ achieves a fast linear convergence rate that is independent of the gradient mini-batch size $b$, as long $b$ is in the range between $1$ and $b_{\\max}=O(n/(\\alpha \\log n))$. Only after increasing the mini-batch size past this critical point $b_{\\max}$, the method begins to transition into a standard Newton-type algorithm which is much more sensitive to the Hessian approximation quality. We demonstrate this phenomenon empirically on benchmark optimization tasks showing that, after tuning the step size, the convergence rate of $\\texttt{Mb-SVRN}$ remains fast for a wide range of mini-batch sizes, and the dependence of the phase transition point $b_{\\max}$ on the Hessian approximation factor $\\alpha$ aligns with our theoretical predictions.

This paper presents a new Federated Learning with Adjusted leaRning ratE (FLARE) framework to mitigate the impact of the heterogeneity. The key idea is to allow the participating devices to adjust their individual learning rates and local training iterations, adapting to their instantaneous computing powers. The convergence upper bound of FLARE is established rigorously under a general setting with non-convex models in the presence of non-i.i.d. datasets and imbalanced computing powers. By minimizing the upper bound, we further optimize the scheduling of FLARE to exploit the channel heterogeneity. A nested problem structure is revealed to facilitate iteratively allocating the bandwidth with binary search and selecting devices with a new greedy method. A linear problem structure is also identified and a low-complexity linear programming scheduling policy is designed when training models have large Lipschitz constants. Experiments demonstrate that FLARE consistently outperforms the baselines in test accuracy, and converges much faster with the proposed scheduling policy. ",

The results show that using only three phase-diverse images captured above, below and at the focal plane with an amplitude of 1 achieves a low RMSE of 0.10 radians on the simulated PSF dataset. Furthermore, this approach directly predicts Zernike modes simulated extended 2D samples, while maintaining a comparable RMSE of 0.15 radians. We demonstrate that this approach is effective using only a single prediction step, or can be iterated a small number of times.
