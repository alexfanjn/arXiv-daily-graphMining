    "title": "Spike-driven Transformer V2: Meta Spiking Neural Network Architecture  Inspiring the Design of Next-generation Neuromorphic Chips",
    "abstract": "Neuromorphic computing, which exploits Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) on neuromorphic chips, is a promising energy-efficient alternative to traditional AI. CNN-based SNNs are the current mainstream of neuromorphic computing. By contrast, no neuromorphic chips are designed especially for Transformer-based SNNs, which have just emerged, and their performance is only on par with CNN-based SNNs, offering no distinct advantage. In this work, we propose a general Transformer-based SNN architecture, termed as ``Meta-SpikeFormer\", whose goals are: 1) Lower-power, supports the spike-driven paradigm that there is only sparse addition in the network; 2) Versatility, handles various vision tasks; 3) High-performance, shows overwhelming performance advantages over CNN-based SNNs; 4) Meta-architecture, provides inspiration for future next-generation Transformer-based neuromorphic chip designs. Specifically, we extend the Spike-driven Transformer in \\citet{yao2023spike} into a meta architecture, and explore the impact of structure, spike-driven self-attention, and skip connection on its performance. On ImageNet-1K, Meta-SpikeFormer achieves 80.0\\% top-1 accuracy (55M), surpassing the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) SNN baselines (66M) by 3.7\\%. This is the first direct training SNN backbone that can simultaneously supports classification, detection, and segmentation, obtaining SOTA results in SNNs. Finally, we discuss the inspiration of the meta SNN architecture for neuromorphic chip design. Source code and models are available at \\url{https://github.com/BICLab/Spike-Driven-Transformer-V2}. ",

The general informational parameters as the global quantitative measure of the neural systems computing potential as absolute and relative neural power were proposed. Neural information organizing and processing follows the way in which nature manages neural information by developing functions, functionalities and circuits related to different internal or peripheral components and also to the whole system through a non-deterministic memorization, fragmentation and aggregation of afferent and efferent information, deep neural information processing representing multiple alternations of fragmentation and aggregation stages. The relevant neural characteristics were integrated into a neural machine type model that incorporates unitary also peripheral or interface components as the central ones. The proposed approach allows overcoming the technical constraints in artificial computational implementations of neural information processes and also provides a more relevant description of natural ones.

    "abstract": "Freezing of gait (FOG) is one of the most incapacitating symptoms in Parkinsons disease, affecting more than 50 percent of patients in advanced stages of the disease. The presence of FOG may lead to falls and a loss of independence with a consequent reduction in the quality of life. Wearable technology and artificial intelligence have been used for automatic FOG detection to optimize monitoring. However, differences between laboratory and daily-life conditions present challenges for the implementation of reliable detection systems. Consequently, improvement of FOG detection methods remains important to provide accurate monitoring mechanisms intended for free-living and real-time use. This paper presents advances in automatic FOG detection using a single body-worn triaxial accelerometer and a novel classification algorithm based on Transformers and convolutional networks. This study was performed with data from 21 patients who manifested FOG episodes while performing activities of daily living in a home setting. Results indicate that the proposed FOG-Transformer can bring a significant improvement in FOG detection using leave-one-subject-out cross-validation (LOSO CV). These results bring opportunities for the implementation of accurate monitoring systems for use in ambulatory or home settings. ",

    "abstract": "Counterfactual learning to rank (CLTR) has attracted extensive attention in the IR community for its ability to leverage massive logged user interaction data to train ranking models. While the CLTR models can be theoretically unbiased when the user behavior assumption is correct and the propensity estimation is accurate, their effectiveness is usually empirically evaluated via simulation-based experiments due to a lack of widely-available, large-scale, real click logs. However, the mainstream simulation-based experiments are somewhat limited as they often feature a single, deterministic production ranker and simplified user simulation models to generate the synthetic click logs. As a result, the robustness of CLTR models in complex and diverse situations is largely unknown and needs further investigation. To address this problem, in this paper, we aim to investigate the robustness of existing CLTR models in a reproducibility study with extensive simulation-based experiments that (1) use both deterministic and stochastic production rankers, each with different ranking performance, and (2) leverage multiple user simulation models with different user behavior assumptions. We find that the DLA models and IPS-DCM show better robustness under various simulation settings than IPS-PBM and PRS with offline propensity estimation. Besides, the existing CLTR models often fail to outperform the naive click baselines when the production ranker has relatively high ranking performance or certain randomness, which suggests an urgent need for developing new CLTR algorithms that work for these settings.

    "abstract": "Artificial neural networks (ANNs) are at the core of most Deep learning (DL) algorithms that successfully tackle complex problems like image recognition, autonomous driving, and natural language processing. However, unlike biological brains who tackle similar problems in a very efficient manner, DL algorithms require a large number of trainable parameters, making them energy-intensive and prone to overfitting. Here, we show that a new ANN architecture that incorporates the structured connectivity and restricted sampling properties of biological dendrites counteracts these limitations. We find that dendritic ANNs are more robust to overfitting and outperform traditional ANNs on several image classification tasks while using significantly fewer trainable parameters. This is achieved through the adoption of a different learning strategy, whereby most of the nodes respond to several classes, unlike classical ANNs that strive for class-specificity. These findings suggest that the incorporation of dendrites can make learning in ANNs precise, resilient, and parameter-efficient and shed new light on how biological features can impact the learning strategies of ANNs.

    "abstract": "One of today's main concerns is to bring Artificial Intelligence power to embedded systems for edge applications. The hardware resources and power consumption required by state-of-the-art models are incompatible with the constrained environments observed in edge systems, such as IoT nodes and wearable devices. Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) can represent a solution in this sense: inspired by neuroscience, they reach unparalleled power and resource efficiency when run on dedicated hardware accelerators. However, when designing such accelerators, the amount of choices that can be taken is huge. This paper presents SpikExplorer, a modular and flexible Python tool for hardware-oriented Automatic Design Space Exploration to automate the configuration of FPGA accelerators for SNNs. Using Bayesian optimizations, SpikerExplorer enables hardware-centric multi-objective optimization, supporting factors such as accuracy, area, latency, power, and various combinations during the exploration process. The tool searches the optimal network architecture, neuron model, and internal and training parameters, trying to reach the desired constraints imposed by the user. It allows for a straightforward network configuration, providing the full set of explored points for the user to pick the trade-off that best fits the needs. The potential of SpikExplorer is showcased using three benchmark datasets. It reaches 95.8% accuracy on the MNIST dataset, with a power consumption of 180mW/image and a latency of 0.12 ms/image, making it a powerful tool for automatically optimizing SNNs. ",

    "abstract": "A disk graph is an intersection graph of disks in $\\mathbb{R}^2$. Determining the computational complexity of finding a maximum clique in a disk graph is a long-standing open problem. In 1990, Clark, Colbourn, and Johnson gave a polynomial-time algorithm for computing a maximum clique in a unit disk graph. However, finding a maximum clique when disks are of arbitrary size is widely believed to be a challenging open problem. The problem is open even if we restrict the disks to have at most two different sizes of radii, or restrict the radii to be within $[1,1+\\varepsilon]$ for some $\\epsilon>0$. In this paper, we provide a new perspective to examine adjacencies in a disk graph that helps obtain the following results. - We design an $O(2^k n^{2k} poly(n))$-time algorithm to find a maximum clique in a $n$-vertex disk graph with $k$ different sizes of radii. This is polynomial for every fixed $k$, and thus settles the open question for the case when $k=2$. - Given a set of $n$ unit disks, we show how to compute a maximum clique inside each possible axis-aligned rectangle determined by the disk centers in $O(n^5\\log n)$-time. This is at least a factor of $n^{4/3}$ faster than applying the fastest known algorithm for finding a maximum clique in a unit disk graph for each rectangle independently. - We give an $O(2^kn^{2rk} poly(n,r))$-time algorithm to find a maximum clique in a $n$-vertex ball graph with $k$ different sizes of radii where the ball centers lie on $r$ parallel planes. This is polynomial for every fixed $k$ and $r$, and thus contrasts the previously known NP-hardness result for finding a maximum clique in an arbitrary ball graph. ",

In contrast to the usual time-stepping approach, we discretize the optimality system by space-time continuous piecewise-linear finite element basis functions which are defined on fully unstructured simplicial meshes. If we aim at the asymptotically best approximation of the given desired state $y_d$ by the computed finite element state $y_{\\varrho h}$, then the optimal choice of the regularization parameter $\\varrho$ is linked to the space-time finite element mesh-size $h$ by the relations $\\varrho=h^4$ and $\\varrho=h^2$ for the $L^2$ and the energy regularization, respectively. For this setting, we can construct robust (parallel) iterative solvers for the reduced finite element optimality systems. These results can be generalized to variable regularization parameters adapted to the local behavior of the mesh-size that can heavily change in the case of adaptive mesh refinements. The numerical results illustrate the theoretical findings firmly. ",

We initially propose to introduce a regularization term which makes use of the relative entropy to the standard multi-task objective. We then demonstrate through duality that this novel formulation itself is equivalent to the maximization of a submodular function, which may be efficiently carried out through standard greedy selection methods. This approach bridges the existing gap in the optimization of performance-robustness trade-offs in multi-task subset selection. To numerically validate our theoretical results, we test the proposed method in two different setting, one involving the selection of satellites in low Earth orbit constellations in the context of a sensor selection problem, and the other involving an image summarization task using neural networks. Our method is compared with two other algorithms focused on optimizing the performance of the worst-case task, and on directly optimizing the performance on the reference distribution itself. We conclude that our novel formulation produces a solution that is locally distributional robust, and computationally inexpensive. ",

Despite well over half a century of research on high-dimensional approximation, this remains a challenging problem. Yet, significant advances have been made in the last decade towards efficient methods for doing this, commencing with so-called sparse polynomial approximation methods and continuing most recently with methods based on Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). In tandem, there have been substantial advances in the relevant approximation theory and analysis of these techniques. In this work, we survey this recent progress. We describe the contemporary motivations for this problem, which stem from parametric models and computational uncertainty quantification; the relevant function classes, namely, classes of infinite-dimensional, Banach-valued, holomorphic functions; fundamental limits of learnability from finite data for these classes; and finally, sparse polynomial and DNN methods for efficiently learning such functions from finite data. For the latter, there is currently a significant gap between the approximation theory of DNNs and the practical performance of deep learning. Aiming to narrow this gap, we develop the topic of practical existence theory, which asserts the existence of dimension-independent DNN architectures and training strategies that achieve provably near-optimal generalization errors in terms of the amount of training data.

Existing statistical transfer learning methods usually adopt a global similarity measure between the source data and the target data, which may lead to inefficiency when only local information is shared. In this paper, we propose a novel Bayesian transfer learning method named \"CONCERT\" to allow robust local information transfer for high-dimensional data analysis. A novel conditional spike-and-slab prior is introduced in the joint distribution of target and source parameters for information transfer. By incorporating covariate-specific priors, we can characterize the local similarities and make the sources work collaboratively to help improve the performance on the target. Distinguished from existing work, CONCERT is a one-step procedure, which achieves variable selection and information transfer simultaneously. Variable selection consistency is established for our CONCERT. To make our algorithm scalable, we adopt the variational Bayes framework to facilitate implementation. Extensive experiments and a genetic data analysis demonstrate the validity and the advantage of CONCERT over existing cutting-edge transfer learning methods. We also extend our CONCERT to the logistical models with numerical studies showing its superiority over other methods. ",

With a novel combination of different protection techniques, it can run on embedded and low-power IoT devices, which may lack proper security features. R5Detect implements a memory-protected shadow stack to prevent runtime modifications, as well as a heuristics detection based on Hardware Performance Counters to detect control-flow integrity violations. Our results indicate that regular software can be protected against different degrees of control-flow manipulations with an average performance overhead of below 5 %.

    "abstract": "Modern kidney placement incorporates several intelligent recommendation systems which exhibit social discrimination due to biases inherited from training data. Although initial attempts were made in the literature to study algorithmic fairness in kidney placement, these methods replace true outcomes with surgeons' decisions due to the long delays involved in recording such outcomes reliably. However, the replacement of true outcomes with surgeons' decisions disregards expert stakeholders' biases as well as social opinions of other stakeholders who do not possess medical expertise. This paper alleviates the latter concern and designs a novel fairness feedback survey to evaluate an acceptance rate predictor (ARP) that predicts a kidney's acceptance rate in a given kidney-match pair. The survey is launched on Prolific, a crowdsourcing platform, and public opinions are collected from 85 anonymous crowd participants. A novel social fairness preference learning algorithm is proposed based on minimizing social feedback regret computed using a novel logit-based fairness feedback model. The proposed model and learning algorithm are both validated using simulation experiments as well as Prolific data. Public preferences towards group fairness notions in the context of kidney placement have been estimated and discussed in detail. The specific ARP tested in the Prolific survey has been deemed fair by the participants. ",

    "abstract": "Tendon-driven continuum robots have been gaining popularity in medical applications due to their ability to curve around complex anatomical structures, potentially reducing the invasiveness of surgery. However, accurate modeling is required to plan and control the movements of these flexible robots. Physics-based models have limitations due to unmodeled effects, leading to mismatches between model prediction and actual robot shape. Recently proposed learning-based methods have been shown to overcome some of these limitations but do not account for hysteresis, a significant source of error for these robots. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel deep decoder neural network that predicts the complete shape of tendon-driven robots using point clouds as the shape representation, conditioned on prior configurations to account for hysteresis. We evaluate our method on a physical tendon-driven robot and show that our network model accurately predicts the robot's shape, significantly outperforming a state-of-the-art physics-based model and a learning-based model that does not account for hysteresis.

    "abstract": "Lymph node (LN) assessment is a critical, indispensable yet very challenging task in the routine clinical workflow of radiology and oncology. Accurate LN analysis is essential for cancer diagnosis, staging, and treatment planning. Finding scatteredly distributed, low-contrast clinically relevant LNs in 3D CT is difficult even for experienced physicians under high inter-observer variations. Previous automatic LN detection works typically yield limited recall and high false positives (FPs) due to adjacent anatomies with similar image intensities, shapes, or textures (vessels, muscles, esophagus, etc). In this work, we propose a new LN DEtection TRansformer, named LN-DETR, to achieve more accurate performance. By enhancing the 2D backbone with a multi-scale 2.5D feature fusion to incorporate 3D context explicitly, more importantly, we make two main contributions to improve the representation quality of LN queries. 1) Considering that LN boundaries are often unclear, an IoU prediction head and a location debiased query selection are proposed to select LN queries of higher localization accuracy as the decoder query's initialization. 2) To reduce FPs, query contrastive learning is employed to explicitly reinforce LN queries towards their best-matched ground-truth queries over unmatched query predictions. Trained and tested on 3D CT scans of 1067 patients (with 10,000+ labeled LNs) via combining seven LN datasets from different body parts (neck, chest, and abdomen) and pathologies/cancers, our method significantly improves the performance of previous leading methods by > 4-5% average recall at the same FP rates in both internal and external testing. We further evaluate on the universal lesion detection task using NIH DeepLesion benchmark, and our method achieves the top performance of 88.46% averaged recall across 0.5 to 4 FPs per image, compared with other leading reported results.

The objective of this study was to develop and implement a framework for addressing both these issues - fairness and explainability. We propose an explainable fairness framework, first developing a model with optimized performance, and then using an in-processing approach to mitigate model biases relative to the sensitive attributes of race and sex. We then explore and visualize explanations of the model changes that lead to the fairness enhancement process through exploring the changes in importance of features. Our resulting-fairness enhanced models retain high sensitivity with improved fairness and explanations of the fairness-enhancement that may provide helpful insights for healthcare providers to guide clinical decision-making and resource allocation.

A key characteristic of a robust cooperative multi-robot system is the ability to repair the communication topology in the case of robot failure. In this paper, we focus on the Fast k-connectivity Restoration (FCR) problem, which aims to repair a network to make it k-connected with minimum robot movement. We develop a Quadratically Constrained Program (QCP) formulation of the FCR problem, which provides a way to optimally solve the problem, but cannot handle large instances due to high computational overhead. We therefore present a scalable algorithm, called EA-SCR, for the FCR problem using graph theoretic concepts. By conducting empirical studies, we demonstrate that the EA-SCR algorithm performs within 10 percent of the optimal while being orders of magnitude faster. We also show that EA-SCR outperforms existing solutions by 30 percent in terms of the FCR distance metric. ",

    "abstract": "In this work, we are interested in automated methods for knowledge graph creation (KGC) from input text. Progress on large language models (LLMs) has prompted a series of recent works applying them to KGC, e.g., via zero/few-shot prompting. Despite successes on small domain-specific datasets, these models face difficulties scaling up to text common in many real-world applications. A principal issue is that in prior methods, the KG schema has to be included in the LLM prompt to generate valid triplets; larger and more complex schema easily exceed the LLMs' context window length. To address this problem, we propose a three-phase framework named Extract-Define-Canonicalize (EDC): open information extraction followed by schema definition and post-hoc canonicalization. EDC is flexible in that it can be applied to settings where a pre-defined target schema is available and when it is not; in the latter case, it constructs a schema automatically and applies self-canonicalization. To further improve performance, we introduce a trained component that retrieves schema elements relevant to the input text; this improves the LLMs' extraction performance in a retrieval-augmented generation-like manner. We demonstrate on three KGC benchmarks that EDC is able to extract high-quality triplets without any parameter tuning and with significantly larger schemas compared to prior works. ",

However, MARL still faces significant challenges, particularly in achieving zero-shot scalability, which allows trained MARL models to be directly applied to unseen tasks with varying numbers of agents. In addition, real-world multi-agent systems usually contain agents with different functions and strategies, while the existing scalable MARL methods only have limited heterogeneity. To address this, we propose a novel MARL framework named Scalable and Heterogeneous Proximal Policy Optimization (SHPPO), integrating heterogeneity into parameter-shared PPO-based MARL networks. we first leverage a latent network to adaptively learn strategy patterns for each agent. Second, we introduce a heterogeneous layer for decision-making, whose parameters are specifically generated by the learned latent variables. Our approach is scalable as all the parameters are shared except for the heterogeneous layer, and gains both inter-individual and temporal heterogeneity at the same time. We implement our approach based on the state-of-the-art backbone PPO-based algorithm as SHPPO, while our approach is agnostic to the backbone and can be seamlessly plugged into any parameter-shared MARL method. SHPPO exhibits superior performance over the baselines such as MAPPO and HAPPO in classic MARL environments like Starcraft Multi-Agent Challenge (SMAC) and Google Research Football (GRF), showcasing enhanced zero-shot scalability and offering insights into the learned latent representation's impact on team performance by visualization.

    "abstract": "In North America, there are many diverse species of native bees crucial for the environment, who are the primary pollinators of most native floral species. The Californian agriculture industry imports European honeybees (Apis Mellifera) primarily for pollinating almonds. Unfortunately, this has resulted in the unintended consequence of disrupting the native ecosystem and threatening many native bee species as they are outcompeted for food. Our first step for protecting the native species is identification with the use of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to differentiate common native bee species from invasive ones. Removing invasive colonies efficiently without harming native species is difficult as pesticides cause myriad diseases in native species. Our approach seeks to prevent the formation of new queens, causing the colony's collapse. Workers secrete royal jelly, a substance that causes fertility and longevity; it is fed to future honeybee queens. Targeting the production of this substance is safe as no native species use it; small organic molecules (ligands) prevent the proteins Apisimin and MRJP1 from combining and producing an oligomer used to form the substance. Ideal ligands bind to only one of these proteins preventing them from joining together: they have a high affinity for one receptor and a significantly lower affinity for the other. We optimized the CNN to provide a framework for creating Machine Learning models that excel at differentiating between subspecies of insects by measuring the effects of image alteration and class grouping on model performance. The CNN is able to achieve an accuracy of 82% in differentiating between invasive and native bee species; 3 ligands have been identified as effective. Our new approach offers a promising solution to curb the spread of invasive bees within California through an identification and neutralization method. ",

    "abstract": "Time series have numerous applications in finance, healthcare, IoT, and smart city. In many of these applications, time series typically contain personal data, so privacy infringement may occur if they are released directly to the public. Recently, local differential privacy (LDP) has emerged as the state-of-the-art approach to protecting data privacy. However, existing works on LDP-based collections cannot preserve the shape of time series. A recent work, PatternLDP, attempts to address this problem, but it can only protect a finite group of elements in a time series due to {\\omega}-event level privacy guarantee. In this paper, we propose PrivShape, a trie-based mechanism under user-level LDP to protect all elements. PrivShape first transforms a time series to reduce its length, and then adopts trie-expansion and two-level refinement to improve utility. By extensive experiments on real-world datasets, we demonstrate that PrivShape outperforms PatternLDP when adapted for offline use, and can effectively extract frequent shapes. ",

Utilizing a fine-tuned ResNet50 architecture, our investigation not only provides effective differentiation of mammographic images into benign and malignant categories but also addresses the opaque \"black-box\" nature of deep learning models by employing XAI methodologies, namely Grad-CAM, LIME, and SHAP, to interpret CNN decision-making processes for healthcare professionals. Our methodology encompasses an elaborate data preprocessing pipeline and advanced data augmentation techniques to counteract dataset limitations, and transfer learning using pre-trained networks, such as VGG-16, DenseNet and ResNet was employed. A focal point of our study is the evaluation of XAI's effectiveness in interpreting model predictions, highlighted by utilising the Hausdorff measure to assess the alignment between AI-generated explanations and expert annotations quantitatively. This approach plays a critical role for XAI in promoting trustworthiness and ethical fairness in AI-assisted diagnostics. The findings from our research illustrate the effective collaboration between CNNs and XAI in advancing diagnostic methods for breast cancer, thereby facilitating a more seamless integration of advanced AI technologies within clinical settings. By enhancing the interpretability of AI-driven decisions, this work lays the groundwork for improved collaboration between AI systems and medical practitioners, ultimately enriching patient care.

Although knowledge graph embedding (KGE) models have demonstrated superior predictive performance on KGC tasks, these models infer missing links in a black-box manner that lacks transparency and accountability, preventing researchers from developing accountable models. Existing KGE-based explanation methods focus on exploring key paths or isolated edges as explanations, which is information-less to reason target prediction. Additionally, the missing ground truth leads to these explanation methods being ineffective in quantitatively evaluating explored explanations. To overcome these limitations, we propose KGExplainer, a model-agnostic method that identifies connected subgraph explanations and distills an evaluator to assess them quantitatively. KGExplainer employs a perturbation-based greedy search algorithm to find key connected subgraphs as explanations within the local structure of target predictions. To evaluate the quality of the explored explanations, KGExplainer distills an evaluator from the target KGE model. By forwarding the explanations to the evaluator, our method can examine the fidelity of them. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that KGExplainer yields promising improvement and achieves an optimal ratio of 83.3% in human evaluation. ",

    "abstract": "Community detection in multi-layer networks has emerged as a crucial area of modern network analysis. However, conventional approaches often assume that nodes belong exclusively to a single community, which fails to capture the complex structure of real-world networks where nodes may belong to multiple communities simultaneously. To address this limitation, we propose novel spectral methods to estimate the common mixed memberships in the multi-layer mixed membership stochastic block model. The proposed methods leverage the eigen-decomposition of three aggregate matrices: the sum of adjacency matrices, the debiased sum of squared adjacency matrices, and the sum of squared adjacency matrices. We establish rigorous theoretical guarantees for the consistency of our methods. Specifically, we derive per-node error rates under mild conditions on network sparsity, demonstrating their consistency as the number of nodes and/or layers increases under the multi-layer mixed membership stochastic block model. Our theoretical results reveal that the method leveraging the sum of adjacency matrices generally performs poorer than the other two methods for mixed membership estimation in multi-layer networks. We conduct extensive numerical experiments to empirically validate our theoretical findings. For real-world multi-layer networks with unknown community information, we introduce two novel modularity metrics to quantify the quality of mixed membership community detection. Finally, we demonstrate the practical applications of our algorithms and modularity metrics by applying them to real-world multi-layer networks, demonstrating their effectiveness in extracting meaningful community structures.

The data they collect are extremely useful, including in the fight against climate change. However, these data and the information that can be inferred from them are highly sensitive. Re-pseudonymization, i.e., the frequent replacement of random identifiers over time, is widely used to share smart meter data while mitigating the risk of re-identification. We here show how, in spite of re-pseudonymization, households' consumption records can be pieced together with high accuracy in large-scale datasets. We propose the first deep learning-based profiling attack against re-pseudonymized smart meter data. Our attack combines neural network embeddings, which are used to extract features from weekly consumption records and are tailored to the smart meter identification task, with a nearest neighbor classifier. We evaluate six neural networks architectures as the embedding model. Our results suggest that the Transformer and CNN-LSTM architectures vastly outperform previous methods as well as other architectures, successfully identifying the correct household 73.4% of the time among 5139 households based on electricity and gas consumption records (54.5% for electricity only). We further show that the features extracted by the embedding model maintain their effectiveness when transferred to a set of users disjoint from the one used to train the model. Finally, we extensively evaluate the robustness of our results. Taken together, our results strongly suggest that even frequent re-pseudonymization strategies can be reversed, strongly limiting their ability to prevent re-identification in practice. ",

However, this challenge is often impeded by the lack of comprehensive understanding of how specific code modifications influence quality metrics. Objective: This study ventures to bridge this gap through an approach that aspires to assess and interpret the impact of code modifications. The underlying hypothesis posits that code modifications inducing similar changes in software quality metrics can be grouped into distinct clusters, which can be effectively described using an AI language model, thus providing a simple understanding of code changes and their quality implications. Method: To validate this hypothesis, we built and analyzed a dataset from popular GitHub repositories, segmented into individual code modifications. Each project was evaluated against software quality metrics pre and post-application. Machine learning techniques were utilized to cluster these modifications based on the induced changes in the metrics. Simultaneously, an AI language model was employed to generate descriptions of each modification's function. Results: The results reveal distinct clusters of code modifications, each accompanied by a concise description, revealing their collective impact on software quality metrics. Conclusions: The findings suggest that this research is a significant step towards a comprehensive understanding of the complex relationship between code changes and software quality, which has the potential to transform software maintenance strategies and enable the development of more accurate quality prediction models.

    "abstract": "We study the following Independent Stable Set problem. Let G be an undirected graph and M = (V(G),I) be a matroid whose elements are the vertices of G. For an integer k\\geq 1, the task is to decide whether G contains a set S\\subseteq V(G) of size at least k which is independent (stable) in G and independent in M. This problem generalizes several well-studied algorithmic problems, including Rainbow Independent Set, Rainbow Matching, and Bipartite Matching with Separation. We show that - When the matroid M is represented by the independence oracle, then for any computable function f, no algorithm can solve Independent Stable Set using f(k)n^{o(k)} calls to the oracle. - On the other hand, when the graph G is of degeneracy d, then the problem is solvable in time O((d+1)^kn), and hence is FPT parameterized by d+k. Moreover, when the degeneracy d is a constant (which is not a part of the input), the problem admits a kernel polynomial in k. More precisely, we prove that for every integer d\\geq 0, the problem admits a kernelization algorithm that in time n^{O(d)} outputs an equivalent framework with a graph on dk^{O(d)} vertices. A lower bound complements this when d is part of the input: Independent Stable Set does not admit a polynomial kernel when parameterized by k+d unless NP \\subseteq coNP/poly. This lower bound holds even when M is a partition matroid. - Another set of results concerns the scenario when the graph G is chordal. In this case, our computational lower bound excludes an FPT algorithm when the input matroid is given by its independence oracle. However, we demonstrate that Independent Stable Set can be solved in 2^{O(k)}||M||^{O(1)} time when M is a linear matroid given by its representation. In the same setting, Independent Stable Set does not have a polynomial kernel when parameterized by k unless NP\\subseteq coNP/poly. ",

    "abstract": "For a viewpoint-diverse news recommender, identifying whether two news articles express the same viewpoint is essential. One way to determine \"same or different\" viewpoint is stance detection. In this paper, we investigate the robustness of operationalization choices for few-shot stance detection, with special attention to modelling stance across different topics. Our experiments test pre-registered hypotheses on stance detection. Specifically, we compare two stance task definitions (Pro/Con versus Same Side Stance), two LLM architectures (bi-encoding versus cross-encoding), and adding Natural Language Inference knowledge, with pre-trained RoBERTa models trained with shots of 100 examples from 7 different stance detection datasets. Some of our hypotheses and claims from earlier work can be confirmed, while others give more inconsistent results. The effect of the Same Side Stance definition on performance differs per dataset and is influenced by other modelling choices. We found no relationship between the number of training topics in the training shots and performance. In general, cross-encoding out-performs bi-encoding, and adding NLI training to our models gives considerable improvement, but these results are not consistent across all datasets. Our results indicate that it is essential to include multiple datasets and systematic modelling experiments when aiming to find robust modelling choices for the concept `stance'. ",

Given a new prediction task, finding the best model to fine-tune can be computationally intensive and costly, especially when the number of pre-trained models is large. Selecting the right pre-trained models is crucial, yet complicated by the diversity of models from various model families (like ResNet, Vit, Swin) and the hidden relationships between models and datasets. Existing methods, which utilize basic information from models and datasets to compute scores indicating model performance on target datasets, overlook the intrinsic relationships, limiting their effectiveness in model selection. In this study, we introduce TransferGraph, a novel framework that reformulates model selection as a graph learning problem. TransferGraph constructs a graph using extensive metadata extracted from models and datasets, while capturing their inherent relationships. Through comprehensive experiments across 16 real datasets, both images and texts, we demonstrate TransferGraph's effectiveness in capturing essential model-dataset relationships, yielding up to a 32% improvement in correlation between predicted performance and the actual fine-tuning results compared to the state-of-the-art methods.

We found that the existing state-of-the-art methods are generally superior to ChatGPT in software vulnerability detection. Although ChatGPT improves accuracy when providing context information, it still has limitations in accurately predicting severity ratings for certain CWE types. In addition, ChatGPT demonstrates some ability in locating vulnerabilities for certain CWE types, but its performance varies among different CWE types. ChatGPT exhibits limited vulnerability repair capabilities in both providing and not providing context information. Finally, ChatGPT shows uneven performance in generating CVE descriptions for various CWE types, with limited accuracy in detailed information. Overall, though ChatGPT performs well in some aspects, it still needs improvement in understanding the subtle differences in code vulnerabilities and the ability to describe vulnerabilities in order to fully realize its potential. Our evaluation framework provides valuable insights for further enhancing ChatGPT' s software vulnerability handling capabilities. ",

In this study, we focus on users' comprehension of the privacy protection provided by a differential privacy mechanism. To do so, we study three variants of explaining the privacy protection provided by differential privacy: (1) the original mathematical definition; (2) $\\varepsilon$ translated into a specific privacy risk; and (3) an explanation using the randomized response technique. We compare users' comprehension of privacy protection employing these explanatory models with their comprehension of privacy protection of $k$-anonymity as baseline comprehensibility. Our findings suggest that participants' comprehension of differential privacy protection is enhanced by the privacy risk model and the randomized response-based model. Moreover, our results confirm our intuition that privacy protection provided by $k$-anonymity is more comprehensible. ",

Rates expire when their number of unsuccessful trials has exceeded a threshold, while rates currently not present in the archive can enter it in two ways: (i) via user-defined minimum selection probabilities for rates combined with a successful step or (ii) via a stagnation detection mechanism increasing the value for a promising rate after the current bit-flip neighborhood has been explored with high probability. For the minimum selection probabilities, we suggest different options, including heavy-tailed distributions. We conduct rigorous runtime analysis of the flexible evolutionary algorithm on the OneMax and Jump functions, on general unimodal functions, on minimum spanning trees, and on a class of hurdle-like functions with varying hurdle width that benefit particularly from the archive of promising mutation rates. In all cases, the runtime bounds are close to or even outperform the best known results for both stagnation detection and heavy-tailed mutations. ",

Current 3D few-shot segmentation methods first pre-train models on 'seen' classes, and then evaluate their generalization performance on 'unseen' classes. However, the prior pre-training stage not only introduces excessive time overhead but also incurs a significant domain gap on 'unseen' classes. To tackle these issues, we propose a Non-parametric Network for few-shot 3D Segmentation, Seg-NN, and its Parametric variant, Seg-PN. Without training, Seg-NN extracts dense representations by hand-crafted filters and achieves comparable performance to existing parametric models. Due to the elimination of pre-training, Seg-NN can alleviate the domain gap issue and save a substantial amount of time. Based on Seg-NN, Seg-PN only requires training a lightweight QUEry-Support Transferring (QUEST) module, which enhances the interaction between the support set and query set. Experiments suggest that Seg-PN outperforms previous state-of-the-art method by +4.19% and +7.71% mIoU on S3DIS and ScanNet datasets respectively, while reducing training time by -90%, indicating its effectiveness and efficiency.

Traditional derivative-free optimization techniques often rely on strong assumptions about objective functions, thereby failing at optimizing non-convex systems beyond 100 dimensions. Here, we present a tree search method for derivative-free optimization that enables accelerated optimal design of high-dimensional complex systems. Specifically, we introduce stochastic tree expansion, dynamic upper confidence bound, and short-range backpropagation mechanism to evade local optimum, iteratively approximating the global optimum using machine learning models. This development effectively confronts the dimensionally challenging problems, achieving convergence to global optima across various benchmark functions up to 2,000 dimensions, surpassing the existing methods by 10- to 20-fold. Our method demonstrates wide applicability to a wide range of real-world complex systems spanning materials, physics, and biology, considerably outperforming state-of-the-art algorithms. This enables efficient autonomous knowledge discovery and facilitates self-driving virtual laboratories.

We introduce a new anomaly detection model that unifies the OC-SVM and DL residual functions into a single composite objective, subsequently solved through K-SVD-type iterative algorithms. A closed-form of the alternating K-SVD iteration is explicitly derived for the new composite model and practical implementable schemes are discussed. The standard DL model is adapted for the Dictionary Pair Learning (DPL) context, where the usual sparsity constraints are naturally eliminated. Finally, we extend both objectives to the more general setting that allows the use of kernel functions.

HNAM expands upon Neural Additive Models (NAM) by introducing a time-series specific additive model with a level and interacting covariate components. Covariate interactions are only allowed according to a user-specified interaction hierarchy. For example, weekday effects may be estimated independently of other covariates, whereas a holiday effect may depend on the weekday and an additional promotion may depend on both former covariates that are lower in the interaction hierarchy. Thereby, HNAM yields an intuitive forecasting interface in which analysts can observe the contribution for each known covariate. We evaluate the proposed approach and benchmark its performance against other state-of-the-art machine learning and statistical models extensively on real-world retail data. The results reveal that HNAM offers competitive prediction performance whilst providing plausible explanations. ",

This work presents a centralized network control algorithm executable on already existing quantum computer which are based on the principle of quantum annealing like the D-Wave Advantage. We introduce a resource reoccupation algorithm for traffic engineering in wide-area networks. The proposed optimization algorithm changes traffic steering and resource allocation in case of overloaded transceivers. Settings of active components like fiber amplifiers and transceivers are not changed for the reason of stability. This algorithm is beneficial in situations when the network traffic is fluctuating in time scales of seconds or spontaneous bursts occur. Further, we developed a discrete-time flow simulator to study the algorithm's performance in wide-area networks. Our network simulator considers backlog and loss modeling of buffered transmission lines. Concurring flows are handled equally in case of a backlog. This work provides an ILP-based network configuring algorithm that is applicable on quantum annealing computers. We showcase, that traffic losses can be reduced significantly by a factor of 2 if a resource reoccupation algorithm is applied in a network with bursty traffic. As resources are used more efficiently by reoccupation in heavy load situations, overprovisioning of networks can be reduced. Thus, this new form of network operation leads toward a zero-margin network. We show that our newly introduced network simulator enables analyses of short-time effects like buffering within fat-pipe networks. As the calculation of network configurations in real-sized networks is typically time-consuming, quantum computing can enable the proposed network configuration algorithm for application in real-sized wide-area networks.

Existing privacy protection techniques are unable to efficiently protect such data. For example, Differential Privacy (DP) that is an emerging technique protects data with strong privacy guarantee cannot effectively protect visual features of exposed image dataset. In this paper, we propose a novel privacy-preserving framework VisualMixer that protects the training data of visual DNN tasks by pixel shuffling, while not injecting any noises. VisualMixer utilizes a new privacy metric called Visual Feature Entropy (VFE) to effectively quantify the visual features of an image from both biological and machine vision aspects. In VisualMixer, we devise a task-agnostic image obfuscation method to protect the visual privacy of data for DNN training and inference. For each image, it determines regions for pixel shuffling in the image and the sizes of these regions according to the desired VFE. It shuffles pixels both in the spatial domain and in the chromatic channel space in the regions without injecting noises so that it can prevent visual features from being discerned and recognized, while incurring negligible accuracy loss. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that VisualMixer can effectively preserve the visual privacy with negligible accuracy loss, i.e., at average 2.35 percentage points of model accuracy loss, and almost no performance degradation on model training.

    "abstract": "The preference alignment aims to enable large language models (LLMs) to generate responses that conform to human values, which is essential for developing general AI systems. Ranking-based methods -- a promising class of alignment approaches -- learn human preferences from datasets containing response pairs by optimizing the log-likelihood margins between preferred and dis-preferred responses. However, due to the inherent differences in annotators' preferences, ranking labels of comparisons for response pairs are unavoidably noisy. This seriously hurts the reliability of existing ranking-based methods. To address this problem, we propose a provably noise-tolerant preference alignment method, namely RObust Preference Optimization (ROPO). To the best of our knowledge, ROPO is the first preference alignment method with noise-tolerance guarantees. The key idea of ROPO is to dynamically assign conservative gradient weights to response pairs with high label uncertainty, based on the log-likelihood margins between the responses. By effectively suppressing the gradients of noisy samples, our weighting strategy ensures that the expected risk has the same gradient direction independent of the presence and proportion of noise. Experiments on three open-ended text generation tasks with four base models ranging in size from 2.8B to 13B demonstrate that ROPO significantly outperforms existing ranking-based methods. ",

    "abstract": "Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) offers a powerful approach to training neural network control policies for stochastic queuing networks (SQN). However, traditional DRL methods rely on offline simulations or static datasets, limiting their real-world application in SQN control. This work proposes Online Deep Reinforcement Learning-based Controls (ODRLC) as an alternative, where an intelligent agent interacts directly with a real environment and learns an optimal control policy from these online interactions. SQNs present a challenge for ODRLC due to the unbounded nature of the queues within the network resulting in an unbounded state-space. An unbounded state-space is particularly challenging for neural network policies as neural networks are notoriously poor at extrapolating to unseen states. To address this challenge, we propose an intervention-assisted framework that leverages strategic interventions from known stable policies to ensure the queue sizes remain bounded. This framework combines the learning power of neural networks with the guaranteed stability of classical control policies for SQNs. We introduce a method to design these intervention-assisted policies to ensure strong stability of the network. Furthermore, we extend foundational DRL theorems for intervention-assisted policies and develop two practical algorithms specifically for ODRLC of SQNs. Finally, we demonstrate through experiments that our proposed algorithms outperform both classical control approaches and prior ODRLC algorithms. ",

    "title": "The Unreasonable Effectiveness Of Early Discarding After One Epoch In  Neural Network Hyperparameter Optimization",
    "abstract": "To reach high performance with deep learning, hyperparameter optimization (HPO) is essential. This process is usually time-consuming due to costly evaluations of neural networks. Early discarding techniques limit the resources granted to unpromising candidates by observing the empirical learning curves and canceling neural network training as soon as the lack of competitiveness of a candidate becomes evident. Despite two decades of research, little is understood about the trade-off between the aggressiveness of discarding and the loss of predictive performance. Our paper studies this trade-off for several commonly used discarding techniques such as successive halving and learning curve extrapolation. Our surprising finding is that these commonly used techniques offer minimal to no added value compared to the simple strategy of discarding after a constant number of epochs of training. The chosen number of epochs depends mostly on the available compute budget. We call this approach i-Epoch (i being the constant number of epochs with which neural networks are trained) and suggest to assess the quality of early discarding techniques by comparing how their Pareto-Front (in consumed training epochs and predictive performance) complement the Pareto-Front of i-Epoch.

    "abstract": "Knowledge probing assesses to which degree a language model (LM) has successfully learned relational knowledge during pre-training. Probing is an inexpensive way to compare LMs of different sizes and training configurations. However, previous approaches rely on the objective function used in pre-training LMs and are thus applicable only to masked or causal LMs. As a result, comparing different types of LMs becomes impossible. To address this, we propose an approach that uses an LM's inherent ability to estimate the log-likelihood of any given textual statement. We carefully design an evaluation dataset of 7,731 instances (40,916 in a larger variant) from which we produce alternative statements for each relational fact, one of which is correct. We then evaluate whether an LM correctly assigns the highest log-likelihood to the correct statement. Our experimental evaluation of 22 common LMs shows that our proposed framework, BEAR, can effectively probe for knowledge across different LM types. We release the BEAR datasets and an open-source framework that implements the probing approach to the research community to facilitate the evaluation and development of LMs. ",

    "abstract": "Federated Learning (FL) is a collaborative learning paradigm enabling participants to collectively train a shared machine learning model while preserving the privacy of their sensitive data. Nevertheless, the inherent decentralized and data-opaque characteristics of FL render its susceptibility to data poisoning attacks. These attacks introduce malformed or malicious inputs during local model training, subsequently influencing the global model and resulting in erroneous predictions. Current FL defense strategies against data poisoning attacks either involve a trade-off between accuracy and robustness or necessitate the presence of a uniformly distributed root dataset at the server. To overcome these limitations, we present FedZZ, which harnesses a zone-based deviating update (ZBDU) mechanism to effectively counter data poisoning attacks in FL. Further, we introduce a precision-guided methodology that actively characterizes these client clusters (zones), which in turn aids in recognizing and discarding malicious updates at the server. Our evaluation of FedZZ across two widely recognized datasets: CIFAR10 and EMNIST, demonstrate its efficacy in mitigating data poisoning attacks, surpassing the performance of prevailing state-of-the-art methodologies in both single and multi-client attack scenarios and varying attack volumes. Notably, FedZZ also functions as a robust client selection strategy, even in highly non-IID and attack-free scenarios. Moreover, in the face of escalating poisoning rates, the model accuracy attained by FedZZ displays superior resilience compared to existing techniques. For instance, when confronted with a 50% presence of malicious clients, FedZZ sustains an accuracy of 67.43%, while the accuracy of the second-best solution, FL-Defender, diminishes to 43.36%. ",

In most modern detection pipelines, however, the detection proposals are processed independently, overlooking the underlying relationships between objects.

Building on two-stage detectors, we tokenize the region of interest (RoI) proposals to be processed by a transformer encoder. Specific spatial and geometric relations are incorporated into the attention weights and adaptively modulated and regularized. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves consistent performance improvement on three benchmarks including DOTA-v1.0, DOTA-v1.5, and HRSC 2016, especially ranking first on both DOTA-v1.5 and HRSC 2016. Specifically, our new method has an increase of 1.59 mAP on DOTA-v1.0, 4.88 mAP on DOTA-v1.5, and 2.1 mAP on HRSC 2016, respectively, compared to the baselines. ",

Nevertheless, the involved wireless resource management becomes rather complicated and challenging, given the unique background knowledge matching and time-consuming semantic coding requirements in SemCom. To this end, this paper jointly investigates user association (UA), mode selection (MS), and bandwidth allocation (BA) problems in a hybrid semantic/bit communication network (HSB-Net). Concretely, we first identify a unified performance metric of message throughput for both SemCom and BitCom links. Next, we specially develop a knowledge matching-aware two-stage tandem packet queuing model and theoretically derive the average packet loss ratio and queuing latency. Combined with practical constraints, we then formulate a joint optimization problem for UA, MS, and BA to maximize the overall message throughput of HSB-Net. Afterward, we propose an optimal resource management strategy by utilizing a Lagrange primal-dual transformation method and a preference list-based heuristic algorithm with polynomial-time complexity. Numerical results not only demonstrate the accuracy of our analytical queuing model, but also validate the performance superiority of our proposed strategy compared with different benchmarks. ",

    "abstract": "Traditional deep learning-based object detection networks often resize images during the data preprocessing stage to achieve a uniform size and scale in the feature map. Resizing is done to facilitate model propagation and fully connected classification. However, resizing inevitably leads to object deformation and loss of valuable information in the images. This drawback becomes particularly pronounced for tiny objects like distribution towers with linear shapes and few pixels. To address this issue, we propose abandoning the resizing operation. Instead, we introduce Positional-Encoding Multi-head Criss-Cross Attention. This allows the model to capture contextual information and learn from multiple representation subspaces, effectively enriching the semantics of distribution towers. Additionally, we enhance Spatial Pyramid Pooling by reshaping three pooled feature maps into a new unified one while also reducing the computational burden. This approach allows images of different sizes and scales to generate feature maps with uniform dimensions and can be employed in feature map propagation. Our SCAResNet incorporates these aforementioned improvements into the backbone network ResNet. We evaluated our SCAResNet using the Electric Transmission and Distribution Infrastructure Imagery dataset from Duke University. Without any additional tricks, we employed various object detection models with Gaussian Receptive Field based Label Assignment as the baseline. When incorporating the SCAResNet into the baseline model, we achieved a 2.1% improvement in mAPs. This demonstrates the advantages of our SCAResNet in detecting transmission and distribution towers and its value in tiny object detection.

    "abstract": "Consensus algorithms deployed in the crash fault tolerant setting chose a leader-based architecture in order to achieve the lowest latency possible. However, when deployed in the wide area they face two key robustness challenges. First, they lose liveness when the network is unreliable because they rely on timeouts to find a leader. Second, they cannot have a high replication factor because of the high load imposed on the leader-replica making it a bottleneck. This effectively limits the replication factor allowed, for a given level of throughput, thus lowering the fault tolerance threshold. In this paper, we propose RACS and SADL, a modular state machine replication algorithm that addresses these two robustness challenges. To achieve robustness under adversarial network conditions, we propose RACS, a novel crash fault-tolerant consensus algorithm. RACS consists of two modes of operations: synchronous and asynchronous, that always ensure liveness. RACS leverages the synchronous network to minimize the communication cost to O(n) and matches the lower bound of O(n2) at adversarial-case executions. To avoid the leader bottleneck and to allow higher replication factor, without sacrificing the throughput, we then propose SADL, a novel consensus-agnostic asynchronous dissemination layer. SADL separates client command dissemination from the critical path of consensus and distributes the overhead evenly among all the replicas. The combination of RACS and SADL (SADL-RACS) provides a robust and high-performing state machine replication system. We implement and evaluate RACS and SADL-RACS in a wide-area deployment running on Amazon EC2. ",

By selecting the most relevant features for cyber-attack detection, it is possible to improve both the robustness and computational efficiency of the models used in a cybersecurity system. This work presents a feature selection and consensus process that combines multiple methods and applies them to several network datasets. Two different feature sets were selected and were used to train multiple ML models with regular and adversarial training. Finally, an adversarial evasion robustness benchmark was performed to analyze the reliability of the different feature sets and their impact on the susceptibility of the models to adversarial examples. By using an improved dataset with more data diversity, selecting the best time-related features and a more specific feature set, and performing adversarial training, the ML models were able to achieve a better adversarially robust generalization. The robustness of the models was significantly improved without their generalization to regular traffic flows being affected, without increases of false alarms, and without requiring too many computational resources, which enables a reliable detection of suspicious activity and perturbed traffic flows in enterprise computer networks.

These approaches typically depend on large datasets to capture the diversity within the chemical space, facilitating a more accurate approximation, interpolation, or extrapolation of the chemical behavior of molecules. In our research, we introduce an active learning approach that discerns underlying cause-effect relationships through strategic sampling with the use of a graph loss function. This method identifies the smallest subset of the dataset capable of encoding the most information representative of a much larger chemical space. The identified causal relations are then leveraged to conduct systematic interventions, optimizing the design task within a chemical space that the models have not encountered previously. While our implementation focused on the QM9 quantum-chemical dataset for a specific design task-finding molecules with a large dipole moment-our active causal learning approach, driven by intelligent sampling and interventions, holds potential for broader applications in molecular, materials design and discovery.

The study also investigates defense mechanisms aimed at bolstering the robustness of machine learning models. The research focuses on comprehending the ramifications of two prominent attack methodologies: the Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) and the Carlini-Wagner (CW) approach. These attacks are examined concerning three pre-trained image classifiers: Resnext50_32x4d, DenseNet-201, and VGG-19, utilizing the Tiny-ImageNet dataset. Furthermore, the study proposes the robustness of defensive distillation as a defense mechanism to counter FGSM and CW attacks. This defense mechanism is evaluated using the CIFAR-10 dataset, where CNN models, specifically resnet101 and Resnext50_32x4d, serve as the teacher and student models, respectively. The proposed defensive distillation model exhibits effectiveness in thwarting attacks such as FGSM. However, it is noted to remain susceptible to more sophisticated techniques like the CW attack. The document presents a meticulous validation of the proposed scheme. It provides detailed and comprehensive results, elucidating the efficacy and limitations of the defense mechanisms employed. Through rigorous experimentation and analysis, the study offers insights into the dynamics of adversarial attacks on DNNs, as well as the effectiveness of defensive strategies in mitigating their impact.

    "abstract": "Multi-modal semantic segmentation significantly enhances AI agents' perception and scene understanding, especially under adverse conditions like low-light or overexposed environments. Leveraging additional modalities (X-modality) like thermal and depth alongside traditional RGB provides complementary information, enabling more robust and reliable segmentation. In this work, we introduce Sigma, a Siamese Mamba network for multi-modal semantic segmentation, utilizing the Selective Structured State Space Model, Mamba. Unlike conventional methods that rely on CNNs, with their limited local receptive fields, or Vision Transformers (ViTs), which offer global receptive fields at the cost of quadratic complexity, our model achieves global receptive fields coverage with linear complexity. By employing a Siamese encoder and innovating a Mamba fusion mechanism, we effectively select essential information from different modalities. A decoder is then developed to enhance the channel-wise modeling ability of the model. Our method, Sigma, is rigorously evaluated on both RGB-Thermal and RGB-Depth segmentation tasks, demonstrating its superiority and marking the first successful application of State Space Models (SSMs) in multi-modal perception tasks.

    "abstract": "This article presents novel methods for synthesizing distributionally robust stabilizing neural controllers and certificates for control systems under model uncertainty. A key challenge in designing controllers with stability guarantees for uncertain systems is the accurate determination of and adaptation to shifts in model parametric uncertainty during online deployment. We tackle this with a novel distributionally robust formulation of the Lyapunov derivative chance constraint ensuring a monotonic decrease of the Lyapunov certificate. To avoid the computational complexity involved in dealing with the space of probability measures, we identify a sufficient condition in the form of deterministic convex constraints that ensures the Lyapunov derivative constraint is satisfied. We integrate this condition into a loss function for training a neural network-based controller and show that, for the resulting closed-loop system, the global asymptotic stability of its equilibrium can be certified with high confidence, even with Out-of-Distribution (OoD) model uncertainties. To demonstrate the efficacy and efficiency of the proposed methodology, we compare it with an uncertainty-agnostic baseline approach and several reinforcement learning approaches in two control problems in simulation.

    "abstract": "With an evolutionary approach, the basis of morality can be explained as adaptations to problems of cooperation. With 'evolution' taken in a broad sense, evolving AIs that satisfy the conditions for evolution to apply will be subject to the same cooperative evolutionary pressure as biological entities. Here the adaptiveness of increased cooperation as material safety and wealth increase is discussed -- for humans, for other societies, and for AIs. Diminishing beneficial returns from increased access to material resources also suggests the possibility that, on the whole, there will be no incentive to for instance colonize entire galaxies, thus providing a possible explanation of the Fermi paradox, wondering where everybody is. It is further argued that old societies could engender, give way to, super-AIs, since it is likely that super-AIs are feasible, and fitter. Closing is an aside on effective ways for morals and goals to affect life and society, emphasizing environments, cultures, and laws, and exemplified by how to eat. Appended are an algorithm for colonizing for example a galaxy quickly, models of the evolution of cooperation and fairness under diminishing returns, and software for simulating signaling development. It is also noted that there can be no exponential colonization or reproduction, for mathematical reasons, as each entity takes up a certain amount of space. ",

    "abstract": "The volume of remote sensing data is experiencing rapid growth, primarily due to the plethora of space and air platforms equipped with an array of sensors. Due to limited hardware and battery constraints the data is transmitted back to Earth for processing. The large amounts of data along with security concerns call for new compression and encryption techniques capable of preserving reconstruction quality while minimizing the transmission cost of this data back to Earth. This study investigates image compression based on convolutional variational autoencoders (CVAE), which are capable of substantially reducing the volume of transmitted data while guaranteeing secure lossy image reconstruction. CVAEs have been demonstrated to outperform conventional compression methods such as JPEG2000 by a substantial margin on compression benchmark datasets. The proposed model draws on the strength of the CVAEs capability to abstract data into highly insightful latent spaces, and combining it with the utilization of an entropy bottleneck is capable of finding an optimal balance between compressibility and reconstruction quality. The balance is reached by optimizing over a composite loss function that represents the rate-distortion curve. ",

For computational efficiency, we explore the use of stochastic greedy algorithms which limit the search space via random sampling instead of the standard greedy procedure which explores the entire feasible search space. We propose a pair of stochastic greedy algorithms, namely, Modified Randomized Greedy (MRG) and Dual Randomized Greedy (DRG) to approximately solve the budget- and performance-constrained problems, respectively. For both algorithms, we derive approximation guarantees that hold with high probability. We then examine the use of DRG in robust optimization problems wherein the objective is to maximize the worst-case of a number of weak submodular objectives and propose the Randomized Weak Submodular Saturation Algorithm (Random-WSSA). We further derive a high-probability guarantee for when Random-WSSA successfully constructs a robust solution. Finally, we showcase the effectiveness of these algorithms in a variety of relevant uses within the context of Earth-observing LEO constellations which estimate atmospheric weather conditions and provide Earth coverage.

    "abstract": "A low-resolution digital surface model (DSM) features distinctive attributes impacted by noise, sensor limitations and data acquisition conditions, which failed to be replicated using simple interpolation methods like bicubic. This causes super-resolution models trained on synthetic data does not perform effectively on real ones. Training a model on real low and high resolution DSMs pairs is also a challenge because of the lack of information. On the other hand, the existence of other imaging modalities of the same scene can be used to enrich the information needed for large-scale super-resolution. In this work, we introduce a novel methodology to address the intricacies of real-world DSM super-resolution, named REAL-GDSR, breaking down this ill-posed problem into two steps. The first step involves the utilization of a residual local refinement network. This strategic approach departs from conventional methods that trained to directly predict height values instead of the differences (residuals) and utilize large receptive fields in their networks. The second step introduces a diffusion-based technique that enhances the results on a global scale, with a primary focus on smoothing and edge preservation. Our experiments underscore the effectiveness of the proposed method. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation, comparing it to recent state-of-the-art techniques in the domain of real-world DSM super-resolution (SR). Our approach consistently outperforms these existing methods, as evidenced through qualitative and quantitative assessments. ",
