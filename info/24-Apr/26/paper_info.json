    "title": "VN-Net: Vision-Numerical Fusion Graph Convolutional Network for Sparse  Spatio-Temporal Meteorological Forecasting",
    "abstract": "Sparse meteorological forecasting is indispensable for fine-grained weather forecasting and deserves extensive attention. Recent studies have highlighted the potential of spatio-temporal graph convolutional networks (ST-GCNs) in predicting numerical data from ground weather stations. However, as one of the highest fidelity and lowest latency data, the application of the vision data from satellites in ST-GCNs remains unexplored. There are few studies to demonstrate the effectiveness of combining the above multi-modal data for sparse meteorological forecasting. Towards this objective, we introduce Vision-Numerical Fusion Graph Convolutional Network (VN-Net), which mainly utilizes: 1) Numerical-GCN (N-GCN) to adaptively model the static and dynamic patterns of spatio-temporal numerical data; 2) Vision-LSTM Network (V-LSTM) to capture multi-scale joint channel and spatial features from time series satellite images; 4) a GCN-based decoder to generate hourly predictions of specified meteorological factors. As far as we know, VN-Net is the first attempt to introduce GCN method to utilize multi-modal data for better handling sparse spatio-temporal meteorological forecasting. Our experiments on Weather2k dataset show VN-Net outperforms state-of-the-art by a significant margin on mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean square error (RMSE) for temperature, relative humidity, and visibility forecasting. Furthermore, we conduct interpretation analysis and design quantitative evaluation metrics to assess the impact of incorporating vision data. ",

    "abstract": "The escalating demand to migrate legacy software across different Instruction Set Architectures (ISAs) has driven the development of assembly-to-assembly translators to map between their respective assembly languages. However, the development of these tools requires substantial engineering effort. State-of-the-art approaches use lifting, a technique where source assembly code is translated to an architecture-independent intermediate representation (IR) (for example, the LLVM IR) and use a pre-existing compiler to recompile the IR to the target ISA. However, the hand-written rules these lifters employ are sensitive to the particular compiler and optimization level used to generate the code and require significant engineering effort to support each new ISA. We propose Forklift, the first neural lifter that learns how to translate assembly to LLVM IR using a token-level encoder-decoder Transformer. We show how to incrementally add support to new ISAs by fine tuning the assembly encoder and freezing the IR decoder, improving the overall accuracy and efficiency. We collect millions of parallel LLVM IR, x86, ARM, and RISC-V programs across compilers and optimization levels to train Forklift and set up an input/output-based accuracy harness. We evaluate Forklift on two challenging benchmark suites and translate 2.5x more x86 programs than a state-of-the-art hand-written lifter and 4.4x more x86 programs than GPT-4 as well as enabling translation from new ISAs.

Based on explorative interviews with expert analysts, we propose an extended, rich set of relationships. We describe how these can be visualized as TimeFlows. We provide an example of such a visualization by illustrating the Childcare Benefits Scandal -- an affair that deeply affected Dutch politics in recent years.

    "abstract": "The present paper introduces a novel approach to studying social media habits through predictive modeling of sequential smartphone user behaviors. While much of the literature on media and technology habits has relied on self-report questionnaires and simple behavioral frequency measures, we examine an important yet understudied aspect of media and technology habits: their embeddedness in repetitive behavioral sequences. Leveraging Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and transformer neural networks, we show that (i) social media use is predictable at the within and between-person level and that (ii) there are robust individual differences in the predictability of social media use. We examine the performance of several modeling approaches, including (i) global models trained on the pooled data from all participants, (ii) idiographic person-specific models, and (iii) global models fine-tuned on person-specific data. Neither person-specific modeling nor fine-tuning on person-specific data substantially outperformed the global models, indicating that the global models were able to represent a variety of idiosyncratic behavioral patterns. Additionally, our analyses reveal that the person-level predictability of social media use is not substantially related to the frequency of smartphone use in general or the frequency of social media use, indicating that our approach captures an aspect of habits that is distinct from behavioral frequency. Implications for habit modeling and theoretical development are discussed. ",

    "abstract": "Due to the rapid spread of rumors on social media, rumor detection has become an extremely important challenge. Recently, numerous rumor detection models which utilize textual information and the propagation structure of events have been proposed. However, these methods overlook the importance of semantic evolvement information of event in propagation process, which is often challenging to be truly learned in supervised training paradigms and traditional rumor detection methods. To address this issue, we propose a novel semantic evolvement enhanced Graph Autoencoder for Rumor Detection (GARD) model in this paper. The model learns semantic evolvement information of events by capturing local semantic changes and global semantic evolvement information through specific graph autoencoder and reconstruction strategies. By combining semantic evolvement information and propagation structure information, the model achieves a comprehensive understanding of event propagation and perform accurate and robust detection, while also detecting rumors earlier by capturing semantic evolvement information in the early stages. Moreover, in order to enhance the model's ability to learn the distinct patterns of rumors and non-rumors, we introduce a uniformity regularizer to further improve the model's performance. Experimental results on three public benchmark datasets confirm the superiority of our GARD method over the state-of-the-art approaches in both overall performance and early rumor detection. ",

Here we present CodeZero, an artificial intelligence agent trained extensively on large data to produce effective optimization strategies instantly for each program in a single trial of the agent. To overcome the huge range of possible test programs, we prepare a large dataset of training programs that emphasize quality, naturalness, and diversity. To tackle the vast space of possible optimizations, we adapt deep reinforcement learning to train the agent in a sample-efficient manner through interacting with a world model of the compiler environment. Evaluation on both benchmark suites and production-level code optimization problems demonstrates our agent's supercompiler performances and zero-shot generalization abilities, outperforming built-in optimization options designed by compiler experts. Our methodology kindles the great potential of artificial intelligence for engineering and paves the way for scaling machine learning techniques in the realm of code optimization. ",

    "abstract": "Politics is one of the most prevalent topics discussed on social media platforms, particularly during major election cycles, where users engage in conversations about candidates and electoral processes. Malicious actors may use this opportunity to disseminate misinformation to undermine trust in the electoral process. The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) exacerbates this issue by enabling malicious actors to generate misinformation at an unprecedented scale. Artificial intelligence (AI)-generated content is often indistinguishable from authentic user content, raising concerns about the integrity of information on social networks. In this paper, we present a novel taxonomy for characterizing election-related claims. This taxonomy provides an instrument for analyzing election-related claims, with granular categories related to jurisdiction, equipment, processes, and the nature of claims. We introduce ElectAI, a novel benchmark dataset that consists of 9,900 tweets, each labeled as human- or AI-generated. For AI-generated tweets, the specific LLM variant that produced them is specified. We annotated a subset of 1,550 tweets using the proposed taxonomy to capture the characteristics of election-related claims. We explored the capabilities of LLMs in extracting the taxonomy attributes and trained various machine learning models using ElectAI to distinguish between human- and AI-generated posts and identify the specific LLM variant.

We conduct comprehensive laboratory measurements to understand hybrid (radio and optical) communication propagation through biological tissues and utilize these insights to refine a dataset for training a Deep Learning (DL) model. These models, in turn, generate semantic concepts linked to cryptographic keys for enhanced data confidentiality and integrity using a jamming receiver. The proposed model demonstrates a significant reduction in energy consumption compared to traditional cryptographic methods, like Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH), especially when supplemented with jamming.

    "abstract": "The use of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to retrieve relevant information from an external knowledge source enables large language models (LLMs) to answer questions over private and/or previously unseen document collections. However, RAG fails on global questions directed at an entire text corpus, such as \"What are the main themes in the dataset?\", since this is inherently a query-focused summarization (QFS) task, rather than an explicit retrieval task. Prior QFS methods, meanwhile, fail to scale to the quantities of text indexed by typical RAG systems. To combine the strengths of these contrasting methods, we propose a Graph RAG approach to question answering over private text corpora that scales with both the generality of user questions and the quantity of source text to be indexed. Our approach uses an LLM to build a graph-based text index in two stages: first to derive an entity knowledge graph from the source documents, then to pregenerate community summaries for all groups of closely-related entities. Given a question, each community summary is used to generate a partial response, before all partial responses are again summarized in a final response to the user. For a class of global sensemaking questions over datasets in the 1 million token range, we show that Graph RAG leads to substantial improvements over a na\\\"ive RAG baseline for both the comprehensiveness and diversity of generated answers. An open-source, Python-based implementation of both global and local Graph RAG approaches is forthcoming at https://aka.ms/graphrag. ",

While QML models have been shown to be vulnerable to adversarial attacks much in the same manner as classical machine learning models, it is still largely unknown how to compare adversarial attacks on quantum versus classical models. In this paper, we show how to systematically investigate the similarities and differences in adversarial robustness of classical and quantum models using transfer attacks, perturbation patterns and Lipschitz bounds. More specifically, we focus on classification tasks on a handcrafted dataset that allows quantitative analysis for feature attribution. This enables us to get insight, both theoretically and experimentally, on the robustness of classification networks. We start by comparing typical QML model architectures such as amplitude and re-upload encoding circuits with variational parameters to a classical ConvNet architecture. Next, we introduce a classical approximation of QML circuits (originally obtained with Random Fourier Features sampling but adapted in this work to fit a trainable encoding) and evaluate this model, denoted Fourier network, in comparison to other architectures. Our findings show that this Fourier network can be seen as a \"middle ground\" on the quantum-classical boundary. While adversarial attacks successfully transfer across this boundary in both directions, we also show that regularization helps quantum networks to be more robust, which has direct impact on Lipschitz bounds and transfer attacks.

This work proposes a novel, robust approach using five heterogeneous independent models combined with a dual ensemble fusion of voting techniques. Diverse models capture various system behaviors, while the fusion strategy maximizes detection effectiveness and minimizes false alarms. Each base autoencoder model learns a unique representation of the data, leveraging their complementary strengths to improve anomaly detection performance. To increase the effectiveness and reliability of final anomaly prediction, dual ensemble technique is applied. This approach outperforms in maximizing the coverage of identifying anomalies.

This has triggered several research efforts to accurately detect deepfake images, achieving excellent performance on publicly available deepfake datasets. In this work, we study 8 state-of-the-art detectors and argue that they are far from being ready for deployment due to two recent developments. First, the emergence of lightweight methods to customize large generative models, can enable an attacker to create many customized generators (to create deepfakes), thereby substantially increasing the threat surface. We show that existing defenses fail to generalize well to such \\emph{user-customized generative models} that are publicly available today. We discuss new machine learning approaches based on content-agnostic features, and ensemble modeling to improve generalization performance against user-customized models. Second, the emergence of \\textit{vision foundation models} -- machine learning models trained on broad data that can be easily adapted to several downstream tasks -- can be misused by attackers to craft adversarial deepfakes that can evade existing defenses. We propose a simple adversarial attack that leverages existing foundation models to craft adversarial samples \\textit{without adding any adversarial noise}, through careful semantic manipulation of the image content. We highlight the vulnerabilities of several defenses against our attack, and explore directions leveraging advanced foundation models and adversarial training to defend against this new threat. ",

The main assertion is that a communication network with this topology supports infinitely scalable self-organization of collective action without requiring hierarchy or central control. The paper presents the functionality of this protocol and substantiates the following propositions about its function and implications: (1) Communication via NK boolean networks facilitates coordination on collective action games for any variable number of users, and justifies the assumption that the game's payoff structure is common knowledge; (2) Use of this protocol increases its users' transfer empowerment, a form of intrinsic motivation that motivates coordinated action independent of the task or outcome; (3) Communication via this network can be considered 'cheap talk' and benefits the strategy of players with aligned interests, but not of players with conflicting interests; (4) Absence of significant barriers for its realization warrants a timely and continuing discussion on the ethics and implications of this technology; (5) Full realization of the technology's potential calls for a free-to-use service with maximal transparency of design and associated economic incentives.

Applied to datasets such as Modified MNIST and CelebrityA, our methods significantly reduce mutual information between sensitive attributes and transformed data, thereby enhancing privacy. Our experimental results confirm that these approaches achieve superior privacy protection and retain high utility, making them viable for practical applications where both aspects are crucial.

Current studies are limited to specific tasks like information retrieval or semantic matching, where the claim-reference relationships are unique and fixed, while the referential knowledge linking (RKL) in real-world can be much more diverse and complex. In this paper, we propose universal referential knowledge linking (URL), which aims to resolve diversified referential knowledge linking tasks by one unified model. To this end, we propose a LLM-driven task-instructed representation compression, as well as a multi-view learning approach, in order to effectively adapt the instruction following and semantic understanding abilities of LLMs to referential knowledge linking. Furthermore, we also construct a new benchmark to evaluate ability of models on referential knowledge linking tasks across different scenarios. Experiments demonstrate that universal RKL is challenging for existing approaches, while the proposed framework can effectively resolve the task across various scenarios, and therefore outperforms previous approaches by a large margin.

    "abstract": "Modern face recognition systems utilize deep neural networks to extract salient features from a face. These features denote embeddings in latent space and are often stored as templates in a face recognition system. These embeddings are susceptible to data leakage and, in some cases, can even be used to reconstruct the original face image. To prevent compromising identities, template protection schemes are commonly employed. However, these schemes may still not prevent the leakage of soft biometric information such as age, gender and race. To alleviate this issue, we propose a novel technique that combines Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) with an existing template protection scheme known as PolyProtect. We show that the embeddings can be compressed and encrypted using FHE and transformed into a secure PolyProtect template using polynomial transformation, for additional protection. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach through extensive experiments on multiple datasets. Our proposed approach ensures irreversibility and unlinkability, effectively preventing the leakage of soft biometric attributes from face embeddings without compromising recognition accuracy. ",

    "abstract": "Cross-modality images that integrate visible-infrared spectra cues can provide richer complementary information for object detection. Despite this, existing visible-infrared object detection methods severely degrade in severe weather conditions. This failure stems from the pronounced sensitivity of visible images to environmental perturbations, such as rain, haze, and snow, which frequently cause false negatives and false positives in detection. To address this issue, we introduce a novel and challenging task, termed visible-infrared object detection under adverse weather conditions. To foster this task, we have constructed a new Severe Weather Visible-Infrared Dataset (SWVID) with diverse severe weather scenes. Furthermore, we introduce the Cross-modality Fusion Mamba with Weather-removal (CFMW) to augment detection accuracy in adverse weather conditions. Thanks to the proposed Weather Removal Diffusion Model (WRDM) and Cross-modality Fusion Mamba (CFM) modules, CFMW is able to mine more essential information of pedestrian features in cross-modality fusion, thus could transfer to other rarer scenarios with high efficiency and has adequate availability on those platforms with low computing power. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that targeted improvement and integrated both Diffusion and Mamba modules in cross-modality object detection, successfully expanding the practical application of this type of model with its higher accuracy and more advanced architecture. Extensive experiments on both well-recognized and self-created datasets conclusively demonstrate that our CFMW achieves state-of-the-art detection performance, surpassing existing benchmarks.

To address this, we propose to augment the deep features of samples by incorporating their adversarial and anti-adversarial perturbation distributions, enabling adaptive adjustment in the learning difficulty tailored to each sample's specific characteristics. We then theoretically reveal that our augmentation process approximates the optimization of a surrogate loss function as the number of augmented copies increases indefinitely. This insight leads us to develop a meta-learning-based framework for optimizing classifiers with this novel loss, introducing the effects of augmentation while bypassing the explicit augmentation process. We conduct extensive experiments across four common biased learning scenarios: long-tail learning, generalized long-tail learning, noisy label learning, and subpopulation shift learning.

However, the quality of a neural network highly depends on the used training data. Noisy, insufficient, or biased training data leads to suboptimal results. We present a hybrid method that combines deep learning with iterated graph Laplacian and show its application in acoustic impedance inversion which is a routine procedure in seismic explorations. A neural network is used to obtain a first approximation of the underlying acoustic impedance and construct a graph Laplacian matrix from this approximation. Afterwards, we use a Tikhonov-like variational method to solve the impedance inversion problem where the regularizer is based on the constructed graph Laplacian. The obtained solution can be shown to be more accurate and stable with respect to noise than the initial guess obtained by the neural network. This process can be iterated several times, each time constructing a new graph Laplacian matrix from the most recent reconstruction. The method converges after only a few iterations returning a much more accurate reconstruction. We demonstrate the potential of our method on two different datasets and under various levels of noise. We use two different neural networks that have been introduced in previous works. The experiments show that our approach improves the reconstruction quality in the presence of noise. ",

This paper introduces a Koopman-inspired framework that leverages neural networks for data-driven learning of the Koopman bases, termed NeuroKoopman Dynamic Causal Discovery (NKDCD), for reliably inferring the Granger causality along with the underlying nonlinear dynamics. NKDCD employs an autoencoder architecture that lifts the nonlinear dynamics to a higher dimension using data-learned bases, where the lifted time series can be reliably modeled linearly. The lifting function, the linear Granger causality lag matrices, and the projection function (from lifted space to base space) are all represented as multilayer perceptrons and are all learned simultaneously in one go. NKDCD also utilizes sparsity-inducing penalties on the weights of the lag matrices, encouraging the model to select only the needed causal dependencies within the data. Through extensive testing on practically applicable datasets, it is shown that the NKDCD outperforms the existing nonlinear Granger causality discovery approaches. ",

    "abstract": "Besides humans and machines, Artificial Intelligence (AI) models have emerged to be another important audience of programming languages, as we come to the era of large language models (LLMs). LLMs can now excel at coding competitions and even program like developers to address various tasks, such as math calculation. Yet, the grammar and layout of existing programs are designed for humans. Particularly, abundant grammar tokens and formatting tokens are included to make the code more readable to humans. While beneficial, such a human-centric design imposes an unnecessary computational burden on LLMs where each token, either consumed or generated, consumes computational resources. To improve inference efficiency and reduce computational costs, we propose the concept of AI-oriented grammar, which aims to represent the code in a way that better suits the working mechanism of AI models. Code written with AI-oriented grammar discards formats and uses a minimum number of tokens to convey code semantics effectively. To demonstrate the feasibility of this concept, we explore and implement the first AI-oriented grammar for Python, named Simple Python (SimPy). SimPy is crafted by revising the original Python grammar through a series of heuristic rules. Programs written in SimPy maintain identical Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) structures to those in standard Python, allowing execution via a modified AST parser. In addition, we explore methods to enable existing LLMs to proficiently understand and use SimPy, and ensure the changes remain imperceptible for human developers. Compared with the original Python, SimPy not only reduces token usage by 13.5% and 10.4% for CodeLlama and GPT-4, but can also achieve equivalent, even improved, performance over the models trained on Python code.

Unlike conventional computational fluid dynamics methods, PINNs offer advantages by eliminating the need for discretized meshes and enabling the direct solution of partial differential equations (PDEs). In this paper, we propose the weighted Extended Physics-Informed Neural Networks (WXPINNs) and weighted Conservative Physics-Informed Neural Networks (WCPINNs), tailored for detailed hemodynamic simulations based on generalized space-time domain decomposition techniques. The inclusion of multiple neural networks enhances the representation capacity of the weighted PINN methods. Furthermore, the weighted PINNs can be efficiently trained in parallel computing frameworks by employing separate neural networks for each sub-domain. We show that PINNs simulation results circumvent backflow instabilities, underscoring a notable advantage of employing PINNs over traditional numerical methods to solve such complex blood flow models. They naturally address such challenges within their formulations. The presented numerical results demonstrate that the proposed weighted PINNs outperform traditional PINNs settings, where sub-PINNs are applied to each subdomain separately.

This paper addresses these issues by introducing a simple yet effective approach, dubbed Dual Expert Distillation Network (DEDN), where two experts are dedicated to coarse- and fine-grained visual-attribute modeling, respectively. Concretely, one coarse expert, namely cExp, has a complete perceptual scope to coordinate visual-attribute similarity metrics across dimensions, and moreover, another fine expert, namely fExp, consists of multiple specialized subnetworks, each corresponds to an exclusive set of attributes. Two experts cooperatively distill from each other to reach a mutual agreement during training.

To address those challenges, we introduce a feature graph-based malware detection method, MFGraph, to characterize applications by learning feature-to-feature relationships to achieve improved detection accuracy while mitigating the impact of concept drift. In MFGraph, we construct a feature graph using static features extracted from binary PE files, then apply a deep graph convolutional network to learn the representation of the feature graph.

Our theoretical analysis reveals scenarios where actions by Byzantine validators expedite the finalization of two conflicting branches, and instances where Byzantine validators reach a voting power exceeding the critical safety threshold of one-third. Additionally, we revisit the probabilistic bouncing attack, illustrating how the inactivity leak can result in a probabilistic breach of safety, potentially allowing Byzantine validators to exceed the one-third safety threshold. Our findings uncover how penalizing inactive nodes can compromise blockchain properties, particularly in the presence of Byzantine validators capable of coordinating actions. ",

    "title": "VISLA Benchmark: Evaluating Embedding Sensitivity to Semantic and  Lexical Alterations",
    "abstract": "Despite their remarkable successes, state-of-the-art language models face challenges in grasping certain important semantic details. This paper introduces the VISLA (Variance and Invariance to Semantic and Lexical Alterations) benchmark, designed to evaluate the semantic and lexical understanding of language models. VISLA presents a 3-way semantic (in)equivalence task with a triplet of sentences associated with an image, to evaluate both vision-language models (VLMs) and unimodal language models (ULMs). An evaluation involving 34 VLMs and 20 ULMs reveals surprising difficulties in distinguishing between lexical and semantic variations. Spatial semantics encoded by language models also appear to be highly sensitive to lexical information. Notably, text encoders of VLMs demonstrate greater sensitivity to semantic and lexical variations than unimodal text encoders. Our contributions include the unification of image-to-text and text-to-text retrieval tasks, an off-the-shelf evaluation without fine-tuning, and assessing LMs' semantic (in)variance in the presence of lexical alterations. The results highlight strengths and weaknesses across diverse vision and unimodal language models, contributing to a deeper understanding of their capabilities. % VISLA enables a rigorous evaluation, shedding light on language models' capabilities in handling semantic and lexical nuances.

    "abstract": "Unsupervised graph anomaly detection aims at identifying rare patterns that deviate from the majority in a graph without the aid of labels, which is important for a variety of real-world applications. Recent advances have utilized Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to learn effective node representations by aggregating information from neighborhoods. This is motivated by the hypothesis that nodes in the graph tend to exhibit consistent behaviors with their neighborhoods. However, such consistency can be disrupted by graph anomalies in multiple ways. Most existing methods directly employ GNNs to learn representations, disregarding the negative impact of graph anomalies on GNNs, resulting in sub-optimal node representations and anomaly detection performance. While a few recent approaches have redesigned GNNs for graph anomaly detection under semi-supervised label guidance, how to address the adverse effects of graph anomalies on GNNs in unsupervised scenarios and learn effective representations for anomaly detection are still under-explored. To bridge this gap, in this paper, we propose a simple yet effective framework for Guarding Graph Neural Networks for Unsupervised Graph Anomaly Detection (G3AD). Specifically, G3AD introduces two auxiliary networks along with correlation constraints to guard the GNNs from inconsistent information encoding. Furthermore, G3AD introduces an adaptive caching module to guard the GNNs from solely reconstructing the observed data that contains anomalies. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed G3AD can outperform seventeen state-of-the-art methods on both synthetic and real-world datasets. ",

This method involves constructing a closed-loop system model and assessing the impact of different prediction horizons on system stability. In contrast to conventional design approaches that often rely on empirical prediction horizon selection or incorporate non-linear observers, the proposed method establishes a rigorous boundary for the prediction horizon to ensure system stability. This approach facilitates the selection of an appropriate prediction horizon while avoiding excessively short horizons that can lead to instability and preventing the adoption of unnecessarily long horizons that would burden the controller with high computational demands. Finally, the accuracy of the design method has been confirmed through experimental testing. Moreover, it has been demonstrated that the prediction horizon determined by this method reduces the computational burden by 10\\%-20\\% compared to the empirically selected prediction horizon. ",

This includes both small-scale local events like local farmer markets and large complex events like political and military conflicts. The latter are typically not observed directly but through the lenses of intermediaries like newspapers or social media. In other words, we do not witness the unfolding of such events directly but are confronted with narratives surrounding them. Such narratives capture different aspects of a complex event and may also differ with respect to the narrator. Thus, they provide a rich semantics concerning real-world events. In this paper, we show how narratives concerning complex events can be constructed and utilized. We provide a formal representation of narratives based on recursive nodes to represent multiple levels of detail and discuss how narratives can be bound to event-centric knowledge graphs. Additionally, we provide an algorithm based on incremental prompting techniques that mines such narratives from texts to account for different perspectives on complex events.

This paper introduces a novel task: translating multi-view images of a structural 3D model (for example, one constructed with building blocks drawn from a 3D-object library) into a detailed sequence of assembly instructions executable by a robotic arm. Fed with multi-view images of the target 3D model for replication, the model designed for this task must address several sub-tasks, including recognizing individual components used in constructing the 3D model, estimating the geometric pose of each component, and deducing a feasible assembly order adhering to physical rules. Establishing accurate 2D-3D correspondence between multi-view images and 3D objects is technically challenging. To tackle this, we propose an end-to-end model known as the Neural Assembler. This model learns an object graph where each vertex represents recognized components from the images, and the edges specify the topology of the 3D model, enabling the derivation of an assembly plan. We establish benchmarks for this task and conduct comprehensive empirical evaluations of Neural Assembler and alternative solutions. Our experiments clearly demonstrate the superiority of Neural Assembler. ",

Triggered by a manifold of research activities, promising results have been gained especially for texture-less, transparent, and reflecting surfaces, while such scenarios remain challenging for traditional MVS-based approaches. However, most of these investigations focus on close-range scenarios, with studies for airborne scenarios still missing. For this task, NeRFs face potential difficulties at areas of low image redundancy and weak data evidence, as often found in street canyons, facades or building shadows. Furthermore, training such networks is computationally expensive. Thus, the aim of our work is twofold: First, we investigate the applicability of NeRFs for aerial image blocks representing different characteristics like nadir-only, oblique and high-resolution imagery. Second, during these investigations we demonstrate the benefit of integrating depth priors from tie-point measures, which are provided during presupposed Bundle Block Adjustment. Our work is based on the state-of-the-art framework VolSDF, which models 3D scenes by signed distance functions (SDFs), since this is more applicable for surface reconstruction compared to the standard volumetric representation in vanilla NeRFs. For evaluation, the NeRF-based reconstructions are compared to results of a publicly available benchmark dataset for airborne images. ",

    "abstract": "The recent work Local Implicit Image Function (LIIF) and subsequent Implicit Neural Representation (INR) based works have achieved remarkable success in Arbitrary-Scale Super-Resolution (ASSR) by using MLP to decode Low-Resolution (LR) features. However, these continuous image representations typically implement decoding in High-Resolution (HR) High-Dimensional (HD) space, leading to a quadratic increase in computational cost and seriously hindering the practical applications of ASSR. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel Latent Modulated Function (LMF), which decouples the HR-HD decoding process into shared latent decoding in LR-HD space and independent rendering in HR Low-Dimensional (LD) space, thereby realizing the first computational optimal paradigm of continuous image representation. Specifically, LMF utilizes an HD MLP in latent space to generate latent modulations of each LR feature vector. This enables a modulated LD MLP in render space to quickly adapt to any input feature vector and perform rendering at arbitrary resolution. Furthermore, we leverage the positive correlation between modulation intensity and input image complexity to design a Controllable Multi-Scale Rendering (CMSR) algorithm, offering the flexibility to adjust the decoding efficiency based on the rendering precision. Extensive experiments demonstrate that converting existing INR-based ASSR methods to LMF can reduce the computational cost by up to 99.9%, accelerate inference by up to 57 times, and save up to 76% of parameters, while maintaining competitive performance.

Semantic independence indicates that adversarial patches operate autonomously within their semantic context, while spatial heterogeneity manifests as distinct image quality of the patch area that differs from original clean image due to the independent generation process. Based on these observations, we propose PAD, a novel adversarial patch localization and removal method that does not require prior knowledge or additional training. PAD offers patch-agnostic defense against various adversarial patches, compatible with any pre-trained object detectors.

This technology is already in people's pockets regarding Mobile Augmented Reality with their smartphones. The scientific community still needs answers about how humans could and should interact in environments where perceived stimuli are different from fully physical or digital circumstances. Moreover, it is still being determined if people accept these new technologies in different social environments and interaction settings or if some obstacles could exist. This paper explores the impact of the Social Environment and the Focus of social interaction on users while playing a location-based augmented reality game, measuring it with user experience and social acceptance indicators. An empirical study in a within-subject fashion was performed in different social environments and under different settings of social interaction focus with N = 28 participants compiling self-reported questionnaires after playing a Scavenger Hunt in Augmented Reality. The measures from two different Social Environments (Crowded vs. Uncrowded) resulted in statistically relevant mean differences with indicators from the Social Acceptability dimension. Moreover, the analyses show statistically relevant differences between the variances from different degrees of Social Interaction Focus with Overall Social Presence, Perceived Psychological Engagement, Perceived Attentional Engagement, and Perceived Emotional Contagion. The results suggest that a location-based AR game played in different social environments and settings can influence the user experience's social dimension. Therefore, they should be carefully considered while designing immersive technological experiences in public spaces involving social interactions between players. ",

For real-world molecular property regression and classification tasks, we find that our method rediscovers established rules of thumb. More specifically, our results for molecular mutagenicity prediction indicate more fine-grained resolution of structural details than existing explainability methods, consistent with previous results from chemistry literature. Overall, our results show promising capability to extract the underlying structure-property relationships for complex graph property prediction tasks. ",

Addressing this issue, this paper introduces a Weakly-Supervised Disentanglement Framework, denoted as WSDF, to facilitate the training of controllable 3D face models without an overly stringent labeling requirement. Adhering to the paradigm of Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), the proposed model achieves disentanglement of identity and expression controlling factors through a two-branch encoder equipped with dedicated identity-consistency prior. It then faithfully re-entangles these factors via a tensor-based combination mechanism. Notably, the introduction of the Neutral Bank allows precise acquisition of subject-specific information using only identity labels, thereby averting degeneration due to insufficient supervision. Additionally, the framework incorporates a label-free second-order loss function for the expression factor to regulate deformation space and eliminate extraneous information, resulting in enhanced disentanglement. Extensive experiments have been conducted to substantiate the superior performance of WSDF. Our code is available at https://github.com/liguohao96/WSDF. ",

Assume that initially some lamps are on and others are off. The button on vertex $x$ is of $\\sigma^+$-type ($\\sigma$-type, respectively) if pressing the button changes the lamp states on $x$ and on its neighbors in $G$ (the lamp states on the neighbors of $x$ only, respectively). Assume that there is a set $X\\subseteq V$ such that pressing buttons on vertices of $X$ lights all lamps on vertices of $G$. In particular, it is known to hold when initially all lamps are off and all buttons are of $\\sigma^+$-type. Finding such a set $X$ of the smallest size is NP-hard even if initially all lamps are off and all buttons are of $\\sigma^+$-type. Using a linear algebraic approach we design a polynomial-time approximation algorithm for the problem such that for the set $X$ constructed by the algorithm, we have $|X|\\le \\min\\{r,(|V|+{\\rm opt})/2\\},$ where $r$ is the rank of a (modified) adjacent matrix of $G$ and ${\\rm opt}$ is the size of an optimal solution to the problem. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first polynomial-time approximation algorithm for the problem with a nontrivial approximation guarantee. ",

In the absence of analytical models and due to the complexity of the scour process, it is difficult for current empirical methods to achieve accurate predictions. In this paper, we exploit the power of deep learning algorithms to forecast the scour depth variations around bridge piers based on historical sensor monitoring data, including riverbed elevation, flow elevation, and flow velocity. We investigated the performance of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models for real-time scour forecasting using data collected from bridges in Alaska and Oregon from 2006 to 2021. The LSTM models achieved mean absolute error (MAE) ranging from 0.1m to 0.5m for predicting bed level variations a week in advance, showing a reasonable performance. The Fully Convolutional Network (FCN) variant of CNN outperformed other CNN configurations, showing a comparable performance to LSTMs with significantly lower computational costs. We explored various innovative random-search heuristics for hyperparameter tuning and model optimisation which resulted in reduced computational cost compared to grid-search method. The impact of different combinations of sensor features on scour prediction showed the significance of the historical time series of scour for predicting upcoming events. Overall, this study provides a greater understanding of the potential of Deep Learning (DL) for real-time scour forecasting and early warning in bridges with diverse scour and flow characteristics including riverine and tidal/coastal bridges.

Although many performance predictors correlate well with ground truth performance, they require training data in the form of trained networks. Recently, zero-cost proxies have been proposed as an efficient method to estimate network performance without any training. However, they are still poorly understood, exhibit biases with network properties, and their performance is limited. Inspired by the drawbacks of zero-cost proxies, we propose neural graph features (GRAF), simple to compute properties of architectural graphs. GRAF offers fast and interpretable performance prediction while outperforming zero-cost proxies and other common encodings. In combination with other zero-cost proxies, GRAF outperforms most existing performance predictors at a fraction of the cost. ",

    "abstract": "A package's source code repository records the development history of the package, providing indispensable information for the use and risk monitoring of the package. However, a package release often misses its source code repository due to the separation of the package's development platform from its distribution platform. Existing tools retrieve the release's repository information from its metadata, which suffers from two limitations: the metadata may not contain or contain wrong information. Our analysis shows that existing tools can only retrieve repository information for up to 70.5% of PyPI releases. To address the limitations, this paper proposes PyRadar, a novel framework that utilizes the metadata and source distribution to retrieve and validate the repository information for PyPI releases. We start with an empirical study to compare four existing tools on 4,227,425 PyPI releases and analyze phantom files (files appearing in the release's distribution but not in the release's repository) in 14,375 correct package-repository links and 2,064 incorrect links. Based on the findings, we design PyRadar with three components, i.e., Metadata-based Retriever, Source Code Repository Validator, and Source Code-based Retriever. In particular, the Metadata-based Retriever combines best practices of existing tools and successfully retrieves repository information from the metadata for 72.1% of PyPI releases. The Source Code Repository Validator applies common machine learning algorithms on six crafted features and achieves an AUC of up to 0.995. The Source Code-based Retriever queries World of Code with the SHA-1 hashes of all Python files in the release's source distribution and retrieves repository information for 90.2% of packages in our dataset with an accuracy of 0.970. Both practitioners and researchers can employ the PyRadar to better use PyPI packages. ",

Knowledge graph embeddings (KGEs) represent entities (e.g., \"da Vinci,\" \"Mona Lisa\") and relationships (e.g., \"painted\") of a knowledge graph (KG) as vectors. KGEs are generated by optimizing an embedding score, which assesses whether a triple (e.g., \"da Vinci,\" \"painted,\" \"Mona Lisa\") exists in the graph. KGEs have been proven effective in a variety of web-related downstream tasks, including, for instance, predicting relationships among entities. However, the problem of anticipating the performance of a given KGE in a certain downstream task and locally to a specific individual triple, has not been tackled so far. In this paper, we fill this gap with ReliK, a Reliability measure for KGEs. ReliK relies solely on KGE embedding scores, is task- and KGE-agnostic, and requires no further KGE training. As such, it is particularly appealing for semantic web applications which call for testing multiple KGE methods on various parts of the KG and on each individual downstream task. Through extensive experiments, we attest that ReliK correlates well with both common downstream tasks, such as tail or relation prediction and triple classification, as well as advanced downstream tasks, such as rule mining and question answering, while preserving locality.

This framework assesses the interactive motion of agents by employing neural interaction energy, which captures the dynamics of interactions and illustrates their influence on the future trajectories of agents. To bolster temporal stability, we introduce two constraints: inter-agent interaction constraint and intra-agent motion constraint. These constraints work together to ensure temporal stability at both the system and agent levels, effectively mitigating prediction fluctuations inherent in multi-agent systems.

One promising solution to mitigate these hallucinations is to store external knowledge as embeddings, aiding LLMs in retrieval-augmented generation. However, such a solution risks compromising privacy, as recent studies experimentally showed that the original text can be partially reconstructed from text embeddings by pre-trained language models. The significant advantage of LLMs over traditional pre-trained models may exacerbate these concerns. To this end, we investigate the effectiveness of reconstructing original knowledge and predicting entity attributes from these embeddings when LLMs are employed. Empirical findings indicate that LLMs significantly improve the accuracy of two evaluated tasks over those from pre-trained models, regardless of whether the texts are in-distribution or out-of-distribution. This underscores a heightened potential for LLMs to jeopardize user privacy, highlighting the negative consequences of their widespread use. We further discuss preliminary strategies to mitigate this risk. ",

Support Vector Ordinal Regression, as an outstanding ordinal regression model, is widely used in many ordinal regression tasks. However, like most supervised learning algorithms, the design of SVOR is based on the assumption that the training data are real and reliable, which is difficult to satisfy in real-world data. In many practical applications, outliers are frequently present in the training set, potentially leading to misguide the learning process, such that the performance is non-optimal. In this paper, we propose a novel capped $\\ell_{p}$-norm loss function that is theoretically robust to both light and heavy outliers. The capped $\\ell_{p}$-norm loss can help the model detect and eliminate outliers during training process. Adhering to this concept, we introduce a new model, Capped $\\ell_{p}$-Norm Support Vector Ordinal Regression(CSVOR), that is robust to outliers. CSVOR uses a weight matrix to detect and eliminate outliers during the training process to improve the robustness to outliers. Moreover, a Re-Weighted algorithm algorithm which is illustrated convergence by our theoretical results is proposed to effectively minimize the corresponding problem. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art(SOTA) methods, particularly in the presence of outliers. ",

We implement and assess two distinct AMR approaches and evaluate their performance through standard NWP benchmarks. In both cases, we solve the fully compressible Euler equations, fundamental to many non-hydrostatic weather models. The first approach utilizes oct-tree cell-based mesh refinement coupled with a high-order discontinuous Galerkin method for spatial discretization. In the second approach, we employ level-based AMR with the finite difference method. Our study provides insights into the accuracy and benefits of employing these AMR methodologies for the multi-scale problem of NWP. Additionally, we explore essential properties including their impact on mass and energy conservation. Moreover, we present and evaluate an AMR solution transfer strategy for the tree-based AMR approach that is simple to implement, memory-efficient, and ensures conservation for both flow in the box and sphere. Furthermore, we discuss scalability, performance portability, and the practical utility of the AMR methodology within an NWP framework -- crucial considerations in selecting an AMR approach. The current de facto standard for mesh refinement in NWP employs a relatively simplistic approach of static nested grids, either within a general circulation model or a separately operated regional model with loose one-way synchronization. It is our hope that this study will stimulate further interest in the adoption of AMR frameworks like AMReX in NWP.

Classic learning tools are often vulnerable to perturbations of the input covariates, and are sensitive to outliers and noise, and some tools are based on rigid algebraic assumptions. Distribution shifts are frequently occurring due to changes in raw materials for production, seasonality, a different user base, or even adversarial attacks. Therefore, there is a need for more effective distribution shift detection techniques. In this work, we propose a continual learning framework for monitoring and detecting distribution changes. We explore the problem in a latent space generated by a bio-inspired self-organizing clustering and statistical aspects of the latent space. In particular, we investigate the projections made by two topology-preserving maps: the Self-Organizing Map and the Scale Invariant Map. Our method can be applied in both a supervised and an unsupervised context. We construct the assessment of changes in the data distribution as a comparison of Gaussian signals, making the proposed method fast and robust. We compare it to other unsupervised techniques, specifically Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Kernel-PCA. Our comparison involves conducting experiments using sequences of images (based on MNIST and injected shifts with adversarial samples), chemical sensor measurements, and the environmental variable related to ozone levels.

The lack of plausibility originates from both the absence of physics modeling in the existing pipeline and their inability to recover intricate geometrical structures. In this paper, we introduce PhyRecon, which stands as the first approach to harness both differentiable rendering and differentiable physics simulation to learn implicit surface representations. Our framework proposes a novel differentiable particle-based physical simulator seamlessly integrated with the neural implicit representation. At its core is an efficient transformation between SDF-based implicit representation and explicit surface points by our proposed algorithm, Surface Points Marching Cubes (SP-MC), enabling differentiable learning with both rendering and physical losses. Moreover, we model both rendering and physical uncertainty to identify and compensate for the inconsistent and inaccurate monocular geometric priors. The physical uncertainty additionally enables a physics-guided pixel sampling to enhance the learning of slender structures. By amalgamating these techniques, our model facilitates efficient joint modeling with appearance, geometry, and physics. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PhyRecon significantly outperforms all state-of-the-art methods in terms of reconstruction quality. Our reconstruction results also yield superior physical stability, verified by Isaac Gym, with at least a 40% improvement across all datasets, opening broader avenues for future physics-based applications.

The planner selects the topology class that imitates human behavior the best using a deep neural network model trained on real-world human motion data, ensuring socially intelligent and contextually aware navigation. Our system refines the chosen path through an optimization-based local planner in real time, ensuring seamless adherence to desired social behaviors. In this way, we decouple perception and local planning from the decision-making process. We evaluate the prediction accuracy of the network with real-world data.

    "abstract": "In the task of differentially private (DP) continual counting, we receive a stream of increments and our goal is to output an approximate running total of these increments, without revealing too much about any specific increment. Despite its simplicity, differentially private continual counting has attracted significant attention both in theory and in practice. Existing algorithms for differentially private continual counting are either inefficient in terms of their space usage or add an excessive amount of noise, inducing suboptimal utility. The most practical DP continual counting algorithms add carefully correlated Gaussian noise to the values. The task of choosing the covariance for this noise can be expressed in terms of factoring the lower-triangular matrix of ones (which computes prefix sums). We present two approaches from this class (for different parameter regimes) that achieve near-optimal utility for DP continual counting and only require logarithmic or polylogarithmic space (and time). Our first approach is based on a space-efficient streaming matrix multiplication algorithm for a class of Toeplitz matrices. We show that to instantiate this algorithm for DP continual counting, it is sufficient to find a low-degree rational function that approximates the square root on a circle in the complex plane. We then apply and extend tools from approximation theory to achieve this. We also derive efficient closed-forms for the objective function for arbitrarily many steps, and show direct numerical optimization yields a highly practical solution to the problem. Our second approach combines our first approach with a recursive construction similar to the binary tree mechanism. ",

    "abstract": "We consider two-cost network design models in which edges of the input graph have an associated cost and length. We build upon recent advances in hop-constrained oblivious routing to obtain two sets of results. We address multicommodity buy-at-bulk network design in the nonuniform setting. Existing poly-logarithmic approximations are based on the junction tree approach [CHKS09,KN11]. We obtain a new polylogarithmic approximation via a natural LP relaxation. This establishes an upper bound on its integrality gap and affirmatively answers an open question raised in [CHKS09]. The rounding is based on recent results in hop-constrained oblivious routing [GHZ21], and this technique yields a polylogarithmic approximation in more general settings such as set connectivity. Our algorithm for buy-at-bulk network design is based on an LP-based reduction to hop constrained network design for which we obtain LP-based bicriteria approximation algorithms. We also consider a fault-tolerant version of hop constrained network design where one wants to design a low-cost network to guarantee short paths between a given set of source-sink pairs even when k-1 edges can fail. This model has been considered in network design [GL17,GML18,AJL20] but no approximation algorithms were known. We obtain polylogarithmic bicriteria approximation algorithms for the single-source setting for any fixed k. We build upon the single-source algorithm and the junction-tree approach to obtain an approximation algorithm for the multicommodity setting when at most one edge can fail. ",

To this day, standardized evaluation protocols and rigorous comparison across TKG models are available, but the importance of simple baselines is often neglected in the evaluation, which prevents researchers from discerning actual and fictitious progress. We propose to close this gap by designing an intuitive baseline for TKG Forecasting based on predicting recurring facts. Compared to most TKG models, it requires little hyperparameter tuning and no iterative training. Further, it can help to identify failure modes in existing approaches. The empirical findings are quite unexpected: compared to 11 methods on five datasets, our baseline ranks first or third in three of them, painting a radically different picture of the predictive quality of the state of the art.

    "abstract": "We address the problem of regressing 3D human pose and shape from a single image, with a focus on 3D accuracy. The current best methods leverage large datasets of 3D pseudo-ground-truth (p-GT) and 2D keypoints, leading to robust performance. With such methods, we observe a paradoxical decline in 3D pose accuracy with increasing 2D accuracy. This is caused by biases in the p-GT and the use of an approximate camera projection model. We quantify the error induced by current camera models and show that fitting 2D keypoints and p-GT accurately causes incorrect 3D poses. Our analysis defines the invalid distances within which minimizing 2D and p-GT losses is detrimental. We use this to formulate a new loss Threshold-Adaptive Loss Scaling (TALS) that penalizes gross 2D and p-GT losses but not smaller ones. With such a loss, there are many 3D poses that could equally explain the 2D evidence. To reduce this ambiguity we need a prior over valid human poses but such priors can introduce unwanted bias. To address this, we exploit a tokenized representation of human pose and reformulate the problem as token prediction. This restricts the estimated poses to the space of valid poses, effectively providing a uniform prior. Extensive experiments on the EMDB and 3DPW datasets show that our reformulated keypoint loss and tokenization allows us to train on in-the-wild data while improving 3D accuracy over the state-of-the-art.

After training, the model successfully discovers and localizes monotonic changes while ignoring cyclic and stochastic ones. We demonstrate applications of the model in multiple video settings covering different scene and object types, discovering both object-level and environmental changes in unseen sequences.

In recent years, generative adversarial networks (GANs) have shown a powerful performance in image generation as well as translation, rendering them a smart choice to be applied to reconstruction tasks.

Specifically, we consider the interconnection of different Quantum Local Area Networks (QLANs), and we show that multipartite entanglement allows to dynamically generate an inter-QLAN artificial topology, by means of local operations only, that overcomes the limitations of the physical QLAN topologies. To this aim, we first design the multipartite entangled state to be distributed within each QLAN. Then, we show how such a state can be engineered to: i) interconnect nodes belonging to different QLANs, and ii) dynamically adapt to different inter-QLAN traffic patterns.

The core concept of the DRSS method involves reformulating the DR covariate-shift problem as a weighted empirical risk minimization problem, where the weights are subject to uncertainty within a predetermined range. By extending the SS technique to accommodate this weight uncertainty, the DRSS method is capable of reliably identifying unnecessary samples and features under any future distribution within a specified range. We provide a theoretical guarantee of the DRSS method and validate its performance through numerical experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets. ",

As light penetrates the sample scattering events occur that alter the propagation direction of the photons in a random manner leading degradation of image quality. The distribution of the scattered light does, however, give a measure of the optical properties such as the reduced scattering coefficient and the absorption coefficient. Unfortunately, inverting scattering patterns to recover the optical properties is not simple, especially in the regime where the light is partially randomized. Machine learning has been proposed by several authors as a means of recovering these properties from either the back scattered or the transmitted light. In the present paper, we train a general purpose convolutional neural network RESNET 50 with simulated data based on Monte Carlo simulations. We show that compared with previous work our approach gives comparable or better reconstruction accuracy with training on a much smaller dataset. Moreover, by training on multiple parameters such as the intensity distribution at multiple planes or the exit angle and spatial distribution one achieves improved performance compared to training on a single input such as the intensity distribution captured at the sample surface. While our approach gives good parameter reconstruction, we identify factors that limit the accuracy of the recovered properties, particularly the absorption coefficient. In the light of these limitations, we suggest how the present approach may be enhanced for even better performance. ",

Over decades, a wide range of upper and lower bound methods have been developed to analyze this problem. However, despite tremendous effort, even small instances of the problem have remained open. In recent years, a new dual characterization of the Shannon capacity of graphs, asymptotic spectrum duality, has unified and extended known upper bound methods and structural theorems. In this paper, building on asymptotic spectrum duality, we develop a new theory of graph distance, that we call asymptotic spectrum distance, and corresponding limits (reminiscent of, but different from, the celebrated theory of cut-norm, graphons and flag algebras). We propose a graph limit approach to the Shannon capacity problem: to determine the Shannon capacity of a graph, construct a sequence of easier to analyse graphs converging to it. (1) We give a very general construction of non-trivial converging sequences of graphs (in a family of circulant graphs). (2) We construct Cauchy sequences of finite graphs that do not converge to any finite graph, but do converge to an infinite graph. We establish strong connections between convergence questions of finite graphs and the asymptotic properties of Borsuk-like infinite graphs on the circle. (3) We observe that all best-known lower bound constructions for Shannon capacity of small odd cycles can be obtained from a \"finite\" version of the graph limit approach. We develop computational and theoretical aspects of this approach and use these to obtain a new Shannon capacity lower bound for the fifteen-cycle. The theory of asymptotic spectrum distance applies not only to Shannon capacity of graphs; indeed, we will develop it for a general class of mathematical objects and their asymptotic properties. ",
