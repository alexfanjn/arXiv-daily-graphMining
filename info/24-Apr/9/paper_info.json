    "title": "Logic Query of Thoughts: Guiding Large Language Models to Answer Complex  Logic Queries with Knowledge Graphs",
    "abstract": "Despite the superb performance in many tasks, large language models (LLMs) bear the risk of generating hallucination or even wrong answers when confronted with tasks that demand the accuracy of knowledge. The issue becomes even more noticeable when addressing logic queries that require multiple logic reasoning steps. On the other hand, knowledge graph (KG) based question answering methods are capable of accurately identifying the correct answers with the help of knowledge graph, yet its accuracy could quickly deteriorate when the knowledge graph itself is sparse and incomplete. It remains a critical challenge on how to integrate knowledge graph reasoning with LLMs in a mutually beneficial way so as to mitigate both the hallucination problem of LLMs as well as the incompleteness issue of knowledge graphs. In this paper, we propose 'Logic-Query-of-Thoughts' (LGOT) which is the first of its kind to combine LLMs with knowledge graph based logic query reasoning. LGOT seamlessly combines knowledge graph reasoning and LLMs, effectively breaking down complex logic queries into easy to answer subquestions. Through the utilization of both knowledge graph reasoning and LLMs, it successfully derives answers for each subquestion. By aggregating these results and selecting the highest quality candidate answers for each step, LGOT achieves accurate results to complex questions. Our experimental findings demonstrate substantial performance enhancements, with up to 20% improvement over ChatGPT. ",

    "abstract": "Until recently, search engines were the predominant method for people to access online information. The recent emergence of large language models (LLMs) has given machines new capabilities such as the ability to generate new digital artifacts like text, images, code etc., resulting in a new tool, a generative search engine, which combines the capabilities of LLMs with a traditional search engine. Through the empirical analysis of Bing Copilot (Bing Chat), one of the first publicly available generative search engines, we analyze the types and complexity of tasks that people use Bing Copilot for compared to Bing Search. Findings indicate that people use the generative search engine for more knowledge work tasks that are higher in cognitive complexity than were commonly done with a traditional search engine. ",

    "abstract": "The next point-of-interest (POI) prediction is a significant task in location-based services, yet its complexity arises from the consolidation of spatial and semantic intent. This fusion is subject to the influences of historical preferences, prevailing location, and environmental factors, thereby posing significant challenges. In addition, the uneven POI distribution further complicates the next POI prediction procedure. To address these challenges, we enrich input features and propose an effective deep-learning method within a two-step prediction framework. Our method first incorporates remote sensing data, capturing pivotal environmental context to enhance input features regarding both location and semantics. Subsequently, we employ a region quad-tree structure to integrate urban remote sensing, road network, and POI distribution spaces, aiming to devise a more coherent graph representation method for urban spatial. Leveraging this method, we construct the QR-P graph for the user's historical trajectories to encapsulate historical travel knowledge, thereby augmenting input features with comprehensive spatial and semantic insights. We devise distinct embedding modules to encode these features and employ an attention mechanism to fuse diverse encodings. In the two-step prediction procedure, we initially identify potential spatial zones by predicting user-preferred tiles, followed by pinpointing specific POIs of a designated type within the projected tiles. Empirical findings from four real-world location-based social network datasets underscore the remarkable superiority of our proposed approach over competitive baseline methods. ",

    "title": "ProLoc: Robust Location Proofs in Hindsight",
    "abstract": "Many online services rely on self-reported locations of user devices like smartphones. To mitigate harm from falsified self-reported locations, the literature has proposed location proof services (LPSs), which provide proof of a device's location by corroborating its self-reported location using short-range radio contacts with either trusted infrastructure or nearby devices that also report their locations. This paper presents ProLoc, a new LPS that extends prior work in two ways. First, ProLoc relaxes prior work's proofs that a device was at a given location to proofs that a device was within distance \"d\" of a given location. We argue that these weaker proofs, which we call \"region proofs\", are important because (i) region proofs can be constructed with few requirements on device reporting behavior as opposed to precise location proofs, and (ii) a quantitative bound on a device's distance from a known epicenter is useful for many applications. For example, in the context of citizen reporting near an unexpected event (earthquake, violent protest, etc.), knowing the verified distances of the reporting devices from the event's epicenter would be valuable for ranking the reports by relevance or flagging fake reports. Second, ProLoc includes a novel mechanism to prevent collusion attacks where a set of attacker-controlled devices corroborate each others' false locations. Ours is the first mechanism that does not need additional infrastructure to handle attacks with made-up devices, which an attacker can create in any number at any location without any cost. For this, we rely on a variant of TrustRank applied to the self-reported trajectories and encounters of devices. Our goal is to prevent retroactive attacks where the adversary cannot predict ahead of time which fake location it will want to report, which is the case for the reporting of unexpected events. ",

    "abstract": "There currently exist two extreme viewpoints for neural network feature learning -- (i) Neural networks simply implement a kernel method (a la NTK) and hence no features are learned (ii) Neural networks can represent (and hence learn) intricate hierarchical features suitable for the data. We argue in this paper neither interpretation is likely to be correct based on a novel viewpoint. Neural networks can be viewed as a mixture of experts, where each expert corresponds to a (number of layers length) path through a sequence of hidden units. We use this alternate interpretation to motivate a model, called the Deep Linearly Gated Network (DLGN), which sits midway between deep linear networks and ReLU networks. Unlike deep linear networks, the DLGN is capable of learning non-linear features (which are then linearly combined), and unlike ReLU networks these features are ultimately simple -- each feature is effectively an indicator function for a region compactly described as an intersection of (number of layers) half-spaces in the input space. This viewpoint allows for a comprehensive global visualization of features, unlike the local visualizations for neurons based on saliency/activation/gradient maps. Feature learning in DLGNs is shown to happen and the mechanism with which this happens is through learning half-spaces in the input space that contain smooth regions of the target function. Due to the structure of DLGNs, the neurons in later layers are fundamentally the same as those in earlier layers -- they all represent a half-space -- however, the dynamics of gradient descent impart a distinct clustering to the later layer neurons. We hypothesize that ReLU networks also have similar feature learning behaviour. ",

Both topology and routing are critical aspects that must be carefully considered for a competitive system network design. Moreover, when daily failures are expected, this tandem should exhibit resilience and robustness. Low-diameter networks, including HyperX, are cheaper than typical Fat Trees. But, to be really competitive, they have to employ evolved routing algorithms to both balance traffic and tolerate failures. In this paper, SurePath, an efficient fault-tolerant routing mechanism for HyperX topology is introduced and evaluated. SurePath leverages routes provided by standard routing algorithms and a deadlock avoidance mechanism based on an Up/Down escape subnetwork. This mechanism not only prevents deadlock but also allows for a fault-tolerant solution for these networks. SurePath is thoroughly evaluated in the paper under different traffic patterns, showing no performance degradation under extremely faulty scenarios. ",

In this work, we present a general framework that leverages polarization imaging to improve inaccurate depth measurements from various depth sensors. Previous polarization-based depth enhancement methods focus on utilizing pure physics-based formulas for a single sensor. In contrast, our method first adopts a learning-based strategy where a neural network is trained to estimate a dense and complete depth map from polarization data and a sensor depth map from different sensors. To further improve the performance, we propose a Polarization Prompt Fusion Tuning (PPFT) strategy to effectively utilize RGB-based models pre-trained on large-scale datasets, as the size of the polarization dataset is limited to train a strong model from scratch. We conducted extensive experiments on a public dataset, and the results demonstrate that the proposed method performs favorably compared to existing depth enhancement baselines.

In this letter, we provide a compositional approach to estimate Lipschitz constants for deep feedforward neural networks by obtaining an exact decomposition of the large matrix verification problem into smaller sub-problems. We further obtain a closed-form solution that applies to most common neural network activation functions, which will enable rapid robustness and stability certificates for neural networks deployed in online control settings.

However, running multiple audio understanding models on headphones with a limited energy budget and on-chip memory remains a challenging task. In this work, we identify a new class of neural network accelerators (e.g., NE16 on GAP9) that allows network weights to be quantized to different common (e.g., 8 bits) and uncommon bit-widths (e.g., 3 bits). We then applied a differentiable neural architecture search to search over the optimal bit-widths of a network on two different sound event detection tasks with potentially different requirements on quantization and prediction granularity (i.e., classification vs. embeddings for few-shot learning). We further evaluated our quantized models on actual hardware, showing that we reduce memory usage, inference latency, and energy consumption by an average of 62%, 46%, and 61% respectively compared to 8-bit models while maintaining floating point performance. Our work sheds light on the benefits of such accelerators on sound event detection tasks when combined with an appropriate search method. ",

First, we explore the unique characteristics of few-shot learning to ensemble multiple few-shot (FS) models by creating three alternative fusion channels. Second, we introduce the concept of focal error diversity to learn the most efficient ensemble teaming strategy, rather than assuming that an ensemble of a larger number of base models will outperform those sub-ensembles of smaller size. We develop a focal-diversity ensemble pruning method to effectively prune out the candidate ensembles with low ensemble error diversity and recommend top-$K$ FS ensembles with the highest focal error diversity. Finally, we capture the complex non-linear patterns of ensemble few-shot predictions by designing the learn-to-combine algorithm, which can learn the diverse weight assignments for robust ensemble fusion over different member models. Extensive experiments on representative few-shot benchmarks show that the top-K ensembles recommended by FusionShot can outperform the representative SOTA few-shot models on novel tasks (different distributions and unknown at training), and can prevail over existing few-shot learners in both cross-domain settings and adversarial settings.

The discrepancy presents a challenge for accurately predicting the performance of models once deployed on the target distribution. Domain adaptation and generalization are widely recognized as effective strategies for addressing such shifts, thereby ensuring reliable performance. The recent promising results in applying vision transformers in computer vision tasks, coupled with advancements in self-attention mechanisms, have demonstrated their significant potential for robustness and generalization in handling distribution shifts. Motivated by the increased interest from the research community, our paper investigates the deployment of vision transformers in domain adaptation and domain generalization scenarios. For domain adaptation methods, we categorize research into feature-level, instance-level, model-level adaptations, and hybrid approaches, along with other categorizations with respect to diverse strategies for enhancing domain adaptation. Similarly, for domain generalization, we categorize research into multi-domain learning, meta-learning, regularization techniques, and data augmentation strategies. We further classify diverse strategies in research, underscoring the various approaches researchers have taken to address distribution shifts by integrating vision transformers. The inclusion of comprehensive tables summarizing these categories is a distinct feature of our work, offering valuable insights for researchers. These findings highlight the versatility of vision transformers in managing distribution shifts, crucial for real-world applications, especially in critical safety and decision-making scenarios. ",

In this research, we use a similar framework but with a lightweight deep network, and we adopt a probabilistic score with reconstruction error. Our methodology calculates the probability of whether the sample comes from the inlier distribution or not. This work makes two key contributions. The first is that we compute the novelty probability by linearizing the manifold that holds the structure of the inlier distribution. This allows us to interpret how the probability is distributed and can be determined in relation to the local coordinates of the manifold tangent space. The second contribution is that we improve the training protocol for the network.

    "abstract": "Cyber-physical systems (CPS) have experienced rapid growth in recent decades. However, like any other computer-based systems, malicious attacks evolve mutually, driving CPS to undesirable physical states and potentially causing catastrophes. Although the current state-of-the-art is well aware of this issue, the majority of researchers have not focused on CPS recovery, the procedure we defined as restoring a CPS's physical state back to a target condition under adversarial attacks. To call for attention on CPS recovery and identify existing efforts, we have surveyed a total of 30 relevant papers. We identify a major partition of the proposed recovery strategies: shallow recovery vs. deep recovery, where the former does not use a dedicated recovery controller while the latter does. Additionally, we surveyed exploratory research on topics that facilitate recovery. From these publications, we discuss the current state-of-the-art of CPS recovery, with respect to applications, attack type, attack surfaces and system dynamics. Then, we identify untouched sub-domains in this field and suggest possible future directions for researchers. ",

It discusses the limitations of traditional positioning methods, introduces SLAM technology, and compares LIDAR SLAM with visual SLAM. Real-world examples from companies like Tesla, Waymo, and Mobileye showcase the integration of AI-driven technologies, sensor fusion, and SLAM in autonomous driving systems. The paper then delves into the specifics of SLAM algorithms, sensor technologies, and the importance of automatic lane changes in driving safety and efficiency.

    "abstract": "Automatic software fault localization plays an important role in software quality assurance by pinpointing faulty locations for easier debugging. Coverage-based fault localization, a widely used technique, employs statistics on coverage spectra to rank code based on suspiciousness scores. However, the rigidity of statistical approaches calls for learning-based techniques. Amongst all, Grace, a graph-neural network (GNN) based technique has achieved state-of-the-art due to its capacity to preserve coverage spectra, i.e., test-to-source coverage relationships, as precise abstract syntax-enhanced graph representation, mitigating the limitation of other learning-based technique which compresses the feature representation. However, such representation struggles with scalability due to the increasing complexity of software and associated coverage spectra and AST graphs. In this work, we proposed a new graph representation, DepGraph, that reduces the complexity of the graph representation by 70% in nodes and edges by integrating interprocedural call graph in the graph representation of the code. Moreover, we integrate additional features such as code change information in the graph as attributes so the model can leverage rich historical project data. We evaluate DepGraph using Defects4j 2.0.0, and it outperforms Grace by locating 20% more faults in Top-1 and improving the Mean First Rank (MFR) and the Mean Average Rank (MAR) by over 50% while decreasing GPU memory usage by 44% and training/inference time by 85%. Additionally, in cross-project settings, DepGraph surpasses the state-of-the-art baseline with a 42% higher Top-1 accuracy, and 68% and 65% improvement in MFR and MAR, respectively. Our study demonstrates DepGraph's robustness, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy and scalability for future extension and adoption. ",

They are primarily effective on social media platforms since they can easily reach many users. Memes in a disinformation campaign achieve their goal of influencing the users through several rhetorical and psychological techniques, such as causal oversimplification, name-calling, and smear. The SemEval 2024 Task 4 \\textit{Multilingual Detection of Persuasion Technique in Memes} on identifying such techniques in the memes is divided across three sub-tasks: ($\\mathbf{1}$) Hierarchical multi-label classification using only textual content of the meme, ($\\mathbf{2}$) Hierarchical multi-label classification using both, textual and visual content of the meme and ($\\mathbf{3}$) Binary classification of whether the meme contains a persuasion technique or not using it's textual and visual content. This paper proposes an ensemble of Class Definition Prediction (CDP) and hyperbolic embeddings-based approaches for this task. We enhance meme classification accuracy and comprehensiveness by integrating HypEmo's hierarchical label embeddings (Chen et al., 2023) and a multi-task learning framework for emotion prediction.

It is a step-by-step linear reasoning process that adjusts the length of the chain to improve the performance of generated prompts. However, human thought processes are predominantly non-linear, as they encompass multiple aspects simultaneously and employ dynamic adjustment and updating mechanisms. Therefore, we propose a novel Aggregation-Graph-of-Thought (AGoT) mechanism for soft-prompt tuning in multi-modal representation learning. The proposed AGoT models the human thought process not only as a chain but also models each step as a reasoning aggregation graph to cope with the overlooked multiple aspects of thinking in single-step reasoning. This turns the entire reasoning process into prompt aggregation and prompt flow operations. Experiments show that our multi-modal model enhanced with AGoT soft-prompting achieves good results in several tasks such as text-image retrieval, visual question answering, and image recognition. In addition, we demonstrate that it has good domain generalization performance due to better reasoning. ",

    "abstract": "Multimodal Sentiment Analysis (MSA) endeavors to understand human sentiment by leveraging language, visual, and acoustic modalities. Despite the remarkable performance exhibited by previous MSA approaches, the presence of inherent multimodal heterogeneities poses a challenge, with the contribution of different modalities varying considerably. Past research predominantly focused on improving representation learning techniques and feature fusion strategies. However, many of these efforts overlooked the variation in semantic richness among different modalities, treating each modality uniformly. This approach may lead to underestimating the significance of strong modalities while overemphasizing the importance of weak ones. Motivated by these insights, we introduce a Text-oriented Cross-Attention Network (TCAN), emphasizing the predominant role of the text modality in MSA. Specifically, for each multimodal sample, by taking unaligned sequences of the three modalities as inputs, we initially allocate the extracted unimodal features into a visual-text and an acoustic-text pair. Subsequently, we implement self-attention on the text modality and apply text-queried cross-attention to the visual and acoustic modalities. To mitigate the influence of noise signals and redundant features, we incorporate a gated control mechanism into the framework. Additionally, we introduce unimodal joint learning to gain a deeper understanding of homogeneous emotional tendencies across diverse modalities through backpropagation. Experimental results demonstrate that TCAN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art MSA methods on two datasets (CMU-MOSI and CMU-MOSEI). ",

    "abstract": "Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) is vital in neuroscience, enabling investigations into brain disorders, treatment monitoring, and brain function mapping. However, head motion during fMRI scans, occurring between shots of slice acquisition, can result in distortion, biased analyses, and increased costs due to the need for scan repetitions. Therefore, retrospective slice-level motion correction through slice-to-volume registration (SVR) is crucial. Previous studies have utilized deep learning (DL) based models to address the SVR task; however, they overlooked the uncertainty stemming from the input stack of slices and did not assign weighting or scoring to each slice. In this work, we introduce an end-to-end SVR model for aligning 2D fMRI slices with a 3D reference volume, incorporating a self-attention mechanism to enhance robustness against input data variations and uncertainties. It utilizes independent slice and volume encoders and a self-attention module to assign pixel-wise scores for each slice. We conducted evaluation experiments on 200 images involving synthetic rigid motion generated from 27 subjects belonging to the test set, from the publicly available Healthy Brain Network (HBN) dataset. Our experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves competitive performance in terms of alignment accuracy compared to state-of-the-art deep learning-based methods (Euclidean distance of $0.93$ [mm] vs. $1.86$ [mm]). Furthermore, our approach exhibits significantly faster registration speed compared to conventional iterative methods ($0.096$ sec. vs. $1.17$ sec.). Our end-to-end SVR model facilitates real-time head motion tracking during fMRI acquisition, ensuring reliability and robustness against uncertainties in inputs. source code, which includes the training and evaluations, will be available soon.

Extracting accurate point correspondence is to the center of the problem. Existing approaches usually treat the scene point cloud as a whole, overlooking the separation of instances. Therefore, point features could be easily polluted by other points from the background or different instances, leading to inaccurate correspondences oblivious to separate instances, especially in cluttered scenes. In this work, we propose MIRETR, Multi-Instance REgistration TRansformer, a coarse-to-fine approach to the extraction of instance-aware correspondences. At the coarse level, it jointly learns instance-aware superpoint features and predicts per-instance masks. With instance masks, the influence from outside of the instance being concerned is minimized, such that highly reliable superpoint correspondences can be extracted. The superpoint correspondences are then extended to instance candidates at the fine level according to the instance masks. At last, an efficient candidate selection and refinement algorithm is devised to obtain the final registrations. Extensive experiments on three public benchmarks demonstrate the efficacy of our approach. In particular, MIRETR outperforms the state of the arts by 16.6 points on F1 score on the challenging ROBI benchmark. Code and models are available at https://github.com/zhiyuanYU134/MIRETR. ",

Specifically, considering the spectral graph convolution as a construction operation towards target output, we prove that existing popular convolution paradigms cannot construct the target output with mild conditions on input graph signals, causing spectral GNNs to fall into suboptimal solutions. To address the issues, we rethink the spectral graph convolution from a more general two-dimensional (2-D) signal convolution perspective and propose a new convolution paradigm, named 2-D graph convolution. We prove that 2-D graph convolution unifies existing graph convolution paradigms, and is capable to construct arbitrary target output. Based on the proposed 2-D graph convolution, we further propose ChebNet2D, an efficient and effective GNN implementation of 2-D graph convolution through applying Chebyshev interpolation.

    "abstract": "3D semantic occupancy prediction is a pivotal task in the field of autonomous driving. Recent approaches have made great advances in 3D semantic occupancy predictions on a single modality. However, multi-modal semantic occupancy prediction approaches have encountered difficulties in dealing with the modality heterogeneity, modality misalignment, and insufficient modality interactions that arise during the fusion of different modalities data, which may result in the loss of important geometric and semantic information. This letter presents a novel multi-modal, i.e., LiDAR-camera 3D semantic occupancy prediction framework, dubbed Co-Occ, which couples explicit LiDAR-camera feature fusion with implicit volume rendering regularization. The key insight is that volume rendering in the feature space can proficiently bridge the gap between 3D LiDAR sweeps and 2D images while serving as a physical regularization to enhance LiDAR-camera fused volumetric representation. Specifically, we first propose a Geometric- and Semantic-aware Fusion (GSFusion) module to explicitly enhance LiDAR features by incorporating neighboring camera features through a K-nearest neighbors (KNN) search. Then, we employ volume rendering to project the fused feature back to the image planes for reconstructing color and depth maps. These maps are then supervised by input images from the camera and depth estimations derived from LiDAR, respectively. Extensive experiments on the popular nuScenes and SemanticKITTI benchmarks verify the effectiveness of our Co-Occ for 3D semantic occupancy prediction.

However, current video visual relation detection datasets have two main limitations that hinder the progress of research in this area. First, they do not explore complex human-human interactions in multi-person scenarios. Second, the relation types of existing datasets have relatively low-level semantics and can be often recognized by appearance or simple prior information, without the need for detailed spatio-temporal context reasoning. Nevertheless, comprehending high-level interactions between humans is crucial for understanding complex multi-person videos, such as sports and surveillance videos. To address this issue, we propose a new video visual relation detection task: video human-human interaction detection, and build a dataset named SportsHHI for it. SportsHHI contains 34 high-level interaction classes from basketball and volleyball sports. 118,075 human bounding boxes and 50,649 interaction instances are annotated on 11,398 keyframes. To benchmark this, we propose a two-stage baseline method and conduct extensive experiments to reveal the key factors for a successful human-human interaction detector.

If any devices are infected, the whole ecosystem can be compromised. Although various Machine Learning (ML) models are deployed to detect malware and network intrusion, generally speaking, robust high-accuracy models tend to require resources not found in all IoT devices, compared to less robust models defined by weak learners. In order to combat this issue, Fadhilla proposed a meta-learner ensemble model comprised of less robust prediction results inherent with weak learner ML models to produce a highly robust meta-learning ensemble model. The main problem with the prior research is that it cannot be deployed in low-end AIoT devices due to the limited resources comprising processing power, storage, and memory (the required libraries quickly exhaust low-end AIoT devices' resources.) Hence, this research aims to optimize the proposed super learner meta-learning ensemble model to make it viable for low-end AIoT devices. We show the library and ML model memory requirements associated with each optimization stage and emphasize that optimization of current ML models is necessitated for low-end AIoT devices. Our results demonstrate that we can obtain similar accuracy and False Positive Rate (FPR) metrics from high-end AIoT devices running the derived ML model, with a lower inference duration and smaller memory footprint.

TempNet can be trained together with a large foundation model from scratch or learned separately given a pretrained foundation model. It is not only useful for predicting personalized temperature to promote the training of LFMs but also generalizable and transferable to new tasks.

It finds applications in real-time scenarios such as security surveillance and autonomous vehicle navigation, among others. Computational efficiency becomes a critical factor in achieving real-time object detection. Hence, there is a need for a detection model with low complexity and satisfactory accuracy. This research aims to enhance computational efficiency by selecting appropriate features within the GLCM framework. Two classification models, namely K-Nearest Neighbours (K-NN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM), were employed, with the results indicating that K-Nearest Neighbours (K-NN) outperforms SVM in terms of computational complexity. Specifically, K-NN, when utilizing a combination of Correlation, Energy, and Homogeneity features, achieves a 100% accuracy rate with low complexity. Moreover, when using a combination of Energy and Homogeneity features, K-NN attains an almost perfect accuracy level of 99.9889%, while maintaining low complexity. On the other hand, despite SVM achieving 100% accuracy in certain feature combinations, its high or very high complexity can pose challenges, particularly in real-time applications. Therefore, based on the trade-off between accuracy and complexity, the K-NN model with a combination of Correlation, Energy, and Homogeneity features emerges as a more suitable choice for real-time applications that demand high accuracy and low complexity. This research provides valuable insights for optimizing object detection in various applications requiring both high accuracy and rapid responsiveness. ",

    "abstract": "The boom of Generative AI brings opportunities entangled with risks and concerns. In this work, we seek a step toward a universal deepfake detection system with better generalization and robustness, to accommodate the responsible deployment of diverse image generative models. We do so by first scaling up the existing detection task setup from the one-generator to multiple-generators in training, during which we disclose two challenges presented in prior methodological designs. Specifically, we reveal that the current methods tailored for training on one specific generator either struggle to learn comprehensive artifacts from multiple generators or tend to sacrifice their ability to identify fake images from seen generators (i.e., In-Domain performance) to exchange the generalization for unseen generators (i.e., Out-Of-Domain performance). To tackle the above challenges, we propose our Discrepancy Deepfake Detector (D$^3$) framework, whose core idea is to learn the universal artifacts from multiple generators by introducing a parallel network branch that takes a distorted image as extra discrepancy signal to supplement its original counterpart. Extensive scaled-up experiments on the merged UFD and GenImage datasets with six detection models demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework, achieving a 5.3% accuracy improvement in the OOD testing compared to the current SOTA methods while maintaining the ID performance.

    "abstract": "Neuroevolution is a powerful method of applying an evolutionary algorithm to refine the performance of artificial neural networks through natural selection; however, the fitness evaluation of these networks can be time-consuming and computationally expensive, particularly for continuous time recurrent neural networks (CTRNNs) that necessitate the simulation of differential equations. To overcome this challenge, field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) have emerged as an increasingly popular solution, due to their high performance and low power consumption. Further, their ability to undergo dynamic and partial reconfiguration enables the extremely rapid evaluation of the fitness of CTRNNs, effectively addressing the bottleneck associated with conventional methods. By incorporating fitness evaluation directly upon the programmable logic of the FPGA, hyper-parallel evaluation becomes feasible, dramatically reducing the time required for assessment. This inherent parallelism of FPGAs accelerates the entire neuroevolutionary process by several orders of magnitude, facilitating faster convergence to an optimal solution. The work presented in this study demonstrates the potential of utilizing dynamic and partial reconfiguration on capable FPGAs as a powerful platform for neuroevolving dynamic neural networks. ",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we uncover a new side-channel vulnerability in the widely used NAT port preservation strategy and an insufficient reverse path validation strategy of Wi-Fi routers, which allows an off-path attacker to infer if there is one victim client in the same network communicating with another host on the Internet using TCP. After detecting the presence of TCP connections between the victim client and the server, the attacker can evict the original NAT mapping and reconstruct a new mapping at the router by sending fake TCP packets due to the routers' vulnerability of disabling TCP window tracking strategy, which has been faithfully implemented in most of the routers for years. In this way, the attacker can intercept TCP packets from the server and obtain the current sequence and acknowledgment numbers, which in turn allows the attacker to forcibly close the connection, poison the traffic in plain text, or reroute the server's incoming packets to the attacker. We test 67 widely used routers from 30 vendors and discover that 52 of them are affected by this attack. Also, we conduct an extensive measurement study on 93 real-world Wi-Fi networks. The experimental results show that 75 of these evaluated Wi-Fi networks (81%) are fully vulnerable to our attack. Our case study shows that it takes about 17.5, 19.4, and 54.5 seconds on average to terminate an SSH connection, download private files from FTP servers, and inject fake HTTP response packets with success rates of 87.4%, 82.6%, and 76.1%. We responsibly disclose the vulnerability and suggest mitigation strategies to all affected vendors and have received positive feedback, including acknowledgments, CVEs, rewards, and adoption of our suggestions.

    "abstract": "Message Passing Graph Neural Networks are known to suffer from two problems that are sometimes believed to be diametrically opposed: over-squashing and over-smoothing. The former results from topological bottlenecks that hamper the information flow from distant nodes and are mitigated by spectral gap maximization, primarily, by means of edge additions. However, such additions often promote over-smoothing that renders nodes of different classes less distinguishable. Inspired by the Braess phenomenon, we argue that deleting edges can address over-squashing and over-smoothing simultaneously. This insight explains how edge deletions can improve generalization, thus connecting spectral gap optimization to a seemingly disconnected objective of reducing computational resources by pruning graphs for lottery tickets. To this end, we propose a more effective spectral gap optimization framework to add or delete edges and demonstrate its effectiveness on large heterophilic datasets. ",

Nowadays, Multi-modal Language Models~(MLMs) integrate multi-modal signals into LLMs, further bringing richer perception to entity agents and allowing embodied agents to perceive world-understanding tasks more delicately. However, existing works: 1) operate independently by agents, each containing multiple LLMs, from perception to action, resulting in gaps between complex tasks and execution; 2) train MLMs on static data, struggling with dynamics in open-ended scenarios; 3) input prior knowledge directly as prompts, suppressing application flexibility. We propose STEVE-2, a hierarchical knowledge distillation framework for open-ended embodied tasks, characterized by 1) a hierarchical system for multi-granular task division, 2) a mirrored distillation method for parallel simulation data, and 3) an extra expert model for bringing additional knowledge into parallel simulation. After distillation, embodied agents can complete complex, open-ended tasks without additional expert guidance, utilizing the performance and knowledge of a versatile MLM. Extensive evaluations on navigation and creation tasks highlight the superior performance of STEVE-2 in open-ended tasks, with $1.4 \\times$ - $7.3 \\times$ in performance. ",

However, their potential in multi-sensor fusion remains largely unexplored. In this work, we introduce DifFUSER, a novel approach that leverages diffusion models for multi-modal fusion in 3D object detection and BEV map segmentation. Benefiting from the inherent denoising property of diffusion, DifFUSER is able to refine or even synthesize sensor features in case of sensor malfunction, thereby improving the quality of the fused output. In terms of architecture, our DifFUSER blocks are chained together in a hierarchical BiFPN fashion, termed cMini-BiFPN, offering an alternative architecture for latent diffusion. We further introduce a Gated Self-conditioned Modulated (GSM) latent diffusion module together with a Progressive Sensor Dropout Training (PSDT) paradigm, designed to add stronger conditioning to the diffusion process and robustness to sensor failures. Our extensive evaluations on the Nuscenes dataset reveal that DifFUSER not only achieves state-of-the-art performance with a 69.1% mIOU in BEV map segmentation tasks but also competes effectively with leading transformer-based fusion techniques in 3D object detection.

This scenario presents a significant challenge due to the complex geometries involved, requiring a deep understanding of the local geometry to generate grasps efficiently on the specified constrained regions. Existing methods only explore settings involving table-top/small objects and require augmented datasets to train, limiting their performance on complex objects. We propose CGDF: Constrained Grasp Diffusion Fields, a diffusion-based grasp generative model that generalizes to objects with arbitrary geometries, as well as generates dense grasps on the target regions. CGDF uses a part-guided diffusion approach that enables it to get high sample efficiency in constrained grasping without explicitly training on massive constraint-augmented datasets. We provide qualitative and quantitative comparisons using analytical metrics and in simulation, in both unconstrained and constrained settings to show that our method can generalize to generate stable grasps on complex objects, especially useful for dual-arm manipulation settings, while existing methods struggle to do so.

However, standard gradient-based interpretation maps, including the simple gradient and integrated gradient algorithms, often lack desired structures such as sparsity and connectedness in their application to real-world computer vision models. A frequently used approach to inducing sparsity structures into gradient-based saliency maps is to alter the simple gradient scheme using sparsification or norm-based regularization. A drawback with such post-processing methods is their frequently-observed significant loss in fidelity to the original simple gradient map. In this work, we propose to apply adversarial training as an in-processing scheme to train neural networks with structured simple gradient maps. We show a duality relation between the regularized norms of the adversarial perturbations and gradient-based maps, based on which we design adversarial training loss functions promoting sparsity and group-sparsity properties in simple gradient maps. We present several numerical results to show the influence of our proposed norm-based adversarial training methods on the standard gradient-based maps of standard neural network architectures on benchmark image datasets.

As a countermeasure, various Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) have been suggested in the literature to prevent and mitigate these threats. With the increasing volume of data facilitated by the integration of Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) and Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) communication networks, most of these systems rely on data-driven approaches such as Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) models. However, these systems are susceptible to adversarial evasion attacks. While many researchers have explored this vulnerability, their studies often involve unrealistic assumptions, lack consideration for a realistic threat model, and fail to provide effective solutions. In this paper, we present CANEDERLI (CAN Evasion Detection ResiLIence), a novel framework for securing CAN-based IDSs. Our system considers a realistic threat model and addresses the impact of adversarial attacks on DL-based detection systems. Our findings highlight strong transferability properties among diverse attack methodologies by considering multiple state-of-the-art attacks and model architectures. We analyze the impact of adversarial training in addressing this threat and propose an adaptive online adversarial training technique outclassing traditional fine-tuning methodologies with F1 scores up to 0.941. By making our framework publicly available, we aid practitioners and researchers in assessing the resilience of IDSs to a varied adversarial landscape. ",

While recent research suggests using neural activation patterns (NAPs) as specifications for verifying unseen test set data, it focuses on computing the most refined NAPs, often limited to very small regions in the input space. In this paper, we study the following problem: Given a neural network, find a minimal (coarsest) NAP that is sufficient for formal verification of the network's robustness. Finding the minimal NAP specification not only expands verifiable bounds but also provides insights into which neurons contribute to the model's robustness. To address this problem, we propose several exact and approximate approaches. Our exact approaches leverage the verification tool to find minimal NAP specifications in either a deterministic or statistical manner. Whereas the approximate methods efficiently estimate minimal NAPs using adversarial examples and local gradients, without making calls to the verification tool. This allows us to inspect potential causal links between neurons and the robustness of state-of-the-art neural networks, a task for which existing verification frameworks fail to scale. Our experimental results suggest that minimal NAP specifications require much smaller fractions of neurons compared to the most refined NAP specifications, yet they can significantly expand the verifiable boundaries to several orders of magnitude larger.

Traditional mesh-based representations struggle to represent articulated bodies with clothes due to the diversity of human body shapes and clothing styles, as well as the complexity of poses. Our proposed model provides a unified framework for parametric modeling, which can represent the identity, clothing, shape and pose of the clothed human body. Our proposed approach utilizes the power of neural implicit functions as the underlying representation and integrates well-designed structures to meet the necessary requirements. Specifically, we represent the underlying body as a signed distance function and clothing as an unsigned distance function, and they can be uniformly represented as unsigned distance fields. Different types of clothing do not require predefined topological structures or classifications, and can follow changes in the underlying body to fit the body. Additionally, we construct poses using a controllable articulated structure. The model is trained on both open and newly constructed datasets, and our decoupling strategy is carefully designed to ensure optimal performance. Our model excels at disentangling clothing and identity in different shape and poses while preserving the style of the clothing. We demonstrate that Neural-ABC fits new observations of different types of clothing. Compared to other state-of-the-art parametric models, Neural-ABC demonstrates powerful advantages in the reconstruction of clothed human bodies, as evidenced by fitting raw scans, depth maps and images. We show that the attributes of the fitted results can be further edited by adjusting their identities, clothing, shape and pose codes. ",

Traditional methods struggle with frame-to-frame correlations and point-wise correspondence tracking. Recently, partial differential equations (PDE) have provided a new perspective in uniformly solving spatial-temporal data information within certain constraints. While tracking tangible point correspondence remains challenging, we propose to formalize point cloud video representation learning as a PDE-solving problem. Inspired by fluid analysis, where PDEs are used to solve the deformation of spatial shape over time, we employ PDE to solve the variations of spatial points affected by temporal information. By modeling spatial-temporal correlations, we aim to regularize spatial variations with temporal features, thereby enhancing representation learning in point cloud videos. We introduce Motion PointNet composed of a PointNet-like encoder and a PDE-solving module. Initially, we construct a lightweight yet effective encoder to model an initial state of the spatial variations. Subsequently, we develop our PDE-solving module in a parameterized latent space, tailored to address the spatio-temporal correlations inherent in point cloud video. The process of solving PDE is guided and refined by a contrastive learning structure, which is pivotal in reshaping the feature distribution, thereby optimizing the feature representation within point cloud video data. Remarkably, our Motion PointNet achieves an impressive accuracy of 97.52% on the MSRAction-3D dataset, surpassing the current state-of-the-art in all aspects while consuming minimal resources (only 0.72M parameters and 0.82G FLOPs).

However, in both releases, it has been decided not to continue with it as a study-item, and to leave it for possible future specification. In this paper, we present the rationale for such a decision. Particularly, we demonstrate the practical issues which may affect the feasibility or usefulness of RIS in cellular networks, and present open problems to be addressed before RIS can be used in practice. Moreover, we compare the performance of RIS with network-controlled repeater, the node with the most similar characteristics to RIS and which has been standardized in 3GPP Release 18. Finally, different simulations are presented to evaluate the performance of RIS-assisted networks. ",

However, the irregular memory access pattern of HGNNs leads to the buffer thrashing issue in HGNN accelerators. In this work, we identify an opportunity to address buffer thrashing in HGNN acceleration through an analysis of the topology of heterogeneous graphs. To harvest this opportunity, we propose a graph restructuring method and map it into a hardware frontend named GDR-HGNN. GDR-HGNN dynamically restructures the graph on the fly to enhance data locality for HGNN accelerators. Experimental results demonstrate that, with the assistance of GDR-HGNN, a leading HGNN accelerator achieves an average speedup of 14.6 times and 1.78 times compared to the state-of-the-art software framework running on A100 GPU and itself, respectively.

Classical optical flow estimation uses two frames as input, whilst some recent methods consider multiple frames to explicitly model long-range information. The former ones limit their ability to fully leverage temporal coherence along the video sequence; and the latter ones incur heavy computational overhead, typically not possible for real-time flow estimation. Some multi-frame-based approaches even necessitate unseen future frames for current estimation, compromising real-time applicability in safety-critical scenarios. To this end, we present MemFlow, a real-time method for optical flow estimation and prediction with memory. Our method enables memory read-out and update modules for aggregating historical motion information in real-time. Furthermore, we integrate resolution-adaptive re-scaling to accommodate diverse video resolutions. Besides, our approach seamlessly extends to the future prediction of optical flow based on past observations. Leveraging effective historical motion aggregation, our method outperforms VideoFlow with fewer parameters and faster inference speed on Sintel and KITTI-15 datasets in terms of generalization performance. At the time of submission, MemFlow also leads in performance on the 1080p Spring dataset. Codes and models will be available at: https://dqiaole.github.io/MemFlow/. ",

However, the persistent challenge of Catastrophic Forgetting (CF) remains a hurdle.

To address this, we propose a CL method, named $\\textbf{F-MALLOC}$ ($\\textbf{F}$eed-forward $\\textbf{M}$emory $\\textbf{ALLOC}ation)$. F-MALLOC is inspired by recent insights highlighting that feed-forward layers emulate neural memories and encapsulate crucial translation knowledge. It decomposes feed-forward layers into discrete memory cells and allocates these memories to different tasks. By learning to allocate and safeguard these memories, our method effectively alleviates CF while ensuring robust extendability. Besides, we propose a comprehensive assessment protocol for multi-stage CL of NMT systems. Experiments conducted following this new protocol showcase the superior performance of F-MALLOC, evidenced by higher BLEU scores and almost zero forgetting. ",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we advance the understanding of neural network training dynamics by examining the intricate interplay of various factors introduced by weight parameters in the initialization process. Motivated by the foundational work of Luo et al. (J. Mach. Learn. Res., Vol. 22, Iss. 1, No. 71, pp 3327-3373), we explore the gradient descent dynamics of neural networks through the lens of macroscopic limits, where we analyze its behavior as width $m$ tends to infinity. Our study presents a unified approach with refined techniques designed for multi-layer fully connected neural networks, which can be readily extended to other neural network architectures. Our investigation reveals that gradient descent can rapidly drive deep neural networks to zero training loss, irrespective of the specific initialization schemes employed by weight parameters, provided that the initial scale of the output function $\\kappa$ surpasses a certain threshold. This regime, characterized as the theta-lazy area, accentuates the predominant influence of the initial scale $\\kappa$ over other factors on the training behavior of neural networks. Furthermore, our approach draws inspiration from the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) paradigm, and we expand its applicability. While NTK typically assumes that $\\lim_{m\\to\\infty}\\frac{\\log \\kappa}{\\log m}=\\frac{1}{2}$, and imposes each weight parameters to scale by the factor $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{m}}$, in our theta-lazy regime, we discard the factor and relax the conditions to $\\lim_{m\\to\\infty}\\frac{\\log \\kappa}{\\log m}>0$. Similar to NTK, the behavior of overparameterized neural networks within the theta-lazy regime trained by gradient descent can be effectively described by a specific kernel. Through rigorous analysis, our investigation illuminates the pivotal role of $\\kappa$ in governing the training dynamics of neural networks. ",

To ease the above assumption, researchers have studied a more realistic setting: out-of-distribution (OOD) detection, where test data may come from classes that are unknown during training (i.e., OOD data). Due to the unavailability and diversity of OOD data, good generalization ability is crucial for effective OOD detection algorithms, and corresponding learning theory is still an open problem. To study the generalization of OOD detection, this paper investigates the probably approximately correct (PAC) learning theory of OOD detection that fits the commonly used evaluation metrics in the literature. First, we find a necessary condition for the learnability of OOD detection. Then, using this condition, we prove several impossibility theorems for the learnability of OOD detection under some scenarios. Although the impossibility theorems are frustrating, we find that some conditions of these impossibility theorems may not hold in some practical scenarios. Based on this observation, we next give several necessary and sufficient conditions to characterize the learnability of OOD detection in some practical scenarios. Lastly, we offer theoretical support for representative OOD detection works based on our OOD theory. ",

To enable practical and widespread applications, recent advances propose to generate a clothed human from an RGB image. However, they struggle to reconstruct detailed and robust avatars simultaneously. We empirically find that the high-frequency (HF) and low-frequency (LF) information from a parametric model has the potential to enhance geometry details and improve robustness to noise, respectively. Based on this, we propose HiLo, namely clothed human reconstruction with high- and low-frequency information, which contains two components. 1) To recover detailed geometry using HF information, we propose a progressive HF Signed Distance Function to enhance the detailed 3D geometry of a clothed human. We analyze that our progressive learning manner alleviates large gradients that hinder model convergence. 2) To achieve robust reconstruction against inaccurate estimation of the parametric model by using LF information, we propose a spatial interaction implicit function. This function effectively exploits the complementary spatial information from a low-resolution voxel grid of the parametric model. Experimental results demonstrate that HiLo outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by 10.43% and 9.54% in terms of Chamfer distance on the Thuman2.0 and CAPE datasets, respectively. Additionally, HiLo demonstrates robustness to noise from the parametric model, challenging poses, and various clothing styles. ",

This study aims to develop a universal AI-generated image detector capable of identifying images from diverse sources. Existing methods struggle to generalize across unseen generative models when provided with limited sample sources. Inspired by the zero-shot transferability of pre-trained vision-language models, we seek to harness the nontrivial visual-world knowledge and descriptive proficiency of CLIP-ViT to generalize over unknown domains. This paper presents a novel parameter-efficient fine-tuning approach, mixture of low-rank experts, to fully exploit CLIP-ViT's potential while preserving knowledge and expanding capacity for transferable detection. We adapt only the MLP layers of deeper ViT blocks via an integration of shared and separate LoRAs within an MoE-based structure. Extensive experiments on public benchmarks show that our method achieves superiority over state-of-the-art approaches in cross-generator generalization and robustness to perturbations. Remarkably, our best-performing ViT-L/14 variant requires training only 0.08% of its parameters to surpass the leading baseline by +3.64% mAP and +12.72% avg.Acc across unseen diffusion and autoregressive models.

    "abstract": "Change detection, as a research hotspot in the field of remote sensing, has witnessed continuous development and progress. However, the discrimination of boundary details remains a significant bottleneck due to the complexity of surrounding elements between change areas and backgrounds. Discriminating the boundaries of large change areas results in misalignment, while connecting boundaries occurs for small change targets. To address the above issues, a novel network based on the localization-then-refinement strategy is proposed in this paper, namely LRNet. LRNet consists of two stages: localization and refinement. In the localization stage, a three-branch encoder simultaneously extracts original image features and their differential features for interactive localization of the position of each change area. To minimize information loss during feature extraction, learnable optimal pooling (LOP) is proposed to replace the widely used max-pooling. Additionally, this process is trainable and contributes to the overall optimization of the network. To effectively interact features from different branches and accurately locate change areas of various sizes, change alignment attention (C2A) and hierarchical change alignment module (HCA) are proposed. In the refinement stage, the localization results from the localization stage are corrected by constraining the change areas and change edges through the edge-area alignment module (E2A). Subsequently, the decoder, combined with the difference features strengthened by C2A in the localization phase, refines change areas of different sizes, ultimately achieving accurate boundary discrimination of change areas. The proposed LRNet outperforms 13 other state-of-the-art methods in terms of comprehensive evaluation metrics and provides the most precise boundary discrimination results on the LEVIR-CD and WHU-CD datasets.

Since the image perspective has depth ambiguity, the challenges of Mono3D lie in understanding 3D scene geometry and reconstructing 3D object information from a single image. Previous methods attempted to transfer 3D information directly from the LiDAR-based teacher to the camera-based student. However, a considerable gap in feature representation makes direct cross-modal distillation inefficient, resulting in a significant performance deterioration between the LiDAR-based teacher and the camera-based student. To address this issue, we propose the Teaching Assistant Knowledge Distillation (MonoTAKD) to break down the learning objective by integrating intra-modal distillation with cross-modal residual distillation. In particular, we employ a strong camera-based teaching assistant model to distill powerful visual knowledge effectively through intra-modal distillation. Subsequently, we introduce the cross-modal residual distillation to transfer the 3D spatial cues. By acquiring both visual knowledge and 3D spatial cues, the predictions of our approach are rigorously evaluated on the KITTI 3D object detection benchmark and achieve state-of-the-art performance in Mono3D.

Despite advancements, existing systems often miss rare cardiac anomalies that could be precursors to serious, life-threatening issues or alterations in the cardiac macro/microstructure. We address this gap by focusing on self-supervised anomaly detection (AD), training exclusively on normal ECGs to recognize deviations indicating anomalies. We introduce a novel self-supervised learning framework for ECG AD, utilizing a vast dataset of normal ECGs to autonomously detect and localize cardiac anomalies. It proposes a novel masking and restoration technique alongside a multi-scale cross-attention module, enhancing the model's ability to integrate global and local signal features. The framework emphasizes accurate localization of anomalies within ECG signals, ensuring the method's clinical relevance and reliability. To reduce the impact of individual variability, the approach further incorporates crucial patient-specific information from ECG reports, such as age and gender, thus enabling accurate identification of a broad spectrum of cardiac anomalies, including rare ones. Utilizing an extensive dataset of 478,803 ECG graphic reports from real-world clinical practice, our method has demonstrated exceptional effectiveness in AD across all tested conditions, regardless of their frequency of occurrence, significantly outperforming existing models.

    "abstract": "The emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic, followed by policy measures to combat the virus, evoked public protest movements world-wide. These movements emerged through virtual social networks as well as local protest gatherings. Prior research has studied such movements solely in the virtual space through social network analysis, thereby disregarding the role of local interaction for protest. This study, however, recognizes the importance of the geo-spatial dimension in protest movements. We therefore introduce a large-scale spatial-social network analysis of a georeferenced Twitter user network to understand the regional connections and transnational influences of the Austrian COVID-19 protest movement through the social network. Our findings reveal that the virtual network is distinctly structured along geographic and linguistic boundaries. We further find that the movement is clearly organized along national protest communities. These results highlight the importance of regional and local influencing factors over the impact of transnational influences for the protest movement. ",

    "abstract": "Chiplet-based systems, integrating various silicon dies manufactured at different integrated circuit technology nodes on a carrier interposer, have garnered significant attention in recent years due to their cost-effectiveness and competitive performance. The widespread adoption of reinforcement learning as a sequential placement method has introduced a new challenge in determining the optimal placement order for each chiplet. The order in which chiplets are placed on the interposer influences the spatial resources available for earlier and later placed chiplets, making the placement results highly sensitive to the sequence of chiplet placement. To address these challenges, we propose a learning to rank approach with graph representation, building upon the reinforcement learning framework RLPlanner. This method aims to select the optimal chiplet placement order for each chiplet-based system. Experimental results demonstrate that compared to placement order obtained solely based on the descending order of the chiplet area and the number of interconnect wires between the chiplets, utilizing the placement order obtained from the learning to rank network leads to further improvements in system temperature and inter-chiplet wirelength. Specifically, applying the top-ranked placement order obtained from the learning to rank network results in a 10.05% reduction in total inter-chiplet wirelength and a 1.01% improvement in peak system temperature during the chiplet placement process.

    "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are widely deployed in vast fields, but they often struggle to maintain accurate representations as graphs evolve. We theoretically establish a lower bound, proving that under mild conditions, representation distortion inevitably occurs over time. To estimate the temporal distortion without human annotation after deployment, one naive approach is to pre-train a recurrent model (e.g., RNN) before deployment and use this model afterwards, but the estimation is far from satisfactory. In this paper, we analyze the representation distortion from an information theory perspective, and attribute it primarily to inaccurate feature extraction during evolution. Consequently, we introduce Smart, a straightforward and effective baseline enhanced by an adaptive feature extractor through self-supervised graph reconstruction. In synthetic random graphs, we further refine the former lower bound to show the inevitable distortion over time and empirically observe that Smart achieves good estimation performance. Moreover, we observe that Smart consistently shows outstanding generalization estimation on four real-world evolving graphs. The ablation studies underscore the necessity of graph reconstruction. For example, on OGB-arXiv dataset, the estimation metric MAPE deteriorates from 2.19% to 8.00% without reconstruction. ",

In the modern context of connectivity and autonomy, routing decisions are potentially vulnerable to malicious attacks. In this paper, we consider the dynamic routing problem over parallel traffic links in the face of such threats. An attacker is capable of increasing or destabilizing traffic queues by strategic manipulating the nominally optimal routing decisions. A defender is capable of securing the correct routing decision. Attacking and defensive actions induce technological costs. The defender has no prior information about the attacker's strategy. We develop an least-square policy iteration algorithm for the defender to compute a cost-aware and threat-adaptive defensive strategy. The policy evaluation step computes a weight vector that minimizes the sampled temporal-difference error. We derive a concrete theoretical upper bound on the evaluation error based on the theory of value function approximation. The policy improvement step solves a minimax problem and thus iteratively computes the Markov perfect equilibrium of the security game. We also discuss the training error of the entire policy iteration process. ",

Specifically, we bootstrap dense synthetic captions using pre-trained VLMs to provide rich descriptions on different regions in images, and incorporate these captions to train a novel detector that generalizes to novel concepts. To mitigate the noise caused by hallucination in synthetic captions, we also propose a novel hyperbolic vision-language learning approach to impose a hierarchy between visual and caption embeddings.

Unlike previous studies that primarily focus on scenarios where all users share identical private and utility attributes and often rely on auxiliary datasets or manual annotations, we introduce a collaborative data-sharing mechanism between two user groups through a trusted third party. This third party uses adversarial privacy techniques with our proposed data-sharing mechanism to internally sanitize data for both groups and eliminates the need for manual annotation or auxiliary datasets. Our methodology ensures that private attributes cannot be accurately inferred while enabling highly accurate predictions of utility features. Importantly, even if analysts or adversaries possess auxiliary datasets containing raw data, they are unable to accurately deduce private features. Additionally, our data-sharing mechanism is compatible with various existing adversarially trained privacy techniques. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach using synthetic and real-world datasets, showcasing its ability to balance the conflicting goals of privacy and utility. ",

The primary objective is to sanitize the tabular data in such a way that it hinders existing machine learning models from accurately inferring private features while allowing models to accurately infer utility-related attributes. We explore various sanitization instructions.

This technique aims to identify a stable data representation that remains effective with out-of-distribution (OOD) data. While numerous studies have developed IRM-based methods adaptive to data augmentation scenarios, there has been limited attention on directly assessing how well these representations preserve their invariant performance under varying conditions. In our paper, we propose a novel method to evaluate invariant performance, specifically tailored for IRM-based methods. We establish a bridge between the conditional expectation of an invariant predictor across different environments through the likelihood ratio. Our proposed criterion offers a robust basis for evaluating invariant performance. We validate our approach with theoretical support and demonstrate its effectiveness through extensive numerical studies.These experiments illustrate how our method can assess the invariant performance of various representation techniques.

Utilizing the BMMR2 challenge dataset, it matches human experts in pCR prediction pre-NAC with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.76 vs. 0.796, and surpasses standard automated methods mid-NAC, with an AUC of 0.729 vs. 0.654 and 0.576.

The method effectively takes advantage of both the least squares structure and the neural network structure of the objective function. By categorizing the weights and biases of the hidden and output layers of the network as nonlinear and linear parameters, respectively, the method iterates back and forth between the nonlinear and linear parameters. The nonlinear parameters are updated by a damped Gauss-Newton method and the linear ones are updated by a linear solver. Moreover, at the Gauss-Newton step, a special form of the Gauss-Newton matrix is derived for the shallow ReLU neural network and is used for efficient iterations. It is shown that the corresponding mass and Gauss-Newton matrices in the respective linear and nonlinear steps are symmetric and positive definite under reasonable assumptions. Thus, the SgGN method naturally produces an effective search direction without the need of additional techniques like shifting in the Levenberg-Marquardt method to achieve invertibility of the Gauss-Newton matrix. The convergence and accuracy of the method are demonstrated numerically for several challenging function approximation problems, especially those with discontinuities or sharp transition layers that pose significant challenges for commonly used training algorithms in machine learning.

Despite recent efforts have been made to yield online processing capabilities, slow inference speeds of low-powered robots fail to meet the demands of real-time detection-making them impractical for autonomous exploration. Existing methods still face performance and efficiency challenges, mainly due to unreliable features and exhaustive class loops. In this work, we propose a new paradigm AirShot, and discover that, by fully exploiting the valuable correlation map, AirShot can result in a more robust and faster few-shot object detection system, which is more applicable to robotics community. The core module Top Prediction Filter (TPF) can operate on multi-scale correlation maps in both the training and inference stages. During training, TPF supervises the generation of a more representative correlation map, while during inference, it reduces looping iterations by selecting top-ranked classes, thus cutting down on computational costs with better performance. Surprisingly, this dual functionality exhibits general effectiveness and efficiency on various off-the-shelf models. Exhaustive experiments on COCO2017, VOC2014, and SubT datasets demonstrate that TPF can significantly boost the efficacy and efficiency of most off-the-shelf models, achieving up to 36.4% precision improvements along with 56.3% faster inference speed.

Such programming complexity stems from the lack of a unified abstraction layer for computing and data exchange, which forces each programming model to define its abstractions. However, with the emerging cache-coherent interconnections such as Compute Express Link, we see an opportunity to standardize such architecture heterogeneity and provide a unified programming model. We present CodeFlow, a language runtime system for heterogeneous computing. CodeFlow abstracts architecture computation in programming language runtime and utilizes CXL as a unified data exchange protocol. Workloads written in high-level languages such as C++ and Rust can be compiled to CodeFlow, which schedules different parts of the workload to suitable accelerators without requiring the developer to implement code or call APIs for specific accelerators.

Using sensitivity information, our algorithm optimizes the LinDistFlow approximation's coefficient and bias parameters to minimize discrepancies in predictions of voltage magnitudes relative to the nonlinear DistFlow model. The algorithm employs the Truncated Newton Conjugate-Gradient (TNC) optimization method to fine-tune coefficients and bias parameters during an offline training phase in order to improve the LinDistFlow approximation's accuracy in optimization applications. This improves the model's effectiveness across various system scenarios, leading to a marked improvement in predictive accuracy. Numerical results underscore the algorithm's efficacy, showcasing accuracy improvements in $L_{1}$-norm and $L_{\\infty}$-norm losses of up to $92\\%$ and $88\\%$, respectively, relative to the traditional LinDistFlow model. We assess how the optimized parameters perform under changes in the network topology and also validate the optimized LinDistFlow approximation's efficacy in a hosting capacity optimization problem.

    "abstract": "Despite achieving good performance and wide adoption, machine learning based security detection models (e.g., malware classifiers) are subject to concept drift and evasive evolution of attackers, which renders up-to-date threat data as a necessity. However, due to enforcement of various privacy protection regulations (e.g., GDPR), it is becoming increasingly challenging or even prohibitive for security vendors to collect individual-relevant and privacy-sensitive threat datasets, e.g., SMS spam/non-spam messages from mobile devices. To address such obstacles, this study systematically profiles the (in)feasibility of federated learning for privacy-preserving cyber threat detection in terms of effectiveness, byzantine resilience, and efficiency. This is made possible by the build-up of multiple threat datasets and threat detection models, and more importantly, the design of realistic and security-specific experiments. We evaluate FL on two representative threat detection tasks, namely SMS spam detection and Android malware detection. It shows that FL-trained detection models can achieve a performance that is comparable to centrally trained counterparts. Also, most non-IID data distributions have either minor or negligible impact on the model performance, while a label-based non-IID distribution of a high extent can incur non-negligible fluctuation and delay in FL training. Then, under a realistic threat model, FL turns out to be adversary-resistant to attacks of both data poisoning and model poisoning. Particularly, the attacking impact of a practical data poisoning attack is no more than 0.14\\% loss in model accuracy. Regarding FL efficiency, a bootstrapping strategy turns out to be effective to mitigate the training delay as observed in label-based non-IID scenarios. ",

    "abstract": "Anthropogenic ecological crisis constitutes a significant challenge that all within the academy must urgently face, including the Natural Language Processing (NLP) community. While recent years have seen increasing work revolving around climate-centric discourse, crucial environmental and ecological topics outside of climate change remain largely unaddressed, despite their prominent importance. Mainstream NLP tasks, such as sentiment analysis, dominate the scene, but there remains an untouched space in the literature involving the analysis of environmental impacts of certain events and practices. To address this gap, this paper presents EcoVerse, an annotated English Twitter dataset of 3,023 tweets spanning a wide spectrum of environmental topics. We propose a three-level annotation scheme designed for Eco-Relevance Classification, Stance Detection, and introducing an original approach for Environmental Impact Analysis. We detail the data collection, filtering, and labeling process that led to the creation of the dataset. Remarkable Inter-Annotator Agreement indicates that the annotation scheme produces consistent annotations of high quality. Subsequent classification experiments using BERT-based models, including ClimateBERT, are presented. These yield encouraging results, while also indicating room for a model specifically tailored for environmental texts. The dataset is made freely available to stimulate further research. ",

Our key idea is that, to track a object through frames, we can obtain multiple different association results from a model by varying the frames it can observe, i.e., skipping frames in observation. As the differences in observations do not alter the identities of objects, the obtained association results should be consistent. Based on this rationale, we generate multiple observation paths, each specifying a different set of frames to be skipped, and formulate the Path Consistency Loss that enforces the association results are consistent across different observation paths. We use the proposed loss to train our object matching model with only self-supervision. By extensive experiments on three tracking datasets (MOT17, PersonPath22, KITTI), we demonstrate that our method outperforms existing unsupervised methods with consistent margins on various evaluation metrics, and even achieves performance close to supervised methods.

    "abstract": "In various real-world applications such as machine translation, sentiment analysis, and question answering, a pivotal role is played by NLP models, facilitating efficient communication and decision-making processes in domains ranging from healthcare to finance. However, a significant challenge is posed to the robustness of these natural language processing models by text adversarial attacks. These attacks involve the deliberate manipulation of input text to mislead the predictions of the model while maintaining human interpretability. Despite the remarkable performance achieved by state-of-the-art models like BERT in various natural language processing tasks, they are found to remain vulnerable to adversarial perturbations in the input text. In addressing the vulnerability of text classifiers to adversarial attacks, three distinct attack mechanisms are explored in this paper using the victim model BERT: BERT-on-BERT attack, PWWS attack, and Fraud Bargain's Attack (FBA). Leveraging the IMDB, AG News, and SST2 datasets, a thorough comparative analysis is conducted to assess the effectiveness of these attacks on the BERT classifier model. It is revealed by the analysis that PWWS emerges as the most potent adversary, consistently outperforming other methods across multiple evaluation scenarios, thereby emphasizing its efficacy in generating adversarial examples for text classification. Through comprehensive experimentation, the performance of these attacks is assessed and the findings indicate that the PWWS attack outperforms others, demonstrating lower runtime, higher accuracy, and favorable semantic similarity scores. The key insight of this paper lies in the assessment of the relative performances of three prevalent state-of-the-art attack mechanisms. ",

    "abstract": "Due to the complexity of medical image acquisition and the difficulty of annotation, medical image datasets inevitably contain noise. Noisy data with wrong labels affects the robustness and generalization ability of deep neural networks. Previous noise learning methods mainly considered noise arising from images being mislabeled, i.e. label noise, assuming that all mislabeled images are of high image quality. However, medical images are prone to suffering extreme quality issues, i.e. data noise, where discriminative visual features are missing for disease diagnosis. In this paper, we propose a noise learning framework, termed as QMix, that learns a robust disease diagnosis model under mixed noise. QMix alternates between sample separation and quality-aware semisupervised training in each training epoch. In the sample separation phase, we design a joint uncertainty-loss criterion to effectively separate (1) correctly labeled images; (2) mislabeled images with high quality and (3) mislabeled images with low quality. In the semi-supervised training phase, we train a disease diagnosis model to learn robust feature representation from the separated samples. Specifically, we devise a sample-reweighing loss to mitigate the effect of mislabeled images with low quality during training. Meanwhile, a contrastive enhancement loss is proposed to further distinguish mislabeled images with low quality from correctly labeled images. QMix achieved state-of-the-art disease diagnosis performance on five public retinal image datasets and exhibited substantial improvement on robustness against mixed noise. ",

We investigate two state-of-the-art IP protection techniques: Quantization Watermarking and Instructional Fingerprint, along with various advanced model merging technologies, such as Task Arithmetic, TIES-MERGING, and so on. Experimental results indicate that current Large Language Model (LLM) watermarking techniques cannot survive in the merged models, whereas model fingerprinting techniques can. Our research aims to highlight that model merging should be an indispensable consideration in the robustness assessment of model IP protection techniques, thereby promoting the healthy development of the open-source LLM community.

While the time domain is superior in representing local dependencies, particularly in non-periodic series, the frequency domain excels in capturing global dependencies, making it ideal for series with evident periodic patterns. To capitalize on both of these strengths, we propose ATFNet, an innovative framework that combines a time domain module and a frequency domain module to concurrently capture local and global dependencies in time series data. Specifically, we introduce Dominant Harmonic Series Energy Weighting, a novel mechanism for dynamically adjusting the weights between the two modules based on the periodicity of the input time series. In the frequency domain module, we enhance the traditional Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) with our Extended DFT, designed to address the challenge of discrete frequency misalignment. Additionally, our Complex-valued Spectrum Attention mechanism offers a novel approach to discern the intricate relationships between different frequency combinations.

Despite subspace clustering shows impressive performance for HSI, traditional methods tend to ignore the global-local interaction in HSI data. In this study, we proposed a multi-level graph subspace contrastive learning (MLGSC) for HSI clustering. The model is divided into the following main parts. Graph convolution subspace construction: utilizing spectral and texture feautures to construct two graph convolution views. Local-global graph representation: local graph representations were obtained by step-by-step convolutions and a more representative global graph representation was obtained using an attention-based pooling strategy. Multi-level graph subspace contrastive learning: multi-level contrastive learning was conducted to obtain local-global joint graph representations, to improve the consistency of the positive samples between views, and to obtain more robust graph embeddings. Specifically, graph-level contrastive learning is used to better learn global representations of HSI data. Node-level intra-view and inter-view contrastive learning is designed to learn joint representations of local regions of HSI. The proposed model is evaluated on four popular HSI datasets: Indian Pines, Pavia University, Houston, and Xu Zhou. The overall accuracies are 97.75%, 99.96%, 92.28%, and 95.73%, which significantly outperforms the current state-of-the-art clustering methods. ",

These represent distinct forms of distributional shifts that can significantly impact DNNs' reliability and robustness. Traditionally, research has addressed OOD detection and adversarial robustness as separate challenges. This survey focuses on the intersection of these two areas, examining how the research community has investigated them together. Consequently, we identify two key research directions: robust OOD detection and unified robustness. Robust OOD detection aims to differentiate between in-distribution (ID) data and OOD data, even when they are adversarially manipulated to deceive the OOD detector. Unified robustness seeks a single approach to make DNNs robust against both adversarial attacks and OOD inputs. Accordingly, first, we establish a taxonomy based on the concept of distributional shifts. This framework clarifies how robust OOD detection and unified robustness relate to other research areas addressing distributional shifts, such as OOD detection, open set recognition, and anomaly detection. Subsequently, we review existing work on robust OOD detection and unified robustness. Finally, we highlight the limitations of the existing work and propose promising research directions that explore adversarial and OOD inputs within a unified framework. ",

To address the above problem, this paper proposes a one-class prompt learning method for few-shot anomaly detection, termed PromptAD. First, we propose semantic concatenation which can transpose normal prompts into anomaly prompts by concatenating normal prompts with anomaly suffixes, thus constructing a large number of negative samples used to guide prompt learning in one-class setting. Furthermore, to mitigate the training challenge caused by the absence of anomaly images, we introduce the concept of explicit anomaly margin, which is used to explicitly control the margin between normal prompt features and anomaly prompt features through a hyper-parameter. For image-level/pixel-level anomaly detection, PromptAD achieves first place in 11/12 few-shot settings on MVTec and VisA. ",

To successfully stylize a scene this way, one must first reconstruct a photo-realistic radiance field from collected images of the scene. However, when only sparse input views are available, pre-trained few-shot NeRFs often suffer from high-frequency artifacts, which are generated as a by-product of high-frequency details for improving reconstruction quality. Is it possible to generate more faithful stylized scenes from sparse inputs by directly optimizing encoding-based scene representation with target style? In this paper, we consider the stylization of sparse-view scenes in terms of disentangling content semantics and style textures. We propose a coarse-to-fine sparse-view scene stylization framework, where a novel hierarchical encoding-based neural representation is designed to generate high-quality stylized scenes directly from implicit scene representations. We also propose a new optimization strategy with content strength annealing to achieve realistic stylization and better content preservation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method can achieve high-quality stylization of sparse-view scenes and outperforms fine-tuning-based baselines in terms of stylization quality and efficiency.

However this definition has changed to computational propaganda, the way manipulation takes place in digital medium. Computational propaganda is the use of algorithms, automation and human curation to purposefully distribute misleading information over social media networks to manipulate public opinion, for political polarization etc. Digital media platforms have introduced new modalities of propaganda such as the use of social bots and state-organized 'troll armies' for social astroturfing to simulate public support or opposition towards a particular topic. Along with this digital media has blurred the line between different forms of propaganda. Hence existing conceptual and epistemological frameworks in propaganda studies need a revision. One of the methods to detect the computational propaganda is to identify automation and bots. Many supervised machine learning based frameworks have been proposed for bot detection but these systems can only identify single accounts, not the coordinated activities of botnets and also these systems depend on the data structure provided by the social media platforms. Similarly, current systems have not included the image features in their detection system. Most of the systems are mainly built for Twitter while there are still uncharted areas of research in other social media platforms. Therefore, there are many unexplored research questions and methods in bot detection systems. ",

To address this, we propose a novel synthetic dataset creation (SDC) strategy that leverages information from reviews as well as additional sources for selecting one of the reviews as a pseudo-summary to enable supervised training. Our Multi-Encoder Decoder framework for Opinion Summarization (MEDOS) employs a separate encoder for each source, enabling effective selection of information while generating the summary.

Experiments across nine test sets demonstrate that the combination of our SDC approach and MEDOS model achieves on average a 14.5% improvement in ROUGE-1 F1 over the SOTA. Moreover, comparative analysis underlines the significance of incorporating additional sources for generating more informative summaries. Human evaluations further indicate that MEDOS scores relatively higher in coherence and fluency with 0.41 and 0.5 (-1 to 1) respectively, compared to existing models.

We demonstrate that many-valued (MV) logic, specifically Lukasiewicz propositional logic, constitutes a suitable language for characterizing general CA as logical machines. This is done by interpolating CA transition functions to continuous piecewise linear functions, which, by virtue of the McNaughton theorem, yield formulae in MV logic characterizing the CA. Recognizing that deep rectified linear unit (ReLU) networks realize continuous piecewise linear functions, it follows that these formulae are naturally extracted from CA evolution traces by deep ReLU networks.

Finally, 24 items with largely varying geometries are grasped in a constrained environment with a success rate of 93\\%. We demonstrate the hand-object self-organization behavior underlines this extreme robustness, where the hand automatically exhibits different grasp types depending on object geometries. Furthermore, the robot grasp type mimics a natural human grasp with a direct similarity of 68\\%. ",

    "abstract": "3D object detection based on roadside cameras is an additional way for autonomous driving to alleviate the challenges of occlusion and short perception range from vehicle cameras. Previous methods for roadside 3D object detection mainly focus on modeling the depth or height of objects, neglecting the stationary of cameras and the characteristic of inter-frame consistency. In this work, we propose a novel framework, namely MOSE, for MOnocular 3D object detection with Scene cuEs. The scene cues are the frame-invariant scene-specific features, which are crucial for object localization and can be intuitively regarded as the height between the surface of the real road and the virtual ground plane. In the proposed framework, a scene cue bank is designed to aggregate scene cues from multiple frames of the same scene with a carefully designed extrinsic augmentation strategy. Then, a transformer-based decoder lifts the aggregated scene cues as well as the 3D position embeddings for 3D object location, which boosts generalization ability in heterologous scenes. The extensive experiment results on two public benchmarks demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of the proposed method, which surpasses the existing methods by a large margin. ",

    "abstract": "Communication and computation services supporting Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAVs) are characterized by stringent requirements, in terms of response time and reliability. Fulfilling these requirements is crucial for ensuring road safety and traffic optimization. The conceptually simple solution of hosting these services in the vehicles increases their cost (mainly due to the installation and maintenance of computation infrastructure) and may drain their battery excessively. Such disadvantages can be tackled via Multi-Access Edge Computing (MEC), consisting in deploying computation capability in network nodes deployed close to the devices (vehicles in this case), such as to satisfy the stringent CAV requirements. However, it is not yet clear under which conditions MEC can support CAV requirements and for which services. To shed light on this question, we conduct a simulation campaign using well-known open-source simulation tools, namely OMNeT++, Simu5G, Veins, INET, and SUMO. We are thus able to provide a reality check on MEC for CAV, pinpointing what are the computation capacities that must be installed in the MEC, to support the different services, and the amount of vehicles that a single MEC node can support. We find that such parameters must vary a lot, depending on the service considered. This study can serve as a preliminary basis for network operators to plan future deployment of MEC to support CAV.

    "abstract": "Decentralized Finance enables many novel applications that were impossible in traditional finances. However, it also introduces new types of vulnerabilities, such as composability bugs. The composability bugs refer to issues that lead to erroneous behaviors when multiple smart contracts operate together. One typical example of composability bugs is those between token contracts and Constant Product Market Makers (CPMM), the most widely used model for Decentralized Exchanges. Since 2022, 23 exploits of such kind have resulted in a total loss of 2.2M USD. BlockSec, a smart contract auditing company, once reported that 138 exploits of such kind occurred just in February 2023. We propose CPMM-Exploiter, which automatically detects and generates end-to-end exploits for CPMM composability bugs. Generating such end-to-end exploits is challenging due to the large search space of multiple contracts and various fees involved with financial services. To tackle this, we investigated real-world exploits regarding these vulnerabilities and identified that they arise due to violating two safety invariants. Based on this observation, we implemented CPMM-Exploiter, a new grammar-based fuzzer targeting the detection of these bugs. CPMM-Exploiter uses fuzzing to find transactions that break the invariants. It then refines these transactions to make them profitable for the attacker. We evaluated CPMM-Exploiter on two real-world exploit datasets. CPMM-Exploiter obtained recalls of 0.91 and 0.89, respectively, while five baselines achieved maximum recalls of 0.36 and 0.58, respectively. We further evaluated CPMM-Exploiter by running it on the latest blocks of the Ethereum and Binance networks. It successfully generated 18 new exploits, which can result in 12.9K USD profit in total.

    "abstract": "Adapting to concept drift is a challenging task in machine learning, which is usually tackled using incremental learning techniques that periodically re-fit a learning model leveraging newly available data. A primary limitation of these techniques is their reliance on substantial amounts of data for retraining. The necessity of acquiring fresh data introduces temporal delays prior to retraining, potentially rendering the models inaccurate if a sudden concept drift occurs in-between two consecutive retrainings. In communication networks, such issue emerges when performing traffic forecasting following a~failure event: post-failure re-routing may induce a drastic shift in distribution and pattern of traffic data, thus requiring a timely model adaptation. In this work, we address this challenge for the problem of traffic forecasting and propose an approach that exploits adaptive learning algorithms, namely, liquid neural networks, which are capable of self-adaptation to abrupt changes in data patterns without requiring any retraining. Through extensive simulations of failure scenarios, we compare the predictive performance of our proposed approach to that of a reference method based on incremental learning. Experimental results show that our proposed approach outperforms incremental learning-based methods in situations where the shifts in traffic patterns are drastic. ",

In particular, modern 4D imaging radars provide target responses across the range, vertical angle, horizontal angle and Doppler velocity dimensions.

Sparse attacks aim to discover a minimum number-the l0 bounded-perturbations to model inputs to craft adversarial examples and misguide model decisions. But, in contrast to query-based dense attack counterparts against black-box models, constructing sparse adversarial perturbations, even when models serve confidence score information to queries in a score-based setting, is non-trivial. Because, such an attack leads to i) an NP-hard problem; and ii) a non-differentiable search space. We develop the BruSLeAttack-a new, faster (more query-efficient) Bayesian algorithm for the problem. We conduct extensive attack evaluations including an attack demonstration against a Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS) offering exemplified by Google Cloud Vision and robustness testing of adversarial training regimes and a recent defense against black-box attacks. The proposed attack scales to achieve state-of-the-art attack success rates and query efficiency on standard computer vision tasks such as ImageNet across different model architectures.

However, little is known about the security implications of RSP, e.g., what illicit promotion campaigns are being distributed by RSP, and to what extent regular search users can be exposed to illicit promotion texts distributed by RSP. In this study, we conduct the first security study on RSP-based illicit promotion, which is made possible through an end-to-end methodology for capturing, analyzing, and infiltrating IPTs. As a result, IPTs distributed via RSP are found to be large-scale, continuously growing, and diverse in both illicit categories and natural languages. Particularly, we have identified over 11 million distinct IPTs belonging to 14 different illicit categories, with typical examples including drug trading, data theft, counterfeit goods, and hacking services. Also, the underlying RSP cases have abused tens of thousands of high-ranking websites, as well as extensively poisoning all four popular search engines we studied, especially Google Search and Bing. Furthermore, it is observed that benign search users are being exposed to IPTs at a concerning extent. To facilitate interaction with potential customers (victim search users), miscreants tend to embed various types of contacts in IPTs, especially instant messaging accounts. Further infiltration of these IPT contacts reveals that the underlying illicit campaigns are operated on a large scale. All these findings highlight the negative security implications of IPTs and RSPs, and thus call for more efforts to mitigate RSP-driven illicit promotion. ",

While for feature extraction in a video game typically the whole image is used, this is hardly practical for many real world games. Instead, using a smaller game state reducing the dimension of the parameter space to include essential parameters only seems to be a promising approach. In the game of Foosball, a compact and comprehensive game state description consists of the positional shifts and rotations of the figures and the position of the ball over time. In particular, velocities and accelerations can be derived from consecutive time samples of the game state. In this paper, a figure detection system to determine the game state in Foosball is presented. We capture a dataset containing the rotations of the rods which were measured using accelerometers and the positional shifts were derived using traditional Computer Vision techniques (in a laboratory setting). This dataset is utilized to train Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based end-to-end regression models to predict the rotations and shifts of each rod. We present an evaluation of our system using different state-of-the-art CNNs as base architectures for the regression model. We show that our system is able to predict the game state with high accuracy.

One current challenge is to address hand-to-hand interaction where self-occlusions and finger articulation pose a significant problem to estimation. Little work has applied physical constraints that minimize the hand intersections that occur as a result of noisy estimation. This work addresses the intersection of hands by exploiting an occupancy network that represents the hand's volume as a continuous manifold. This allows us to model the probability distribution of points being inside a hand. We designed an intersection loss function to minimize the likelihood of hand-to-point intersections. Moreover, we propose a new hand mesh parameterization that is superior to the commonly used MANO model in many respects including lower mesh complexity, underlying 3D skeleton extraction, watertightness, etc. On the benchmark InterHand2.6M dataset, the models trained using our intersection loss achieve better results than the state-of-the-art by significantly decreasing the number of hand intersections while lowering the mean per-joint positional error. Additionally, we demonstrate superior performance for 3D hand uplift on Re:InterHand and SMILE datasets and show reduced hand-to-hand intersections for complex domains such as sign-language pose estimation.

    "abstract": "To reap the active and passive beamforming gain in an intelligent reflecting surface (IRS)-aided wireless network, a typical way is to first acquire the channel state information (CSI) relying on the pilot signal, and then perform the joint beamforming design. However, it is a great challenge when the receiver can neither send pilot signals nor have complex signal processing capabilities due to its hardware limitation. To tackle this problem, we study in this paper an IRS-aided wireless energy transfer (WET) network and propose two joint beamforming design methods, namely, the channel-estimationbased method and the distributed-beamforming-based method, that require only one-bit feedback from the energy receiver (ER) to the energy transmitter (ET). Specifically, for the channelestimation-based method, according to the feedback information, the ET is able to infer the cascaded ET-IRS-ER channel by continually adjusting its transmit beamformer while applying the analytic center cutting plane method (ACCPM). Then, based on the estimated cascaded CSI, the joint beamforming design can be performed by using the existing optimization techniques. While for the distributed-beamforming-based method, we first apply the distributed beamforming algorithm to optimize the IRS reflection coefficients, which is theoretically proven to converge to a local optimum almost surely. Then, the optimal ET's transmit covariance matrix is obtained based on the effective ET-ER channel learned by applying the ACCPM only once. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed one-bitfeedback-based joint beamforming design schemes while greatly reducing the requirement on the hardware complexity of the ER. In particular, the high accuracy of our IRS-involved cascaded channel estimation method exploiting one-bit feedback is also validated. ",

Traditional path planning algorithms, which are heavily reliant on static rules and manually defined parameters, often fall short in such contexts, highlighting the need for more adaptive, learning-based approaches. Among these, behavior cloning emerges as a noteworthy strategy for its simplicity and efficiency, especially within the realm of end-to-end path planning. However, behavior cloning faces challenges, such as covariate shift when employing traditional Manhattan distance as the metric. Addressing this, our study introduces the novel concept of Residual Chain Loss. Residual Chain Loss dynamically adjusts the loss calculation process to enhance the temporal dependency and accuracy of predicted path points, significantly improving the model's performance without additional computational overhead. Through testing on the nuScenes dataset, we underscore the method's substantial advancements in addressing covariate shift, facilitating dynamic loss adjustments, and ensuring seamless integration with end-to-end path planning frameworks. Our findings highlight the potential of Residual Chain Loss to revolutionize planning component of autonomous driving systems, marking a significant step forward in the quest for level 5 autonomous driving system.

    "abstract": "Behavioural types provide a promising way to achieve lightweight, language-integrated verification for communication-centric software. However, a large barrier to the adoption of behavioural types is that the current state of the art expects software to be written using the same tools and typing discipline throughout a system, and has little support for components over which a developer has no control. This position paper describes the outcomes of a working group discussion at Dagstuhl Seminar 24051 (Next-Generation Protocols for Heterogeneous Systems). We propose a methodology for integrating multiple behaviourally-typed components, written in different languages. Our proposed approach involves an extensible protocol description language, a session IR that can describe data transformations and boundary monitoring and which can be compiled into program-specific session proxies, and finally a session middleware to aid session establishment. We hope that this position paper will stimulate discussion on one of the most pressing challenges facing the widespread adoption of behavioural typing. ",

While direct motion capture is expensive and slow, motion editing/generation is also non-trivial, as complex contact patterns with topological and geometric constraints have to be retained. To this end, we propose a new deep learning method for two-body skeletal interaction motion augmentation, which can generate variations of contact-rich interactions with varying body sizes and proportions while retaining the key geometric/topological relations between two bodies. Our system can learn effectively from a relatively small amount of data and generalize to drastically different skeleton sizes. Through exhaustive evaluation and comparison, we show it can generate high-quality motions, has strong generalizability and outperforms traditional optimization-based methods and alternative deep learning solutions.

RLHF requires a large number of preference pairs as training data, which are often used in both the Supervised Fine-Tuning and Reward Model training, and therefore publicly available datasets are commonly used. In this work, we study to what extent a malicious actor can manipulate the LMs generations by poisoning the preferences, i.e., injecting poisonous preference pairs into these datasets and the RLHF training process. We propose strategies to build poisonous preference pairs and test their performance by poisoning two widely used preference datasets. Our results show that preference poisoning is highly effective: by injecting a small amount of poisonous data (1-5% of the original dataset), we can effectively manipulate the LM to generate a target entity in a target sentiment (positive or negative). The findings from our experiments also shed light on strategies to defend against the preference poisoning attack. ",

    "abstract": "A long-standing and formidable challenge faced by all conservative schemes for relativistic magnetohydrodynamics (RMHD) is the recovery of primitive variables from conservative ones. This process involves solving highly nonlinear equations subject to physical constraints. An ideal solver should be \"robust, accurate, and fast -- it is at the heart of all conservative RMHD schemes,\" as emphasized in [S.C. Noble et al., ApJ, 641:626-637, 2006]. Despite over three decades of research, seeking efficient solvers that can provably guarantee stability and convergence remains an open problem. This paper presents the first theoretical analysis for designing a robust, physical-constraint-preserving (PCP), and provably (quadratically) convergent Newton-Raphson (NR) method for primitive variable recovery in RMHD. Our key innovation is a unified approach for the initial guess, devised based on sophisticated analysis. It ensures that the NR iteration consistently converges and adheres to physical constraints. Given the extreme nonlinearity and complexity of the iterative function, the theoretical analysis is highly nontrivial and technical. We discover a pivotal inequality for delineating the convexity and concavity of the iterative function and establish theories to guarantee the PCP property and convergence. We also develop theories to determine a computable initial guess within a theoretical \"safe\" interval. Intriguingly, we find that the unique positive root of a cubic polynomial always falls within this interval. Our PCP NR method is versatile and can be seamlessly integrated into any RMHD scheme that requires the recovery of primitive variables, potentially leading to a broad impact in this field. As an application, we incorporate it into a discontinuous Galerkin method, resulting in fully PCP schemes. Several numerical experiments demonstrate the efficiency and robustness of the PCP NR method. ",

To ensure the quality of the former dataset, a meticulous three-stage labeling process was conducted, and kappa measures were computed to assess inter-annotator agreement. Furthermore, experiments were performed on the dataset using state-of-the-art language models, both with and without employing masked language modeling techniques, as well as machine learning algorithms, in order to establish the baselines for the dataset using contemporary cutting-edge approaches.

Higher-level tasks, such as understanding the interactions and social activities among individuals, are also crucial. Progress towards models that can fully understand scenes involving multiple people is hindered by a lack of sufficient annotated data for such high-level tasks. To address this challenge, we introduce Social-MAE, a simple yet effective transformer-based masked autoencoder framework for multi-person human motion data. The framework uses masked modeling to pre-train the encoder to reconstruct masked human joint trajectories, enabling it to learn generalizable and data efficient representations of motion in human crowded scenes. Social-MAE comprises a transformer as the MAE encoder and a lighter-weight transformer as the MAE decoder which operates on multi-person joints' trajectory in the frequency domain. After the reconstruction task, the MAE decoder is replaced with a task-specific decoder and the model is fine-tuned end-to-end for a variety of high-level social tasks. Our proposed model combined with our pre-training approach achieves the state-of-the-art results on various high-level social tasks, including multi-person pose forecasting, social grouping, and social action understanding. These improvements are demonstrated across four popular multi-person datasets encompassing both human 2D and 3D body pose. ",

We conduct the first systematic study of this effect and reveal that existing data pruning algorithms can produce highly biased classifiers. At the same time, we argue that random data pruning with appropriate class ratios has potential to improve the worst-class performance. We propose a \"fairness-aware\" approach to pruning and empirically demonstrate its performance on standard computer vision benchmarks. In sharp contrast to existing algorithms, our proposed method continues improving robustness at a tolerable drop of average performance as we prune more from the datasets. We present theoretical analysis of the classification risk in a mixture of Gaussians to further motivate our algorithm and support our findings. ",

While research in Deepfake detection has grown rapidly in response, many detection methods struggle with unseen Deepfakes generated by new synthesis techniques.

Inspired by the recent advances of parameter efficient fine-tuning, we propose a novel side-network-based decoder to extract spatial and temporal cues from the given video clip, with the promotion of the Facial Component Guidance (FCG) to guidencourage the spatial feature to include features of key facial parts for more robust and general Deepfake detection. Through extensive cross-dataset evaluations, our approach exhibits superior effectiveness in identifying unseen Deepfake samples, achieving notable performance improvementsuccess even with limited training samples and manipulation types. Our model secures an average performance enhancement of 0.9% AUROC in cross-dataset assessments comparing with state-of-the-art methods, especiallytablishing a significant lead of achieving 4.4% improvement on the challenging DFDC dataset.

Furthermore, the architecture is inherently explainable, providing insights into the decision process for each classification, helping experts understand and validate model predictions.

Based on HTTP/2 and Protocol Buffers, it provides highly performant, standardized, and polyglot communication across loosely coupled microservices and is increasingly preferred over REST- or GraphQL-based service APIs in practice. Despite its widespread adoption, gRPC lacks any advanced privacy techniques beyond transport encryption and basic token-based authentication. Such advanced techniques are, however, increasingly important for fulfilling regulatory requirements. For instance, anonymizing or otherwise minimizing (personal) data before responding to requests, or pre-processing data based on the purpose of the access may be crucial in certain usecases. In this paper, we therefore propose a novel approach for integrating such advanced privacy techniques into the gRPC framework in a practically viable way. Specifically, we present a general approach along with a working prototype that implements privacy techniques, such as data minimization and purpose limitation, in a configurable, extensible, and gRPC-native way utilizing a gRPC interceptor. We also showcase how to integrate this contribution into a realistic example of a food delivery use case. Alongside these implementations, a preliminary performance evaluation shows practical applicability with reasonable overheads. Altogether, we present a viable solution for integrating advanced privacy techniques into real-world gRPC-based microservice architectures, thereby facilitating regulatory compliance ``by design''.

We then use the physics-informed neural networks and stochastic gradient descent methods to learn the tensor networks. One essential step is to determine a proper truncated bounded domain or numerical support for the Fokker-Planck equation.

In this paper, we conduct a first-time analysis of the impact of the quantization pipeline components that can incorporate robust optimization under the settings of Post-Training Quantization and Quantization-Aware Training.

    "abstract": "Human brains image complicated scenes when reading a novel. Replicating this imagination is one of the ultimate goals of AI-Generated Content (AIGC). However, current AIGC methods, such as score-based diffusion, are still deficient in terms of rapidity and efficiency. This deficiency is rooted in the difference between the brain and digital computers. Digital computers have physically separated storage and processing units, resulting in frequent data transfers during iterative calculations, incurring large time and energy overheads. This issue is further intensified by the conversion of inherently continuous and analog generation dynamics, which can be formulated by neural differential equations, into discrete and digital operations. Inspired by the brain, we propose a time-continuous and analog in-memory neural differential equation solver for score-based diffusion, employing emerging resistive memory. The integration of storage and computation within resistive memory synapses surmount the von Neumann bottleneck, benefiting the generative speed and energy efficiency. The closed-loop feedback integrator is time-continuous, analog, and compact, physically implementing an infinite-depth neural network. Moreover, the software-hardware co-design is intrinsically robust to analog noise. We experimentally validate our solution with 180 nm resistive memory in-memory computing macros. Demonstrating equivalent generative quality to the software baseline, our system achieved remarkable enhancements in generative speed for both unconditional and conditional generation tasks, by factors of 64.8 and 156.5, respectively. Moreover, it accomplished reductions in energy consumption by factors of 5.2 and 4.1. Our approach heralds a new horizon for hardware solutions in edge computing for generative AI applications. ",

Much operating experience information pertains to failure events and is stored as reports containing unstructured data, such as narratives. Event reports are essential for understanding how failures are initiated and propagated, including the numerous causal relations involved. Causal relation extraction using deep learning represents a significant frontier in the field of natural language processing (NLP), and is crucial since it enables the interpretation of intricate narratives and connections contained within vast amounts of written information. This paper proposed a hybrid framework for causality detection and extraction from nuclear licensee event reports.

    "abstract": "While recent advances in 3D-aware Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have aided the development of near-frontal view human face synthesis, the challenge of comprehensively synthesizing a full 3D head viewable from all angles still persists. Although PanoHead proves the possibilities of using a large-scale dataset with images of both frontal and back views for full-head synthesis, it often causes artifacts for back views. Based on our in-depth analysis, we found the reasons are mainly twofold. First, from network architecture perspective, we found each plane in the utilized tri-plane/tri-grid representation space tends to confuse the features from both sides, causing \"mirroring\" artifacts (e.g., the glasses appear in the back). Second, from data supervision aspect, we found that existing discriminator training in 3D GANs mainly focuses on the quality of the rendered image itself, and does not care much about its plausibility with the perspective from which it was rendered. This makes it possible to generate \"face\" in non-frontal views, due to its easiness to fool the discriminator. In response, we propose SphereHead, a novel tri-plane representation in the spherical coordinate system that fits the human head's geometric characteristics and efficiently mitigates many of the generated artifacts. We further introduce a view-image consistency loss for the discriminator to emphasize the correspondence of the camera parameters and the images. The combination of these efforts results in visually superior outcomes with significantly fewer artifacts. Our code and dataset are publicly available at https://lhyfst.github.io/spherehead. ",

Previous approaches improve the generalization ability to expand the knowledge of the detector, using 'positive' pseudo-labels with additional 'class' names, e.g., sock, iPod, and alligator. To extend the previous methods in two aspects, we propose Retrieval-Augmented Losses and visual Features (RALF). Our method retrieves related 'negative' classes and augments loss functions. Also, visual features are augmented with 'verbalized concepts' of classes, e.g., worn on the feet, handheld music player, and sharp teeth. Specifically, RALF consists of two modules: Retrieval Augmented Losses (RAL) and Retrieval-Augmented visual Features (RAF). RAL constitutes two losses reflecting the semantic similarity with negative vocabularies. In addition, RAF augments visual features with the verbalized concepts from a large language model (LLM). Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of RALF on COCO and LVIS benchmark datasets. We achieve improvement up to 3.4 box AP$_{50}^{\\text{N}}$ on novel categories of the COCO dataset and 3.6 mask AP$_{\\text{r}}$ gains on the LVIS dataset.

    "abstract": "ML is shifting from the cloud to the edge. Edge computing reduces the surface exposing private data and enables reliable throughput guarantees in real-time applications. Of the panoply of devices deployed at the edge, resource-constrained MCUs, e.g., Arm Cortex-M, are more prevalent, orders of magnitude cheaper, and less power-hungry than application processors or GPUs. Thus, enabling intelligence at the deep edge is the zeitgeist, with researchers focusing on unveiling novel approaches to deploy ANNs on these constrained devices. Quantization is a well-established technique that has proved effective in enabling the deployment of neural networks on MCUs; however, it is still an open question to understand the robustness of QNNs in the face of adversarial examples. To fill this gap, we empirically evaluate the effectiveness of attacks and defenses from (full-precision) ANNs on (constrained) QNNs. Our evaluation includes three QNNs targeting TinyML applications, ten attacks, and six defenses. With this study, we draw a set of interesting findings. First, quantization increases the point distance to the decision boundary and leads the gradient estimated by some attacks to explode or vanish. Second, quantization can act as a noise attenuator or amplifier, depending on the noise magnitude, and causes gradient misalignment. Regarding adversarial defenses, we conclude that input pre-processing defenses show impressive results on small perturbations; however, they fall short as the perturbation increases. At the same time, train-based defenses increase the average point distance to the decision boundary, which holds after quantization. However, we argue that train-based defenses still need to smooth the quantization-shift and gradient misalignment phenomenons to counteract adversarial example transferability to QNNs. All artifacts are open-sourced to enable independent validation of results. ",

Despite the advancements brought about by Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), their performance in segmentation tasks is hindered by challenges such as limited availability of labeled data, class imbalance and the inherent variability and complexity of satellite images. In order to mitigate those issues, our study explores the effectiveness of a Cut-and-Paste augmentation technique for semantic segmentation in satellite images. We adapt this augmentation, which usually requires labeled instances, to the case of semantic segmentation. By leveraging the connected components in the semantic segmentation labels, we extract instances that are then randomly pasted during training. Using the DynamicEarthNet dataset and a U-Net model for evaluation, we found that this augmentation significantly enhances the mIoU score on the test set from 37.9 to 44.1. This finding highlights the potential of the Cut-and-Paste augmentation to improve the generalization capabilities of semantic segmentation models in satellite imagery. ",

Neural network malware classification systems are key tools for combating these threats but are vulnerable to adversarial machine learning attacks.

Existing defenses often rely on enhancing the training process, thereby increasing the model's robustness to these perturbations, which is quantified using verification. While training improvements are necessary, we propose focusing on the verification process used to evaluate improvements to training. As such, we present a case study that evaluates a novel verification domain that will help to ensure tangible safeguards against adversaries and provide a more reliable means of evaluating the robustness and effectiveness of anti-malware systems. To do so, we describe malware classification and two types of common malware datasets (feature and image datasets), demonstrate the certified robustness accuracy of malware classifiers using the Neural Network Verification (NNV) and Neural Network Enumeration (nnenum) tools, and outline the challenges and future considerations necessary for the improvement and refinement of the verification of malware classification. By evaluating this novel domain as a case study, we hope to increase its visibility, encourage further research and scrutiny, and ultimately enhance the resilience of digital systems against malicious attacks.

Simulation results demonstrate our method's superior performance over existing approaches, particularly in complex, long time-horizon scenarios. It remains effective in small-sample, short-duration contexts, matching the performance of asymptotically efficient estimators.

    "abstract": "Tensor clustering has become an important topic, specifically in spatio-temporal modeling, due to its ability to cluster spatial modes (e.g., stations or road segments) and temporal modes (e.g., time of the day or day of the week). Our motivating example is from subway passenger flow modeling, where similarities between stations are commonly found. However, the challenges lie in the innate high-dimensionality of tensors and also the potential existence of anomalies. This is because the three tasks, i.e., dimension reduction, clustering, and anomaly decomposition, are inter-correlated to each other, and treating them in a separate manner will render a suboptimal performance. Thus, in this work, we design a tensor-based subspace clustering and anomaly decomposition technique for simultaneously outlier-robust dimension reduction and clustering for high-dimensional tensors. To achieve this, a novel low-rank robust subspace clustering decomposition model is proposed by combining Tucker decomposition, sparse anomaly decomposition, and subspace clustering. An effective algorithm based on Block Coordinate Descent is proposed to update the parameters. Prudent experiments prove the effectiveness of the proposed framework via the simulation study, with a gain of +25% clustering accuracy than benchmark methods in a hard case. The interrelations of the three tasks are also analyzed via ablation studies, validating the interrelation assumption. Moreover, a case study in the station clustering based on real passenger flow data is conducted, with quite valuable insights discovered. ",

    "abstract": "Algorithms are increasingly used to guide high-stakes decisions about individuals. Consequently, substantial interest has developed around defining and measuring the ``fairness'' of these algorithms. These definitions of fair algorithms share two features: First, they prioritize the role of a pre-defined group identity (e.g., race or gender) by focusing on how the algorithm's impact differs systematically across groups. Second, they are statistical in nature; for example, comparing false positive rates, or assessing whether group identity is independent of the decision (where both are viewed as random variables). These notions are facially distinct from a social welfare approach to fairness, in particular one based on ``veil of ignorance'' thought experiments in which individuals choose how to structure society prior to the realization of their social identity. In this paper, we seek to understand and organize the relationship between these different approaches to fairness. Can the optimization criteria proposed in the algorithmic fairness literature also be motivated as the choices of someone from behind the veil of ignorance? If not, what properties distinguish either approach to fairness? ",

Our Bayesian Additive Regression Networks (BARN) provide more consistent and often more accurate results. On test data benchmarks, BARN averaged between 5 to 20 percent lower root mean square error. This error performance does come at the cost, however, of greater computation time. BARN sometimes takes on the order of a minute where competing methods take a second or less. But, BARN without cross-validated hyperparameter tuning takes about the same amount of computation time as tuned other methods. Yet BARN is still typically more accurate. ",

When demand is nonparametric with some mild assumptions, Miao and Wang (2021) is the first paper which proposes an algorithm with $O(\\text{poly}(N,M,\\ln(T))\\sqrt{T})$ type of regret (in particular, $\\tilde O(N^{3.5}\\sqrt{T})$ plus additional high-order terms that are $o(\\sqrt{T})$ with sufficiently large $T\\gg N$). In this paper, we improve the previous result by proposing a primal-dual optimization algorithm which is not only more practical, but also with an improved regret of $\\tilde O(N^{3.25}\\sqrt{T})$ free from additional high-order terms. A key technical contribution of the proposed algorithm is the so-called demand balancing, which pairs the primal solution (i.e., the price) in each time period with another price to offset the violation of complementary slackness on resource inventory constraints. Numerical experiments compared with several benchmark algorithms further illustrate the effectiveness of our algorithm. ",

Recent studies have, however, cast doubt about underlying assumptions relating shape and intrinsic kinematic misalignment. In this work, we aim to recover the 3D shape of individual galaxies using their projected stellar kinematic and flux distributions using a supervised machine learning approach with mixture density network (MDN). Using a mock dataset of the EAGLE hydrodynamical cosmological simulation, we train the MDN model for a carefully selected set of common kinematic and photometric parameters. Compared to previous methods, we demonstrate potential improvements achieved with the MDN model to retrieve the 3D galaxy shape along with the uncertainties, especially for prolate and triaxial systems. We make specific recommendations for recovering galaxy intrinsic shapes relevant for current and future integral field spectroscopic galaxy surveys. ",

Conclusion: Thus, it can be stated that not all state-of art CNN models can be used on B/W images. In conclusion not all state-of-art CNN models can be used on B/W images. ",

    "abstract": "In recent years, large-scale adoption of cloud storage solutions has revolutionized the way we think about digital data storage. However, the exponential increase in data volume, especially images, has raised environmental concerns regarding power and resource consumption, as well as the rising digital carbon footprint emissions. The aim of this research is to propose a methodology for cloud-based image storage by integrating image compression technology with SuperResolution Generative Adversarial Networks (SRGAN). Rather than storing images in their original format directly on the cloud, our approach involves initially reducing the image size through compression and downsizing techniques before storage. Upon request, these compressed images will be retrieved and processed by SRGAN to generate images. The efficacy of the proposed method is evaluated in terms of PSNR and SSIM metrics. Additionally, a mathematical analysis is given to calculate power consumption and carbon footprint assesment. The proposed data compression technique provides a significant solution to achieve a reasonable trade off between environmental sustainability and industrial efficiency. ",

We claim novelty on four counts. First, it is demonstrated that the hyperbolic clusters resemble the topological network communities more closely than the Euclidean clusters. Second, we are able to clearly distinguish between periods of market stability and volatility through a statistical analysis of hyperbolic distance and hyperbolic shortest path distance corresponding to the embedded network. Third, we demonstrate that using the modularity of the embedded network significant market changes can be spotted early. Lastly, the coalescent embedding is able to segregate the certain market sectors thereby underscoring its natural clustering ability. ",

    "abstract": "Computational prediction of stable crystal structures has a profound impact on the large-scale discovery of novel functional materials. However, predicting the crystal structure solely from a material's composition or formula is a promising yet challenging task, as traditional ab initio crystal structure prediction (CSP) methods rely on time-consuming global searches and first-principles free energy calculations. Inspired by the recent success of deep learning approaches in protein structure prediction, which utilize pairwise amino acid interactions to describe 3D structures, we present AlphaCrystal-II, a novel knowledge-based solution that exploits the abundant inter-atomic interaction patterns found in existing known crystal structures. AlphaCrystal-II predicts the atomic distance matrix of a target crystal material and employs this matrix to reconstruct its 3D crystal structure. By leveraging the wealth of inter-atomic relationships of known crystal structures, our approach demonstrates remarkable effectiveness and reliability in structure prediction through comprehensive experiments. This work highlights the potential of data-driven methods in accelerating the discovery and design of new materials with tailored properties. ",

    "abstract": "In the realm of medical 3D data, such as CT and MRI images, prevalent anisotropic resolution is characterized by high intra-slice but diminished inter-slice resolution. The lowered resolution between adjacent slices poses challenges, hindering optimal viewing experiences and impeding the development of robust downstream analysis algorithms. Various volumetric super-resolution algorithms aim to surmount these challenges, enhancing inter-slice resolution and overall 3D medical imaging quality. However, existing approaches confront inherent challenges: 1) often tailored to specific upsampling factors, lacking flexibility for diverse clinical scenarios; 2) newly generated slices frequently suffer from over-smoothing, degrading fine details, and leading to inter-slice inconsistency. In response, this study presents CycleINR, a novel enhanced Implicit Neural Representation model for 3D medical data volumetric super-resolution. Leveraging the continuity of the learned implicit function, the CycleINR model can achieve results with arbitrary up-sampling rates, eliminating the need for separate training. Additionally, we enhance the grid sampling in CycleINR with a local attention mechanism and mitigate over-smoothing by integrating cycle-consistent loss. We introduce a new metric, Slice-wise Noise Level Inconsistency (SNLI), to quantitatively assess inter-slice noise level inconsistency. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated through image quality evaluations on an in-house dataset and a downstream task analysis on the Medical Segmentation Decathlon liver tumor dataset. ",

In addition, non-linearity is modeled by shallow Neural Network (NN), and Google Trend is incorporated as an exogenous variable. Modeling tourist demand represents great importance for management structures and decision-makers due to its applicability in establishing sustainable tourism utilization strategies in environmentally vulnerable destinations such as caves.

    "abstract": "Social science research often hinges on the relationship between categorical variables and outcomes. We introduce CAVIAR, a novel method for embedding categorical variables that assume values in a high-dimensional ambient space but are sampled from an underlying manifold. Our theoretical and numerical analyses outline challenges posed by such categorical variables in causal inference. Specifically, dynamically varying and sparse levels can lead to violations of the Donsker conditions and a failure of the estimation functionals to converge to a tight Gaussian process. Traditional approaches, including the exclusion of rare categorical levels and principled variable selection models like LASSO, fall short. CAVIAR embeds the data into a lower-dimensional global coordinate system. The mapping can be derived from both structured and unstructured data, and ensures stable and robust estimates through dimensionality reduction. In a dataset of direct-to-consumer apparel sales, we illustrate how high-dimensional categorical variables, such as zip codes, can be succinctly represented, facilitating inference and analysis. ",

Treating each return series as a sequence of tokens, the model excels at understanding and predicting the highly intricate stock return dynamics. Instead of relying on handcrafted trading patterns using historical stock prices, StockGPT automatically learns the hidden representations predictive of future returns via its attention mechanism. On a held-out test sample from 2001 to 2023, a daily rebalanced long-short portfolio formed from StockGPT predictions earns an annual return of 119% with a Sharpe ratio of 6.5. The StockGPT-based portfolio completely explains away momentum and long-/short-term reversals, eliminating the need for manually crafted price-based strategies and also encompasses most leading stock market factors. This highlights the immense promise of generative AI in surpassing human in making complex financial investment decisions and illustrates the efficacy of the attention mechanism of large language models when applied to a completely different domain.

The James-Stein estimator is used in constructing detection schemes that exhibit strong detection performance both asymptotically and non-asymptotically. First, a James-Stein-based extension of the recently developed windowed CuSum test is introduced. Our results indicate that the proposed scheme constitutes a uniform improvement over its typical maximum likelihood variant. That is, the proposed James-Stein version achieves a smaller detection delay simultaneously for all possible post-change parameter values and every false alarm rate constraint, as long as the number of parallel data streams is greater than three. Additionally, an alternative detection procedure that utilizes the James-Stein estimator is shown to have asymptotic detection delay properties that compare favorably to existing tests. The second-order term of the asymptotic average detection delay is reduced in a predefined low-dimensional subspace of the parameter space, while second-order asymptotic minimaxity is preserved. The results are verified in simulations, where the proposed schemes are shown to achieve smaller detection delays compared to existing alternatives, especially when the number of data streams is large.

We also consider the possibility of non-unique trajectories that satisfy equality and inequality constraints. Crucially, we show that the problems of interest can be cast into a standard semi-infinite program and demonstrate how to generate optimal uncertainty scenario sets in order to obtain numerical solutions. We also include examples on model predictive control for obstacle avoidance with logical conditions, control with input saturation affected by uncertainty, and optimal parameter estimation to highlight the need for the proposed extension. Our method solves each of the examples considered, producing violation-free and locally optimal solutions. ",
