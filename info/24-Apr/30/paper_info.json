    "abstract": "As crowdsourcing emerges as an efficient and cost-effective method for obtaining labels for machine learning datasets, it is important to assess the quality of crowd-provided data, so as to improve analysis performance and reduce biases in subsequent machine learning tasks. Given the lack of ground truth in most cases of crowdsourcing, we refer to data quality as annotators' consistency and credibility. Unlike the simple scenarios where Kappa coefficient and intraclass correlation coefficient usually can apply, online crowdsourcing requires dealing with more complex situations. We introduce a systematic method for evaluating data quality and detecting spamming threats via variance decomposition, and we classify spammers into three categories based on their different behavioral patterns. A spammer index is proposed to assess entire data consistency and two metrics are developed to measure crowd worker's credibility by utilizing the Markov chain and generalized random effects models. Furthermore, we showcase the practicality of our techniques and their advantages by applying them on a face verification task with both simulation and real-world data collected from two crowdsourcing platforms.

    "abstract": "The classification of sleep stages is a pivotal aspect of diagnosing sleep disorders and evaluating sleep quality. However, the conventional manual scoring process, conducted by clinicians, is time-consuming and prone to human bias. Recent advancements in deep learning have substantially propelled the automation of sleep stage classification. Nevertheless, challenges persist, including the need for large datasets with labels and the inherent biases in human-generated annotations. This paper introduces NeuroNet, a self-supervised learning (SSL) framework designed to effectively harness unlabeled single-channel sleep electroencephalogram (EEG) signals by integrating contrastive learning tasks and masked prediction tasks. NeuroNet demonstrates superior performance over existing SSL methodologies through extensive experimentation conducted across three polysomnography (PSG) datasets. Additionally, this study proposes a Mamba-based temporal context module to capture the relationships among diverse EEG epochs. Combining NeuroNet with the Mamba-based temporal context module has demonstrated the capability to achieve, or even surpass, the performance of the latest supervised learning methodologies, even with a limited amount of labeled data. This study is expected to establish a new benchmark in sleep stage classification, promising to guide future research and applications in the field of sleep analysis. ",

Current advanced neural models for stance detection typically employ fully parametric softmax classifiers. However, these methods suffer from several limitations, including lack of explainability, insensitivity to the latent data structure, and unimodality, which greatly restrict their performance and applications. To address these challenges, we present a novel collaborative stance detection framework called (CoSD) which leverages contrastive heterogeneous topic graph learning to learn topic-aware semantics and collaborative signals among texts, topics, and stance labels for enhancing stance detection. During training, we construct a heterogeneous graph to structurally organize texts and stances through implicit topics via employing latent Dirichlet allocation. We then perform contrastive graph learning to learn heterogeneous node representations, aggregating informative multi-hop collaborative signals via an elaborate Collaboration Propagation Aggregation (CPA) module. During inference, we introduce a hybrid similarity scoring module to enable the comprehensive incorporation of topic-aware semantics and collaborative signals for stance detection. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets demonstrate the state-of-the-art detection performance of CoSD, verifying the effectiveness and explainability of our collaborative framework. ",

We use a new metric to quantify the degree of this weakened backdoor effect, called attack persistence.

It aggregates more combined trigger information for a more complete backdoor pattern in the global model. Trained backdoored global model is more resilient to benign updates, leading to a higher attack success rate on the test set. We test on three datasets and evaluate with two models across various settings. FCBA's persistence outperforms SOTA federated learning backdoor attacks. On GTSRB, postattack 120 rounds, our attack success rate rose over 50% from baseline. The core code of our method is available at https://github.com/PhD-TaoLiu/FCBA. ",

To address this, we propose a new architecture-agnostic training paradigm called center-based relaxed learning (CRL), which is adaptive to any classification model and provides privacy preservation by sacrificing a minimal or no loss of model generalizability. We emphasize that CRL can better maintain the model's consistency between member and non-member data.

    "abstract": "The reduced cost and computational and calibration requirements of monocular cameras make them ideal positioning sensors for mobile robots, albeit at the expense of any meaningful depth measurement. Solutions proposed by some scholars to this localization problem involve fusing pose estimates from convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with pose estimates from geometric constraints on motion to generate accurate predictions of robot trajectories. However, the distribution of attitude estimation based on CNN is not uniform, resulting in certain translation problems in the prediction of robot trajectories. This paper proposes improving these CNN-based pose estimates by propagating a SE(3) uniform distribution driven by a particle filter. The particles utilize the same motion model used by the CNN, while updating their weights using CNN-based estimates. The results show that while the rotational component of pose estimation does not consistently improve relative to CNN-based estimation, the translational component is significantly more accurate. This factor combined with the superior smoothness of the filtered trajectories shows that the use of particle filters significantly improves the performance of CNN-based localization algorithms. ",

We theoretically formulate the key performance metrics of an application, in terms of goodput and delivery delay, at a cost of network resources in terms of bandwidth. We explore an un-coded communication protocol that uses feedback-based repetitions, and a coded protocol, implementing random linear network coding and using coding-aware acknowledgments. We find that coding reduces the resource demands of a slice to meet the requirements for an application, thereby serving more applications efficiently. Coded slices thus free up resources for other slices, be they coded or not. Based on these results, we propose a hybrid approach, wherein coding is introduced selectively in certain network slices. This approach not only facilitates a smoother transition from un-coded systems to coded systems but also reduces costs across all slices. Theoretical findings in this paper are validated and expanded upon through real-time simulations of the network. ",

In-situ monitoring of the melt pool subsurface morphology requires specialized equipment that may not be readily accessible or scalable. Therefore, we introduce a machine learning framework to correlate in-situ two-color thermal images observed via high-speed color imaging to the two-dimensional profile of the melt pool cross-section. Specifically, we employ a hybrid CNN-Transformer architecture to establish a correlation between single bead off-axis thermal image sequences and melt pool cross-section contours measured via optical microscopy. In this architecture, a ResNet model embeds the spatial information contained within the thermal images to a latent vector, while a Transformer model correlates the sequence of embedded vectors to extract temporal information. Our framework is able to model the curvature of the subsurface melt pool structure, with improved performance in high energy density regimes compared to analytical melt pool models. The performance of this model is evaluated through dimensional and geometric comparisons to the corresponding experimental melt pool observations. ",

In recognition of this problem, the current paper presents the RFP da-taset, which comprises five distinct audio types: partial fake (PF), audio with noise, voice conversion (VC), text-to-speech (TTS), and real. The data are then used to evaluate several detection models, revealing that the available detec-tion models incur a markedly higher equal error rate (EER) when detecting PF audio instead of entirely fake audio.

The conventional retrieval methods in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for large language models (LLMs) treat a large corpus of past issue tracking tickets as plain text, ignoring the crucial intra-issue structure and inter-issue relations, which limits performance. We introduce a novel customer service question-answering method that amalgamates RAG with a knowledge graph (KG). Our method constructs a KG from historical issues for use in retrieval, retaining the intra-issue structure and inter-issue relations. During the question-answering phase, our method parses consumer queries and retrieves related sub-graphs from the KG to generate answers. This integration of a KG not only improves retrieval accuracy by preserving customer service structure information but also enhances answering quality by mitigating the effects of text segmentation. Empirical assessments on our benchmark datasets, utilizing key retrieval (MRR, Recall@K, NDCG@K) and text generation (BLEU, ROUGE, METEOR) metrics, reveal that our method outperforms the baseline by 77.6% in MRR and by 0.32 in BLEU.

We conducted in-depth interviews with 12 autistic adults to find the pain points of current AAC and determine what general technological advances they would find helpful.

    "abstract": "Diffusion probabilistic models (DPMs) have become the state-of-the-art in high-quality image generation. However, DPMs have an arbitrary noisy latent space with no interpretable or controllable semantics. Although there has been significant research effort to improve image sample quality, there is little work on representation-controlled generation using diffusion models. Specifically, causal modeling and controllable counterfactual generation using DPMs is an underexplored area. In this work, we propose CausalDiffAE, a diffusion-based causal representation learning framework to enable counterfactual generation according to a specified causal model. Our key idea is to use an encoder to extract high-level semantically meaningful causal variables from high-dimensional data and model stochastic variation using reverse diffusion. We propose a causal encoding mechanism that maps high-dimensional data to causally related latent factors and parameterize the causal mechanisms among latent factors using neural networks. To enforce the disentanglement of causal variables, we formulate a variational objective and leverage auxiliary label information in a prior to regularize the latent space. We propose a DDIM-based counterfactual generation procedure subject to do-interventions. Finally, to address the limited label supervision scenario, we also study the application of CausalDiffAE when a part of the training data is unlabeled, which also enables granular control over the strength of interventions in generating counterfactuals during inference. We empirically show that CausalDiffAE learns a disentangled latent space and is capable of generating high-quality counterfactual images. ",

    "abstract": "The discretization of the deep Ritz method [18] for the Poisson equation leads to a high-dimensional non-convex minimization problem, that is difficult and expensive to solve numerically. In this paper, we consider the shallow Ritz approximation to one-dimensional diffusion problems and introduce an effective and efficient iterative method, a damped block Newton (dBN) method, for solving the resulting non-convex minimization problem. The method employs the block Gauss-Seidel method as an outer iteration by dividing the parameters of a shallow neural network into the linear parameters (the weights and bias of the output layer) and the non-linear parameters (the weights and bias of the hidden layer). Per each outer iteration, the linear and the non-linear parameters are updated by exact inversion and one step of a damped Newton method, respectively. Inverses of the coefficient matrix and the Hessian matrix are tridiagonal and diagonal, respectively, and hence the cost of each dBN iteration is $\\mathcal{O}(n)$. To move the breakpoints (the non-linear parameters) more efficiently, we propose an adaptive damped block Newton (AdBN) method by combining the dBN with the adaptive neuron enhancement (ANE) method [25]. Numerical examples demonstrate the ability of dBN and AdBN not only to move the breakpoints quickly and efficiently but also to achieve a nearly optimal order of convergence for AdBN. These iterative solvers are capable of outperforming BFGS for select examples. ",

    "abstract": "CLIP showcases exceptional cross-modal matching capabilities due to its training on image-text contrastive learning tasks. However, without specific optimization for unimodal scenarios, its performance in single-modality feature extraction might be suboptimal. Despite this, some studies have directly used CLIP's image encoder for tasks like few-shot classification, introducing a misalignment between its pre-training objectives and feature extraction methods. This inconsistency can diminish the quality of the image's feature representation, adversely affecting CLIP's effectiveness in target tasks. In this paper, we view text features as precise neighbors of image features in CLIP's space and present a novel CrOss-moDal nEighbor Representation(CODER) based on the distance structure between images and their neighbor texts. This feature extraction method aligns better with CLIP's pre-training objectives, thereby fully leveraging CLIP's robust cross-modal capabilities. The key to construct a high-quality CODER lies in how to create a vast amount of high-quality and diverse texts to match with images. We introduce the Auto Text Generator(ATG) to automatically generate the required texts in a data-free and training-free manner. We apply CODER to CLIP's zero-shot and few-shot image classification tasks. Experiment results across various datasets and models confirm CODER's effectiveness.

However, most existing deep learning-based change detection methods mainly focus on intricate feature extraction and multi-scale feature fusion, while ignoring the insufficient utilization of features in the intermediate stages, thus resulting in sub-optimal results. To this end, we propose a novel framework, named RFL-CDNet, that utilizes richer feature learning to boost change detection performance. Specifically, we first introduce deep multiple supervision to enhance intermediate representations, thus unleashing the potential of backbone feature extractor at each stage. Furthermore, we design the Coarse-To-Fine Guiding (C2FG) module and the Learnable Fusion (LF) module to further improve feature learning and obtain more discriminative feature representations. The C2FG module aims to seamlessly integrate the side prediction from the previous coarse-scale into the current fine-scale prediction in a coarse-to-fine manner, while LF module assumes that the contribution of each stage and each spatial location is independent, thus designing a learnable module to fuse multiple predictions. Experiments on several benchmark datasets show that our proposed RFL-CDNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on WHU cultivated land dataset and CDD dataset, and the second-best performance on WHU building dataset.

Training big AI models, e.g., for personalized fine-tuning and continual model refinement, poses significant challenges to edge devices due to the inherent conflict between limited computing resources and intensive workload associated with training. Despite the constraints of on-device training, traditional approaches usually resort to aggregating training data and sending it to a remote cloud for centralized training. Nevertheless, this approach is neither sustainable, which strains long-range backhaul transmission and energy-consuming datacenters, nor safely private, which shares users' raw data with remote infrastructures. To address these challenges, we alternatively observe that prevalent edge environments usually contain a diverse collection of trusted edge devices with untapped idle resources, which can be leveraged for edge training acceleration. Motivated by this, in this article, we propose collaborative edge training, a novel training mechanism that orchestrates a group of trusted edge devices as a resource pool for expedited, sustainable big AI model training at the edge. As an initial step, we present a comprehensive framework for building collaborative edge training systems and analyze in-depth its merits and sustainable scheduling choices following its workflow. To further investigate the impact of its parallelism design, we empirically study a case of four typical parallelisms from the perspective of energy demand with realistic testbeds. Finally, we discuss open challenges for sustainable collaborative edge training to point to future directions of edge-centric big AI model training. ",

Representation learning divides deep learning models into 'base' and 'head' components. The base component, capturing common features across all clients, is shared with the server, while the head component, capturing unique features specific to individual clients, remains local. We propose a new representation learning-based approach that suggests decoupling the entire deep learning model into more densely divided parts with the application of suitable scheduling methods, which can benefit not only data heterogeneity but also class heterogeneity. In this paper, we compare and analyze two layer scheduling approaches, namely forward (\\textit{Vanilla}) and backward (\\textit{Anti}), in the context of data and class heterogeneity among clients.

Existing state-of-the-art methods rely on deep learning to mitigate this threat. They treat each input contract as an independent entity and feed it into a deep learning model to learn vulnerability patterns by fitting vulnerability labels. It is a pity that they disregard the correlation between contracts, failing to consider the commonalities between contracts of the same type and the differences among contracts of different types. As a result, the performance of these methods falls short of the desired level. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel Contrastive Learning Enhanced Automated Recognition Approach for Smart Contract Vulnerabilities, named Clear. In particular, Clear employs a contrastive learning (CL) model to capture the fine-grained correlation information among contracts and generates correlation labels based on the relationships between contracts to guide the training process of the CL model. Finally, it combines the correlation and the semantic information of the contract to detect SCVs. Through an empirical evaluation of a large-scale real-world dataset of over 40K smart contracts and compare 13 state-of-the-art baseline methods. We show that Clear achieves (1) optimal performance over all baseline methods; (2) 9.73%-39.99% higher F1-score than existing deep learning methods. ",

Existing MHPFL methods focus on achieving client-level personalization, but cannot address batch-level data heterogeneity. To bridge this important gap, we propose a model-heterogeneous personalized Federated learning approach with Adaptive Feature Mixture (pFedAFM) for supervised learning tasks. It consists of three novel designs: 1) A sharing global homogeneous small feature extractor is assigned alongside each client's local heterogeneous model (consisting of a heterogeneous feature extractor and a prediction header) to facilitate cross-client knowledge fusion. The two feature extractors share the local heterogeneous model's prediction header containing rich personalized prediction knowledge to retain personalized prediction capabilities. 2) An iterative training strategy is designed to alternately train the global homogeneous small feature extractor and the local heterogeneous large model for effective global-local knowledge exchange. 3) A trainable weight vector is designed to dynamically mix the features extracted by both feature extractors to adapt to batch-level data heterogeneity. Theoretical analysis proves that pFedAFM can converge over time. Extensive experiments on 2 benchmark datasets demonstrate that it significantly outperforms 7 state-of-the-art MHPFL methods, achieving up to 7.93% accuracy improvement while incurring low communication and computation costs.

However, the inherent inductive biases in convolutional architectures limit their ability to model long-range dependencies and spatial correlations. While recent transformer-based architectures address these limitations by leveraging self-attention mechanisms to encode long-range dependencies and learn expressive representations, they often struggle to extract low-level features and are highly dependent on data availability. This motivated us for the development of GLIMS, a data-efficient attention-guided hybrid volumetric segmentation network. GLIMS utilizes Dilated Feature Aggregator Convolutional Blocks (DACB) to capture local-global feature correlations efficiently. Furthermore, the incorporated Swin Transformer-based bottleneck bridges the local and global features to improve the robustness of the model. Additionally, GLIMS employs an attention-guided segmentation approach through Channel and Spatial-Wise Attention Blocks (CSAB) to localize expressive features for fine-grained border segmentation. Quantitative and qualitative results on glioblastoma and multi-organ CT segmentation tasks demonstrate GLIMS' effectiveness in terms of complexity and accuracy. GLIMS demonstrated outstanding performance on BraTS2021 and BTCV datasets, surpassing the performance of Swin UNETR. Notably, GLIMS achieved this high performance with a significantly reduced number of trainable parameters. Specifically, GLIMS has 47.16M trainable parameters and 72.30G FLOPs, while Swin UNETR has 61.98M trainable parameters and 394.84G FLOPs.

This approach implicitly addresses the PSF's impact on objects of interest. In this paper, we propose an alternative approach, which we term \"Boosting Radar Reflections\" (BoostRad). In BoostRad, a first DNN is trained to narrow the PSF for all the reflection points in the scene. The output of the first DNN is a boosted reflection image with higher resolution and reduced clutter, resulting in a sharper and cleaner image. Subsequently, a second DNN is employed to detect objects within the boosted reflection image. We develop a novel method for training the boosting DNN that incorporates domain knowledge of radar's PSF characteristics. BoostRad's performance is evaluated using the RADDet and CARRADA datasets, revealing its superiority over reference methods. ",

Existing methods mainly use graph structures to model dialogue context semantic dependencies and employ Graph Neural Networks (GNN) to capture multimodal semantic features for emotion recognition. However, these methods are limited by some inherent characteristics of GNN, such as over-smoothing and low-pass filtering, resulting in the inability to learn long-distance consistency information and complementary information efficiently. Since consistency and complementarity information correspond to low-frequency and high-frequency information, respectively, this paper revisits the problem of multimodal emotion recognition in conversation from the perspective of the graph spectrum. Specifically, we propose a Graph-Spectrum-based Multimodal Consistency and Complementary collaborative learning framework GS-MCC. First, GS-MCC uses a sliding window to construct a multimodal interaction graph to model conversational relationships and uses efficient Fourier graph operators to extract long-distance high-frequency and low-frequency information, respectively. Then, GS-MCC uses contrastive learning to construct self-supervised signals that reflect complementarity and consistent semantic collaboration with high and low-frequency signals, thereby improving the ability of high and low-frequency information to reflect real emotions. Finally, GS-MCC inputs the collaborative high and low-frequency information into the MLP network and softmax function for emotion prediction.

A celebrated result by Roberts gives a simple characterization of unit interval graphs being exactly claw-free interval graphs. Here, we study the generalization of this characterization for $d$-interval graphs. In particular, we prove that for any $d \\geq 2$, if $G$ is a $K_{1,2d+1}$-free interval graph, then $G$ is a unit $d$-interval graph.

Recent research demonstrates that contrastive learning has the ability to improve event comprehension capabilities of Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) and enhance the performance of event representation learning. However, the efficacy of event representation learning based on contrastive learning and PLMs is limited by the short length of event texts. The length of event texts differs significantly from the text length used in the pre-training of PLMs. As a result, there is inconsistency in the distribution of text length between pre-training and event representation learning, which may undermine the learning process of event representation based on PLMs. In this study, we present PromptCL, a novel framework for event representation learning that effectively elicits the capabilities of PLMs to comprehensively capture the semantics of short event texts. PromptCL utilizes a Prompt template borrowed from prompt learning to expand the input text during Contrastive Learning. This helps in enhancing the event representation learning by providing a structured outline of the event components. Moreover, we propose Subject-Predicate-Object (SPO) word order and Event-oriented Masked Language Modeling (EventMLM) to train PLMs to understand the relationships between event components.

In this context, feature selection assumes a pivotal role in enhancing model interpretability by identifying the most important input features in black-box models. While random forests are frequently used in biomedicine for their remarkable performance on tabular datasets, the accuracy gained from aggregating decision trees comes at the expense of interpretability. Consequently, feature selection for enhancing interpretability in random forests has been extensively explored in supervised settings.

Feature graphs are constructed for the entire dataset as well as individual clusters leveraging the parent-child node splits within the trees, such that feature centrality captures their relevance to the clustering task, while edge weights reflect the discriminating power of feature pairs. Graph-based feature selection methods are extensively evaluated on synthetic and benchmark datasets both in terms of their ability to reduce dimensionality while improving clustering performance, as well as to enhance model interpretability.

    "abstract": "Generative deep learning (DL) models have been successfully adopted for vulnerability patching. However, such models require the availability of a large dataset of patches to learn from. To overcome this issue, researchers have proposed to start from models pre-trained with general knowledge, either on the programming language or on similar tasks such as bug fixing. Despite the efforts in the area of automated vulnerability patching, there is a lack of systematic studies on how these different training procedures impact the performance of DL models for such a task. This paper provides a manyfold contribution to bridge this gap, by (i) comparing existing solutions of self-supervised and supervised pre-training for vulnerability patching; and (ii) for the first time, experimenting with different kinds of prompt-tuning for this task. The study required to train/test 23 DL models. We found that a supervised pre-training focused on bug-fixing, while expensive in terms of data collection, substantially improves DL-based vulnerability patching. When applying prompt-tuning on top of this supervised pre-trained model, there is no significant gain in performance. Instead, prompt-tuning is an effective and cheap solution to substantially boost the performance of self-supervised pre-trained models, i.e., those not relying on the bug-fixing pre-training. ",

    "abstract": "Reconstruction-based methods have been commonly used for unsupervised anomaly detection, in which a normal image is reconstructed and compared with the given test image to detect and locate anomalies. Recently, diffusion models have shown promising applications for anomaly detection due to their powerful generative ability. However, these models lack strict mathematical support for normal image reconstruction and unexpectedly suffer from low reconstruction quality. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel and highly-interpretable method named Masked Diffusion Posterior Sampling (MDPS). In MDPS, the problem of normal image reconstruction is mathematically modeled as multiple diffusion posterior sampling for normal images based on the devised masked noisy observation model and the diffusion-based normal image prior under Bayesian framework. Using a metric designed from pixel-level and perceptual-level perspectives, MDPS can effectively compute the difference map between each normal posterior sample and the given test image. Anomaly scores are obtained by averaging all difference maps for multiple posterior samples. Exhaustive experiments on MVTec and BTAD datasets demonstrate that MDPS can achieve state-of-the-art performance in normal image reconstruction quality as well as anomaly detection and localization.

However, recent approaches have overlooked the impact of noisy pseudo-labels during training, despite efforts to enhance pseudo-label quality through confidence-based filtering. In this paper, we examine the impact of noisy pseudo-labels on IoU-based target assignment and propose the Reliable Student framework, which incorporates two complementary approaches to mitigate errors. First, it involves a class-aware target assignment strategy that reduces false negative assignments in difficult classes. Second, it includes a reliability weighting strategy that suppresses false positive assignment errors while also addressing remaining false negatives from the first step. The reliability weights are determined by querying the teacher network for confidence scores of the student-generated proposals. Our work surpasses the previous state-of-the-art on KITTI 3D object detection benchmark on point clouds in the semi-supervised setting. On 1% labeled data, our approach achieves a 6.2% AP improvement for the pedestrian class, despite having only 37 labeled samples available. The improvements become significant for the 2% setting, achieving 6.0% AP and 5.7% AP improvements for the pedestrian and cyclist classes, respectively. ",

To our knowledge, SAnD is the first procedure that integrates these tools to identify anomalies and help decipher their putative causes. We show how each step contributes to tackling technical challenges that practitioners face when detecting anomalies in industrial contexts, where signals can be highly multicollinear, have unknown distributions, and intertwine short-lived noise with the long(er)-lived actual anomalies. The development of SAnD was motivated by a concrete case study from our industrial partner, which we use here to show its effectiveness. We also evaluate the performance of SAnD by comparing it with a selection of semi-supervised methods on public datasets from the literature on anomaly detection. We conclude that SAnD is effective, broadly applicable, and outperforms existing approaches in both anomaly detection and runtime. ",

    "abstract": "Underwater images often suffer from various issues such as low brightness, color shift, blurred details, and noise due to light absorption and scattering caused by water and suspended particles. Previous underwater image enhancement (UIE) methods have primarily focused on spatial domain enhancement, neglecting the frequency domain information inherent in the images. However, the degradation factors of underwater images are closely intertwined in the spatial domain. Although certain methods focus on enhancing images in the frequency domain, they overlook the inherent relationship between the image degradation factors and the information present in the frequency domain. As a result, these methods frequently enhance certain attributes of the improved image while inadequately addressing or even exacerbating other attributes. Moreover, many existing methods heavily rely on prior knowledge to address color shift problems in underwater images, limiting their flexibility and robustness. In order to overcome these limitations, we propose the Embedding Frequency and Dual Color Encoder Network (FDCE-Net) in our paper. The FDCE-Net consists of two main structures: (1) Frequency Spatial Network (FS-Net) aims to achieve initial enhancement by utilizing our designed Frequency Spatial Residual Block (FSRB) to decouple image degradation factors in the frequency domain and enhance different attributes separately. (2) To tackle the color shift issue, we introduce the Dual-Color Encoder (DCE). The DCE establishes correlations between color and semantic representations through cross-attention and leverages multi-scale image features to guide the optimization of adaptive color query. The final enhanced images are generated by combining the outputs of FS-Net and DCE through a fusion network. These images exhibit rich details, clear textures, low noise and natural colors. ",

Recently, studies revealed their vulnerability to adversarial attacks. In this work, we theoretically define the concept of expected robustness in the context of attributed graphs and relate it to the classical definition of adversarial robustness in the graph representation learning literature. Our definition allows us to derive an upper bound of the expected robustness of Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) and Graph Isomorphism Networks subject to node feature attacks. Building on these findings, we connect the expected robustness of GNNs to the orthonormality of their weight matrices and consequently propose an attack-independent, more robust variant of the GCN, called the Graph Convolutional Orthonormal Robust Networks (GCORNs). We further introduce a probabilistic method to estimate the expected robustness, which allows us to evaluate the effectiveness of GCORN on several real-world datasets.

For these functions, accurately predicting the logits of inlier classes for each pixel is crucial for precisely inferring the anomaly score. However, in real-world driving scenarios, the diversity of scenes often results in distorted manifolds of pixel embeddings in embedding space. This effect is not conducive to directly using the pixel embeddings for the logit prediction during inference, a concern overlooked by existing methods. To address this problem, we propose a novel method called Random Walk on Pixel Manifolds (RWPM). RWPM utilizes random walks to reveal the intrinsic relationships among pixels to refine the pixel embeddings. The refined pixel embeddings alleviate the distortion of manifolds, improving the accuracy of anomaly scores. Our extensive experiments show that RWPM consistently improve the performance of the existing anomaly segmentation methods and achieve the best results.

Traditional methods for shape modeling from imaging data demand significant manual and computational resources. Additionally, these methods necessitate repeating the entire modeling pipeline to derive shape descriptors (e.g., surface-based point correspondences) for new data. While deep learning approaches have shown promise in streamlining the construction of SSMs on new data, they still rely on traditional techniques to supervise the training of the deep networks. Moreover, the predominant linearity assumption of traditional approaches restricts their efficacy, a limitation also inherited by deep learning models trained using optimized/established correspondences. Consequently, representing complex anatomies becomes challenging. To address these limitations, we introduce SCorP, a novel framework capable of predicting surface-based correspondences directly from unsegmented images. By leveraging the shape prior learned directly from surface meshes in an unsupervised manner, the proposed model eliminates the need for an optimized shape model for training supervision. The strong shape prior acts as a teacher and regularizes the feature learning of the student network to guide it in learning image-based features that are predictive of surface correspondences. The proposed model streamlines the training and inference phases by removing the supervision for the correspondence prediction task while alleviating the linearity assumption. ",

At first, we select a state-of-the-art Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) model to predict dimensional emotion values from all input audio in the dataset.

The conditional probability cannot detect outliers, causing outlier sensitivity in softmax networks. This exacerbates model over-confidence impacting many problems, such as hallucinations, confounding biases, and dependence on large datasets. To address this we introduce a novel embedding constraint based on the Method of Moments (MoM). We investigate the use of polynomial moments ranging from 1st through 4th order hyper-covariance matrices. Furthermore, we use this embedding constraint to train an Axis-Aligned Gaussian Mixture Model (AAGMM) final layer, which learns not only the conditional, but also the joint distribution of the latent space. We apply this method to the domain of semi-supervised image classification by extending FlexMatch with our technique. We find our MoM constraint with the AAGMM layer is able to match the reported FlexMatch accuracy, while also modeling the joint distribution, thereby reducing outlier sensitivity. We also present a preliminary outlier detection strategy based on Mahalanobis distance and discuss future improvements to this strategy.

TabNet is a state-of-the-art neural network model designed for tabular data that utilizes an autoencoder architecture for training. Vertical Federated Learning (VFL) is an emerging distributed machine learning paradigm that allows multiple parties to train a model collaboratively on vertically partitioned data while maintaining data privacy. The existing design of training autoencoders in VFL is to train a separate autoencoder in each participant and aggregate the latent representation later. This design could potentially break important correlations between feature data of participating parties, as each autoencoder is trained on locally available features while disregarding the features of others. In addition, traditional autoencoders are not specifically designed for tabular data, which is ubiquitous in VFL settings. Moreover, the impact of client failures during training on the model robustness is under-researched in the VFL scene. In this paper, we propose TabVFL, a distributed framework designed to improve latent representation learning using the joint features of participants. The framework (i) preserves privacy by mitigating potential data leakage with the addition of a fully-connected layer, (ii) conserves feature correlations by learning one latent representation vector, and (iii) provides enhanced robustness against client failures during training phase.

This model modification achieved a significant reduction of computational costs in simulating the model. Results of numerical simulations showed much more significant unbounded growth in both maximal and average sizes of replicating higher-order entities than the original model, demonstrating the effectiveness of this non-spatial model as a minimalistic example of open-ended evolutionary systems.

The corresponding optimization problem is known to be NP-hard. The best known polynomial time approximation algorithm for the problem separates the solution process in two stages applying first a fast greedy algorithm to obtain an initial dominating set, and then it uses an iterative procedure to reduce (purify) this dominating set. The purification stage turned out to be practically efficient. Here we further strengthen the purification stage presenting four new purification algorithms. All four purification procedures outperform the earlier purification procedure. The algorithms were tested for over 1300 benchmark problem instances. Compared to the known upper bounds, the obtained solutions were about 7 times better. Remarkably, for the 500 benchmark instances for which the optimum is known, the optimal solutions were obtained for 46.33\\% of the tested instances, whereas the average error for the remaining instances was about 1.01.

    "abstract": "Loss function plays a vital role in supervised learning frameworks. The selection of the appropriate loss function holds the potential to have a substantial impact on the proficiency attained by the acquired model. The training of supervised learning algorithms inherently adheres to predetermined loss functions during the optimization process. In this paper, we present a novel contribution to the realm of supervised machine learning: an asymmetric loss function named wave loss. It exhibits robustness against outliers, insensitivity to noise, boundedness, and a crucial smoothness property. Theoretically, we establish that the proposed wave loss function manifests the essential characteristic of being classification-calibrated. Leveraging this breakthrough, we incorporate the proposed wave loss function into the least squares setting of support vector machines (SVM) and twin support vector machines (TSVM), resulting in two robust and smooth models termed Wave-SVM and Wave-TSVM, respectively. To address the optimization problem inherent in Wave-SVM, we utilize the adaptive moment estimation (Adam) algorithm. It is noteworthy that this paper marks the first instance of the Adam algorithm application to solve an SVM model. Further, we devise an iterative algorithm to solve the optimization problems of Wave-TSVM. To empirically showcase the effectiveness of the proposed Wave-SVM and Wave-TSVM, we evaluate them on benchmark UCI and KEEL datasets (with and without feature noise) from diverse domains. Moreover, to exemplify the applicability of Wave-SVM in the biomedical domain, we evaluate it on the Alzheimer Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset. The experimental outcomes unequivocally reveal the prowess of Wave-SVM and Wave-TSVM in achieving superior prediction accuracy against the baseline models. ",

In particular, we are interested in one-sided error algorithms, so that they must detect a copy of $C_k$ with high constant probability when the graph is $\\epsilon$-far from $C_k$-free. We next state our results for constant arboricity and constant $\\epsilon$ with a focus on the dependence on the number of graph vertices, $n$. The query complexity of all our algorithms grows polynomially with $1/\\epsilon$. (1) As opposed to the case of $k=3$, where the complexity of testing $C_3$-freeness grows with the arboricity of the graph but not with the size of the graph (Levi, ICALP 2021) this is no longer the case already for $k=4$. We show that $\\Omega(n^{1/4})$ queries are necessary for testing $C_4$-freeness, and that $\\widetilde{O}(n^{1/4})$ are sufficient. The same bounds hold for $C_5$. (2) For every fixed $k \\geq 6$, any one-sided error algorithm for testing $C_k$-freeness must perform $\\Omega(n^{1/3})$ queries. (3) For $k=6$ we give a testing algorithm whose query complexity is $\\widetilde{O}(n^{1/2})$.

This complexity stems from factors such as nuanced definitions of fairness, unique biases in each dataset, and the trade-off between fairness and model accuracy. To address such issues, we introduce FairVIC, an innovative approach designed to enhance fairness in neural networks by addressing inherent biases at the training stage. FairVIC differs from traditional approaches that typically address biases at the data preprocessing stage. Instead, it integrates variance, invariance and covariance into the loss function to minimise the model's dependency on protected characteristics for making predictions, thus promoting fairness. Our experimentation and evaluation consists of training neural networks on three datasets known for their biases, comparing our results to state-of-the-art algorithms, evaluating on different sizes of model architectures, and carrying out sensitivity analysis to examine the fairness-accuracy trade-off. Through our implementation of FairVIC, we observed a significant improvement in fairness across all metrics tested, without compromising the model's accuracy to a detrimental extent. Our findings suggest that FairVIC presents a straightforward, out-of-the-box solution for the development of fairer deep learning models, thereby offering a generalisable solution applicable across many tasks and datasets.

In this paper, we propose a deepfake video detection method based on 3D spatiotemporal trajectories. Specifically, we utilize a robust 3D model to construct spatiotemporal motion features, integrating feature details from both 2D and 3D frames to mitigate the influence of large head rotation angles or insufficient lighting within frames. Furthermore, we separate facial expressions from head movements and design a sequential analysis method based on phase space motion trajectories to explore the feature differences between genuine and fake faces in deepfake videos. We conduct extensive experiments to validate the performance of our proposed method on several compressed deepfake benchmarks. The robustness of the well-designed features is verified by calculating the consistent distribution of facial landmarks before and after video compression.Our method yields satisfactory results and showcases its potential for practical applications.

This work identifies two problems that are largely ignored by existing image demoir\\'eing approaches: 1) moir\\'e patterns vary across different channels (RGB); 2) repetitive patterns are constantly observed. However, employing conventional convolutional (CNN) layers cannot address these problems. Instead, this paper presents the use of our recently proposed Shape concept. It was originally employed to model consistent features from fragmented regions, particularly when identical or similar objects coexist in an RGB-D image. Interestingly, we find that the Shape information effectively captures the moir\\'e patterns in artifact images.

Beyond modeling shape features at the patch-level, we further extend this to the global image-level and design a novel Shape-Architecture. Consequently, our proposed method, equipped with both ShapeConv and Shape-Architecture, can be seamlessly integrated into existing approaches without introducing additional parameters or computation overhead during inference. We conduct extensive experiments on four widely used datasets, and the results demonstrate that our ShapeMoir\\'e achieves state-of-the-art performance, particularly in terms of the PSNR metric. We then apply our method across four popular architectures to showcase its generalization capabilities.

However, the resilience of Transformers' in-context learning capabilities in the presence of noisy samples, prevalent in both training corpora and prompt demonstrations, remains underexplored. In this paper, inspired by prior research that studies ICL ability using simple function classes, we take a closer look at this problem by investigating the robustness of Transformers against noisy labels. Specifically, we first conduct a thorough evaluation and analysis of the robustness of Transformers against noisy labels during in-context learning and show that they exhibit notable resilience against diverse types of noise in demonstration labels. Furthermore, we delve deeper into this problem by exploring whether introducing noise into the training set, akin to a form of data augmentation, enhances such robustness during inference, and find that such noise can indeed improve the robustness of ICL. Overall, our fruitful analysis and findings provide a comprehensive understanding of the resilience of Transformer models against label noises during ICL and provide valuable insights into the research on Transformers in natural language processing.

This task is undeniably challenging. Our research finds that methods based on collision detection can enhance a robot's perception of environmental obstacles. In this work, we propose an end-to-end learning-based quadruped robot motion controller that relies solely on proprioceptive sensing. This controller can accurately detect, localize, and agilely respond to collisions in unknown and complex 3D environments, thereby improving the robot's traversability in complex environments. We demonstrate in both simulation and real-world experiments that our method enables quadruped robots to successfully traverse challenging obstacles in various complex environments. ",

    "abstract": "Illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing seriously affects various aspects of human life. However, current methods for detecting and monitoring IUU activities at sea have limitations. While Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) can complement existing vessel detection systems, extracting useful information from SAR images using traditional methods, especially for IUU fishing identification, poses challenges. This paper proposes a deep learning-based system for detecting fishing activities. We implemented this system on the xView3 dataset using six classical object detection models: Faster R-CNN, Cascade R-CNN, SSD, RetinaNet, FSAF, and FCOS. We applied improvement methods to enhance the performance of the Faster R-CNN model. Specifically, training the Faster R-CNN model using Online Hard Example Mining (OHEM) strategy improved the Avg-F1 value from 0.212 to 0.216, representing a 1.96% improvement. ",

Despite extensive research and notable achievements with successful real-world applications, addressing the challenge of capturing the appropriate receptive field (RF) size from one-dimensional or multi-dimensional time series of varying lengths remains a persistent issue, which greatly impacts performance and varies considerably across different datasets. In this paper, we propose an Adaptive and Effective Full-Scope Convolutional Neural Network (AdaFSNet) to enhance the accuracy of time series classification. This network includes two Dense Blocks. Particularly, it can dynamically choose a range of kernel sizes that effectively encompass the optimal RF size for various datasets by incorporating multiple prime numbers corresponding to the time series length. We also design a TargetDrop block, which can reduce redundancy while extracting a more effective RF. To assess the effectiveness of the AdaFSNet network, comprehensive experiments were conducted using the UCR and UEA datasets, which include one-dimensional and multi-dimensional time series data, respectively. Our model surpassed baseline models in terms of classification accuracy, underscoring the AdaFSNet network's efficiency and effectiveness in handling time series classification tasks. ",

    "abstract": "In network slicing, the network operator needs to satisfy the service level agreements of multiple slices at the same time and on the same physical infrastructure. To do so with reduced provisioned resources, the operator may consider resource sharing mechanisms. However, each slice then becomes susceptible to traffic surges in other slices which degrades performance isolation. To maintain both high efficiency and high isolation, we propose the introduction of hypothesis testing in resource sharing. Our approach comprises two phases. In the trial phase, the operator obtains a stochastic model for each slice that describes its normal behavior, provisions resources and then signs the service level agreements. In the regular phase, whenever there is resource contention, hypothesis testing is conducted to check which slices follow their normal behavior. Slices that fail the test are excluded from resource sharing to protect the well-behaved ones. We test our approach on a mobile traffic dataset. Results show that our approach fortifies the service level agreements against unexpected traffic patterns and achieves high efficiency via resource sharing. Overall, our approach provides an appealing tradeoff between efficiency and isolation. ",

Especially in safety-critical systems such as automotive electronics, ECCs are widely used and the verification of such complex logic becomes more critical considering the ISO 26262 safety standards. Exhaustive verification of ECC using formal methods has been a challenge given the high number of data bits to protect. As an example, for an ECC of 128 data bits with a possibility to detect up to four-bit errors, the combination of bit errors is given by 128C1 + 128C2 + 128C3 + 128C4 = 1.1 * 10^7. This vast analysis space often leads to bounded proof results. Moreover, the complexity and state-space increase further if the ECC has sequential encoding and decoding stages. To overcome such problems and sign-off the design with confidence within reasonable proof time, we present a pragmatic formal verification approach of complex ECC cores with several complexity reduction techniques and know-how that were learnt during the course of verification. We discuss using the linearity of the syndrome generator as a helper assertion, using the abstract model as glue logic to compare the RTL with the sequential version of the circuit, k-induction-based model checking and using mathematical relations captured as properties to simplify the verification in order to get an unbounded proof result within 24 hours of proof runtime.

Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable abilities in understanding text, which also introduced the potential for more expressive modeling in text-rich graphs. Despite these capabilities, efficiently applying LLMs to representation learning on graphs presents significant challenges. Recently, parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods for LLMs have enabled efficient new task generalization with minimal time and memory consumption. Inspired by this, we introduce Graph-aware Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning - GPEFT, a novel approach for efficient graph representation learning with LLMs on text-rich graphs. Specifically, we utilize a graph neural network (GNN) to encode structural information from neighboring nodes into a graph prompt. This prompt is then inserted at the beginning of the text sequence. To improve the quality of graph prompts, we pre-trained the GNN to assist the frozen LLM in predicting the next token in the node text. Compared with existing joint GNN and LMs, our method directly generate the node embeddings from large language models with an affordable fine-tuning cost. We validate our approach through comprehensive experiments conducted on 8 different text-rich graphs, observing an average improvement of 2% in hit@1 and Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) in link prediction evaluations. Our results demonstrate the efficacy and efficiency of our model, showing that it can be smoothly integrated with various large language models, including OPT, LLaMA and Falcon. ",

Recently, research has explored various out-of-distribution (OOD) detection situations and techniques to enable a trustworthy medical AI system. In this survey, we systematically review the recent advances in OOD detection in medical image analysis.

On this basis, we design S3-SLAM to achieve rapid and high-quality tracking and mapping through sparsifying plane parameters and integrating orthogonal features of tri-plane. Furthermore, we develop hierarchical bundle adjustment to achieve globally consistent geometric structures and reconstruct high-resolution appearance. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves competitive tracking and scene reconstruction with minimal parameters on three datasets. Source code will soon be available. ",

However, the increased number of FL users may hinder completing large-scale FL over wireless networks due to high imposed latency. Cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output~(CFmMIMO) is a promising architecture for implementing FL because it serves many users on the same time/frequency resources. While CFmMIMO enhances energy efficiency through spatial multiplexing and collaborative beamforming, it remains crucial to meticulously allocate uplink transmission powers to the FL users. In this paper, we propose an uplink power allocation scheme in FL over CFmMIMO by considering the effect of each user's power on the energy and latency of other users to jointly minimize the users' uplink energy and the latency of FL training. The proposed solution algorithm is based on the coordinate gradient descent method. Numerical results show that our proposed method outperforms the well-known max-sum rate by increasing up to~$27$\\% and max-min energy efficiency of the Dinkelbach method by increasing up to~$21$\\% in terms of test accuracy while having limited uplink energy and latency budget for FL over CFmMIMO.

The NN is first trained using Voronoi parameters (cell site locations, thickness, orientation, and anisotropy) to predict the homogenized constitutive properties. This network is then integrated into a conventional TO framework to minimize structural compliance subject to a volume constraint. Special considerations are given for ensuring positive definiteness of the constitutive matrix and promoting macroscale connectivity.

Knowledge distillation and contrastive learning methods are utilized to optimize the knowledge base, and the learned retrieval-enhanced representations can be integrated with arbitrary CTR models in both instance-wise and feature-wise manners.

Each program in the dataset is labelled based on the vulnerabilities detected in its source code through formal verification using the Efficient SMT-based Context-Bounded Model Checker (ESBMC). This technique eliminates false positives by delivering a counterexample and ensures the exclusion of false negatives by completing the verification process. Our study reveals that at least 63.47% of the generated programs are vulnerable. The differences between the models are minor, as they all display similar coding errors with slight variations.

Compared to traditional methods, CNN is more efficient, delivers more dependable results, and has a shorter response time when dealing with uncertainties. While CNN has shown promising results, it does not extract explainable knowledge from the data. To address this limitation, a physics-inspired CNN model is developed by incorporating constraints of the ED problem into the CNN training to ensure that the model follows physical laws while fitting the data. The proposed method can significantly accelerate real-time economic dispatch of microgrids without compromising the accuracy of numerical optimization techniques.

One functionality that unlocks unique use-cases for neural fields in robotics is object 6-DoF registration. In this paper, we provide an expanded analysis of the recent Reg-NF neural field registration method and its use-cases within a robotics context. We showcase the scenario of determining the 6-DoF pose of known objects within a scene using scene and object neural field models. We show how this may be used to better represent objects within imperfectly modelled scenes and generate new scenes by substituting object neural field models into the scene. ",

    "abstract": "With recent advancements in the sixth generation (6G) communication technologies, more vertical industries have encountered diverse network services. How to reduce energy consumption is critical to meet the expectation of the quality of diverse network services. In particular, the number of base stations in 6G is huge with coupled adjustable network parameters. However, the problem is complex with multiple network objectives and parameters. Network intents are difficult to map to individual network elements and require enhanced automation capabilities. In this paper, we present a network intent decomposition and optimization mechanism in an energy-aware radio access network scenario. By characterizing the intent ontology with a standard template, we present a generic network intent representation framework. Then we propose a novel intent modeling method using Knowledge Acquisition in automated Specification language, which can model the network ontology. To clarify the number and types of network objectives and energy-saving operations, we develop a Softgoal Interdependency Graph-based network intent decomposition model, and thus, a network intent decomposition algorithm is presented. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms without conflict analysis in intent decomposition time. Moreover, we design a deep Q-network-assisted intent optimization scheme to validate the performance gain. ",

Furthermore, for sensitive tasks like inspecting cracks, photorealistic mapping is very important. However, the behavior of Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) is computationally constrained. In this paper, we utilize a neural network-based image enhancement method to improve pose estimation and mapping quality and apply a sliding window-based mesh expansion method to enable lightweight, fast, and photorealistic mapping. To validate our results, we utilize real-world and indoor synthetic datasets. We performed qualitative validation with the real-world dataset and quantitative validation by modeling images from the indoor synthetic dataset as underwater scenes. ",

Prior research has approached RowHammer attacks within a static threat model framework. Nonetheless, it warrants consideration within a more nuanced and dynamic model. This paper presents a low-overhead DRAM RowHammer vulnerability profiling technique termed DRAM-Profiler, which utilizes innovative test vectors for categorizing memory cells into distinct security levels. The proposed test vectors intentionally weaken the spatial correlation between the aggressors and victim rows before an attack for evaluation, thus aiding designers in mitigating RowHammer vulnerabilities in the mapping phase. While there has been no previous research showcasing the impact of such profiling to our knowledge, our study methodically assesses 128 commercial DDR4 DRAM products. The results uncover the significant variability among chips from different manufacturers in the type and quantity of RowHammer attacks that can be exploited by adversaries. ",

Extensive evaluations on benchmarks of different design objectives and sizes validate that ICMarks incurs no wirelength and timing metrics degradation, while successfully proving ownership. Furthermore, we demonstrate ICMarks is robust against two major watermarking attack categories, namely, watermark removal and forging attacks; even if the adversaries have prior knowledge of the watermarking schemes, the signatures cannot be removed without significantly undermining the layout quality.

    "abstract": "The core of a good model is in its ability to focus only on important information that reflects the basic patterns and consistencies, thus pulling out a clear, noise-free signal from the dataset. This necessitates using a simplified model defined by fewer parameters. The importance of theoretical foundations becomes clear in this context, as this paper relies on established results from the domain of advanced sparse optimization, particularly those addressing nonlinear differentiable functions. The need for such theoretical foundations is further highlighted by the trend that as computational power for training NNs increases, so does the complexity of the models in terms of a higher number of parameters. In practical scenarios, these large models are often simplified to more manageable versions with fewer parameters. Understanding why these simplified models with less number of parameters remain effective raises a crucial question. Understanding why these simplified models with fewer parameters remain effective raises an important question. This leads to the broader question of whether there is a theoretical framework that can clearly explain these empirical observations. Recent developments, such as establishing necessary conditions for the convergence of iterative hard thresholding (IHT) to a sparse local minimum (a sparse method analogous to gradient descent) are promising. The remarkable capacity of the IHT algorithm to accurately identify and learn the locations of nonzero parameters underscores its practical effectiveness and utility. This paper aims to investigate whether the theoretical prerequisites for such convergence are applicable in the realm of neural network (NN) training by providing justification for all the necessary conditions for convergence. Then, these conditions are validated by experiments on a single-layer NN, using the IRIS dataset as a testbed. ",

Moreover, there exist much more number of controllable parameters that can be adjusted to reduce the energy consumption from a network-wide perspective.

Therefore, it is critical to decompose a network-level energy-saving intent into multiple levels of configurated operations from a top-down refinement perspective. In this work, we utilize a softgoal interdependency graph decomposition model to assist energy-saving scheme design. Meanwhile, we propose an energy-saving approach based on deep Q-network, which achieve a better trade-off among the energy consumption, the throughput, and the first packet delay. In addition, we illustrate how the decomposition model can assist in making energy-saving decisions.

In this paper, we propose Object-Centric Kinematics (OCK), a framework for dynamics prediction leveraging object-centric representations. Our model utilizes a novel component named object kinematics, which comprises low-level structured states of objects' position, velocity, and acceleration. The object kinematics are obtained via either implicit or explicit approaches, enabling comprehensive spatiotemporal object reasoning, and integrated through various transformer mechanisms, facilitating effective object-centric dynamics modeling. Our model demonstrates superior performance when handling objects and backgrounds in complex scenes characterized by a wide range of object attributes and dynamic movements. Moreover, our model demonstrates generalization capabilities across diverse synthetic environments, highlighting its potential for broad applicability in vision-related tasks. ",

    "abstract": "Presently, the task of few-shot object detection (FSOD) in remote sensing images (RSIs) has become a focal point of attention. Numerous few-shot detectors, particularly those based on two-stage detectors, face challenges when dealing with the multiscale complexities inherent in RSIs. Moreover, these detectors present impractical characteristics in real-world applications, mainly due to their unwieldy model parameters when handling large amount of data. In contrast, we recognize the advantages of one-stage detectors, including high detection speed and a global receptive field. Consequently, we choose the YOLOv7 one-stage detector as a baseline and subject it to a novel meta-learning training framework. This transformation allows the detector to adeptly address FSOD tasks while capitalizing on its inherent advantage of lightweight. Additionally, we thoroughly investigate the samples generated by the meta-learning strategy and introduce a novel meta-sampling approach to retain samples produced by our designed meta-detection head. Coupled with our devised meta-cross loss, we deliberately utilize ``negative samples\" that are often overlooked to extract valuable knowledge from them. This approach serves to enhance detection accuracy and efficiently refine the overall meta-learning strategy. To validate the effectiveness of our proposed detector, we conducted performance comparisons with current state-of-the-art detectors using the DIOR and NWPU VHR-10.v2 datasets, yielding satisfactory results.

In this study, we explore a universal model that can flexibly adapt to unseen dense label structures with a few examples, enabling it to serve as a data-efficient vision generalist in diverse real-world scenarios. To this end, we base our method on a powerful meta-learning framework and explore several axes to improve its performance and versatility for real-world problems, such as flexible adaptation mechanisms and scalability. We evaluate our model across a spectrum of unseen real-world scenarios where low-shot learning is desirable, including video, 3D, medical, biological, and user-interactive tasks.

While previous studies have used deep learning-based models to obtain a general view of ECCs, they often fail to capture detailed, complex information. Our study introduces a novel framework: \\textbf{ECC Analyzer}, combining Large Language Models (LLMs) and multi-modal techniques to extract richer, more predictive insights. The model begins by summarizing the transcript's structure and analyzing the speakers' mode and confidence level by detecting variations in tone and pitch for audio. This analysis helps investors form an overview perception of the ECCs. Moreover, this model uses the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) based methods to meticulously extract the focuses that have a significant impact on stock performance from an expert's perspective, providing a more targeted analysis. The model goes a step further by enriching these extracted focuses with additional layers of analysis, such as sentiment and audio segment features. By integrating these insights, the ECC Analyzer performs multi-task predictions of stock performance, including volatility, value-at-risk (VaR), and return for different intervals. The results show that our model outperforms traditional analytic benchmarks, confirming the effectiveness of using advanced LLM techniques in financial analytics. ",

    "abstract": "Base station densification is one of the key approaches for delivering high capacity in radio access networks. However, current static deployments are often impractical and financially unsustainable, as they increase both capital and operational expenditures of the network. An alternative paradigm is the moving base stations (MBSs) approach, by which part of base stations are installed on vehicles. However, to the best of our knowledge, it is still unclear if and up to which point MBSs allow decreasing the number of static base stations (BSs) deployed in urban settings. In this work, we start tackling this issue by proposing a modeling approach for a first-order evaluation of potential infrastructure savings enabled by the MBSs paradigm. Starting from a set of stochastic geometry results, and a traffic demand profile over time, we formulate an optimization problem for the derivation of the optimal combination of moving and static BSs which minimizes the overall amount of BSs deployed, while guaranteeing a target mean QoS for users. Initial results on a two-district scenario with measurement-based network traffic profiles suggest that substantial infrastructure savings are achievable. We show that these results are robust against different values of user density. ",

However, recent studies have shown that deep learning models can be vulnerable to adversarial attacks. In this paper, we systematically assess this problem by examining the impact of various adversarial white-box and black-box attacks on different languages and genders within the context of SER. We first propose a suitable methodology for audio data processing, feature extraction, and CNN-LSTM architecture. The observed outcomes highlighted the significant vulnerability of CNN-LSTM models to adversarial examples (AEs). In fact, all the considered adversarial attacks are able to significantly reduce the performance of the constructed models. Furthermore, when assessing the efficacy of the attacks, minor differences were noted between the languages analyzed as well as between male and female speech. In summary, this work contributes to the understanding of the robustness of CNN-LSTM models, particularly in SER scenarios, and the impact of AEs. Interestingly, our findings serve as a baseline for a) developing more robust algorithms for SER, b) designing more effective attacks, c) investigating possible defenses, d) improved understanding of the vocal differences between different languages and genders, and e) overall, enhancing our comprehension of the SER task.

    "abstract": "Structural decoupling has played an essential role in model-based fault isolation and estimation in past decades, which facilitates accurate fault localization and reconstruction thanks to the diagonal transfer matrix design. However, traditional methods exhibit limited effectiveness in modeling high-dimensional nonlinearity and big data, and the decoupling idea has not been well-valued in data-driven frameworks. Known for big data and complex feature extraction capabilities, deep learning has recently been used to develop residual generation models. Nevertheless, it lacks decoupling-related diagnostic designs. To this end, this paper proposes a transfer learning-based input-output decoupled network (TDN) for diagnostic purposes, which consists of an input-output decoupled network (IDN) and a pre-trained variational autocoder (VAE). In IDN, uncorrelated residual variables are generated by diagonalization and parallel computing operations. During the transfer learning phase, knowledge of normal status is provided according to VAE's loss and maximum mean discrepancy loss to guide the training of IDN. After training, IDN learns the mapping from faulty to normal, thereby serving as the fault detection index and the estimated fault signal simultaneously. At last, the effectiveness of the developed TDN is verified by a numerical example and a chemical simulation. ",

    "abstract": "Recent state-of-the-art forecasting methods are trained on collections of time series. These methods, often referred to as global models, can capture common patterns in different time series to improve their generalization performance. However, they require large amounts of data that might not be readily available. Besides this, global models sometimes fail to capture relevant patterns unique to a particular time series. In these cases, data augmentation can be useful to increase the sample size of time series datasets. The main contribution of this work is a novel method for generating univariate time series synthetic samples. Our approach stems from the insight that the observations concerning a particular time series of interest represent only a small fraction of all observations. In this context, we frame the problem of training a forecasting model as an imbalanced learning task. Oversampling strategies are popular approaches used to deal with the imbalance problem in machine learning. We use these techniques to create synthetic time series observations and improve the accuracy of forecasting models. We carried out experiments using 7 different databases that contain a total of 5502 univariate time series. We found that the proposed solution outperforms both a global and a local model, thus providing a better trade-off between these two approaches. ",

    "abstract": "Domain decomposition provides an effective way to tackle the dilemma of physics-informed neural networks (PINN) which struggle to accurately and efficiently solve partial differential equations (PDEs) in the whole domain, but the lack of efficient tools for dealing with the interfaces between two adjacent sub-domains heavily hinders the training effects, even leads to the discontinuity of the learned solutions. In this paper, we propose a symmetry group based domain decomposition strategy to enhance the PINN for solving the forward and inverse problems of the PDEs possessing a Lie symmetry group. Specifically, for the forward problem, we first deploy the symmetry group to generate the dividing-lines having known solution information which can be adjusted flexibly and are used to divide the whole training domain into a finite number of non-overlapping sub-domains, then utilize the PINN and the symmetry-enhanced PINN methods to learn the solutions in each sub-domain and finally stitch them to the overall solution of PDEs. For the inverse problem, we first utilize the symmetry group acting on the data of the initial and boundary conditions to generate labeled data in the interior domain of PDEs and then find the undetermined parameters as well as the solution by only training the neural networks in a sub-domain. Consequently, the proposed method can predict high-accuracy solutions of PDEs which are failed by the vanilla PINN in the whole domain and the extended physics-informed neural network in the same sub-domains. Numerical results of the Korteweg-de Vries equation with a translation symmetry and the nonlinear viscous fluid equation with a scaling symmetry show that the accuracies of the learned solutions are improved largely.

Unlike methods that alter portions of an image, the creation of completely synthetic images presents a unique challenge and several Synthetic Image Detection (SID) methods have recently appeared to tackle it.

To better address the evaluation needs of SID and help close this gap, this paper introduces a benchmarking framework that integrates several state-of-the-art SID models. Our selection of integrated models was based on the utilization of varied input features, and different network architectures, aiming to encompass a broad spectrum of techniques. The framework leverages recent datasets with a diverse set of generative models, high level of photo-realism and resolution, reflecting the rapid improvements in image synthesis technology. Additionally, the framework enables the study of how image transformations, common in assets shared online, such as JPEG compression, affect detection performance.

    "abstract": "Autoregressive Recurrent Neural Networks are widely employed in time-series forecasting tasks, demonstrating effectiveness in univariate and certain multivariate scenarios. However, their inherent structure does not readily accommodate the integration of future, time-dependent covariates. A proposed solution, outlined by Salinas et al 2019, suggests forecasting both covariates and the target variable in a multivariate framework. In this study, we conducted comprehensive tests on publicly available time-series datasets, artificially introducing highly correlated covariates to future time-step values. Our evaluation aimed to assess the performance of an LSTM network when considering these covariates and compare it against a univariate baseline. As part of this study we introduce a novel approach using seasonal time segments in combination with an RNN architecture, which is both simple and extremely effective over long forecast horizons with comparable performance to many state of the art architectures. Our findings from the results of more than 120 models reveal that under certain conditions jointly training covariates with target variables can improve overall performance of the model, but often there exists a significant performance disparity between multivariate and univariate predictions. Surprisingly, even when provided with covariates informing the network about future target values, multivariate predictions exhibited inferior performance. In essence, compelling the network to predict multiple values can prove detrimental to model performance, even in the presence of informative covariates. These results suggest that LSTM architectures may not be suitable for forecasting tasks where predicting covariates would typically be expected to enhance model accuracy. ",

However, to realize the promise of WNoC, multiple wireless links operating at several tens of Gb/s need to be created within a computing package. Unfortunately, the highly integrated and enclosed nature of such computing packages incurs significant Co-Channel Interference (CCI) and Inter-Symbol Interference (ISI), not only preventing the deployment of multiple spatial channels, but also severely limiting the symbol rate of each individual channel. In this work, Time Reversal (TR) is proposed as a means to compensate the channel impairments and enable multiple concurrent high-speed links at the chip scale. We offer evidence, via full-wave simulations at 140 GHz, that TR can increase the symbol rate by an order of magnitude and allow the deployment of multiple concurrent links towards achieving aggregate speeds in excess of 100 Gb/s. Finally, the challenges relative to the realization of TR at the chip scale are analyzed from the implementation, protocol support, and architectural perspectives. ",

However, the cybersecurity vulnerabilities and implications arising from the widespread integration of these models are not yet fully understood due to limited research in this domain. To bridge this gap, this paper presents EvilInstructCoder, a framework specifically designed to assess the cybersecurity vulnerabilities of instruction-tuned Code LLMs to adversarial attacks. EvilInstructCoder introduces the Adversarial Code Injection Engine to automatically generate malicious code snippets and inject them into benign code to poison instruction tuning datasets. It incorporates practical threat models to reflect real-world adversaries with varying capabilities and evaluates the exploitability of instruction-tuned Code LLMs under these diverse adversarial attack scenarios. Through the use of EvilInstructCoder, we conduct a comprehensive investigation into the exploitability of instruction tuning for coding tasks using three state-of-the-art Code LLM models: CodeLlama, DeepSeek-Coder, and StarCoder2, under various adversarial attack scenarios. Our experimental results reveal a significant vulnerability in these models, demonstrating that adversaries can manipulate the models to generate malicious payloads within benign code contexts in response to natural language instructions. For instance, under the backdoor attack setting, by poisoning only 81 samples (0.5\\% of the entire instruction dataset), we achieve Attack Success Rate at 1 (ASR@1) scores ranging from 76\\% to 86\\% for different model families. Our study sheds light on the critical cybersecurity vulnerabilities posed by instruction-tuned Code LLMs and emphasizes the urgent necessity for robust defense mechanisms to mitigate the identified vulnerabilities.

Modern game economies are becoming increasingly complex and can be very sensitive to even minor numerical adjustments, which may have an unexpected impact on the overall gaming experience. Consequently, thorough manual testing and fine-tuning during development are essential. Unlike existing works that address algorithmic balancing for specific games or genres, this work adopts a more abstract approach, focusing on game balancing through its economy, detached from a specific game. We propose GEEvo (Game Economy Evolution), a framework to generate graph-based game economies and balancing both, newly generated or existing economies. GEEvo uses a two-step approach where evolutionary algorithms are used to first generate an economy and then balance it based on specified objectives, such as generated resources or damage dealt over time. We define different objectives by differently parameterizing the fitness function using data from multiple simulation runs of the economy. To support this, we define a lightweight and flexible game economy simulation framework. Our method is tested and benchmarked with various balancing objectives on a generated dataset, and we conduct a case study evaluating damage balancing for two fictional economies of two popular game character classes.

Despite these advantages, virtual simulations often fail to accurately replicate real-world conditions like image fidelity, texture representation, and environmental accuracy. This can lead to significant differences in ADS behavior between simulated and real-world domains, a phenomenon known as the sim2real gap. Researchers have used Image-to-Image (I2I) neural translation to mitigate the sim2real gap, enhancing the realism of simulated environments by transforming synthetic data into more authentic representations of real-world conditions. However, while promising, these techniques may potentially introduce artifacts, distortions, or inconsistencies in the generated data that can affect the effectiveness of ADS testing. In our empirical study, we investigated how the quality of image-to-image (I2I) techniques influences the mitigation of the sim2real gap, using a set of established metrics from the literature. We evaluated two popular generative I2I architectures, pix2pix, and CycleGAN, across two ADS perception tasks at a model level, namely vehicle detection and end-to-end lane keeping, using paired simulated and real-world datasets. Our findings reveal that the effectiveness of I2I architectures varies across different ADS tasks, and existing evaluation metrics do not consistently align with the ADS behavior. Thus, we conducted task-specific fine-tuning of perception metrics, which yielded a stronger correlation. Our findings indicate that a perception metric that incorporates semantic elements, tailored to each task, can facilitate selecting the most appropriate I2I technique for a reliable assessment of the sim2real gap mitigation.

In this work, we generalize to a robustness setting that allows for punctual transitions in the automaton to be taken by controller with no perturbation. In order to characterize cycles that resist perturbations in our setting, we introduce a new structural requirement on the reachability relation along an accepting cycle of the automaton. This property is formulated on the region abstraction, and generalizes the existing characterization of winning cycles in the absence of punctual guards. We show that the problem remains within PSPACE despite the presence of punctual guards. ",

    "abstract": "Dynamic fluctuations in the wind field to which a wind turbine (WT) is exposed to are responsible for fatigue loads on its components. To reduce structural loads in WTs, advanced control schemes have been proposed. In recent years, prognosis-based lifetime control of WTs has become increasingly important. In this approach, the prognostic controller gains are adapted based on the stateof-health (SOH) of the WT component to achieve the desired lifetime. However, stochastic wind dynamics complicates estimation of the SOH of a WT. More recently, robust controllers have been combined with real-time damage evaluation models to meet prognosis objectives. Most rely on model-based online load cycle counting algorithms to determine fatigue damage, with analytical models providing the degradation estimate. However, most use load measurements that are either unreliable or unavailable in commercial WTs, limiting their practicality. In this contribution, a hybrid prognosis scheme combining data-driven load prediction and model-based damage estimation models for robust lifetime control of commercial WTs is proposed. A data-driven support vector machine (SVM) regression model is trained using loading data obtained from dynamic simulations using a {\\mu}-synthesis robust disturbance accommodating controller (RDAC). The regression model uses available WT measurements to predict tower load. Based on this prediction, an online rain-flow counting (RFC) damage evaluation model estimates the damage level and lifetime of the tower. The RDAC controller gains are dynamically adapted to achieve a predefined damage limit and lifetime. The proposed approach is evaluated on a 5 MW reference WT and its performance is compared with a model-based prognosis scheme using ideal WT tower measurement. Results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach to control the fatigue lifetime in WT components. ",

Despite the recent progress, the data uncertainty issue, reflected as the content evolution process and dynamic correlation in event labels, has been somehow ignored. This reduces the model generalization ability and deep understanding on video content, leading to serious error accumulation and degraded performance. In this paper, we address the uncertainty learning problem and propose an uncertainty-boosted robust video activity anticipation framework, which generates uncertainty values to indicate the credibility of the anticipation results. The uncertainty value is used to derive a temperature parameter in the softmax function to modulate the predicted target activity distribution. To guarantee the distribution adjustment, we construct a reasonable target activity label representation by incorporating the activity evolution from the temporal class correlation and the semantic relationship. Moreover, we quantify the uncertainty into relative values by comparing the uncertainty among sample pairs and their temporal-lengths. This relative strategy provides a more accessible way in uncertainty modeling than quantifying the absolute uncertainty values on the whole dataset.

    "title": "Enhancing Uncertain Demand Prediction in Hospitals Using Simple and  Advanced Machine Learning",
    "abstract": "Early and timely prediction of patient care demand not only affects effective resource allocation but also influences clinical decision-making as well as patient experience. Accurately predicting patient care demand, however, is a ubiquitous challenge for hospitals across the world due, in part, to the demand's time-varying temporal variability, and, in part, to the difficulty in modelling trends in advance. To address this issue, here, we develop two methods, a relatively simple time-vary linear model, and a more advanced neural network model. The former forecasts patient arrivals hourly over a week based on factors such as day of the week and previous 7-day arrival patterns. The latter leverages a long short-term memory (LSTM) model, capturing non-linear relationships between past data and a three-day forecasting window. We evaluate the predictive capabilities of the two proposed approaches compared to two na\\\"ive approaches - a reduced-rank vector autoregressive (VAR) model and the TBATS model. Using patient care demand data from Rambam Medical Center in Israel, our results show that both proposed models effectively capture hourly variations of patient demand. Additionally, the linear model is more explainable thanks to its simple architecture, whereas, by accurately modelling weekly seasonal trends, the LSTM model delivers lower prediction errors. Taken together, our explorations suggest the utility of machine learning in predicting time-varying patient care demand; additionally, it is possible to predict patient care demand with good accuracy (around 4 patients) three days or a week in advance using machine learning.

    "abstract": "The natural interaction between robots and pedestrians in the process of autonomous navigation is crucial for the intelligent development of mobile robots, which requires robots to fully consider social rules and guarantee the psychological comfort of pedestrians. Among the research results in the field of robotic path planning, the learning-based socially adaptive algorithms have performed well in some specific human-robot interaction environments. However, human-robot interaction scenarios are diverse and constantly changing in daily life, and the generalization of robot socially adaptive path planning remains to be further investigated. In order to address this issue, this work proposes a new socially adaptive path planning algorithm by combining the generative adversarial network (GAN) with the Optimal Rapidly-exploring Random Tree (RRT*) navigation algorithm. Firstly, a GAN model with strong generalization performance is proposed to adapt the navigation algorithm to more scenarios. Secondly, a GAN model based Optimal Rapidly-exploring Random Tree navigation algorithm (GAN-RRT*) is proposed to generate paths in human-robot interaction environments. Finally, we propose a socially adaptive path planning framework named GAN-RTIRL, which combines the GAN model with Rapidly-exploring random Trees Inverse Reinforcement Learning (RTIRL) to improve the homotopy rate between planned and demonstration paths. In the GAN-RTIRL framework, the GAN-RRT* path planner can update the GAN model from the demonstration path. In this way, the robot can generate more anthropomorphic paths in human-robot interaction environments and has stronger generalization in more complex environments. Experimental results reveal that our proposed method can effectively improve the anthropomorphic degree of robot motion planning and the homotopy rate between planned and demonstration paths. ",

Vertex colouring is one of the most fundamental questions about a graph. In this paper, we study the vertex colouring problem in the differentially private setting. To be edge-differentially private, a colouring algorithm needs to be defective: a colouring is d-defective if a vertex can share a colour with at most d of its neighbours. Without defectiveness, the only differentially private colouring algorithm needs to assign n different colours to the n different vertices. We show the following lower bound for the defectiveness: a differentially private c-edge colouring algorithm of a graph of maximum degree {\\Delta} > 0 has defectiveness at least d = {\\Omega} (log n / (log c+log {\\Delta})). We also present an {\\epsilon}-differentially private algorithm to {\\Theta} ( {\\Delta} / log n + 1 / {\\epsilon})-colour a graph with defectiveness at most {\\Theta}(log n). ",

This paper proposes an adversarial framework to uncover the vulnerability of permutation-based interpretation methods for machine learning tasks, with a particular focus on partial dependence (PD) plots. This adversarial framework modifies the original black box model to manipulate its predictions for instances in the extrapolation domain. As a result, it produces deceptive PD plots that can conceal discriminatory behaviors while preserving most of the original model's predictions. This framework can produce multiple fooled PD plots via a single model. By using real-world datasets including an auto insurance claims dataset and COMPAS (Correctional Offender Management Profiling for Alternative Sanctions) dataset, our results show that it is possible to intentionally hide the discriminatory behavior of a predictor and make the black-box model appear neutral through interpretation tools like PD plots while retaining almost all the predictions of the original black-box model.

Tackling VAD in real-life settings poses significant challenges due to the dynamic nature of human actions, environmental variations, and domain shifts. Many research initiatives neglect these complexities, often concentrating on traditional testing methods that fail to account for performance on unseen datasets, creating a gap between theoretical models and their real-world utility. Online learning is a potential strategy to mitigate this issue by allowing models to adapt to new information continuously. This paper assesses how well current VAD algorithms can adjust to real-life conditions through an online learning framework, particularly those based on pose analysis, for their efficiency and privacy advantages. Our proposed framework enables continuous model updates with streaming data from novel environments, thus mirroring actual world challenges and evaluating the models' ability to adapt in real-time while maintaining accuracy. We investigate three state-of-the-art models in this setting, focusing on their adaptability across different domains. Our findings indicate that, even under the most challenging conditions, our online learning approach allows a model to preserve 89.39% of its original effectiveness compared to its offline-trained counterpart in a specific target domain.

We focus on social ranking solutions consistent with the desirability relation and propose complementary sets of properties for the axiomatic characterization of five existing solutions: Ceteris Paribus (CP-)majority, lexicographic excellence (lex-cel), dual-lex, $L^{(1)}$ solution and its dual version $L^{(1)}_{*}$ . These characterizations reveal additional similarities among the five solutions and emphasize the essential characteristics that should be taken into account when selecting a social ranking.

In this work, we take inspiration from neuroscience and employ representational approaches to shed light on how neural networks encode information at low (visual saliency) and high (semantic similarity) levels of abstraction. Moreover, we introduce a custom image dataset where we systematically manipulate salient and semantic information. We find that ResNets are more sensitive to saliency information than ViTs, when trained with object classification objectives. We uncover that networks suppress saliency in early layers, a process enhanced by natural language supervision (CLIP) in ResNets. CLIP also enhances semantic encoding in both architectures. Finally, we show that semantic encoding is a key factor in aligning AI with human visual perception, while saliency suppression is a non-brain-like strategy. ",

In this paper we take some prototypical examples and, under standard hypothesis concerning the neural network convergence, we show that the optimal time sampling follows a truncated exponential distribution. In particular we explain when the time sampling is best to be uniform and when it should not be.

We then employ a meta-neural network to generalize the barrier certificates to state space regions that are outside the training set. These certificates are generated and validated online as sound over-approximations of the reachable states, thus either ensuring system safety or activating appropriate alternative actions in unsafe scenarios.

Therefore, it calls for a holistic review of current advances and an investigation on the challenges and opportunities for highly usable FL systems with a DP guarantee. In this article, we first introduce the primary concepts of FL and DP, and highlight the benefits of integration. We then review the current developments by categorizing different paradigms and notions.

However, numerous feature engineering based methods suffer from a limitation in mining behavioral semantic information, thus impeding the accuracy and efficiency of Android malware detection. Besides, the majority of existing feature engineering based methods are weakly interpretive and fail to furnish researchers with effective and readable detection reports. Inspired by the success of the Large Language Models (LLMs) in natural language understanding, we propose AppPoet, a LLM-assisted multi-view system for Android malware detection. Firstly, AppPoet employs a static method to comprehensively collect application features and formulate various observation views. Subsequently, it steers the LLM to produce function descriptions and behavioral summaries for views via our meticulously devised multi-view prompt engineering technique to realize the deep mining of view semantics. Finally, we collaboratively fuse the multi-view information to efficiently and accurately detect malware through a deep neural network (DNN) classifier and then generate the heuristic diagnostic reports. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves a detection accuracy of 97.15% and an F1 score of 97.21%, which is superior to the baseline method Drebin and its variant. Furthermore, the case study evaluates the effectiveness of our generated diagnostic reports. ",

Current Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) methods in CIM rely on simplistic binary opinion models (i.e., an opinion is represented by either 0 or 1) and often overlook the complexity of users' behavioral characteristics and their prior knowledge. We propose a novel DRL-based framework that enhances CIM analysis by integrating Subjective Logic (SL) to accommodate uncertain opinions, users' behaviors, and their preferences. This approach targets the mitigation of false information by effectively propagating true information. By modeling two competitive agents, one spreading true information and the other spreading false information, we capture the strategic interplay essential to CIM. Our framework utilizes an uncertainty-based opinion model (UOM) to assess the impact on information quality in OSNs, emphasizing the importance of user behavior alongside network topology in selecting influential seed nodes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving faster and more influential results (i.e., outperforming over 20%) under realistic network conditions. Moreover, our method shows robust performance in partially observable networks, effectively doubling the performance when users are predisposed to disbelieve true information. ",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we present a different way to use two modalities, in which either one modality or the other is seen by a single model. This can be useful when adapting an unimodal model to leverage more information while respecting a limited computational budget. This would mean having a single model that is able to deal with any modalities. To describe this, we coined the term anymodal learning. An example of this, is a use case where, surveillance in a room when the lights are off would be much more valuable using an infrared modality while a visible one would provide more discriminative information when lights are on. This work investigates how to efficiently leverage visible and infrared/thermal modalities for transformer-based object detection backbone to create an anymodal architecture. Our work does not create any inference overhead during the testing while exploring an effective way to exploit the two modalities during the training. To accomplish such a task, we introduce the novel anymodal training technique: Mixed Patches (MiPa), in conjunction with a patch-wise domain agnostic module, which is responsible of learning the best way to find a common representation of both modalities. This approach proves to be able to balance modalities by reaching competitive results on individual modality benchmarks with the alternative of using an unimodal architecture on three different visible-infrared object detection datasets. Finally, our proposed method, when used as a regularization for the strongest modality, can beat the performance of multimodal fusion methods while only requiring a single modality during inference. Notably, MiPa became the state-of-the-art on the LLVIP visible/infrared benchmark. Code: https://github.com/heitorrapela/MiPa ",

    "abstract": "Model predictive control (MPC) is a powerful, optimization-based approach for controlling dynamical systems. However, the computational complexity of online optimization can be problematic on embedded devices. Especially, when we need to guarantee fixed control frequencies. Thus, previous work proposed to reduce the computational burden using imitation learning (IL) approximating the MPC policy by a neural network. In this work, we instead learn the whole planned trajectory of the MPC. We introduce a combination of a novel neural network architecture PlanNetX and a simple loss function based on the state trajectory that leverages the parameterized optimal control structure of the MPC. We validate our approach in the context of autonomous driving by learning a longitudinal planner and benchmarking it extensively in the CommonRoad simulator using synthetic scenarios and scenarios derived from real data. Our experimental results show that we can learn the open-loop MPC trajectory with high accuracy while improving the closed-loop performance of the learned control policy over other baselines like behavior cloning.

    "abstract": "Optimizing scientific software is a difficult task because codebases are often large and complex, and performance can depend upon several factors including the algorithm, its implementation, and hardware among others. Causes of poor performance can originate from disparate sources and be difficult to diagnose. Recent years have seen a multitude of work that use large language models (LLMs) to assist in software development tasks. However, these tools are trained to model the distribution of code as text, and are not specifically designed to understand performance aspects of code. In this work, we introduce a reinforcement learning based methodology to align the outputs of code LLMs with performance. This allows us to build upon the current code modeling capabilities of LLMs and extend them to generate better performing code. We demonstrate that our fine-tuned model improves the expected speedup of generated code over base models for a set of benchmark tasks from 0.9 to 1.6 for serial code and 1.9 to 4.5 for OpenMP code.

    "abstract": "To overcome the sim-to-real gap in reinforcement learning (RL), learned policies must maintain robustness against environmental uncertainties. While robust RL has been widely studied in single-agent regimes, in multi-agent environments, the problem remains understudied -- despite the fact that the problems posed by environmental uncertainties are often exacerbated by strategic interactions. This work focuses on learning in distributionally robust Markov games (RMGs), a robust variant of standard Markov games, wherein each agent aims to learn a policy that maximizes its own worst-case performance when the deployed environment deviates within its own prescribed uncertainty set. This results in a set of robust equilibrium strategies for all agents that align with classic notions of game-theoretic equilibria. Assuming a non-adaptive sampling mechanism from a generative model, we propose a sample-efficient model-based algorithm (DRNVI) with finite-sample complexity guarantees for learning robust variants of various notions of game-theoretic equilibria. We also establish an information-theoretic lower bound for solving RMGs, which confirms the near-optimal sample complexity of DRNVI with respect to problem-dependent factors such as the size of the state space, the target accuracy, and the horizon length.

Focusing on the transitions between the hexapod gaits with specific symmetries, the six phase equations of the CPG network can further be reduced to two independent equations for the phase differences. By choosing appropriate coupling functions for the network, we can achieve desired synchronization dynamics regardless of the detailed properties of the limit-cycle oscillators used for the CPG. The effectiveness of our CPG network is demonstrated by numerical simulations of gait transitions between the wave, tetrapod, and tripod gaits, using the FitzHugh-Nagumo oscillator as the CPG unit.

The proposed model benefits from the physics-based knowledge contained in the constitutive models used in the full-order micromodel by embedding them in a neural network. Following previous developments, this paper extends the applicability of the physically recurrent neural network (PRNN) by introducing an architecture suitable for rate-dependent materials in a finite strain framework. In this model, the homogenized deformation gradient of the micromodel is encoded into a set of deformation gradients serving as input to the embedded constitutive models. These constitutive models compute stresses, which are combined in a decoder to predict the homogenized stress, such that the internal variables of the history-dependent constitutive models naturally provide physics-based memory for the network. To demonstrate the capabilities of the surrogate model, we consider a unidirectional composite micromodel with transversely isotropic elastic fibers and elasto-viscoplastic matrix material. The extrapolation properties of the surrogate model trained to replace such micromodel are tested on loading scenarios unseen during training, ranging from different strain-rates to cyclic loading and relaxation. Speed-ups of three orders of magnitude with respect to the runtime of the original micromodel are obtained. ",

    "abstract": "Limited-angle and sparse-view computed tomography (LACT and SVCT) are crucial for expanding the scope of X-ray CT applications. However, they face challenges due to incomplete data acquisition, resulting in diverse artifacts in the reconstructed CT images. Emerging implicit neural representation (INR) techniques, such as NeRF, NeAT, and NeRP, have shown promise in under-determined CT imaging reconstruction tasks. However, the unsupervised nature of INR architecture imposes limited constraints on the solution space, particularly for the highly ill-posed reconstruction task posed by LACT and ultra-SVCT. In this study, we introduce the Diffusion Prior Driven Neural Representation (DPER), an advanced unsupervised framework designed to address the exceptionally ill-posed CT reconstruction inverse problems. DPER adopts the Half Quadratic Splitting (HQS) algorithm to decompose the inverse problem into data fidelity and distribution prior sub-problems. The two sub-problems are respectively addressed by INR reconstruction scheme and pre-trained score-based diffusion model. This combination initially preserves the implicit image local consistency prior from INR. Additionally, it effectively augments the feasibility of the solution space for the inverse problem through the generative diffusion model, resulting in increased stability and precision in the solutions. We conduct comprehensive experiments to evaluate the performance of DPER on LACT and ultra-SVCT reconstruction with two public datasets (AAPM and LIDC). The results show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art reconstruction methods on in-domain datasets, while achieving significant performance improvements on out-of-domain datasets. ",

For the first task, VGON greatly reduces the optimization time compared to stochastic gradient descent while generating nearly optimal quantum states. For the second task, VGON alleviates the barren plateau problem in variational quantum circuits. For the final task, VGON can identify the degenerate ground state spaces after a single stage of training and generate a variety of states therein. ",

    "abstract": "Causal inference methods for observational data are highly regarded due to their wide applicability. While there are already numerous methods available for de-confounding bias, these methods generally assume that covariates consist solely of confounders or make naive assumptions about the covariates. Such assumptions face challenges in both theory and practice, particularly when dealing with high-dimensional covariates. Relaxing these naive assumptions and identifying the confounding covariates that truly require correction can effectively enhance the practical significance of these methods. Therefore, this paper proposes a General Causal Inference (GCI) framework specifically designed for cross-sectional observational data, which precisely identifies the key confounding covariates and provides corresponding identification algorithm. Specifically, based on progressive derivations of the Markov property on Directed Acyclic Graph, we conclude that the key confounding covariates are equivalent to the common root ancestors of the treatment and the outcome variable. Building upon this conclusion, the GCI framework is composed of a novel Ancestor Set Identification (ASI) algorithm and de-confounding inference methods. Firstly, the ASI algorithm is theoretically supported by the conditional independence properties and causal asymmetry between variables, enabling the identification of key confounding covariates. Subsequently, the identified confounding covariates are used in the de-confounding inference methods to obtain unbiased causal effect estimation, which can support informed decision-making. Extensive experiments on synthetic datasets demonstrate that the GCI framework can effectively identify the critical confounding covariates and significantly improve the precision, stability, and interpretability of causal inference in observational studies.

Equipped with the formalism of geometric quantum machine learning, in this work we propose the architectures of equivariant quantum convolutional neural networks (EQCNNs) adherent to $S_{n}$ and its subgroups. We demonstrate that a careful choice of pixel-to-qubit embedding order can facilitate easy construction of EQCNNs for small subgroups of $S_{n}$. Our novel EQCNN architecture corresponding to the full permutation group $S_{n}$ is built by applying all possible QCNNs with equal probability, which can also be conceptualized as a dropout strategy in quantum neural networks. For subgroups of $S_{n}$, our numerical results using MNIST datasets show better classification accuracy than non-equivariant QCNNs. The $S_{n}$-equivariant QCNN architecture shows significantly improved training and test performance than non-equivariant QCNN for classification of connected and non-connected graphs. When trained with sufficiently large number of data, the $S_{n}$-equivariant QCNN shows better average performance compared to $S_{n}$-equivariant QNN .

In this study, we define the variables to represent LaS and the constraints on these variables. Leveraging this formulation, we develop a synthesizer for LaS, LaSsynth, that encodes a LaS construction problem into a SAT instance, subsequently querying SAT solvers for a solution. Starting from a baseline design, we can gradually invoke the solver with shrinking spacetime volume to derive more compact designs. Due to our foundational formulation and the use of SAT solvers, LaSsynth can exhaustively explore the design space, yielding optimal designs in volume.

    "abstract": "Purpose: Paranasal anomalies, frequently identified in routine radiological screenings, exhibit diverse morphological characteristics. Due to the diversity of anomalies, supervised learning methods require large labelled dataset exhibiting diverse anomaly morphology. Self-supervised learning (SSL) can be used to learn representations from unlabelled data. However, there are no SSL methods designed for the downstream task of classifying paranasal anomalies in the maxillary sinus (MS). Methods: Our approach uses a 3D Convolutional Autoencoder (CAE) trained in an unsupervised anomaly detection (UAD) framework. Initially, we train the 3D CAE to reduce reconstruction errors when reconstructing normal maxillary sinus (MS) image. Then, this CAE is applied to an unlabelled dataset to generate coarse anomaly locations by creating residual MS images. Following this, a 3D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) reconstructs these residual images, which forms our SSL task. Lastly, we fine-tune the encoder part of the 3D CNN on a labelled dataset of normal and anomalous MS images. Results: The proposed SSL technique exhibits superior performance compared to existing generic self-supervised methods, especially in scenarios with limited annotated data. When trained on just 10% of the annotated dataset, our method achieves an Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve (AUPRC) of 0.79 for the downstream classification task. This performance surpasses other methods, with BYOL attaining an AUPRC of 0.75, SimSiam at 0.74, SimCLR at 0.73 and Masked Autoencoding using SparK at 0.75. Conclusion: A self-supervised learning approach that inherently focuses on localizing paranasal anomalies proves to be advantageous, particularly when the subsequent task involves differentiating normal from anomalous maxillary sinuses.

In this paper, we study a suitable function space for over-parameterized two-layer neural networks with bounded norms (e.g., the path norm, the Barron norm) in the perspective of sample complexity and generalization properties. First, we show that the path norm (as well as the Barron norm) is able to obtain width-independence sample complexity bounds, which allows for uniform convergence guarantees. Based on this result, we derive the improved result of metric entropy for $\\epsilon$-covering up to $\\mathcal{O}(\\epsilon^{-\\frac{2d}{d+2}})$ ($d$ is the input dimension and the depending constant is at most polynomial order of $d$) via the convex hull technique, which demonstrates the separation with kernel methods with $\\Omega(\\epsilon^{-d})$ to learn the target function in a Barron space. Second, this metric entropy result allows for building a sharper generalization bound under a general moment hypothesis setting, achieving the rate at $\\mathcal{O}(n^{-\\frac{d+2}{2d+2}})$. Our analysis is novel in that it offers a sharper and refined estimation for metric entropy (with a clear dependence relationship on the dimension $d$) and unbounded sampling in the estimation of the sample error and the output error.
