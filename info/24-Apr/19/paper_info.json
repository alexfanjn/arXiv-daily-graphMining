However, their high computational complexity and vulnerability to adversarial attacks are ongoing challenges. In this letter, approximate multipliers are used to explore DNN robustness improvement against adversarial attacks. By uniformly replacing accurate multipliers for state-of-the-art approximate ones in DNN layer models, we explore the DNNs robustness against various adversarial attacks in a feasible time. Results show up to 7% accuracy drop due to approximations when no attack is present while improving robust accuracy up to 10% when attacks applied. ",

    "abstract": "We present a unified framework called deep dependency networks (DDNs) that combines dependency networks and deep learning architectures for multi-label classification, with a particular emphasis on image and video data. The primary advantage of dependency networks is their ease of training, in contrast to other probabilistic graphical models like Markov networks. In particular, when combined with deep learning architectures, they provide an intuitive, easy-to-use loss function for multi-label classification. A drawback of DDNs compared to Markov networks is their lack of advanced inference schemes, necessitating the use of Gibbs sampling. To address this challenge, we propose novel inference schemes based on local search and integer linear programming for computing the most likely assignment to the labels given observations. We evaluate our novel methods on three video datasets (Charades, TACoS, Wetlab) and three image datasets (MS-COCO, PASCAL VOC, NUS-WIDE), comparing their performance with (a) basic neural architectures and (b) neural architectures combined with Markov networks equipped with advanced inference and learning techniques. Our results demonstrate the superiority of our new DDN methods over the two competing approaches. ",

    "abstract": "Representing the environment is a central challenge in robotics, and is essential for effective decision-making. Traditionally, before capturing images with a manipulator-mounted camera, users need to calibrate the camera using a specific external marker, such as a checkerboard or AprilTag. However, recent advances in computer vision have led to the development of \\emph{3D foundation models}. These are large, pre-trained neural networks that can establish fast and accurate multi-view correspondences with very few images, even in the absence of rich visual features. This paper advocates for the integration of 3D foundation models into scene representation approaches for robotic systems equipped with manipulator-mounted RGB cameras. Specifically, we propose the Joint Calibration and Representation (JCR) method. JCR uses RGB images, captured by a manipulator-mounted camera, to simultaneously construct an environmental representation and calibrate the camera relative to the robot's end-effector, in the absence of specific calibration markers. The resulting 3D environment representation is aligned with the robot's coordinate frame and maintains physically accurate scales. We demonstrate that JCR can build effective scene representations using a low-cost RGB camera attached to a manipulator, without prior calibration. ",

    "abstract": "Popular representation learning methods encourage feature invariance under transformations applied at the input. However, in 3D perception tasks like object localization and segmentation, outputs are naturally equivariant to some transformations, such as rotation. Using pre-training loss functions that encourage equivariance of features under certain transformations provides a strong self-supervision signal while also retaining information of geometric relationships between transformed feature representations. This can enable improved performance in downstream tasks that are equivariant to such transformations. In this paper, we propose a spatio-temporal equivariant learning framework by considering both spatial and temporal augmentations jointly. Our experiments show that the best performance arises with a pre-training approach that encourages equivariance to translation, scaling, and flip, rotation and scene flow. For spatial augmentations, we find that depending on the transformation, either a contrastive objective or an equivariance-by-classification objective yields best results. To leverage real-world object deformations and motion, we consider sequential LiDAR scene pairs and develop a novel 3D scene flow-based equivariance objective that leads to improved performance overall. We show our pre-training method for 3D object detection which outperforms existing equivariant and invariant approaches in many settings. ",

    "abstract": "The emergence of connected vehicles is driven by increasing customer and regulatory demands. To meet these, more complex software applications, some of which require service-based cloud and edge backends, are developed. When new software is deployed however, the high complexity and interdependencies between components can lead to unforeseen side effects in other system parts. As such, it becomes more challenging to recognize whether deviations to the intended system behavior are occurring, ultimately resulting in higher monitoring efforts and slower responses to errors. To overcome this problem, a simulation of the cloud environment running in parallel to the system is proposed. This approach enables the live comparison between simulated and real cloud behavior. Therefore, a concept is developed mirroring the existing cloud system into a simulation. To collect the necessary data, an observability platform is presented, capturing telemetry and architecture information. Subsequently, a simulation environment is designed that converts the architecture into a simulation model and simulates its dynamic workload by utilizing captured communication data. The proposed concept is evaluated in a real-world application scenario for electric vehicle charging: Vehicles can apply for an unoccupied charging station at a cloud service backend, the latter which manages all incoming requests and performs the assignment. Benchmarks are conducted by comparing the collected telemetry data with the simulated results under different loads and injected faults. The results show that regular cloud behavior is mirrored well by the simulation and that misbehavior due to fault injection is well visible, indicating that simulations are a promising data source for anomaly detection in connected vehicle cloud environments during operation.

This representation turns out to be a good tool for the investigation of several properties of block languages, making proofs simpler and reasoning clearer. After showing how to convert bitmaps into minimal deterministic and nondeterministic finite automata, we use this representation as a tool to study the deterministic and nondeterministic state complexity of block languages, as well as the costs of basic operations on block languages, in terms of the sizes of the equivalent finite automata.

Moreover, we have substantiated the effectiveness of fine-tuning language models in identifying violent comments by conducting preliminary benchmarking on the state-of-the-art Bangla deep learning model.

    "abstract": "LiDAR datasets for autonomous driving exhibit biases in properties such as point cloud density, range, and object dimensions. As a result, object detection networks trained and evaluated in different environments often experience performance degradation. Domain adaptation approaches assume access to unannotated samples from the test distribution to address this problem. However, in the real world, the exact conditions of deployment and access to samples representative of the test dataset may be unavailable while training. We argue that the more realistic and challenging formulation is to require robustness in performance to unseen target domains. We propose to address this problem in a two-pronged manner. First, we leverage paired LiDAR-image data present in most autonomous driving datasets to perform multimodal object detection. We suggest that working with multimodal features by leveraging both images and LiDAR point clouds for scene understanding tasks results in object detectors more robust to unseen domain shifts. Second, we train a 3D object detector to learn multimodal object features across different distributions and promote feature invariance across these source domains to improve generalizability to unseen target domains. To this end, we propose CLIX$^\\text{3D}$, a multimodal fusion and supervised contrastive learning framework for 3D object detection that performs alignment of object features from same-class samples of different domains while pushing the features from different classes apart. We show that CLIX$^\\text{3D}$ yields state-of-the-art domain generalization performance under multiple dataset shifts. ",

We adopt binary string encoding for matchings and use Hamming distance to measure diversity, aiming for its maximization. Our study centers on the $(\\mu+1)$-EA and $2P-EA_D$, which are applied to optimize diversity. We provide a rigorous theoretical and empirical analysis of these algorithms. For complete bipartite graphs, our runtime analysis shows that, with a reasonably small $\\mu$, the $(\\mu+1)$-EA achieves maximal diversity with an expected runtime of $O(\\mu^2 m^4 \\log(m))$ for the small gap case (where the population size $\\mu$ is less than the difference in the sizes of the bipartite partitions) and $O(\\mu^2 m^2 \\log(m))$ otherwise. For paths, we establish an upper runtime bound of $O(\\mu^3 m^3)$. The $2P-EA_D$ displays stronger performance, with bounds of $O(\\mu^2 m^2 \\log(m))$ for the small gap case, $O(\\mu^2 n^2 \\log(n))$ otherwise, and $O(\\mu^3 m^2)$ for paths.

We validate our approach through both qualitative and quantitative assessments, demonstrating improved bias mitigation and accuracy compared to existing methods.

Recent research has abandoned Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) and utilized dilated convolutions or temporal slicing for feature extraction, and they have the following drawbacks: (1) Dilated convolutions fail to capture the features of adjacent time steps, resulting in the loss of crucial transitional data. (2) The connections within the same temporal slice are strong, while the connections between different temporal slices are too loose. In light of these limitations, we emphasize the importance of analyzing a complete time series repeatedly and the crucial role of GRU in MTS. Therefore, we propose SGRU: Structured Gated Recurrent Units, which involve structured GRU layers and non-linear units, along with multiple layers of time embedding to enhance the model's fitting performance. We evaluate our approach on four publicly available California traffic datasets: PeMS03, PeMS04, PeMS07, and PeMS08 for regression prediction. Experimental results demonstrate that our model outperforms baseline models with average improvements of 11.7%, 18.6%, 18.5%, and 12.0% respectively. ",

    "abstract": "Finding maximum cliques in large networks is a challenging combinatorial problem with many real-world applications. We present a fast algorithm to achieve the exact solution for the maximum clique problem in large sparse networks based on efficient graph decomposition. A bunch of effective techniques is being used to greatly prune the graph and a novel concept called Complete-Upper-Bound-Induced Subgraph (CUBIS) is proposed to ensure that the structures with the potential to form the maximum clique are retained in the process of graph decomposition. Our algorithm first pre-prunes peripheral nodes, subsequently, one or two small-scale CUBISs are constructed guided by the core number and current maximum clique size. Bron-Kerbosch search is performed on each CUBIS to find the maximum clique. Experiments on 50 empirical networks with a scale of up to 20 million show the CUBIS scales are largely independent of the original network scale. This enables an approximately linear runtime, making our algorithm amenable for large networks. Our work provides a new framework for effectively solving maximum clique problems on massive sparse graphs, which not only makes the graph scale no longer the bottleneck but also shows some light on solving other clique-related problems.

    "abstract": "Self-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as a promising technique for medical image analysis due to its ability to learn without annotations. However, despite the promising potential, conventional SSL methods encounter limitations, including challenges in achieving semantic alignment and capturing subtle details. This leads to suboptimal representations, which fail to accurately capture the underlying anatomical structures and pathological details. In response to these constraints, we introduce a novel SSL framework OPTiML, employing optimal transport (OT), to capture the dense semantic invariance and fine-grained details, thereby enhancing the overall effectiveness of SSL in medical image representation learning. The core idea is to integrate OT with a cross-viewpoint semantics infusion module (CV-SIM), which effectively captures complex, fine-grained details inherent in medical images across different viewpoints. In addition to the CV-SIM module, OPTiML imposes the variance and covariance regularizations within OT framework to force the model focus on clinically relevant information while discarding less informative features. Through these, the proposed framework demonstrates its capacity to learn semantically rich representations that can be applied to various medical imaging tasks. To validate its effectiveness, we conduct experimental studies on three publicly available datasets from chest X-ray modality. Our empirical results reveal OPTiML's superiority over state-of-the-art methods across all evaluated tasks. ",

    "abstract": "Graph Transformers (GTs) have made remarkable achievements in graph-level tasks. However, most existing works regard graph structures as a form of guidance or bias for enhancing node representations, which focuses on node-central perspectives and lacks explicit representations of edges and structures. One natural question is, can we treat graph structures node-like as a whole to learn high-level features? Through experimental analysis, we explore the feasibility of this assumption. Based on our findings, we propose a novel multi-view graph structural representation learning model via graph coarsening (MSLgo) on GT architecture for graph classification. Specifically, we build three unique views, original, coarsening, and conversion, to learn a thorough structural representation. We compress loops and cliques via hierarchical heuristic graph coarsening and restrict them with well-designed constraints, which builds the coarsening view to learn high-level interactions between structures. We also introduce line graphs for edge embeddings and switch to edge-central perspective to construct the conversion view. Experiments on six real-world datasets demonstrate the improvements of MSLgo over 14 baselines from various architectures. ",

    "abstract": "Rendering volumetric scattering media, including clouds, fog, smoke, and other complex materials, is crucial for realism in computer graphics. Traditional path tracing, while unbiased, requires many long path samples to converge in scenes with scattering media, and a lot of work is wasted by paths that make a negligible contribution to the image. Methods to make better use of the information learned during path tracing range from photon mapping to radiance caching, but struggle to support the full range of heterogeneous scattering media. This paper introduces a new volumetric rendering algorithm that extends and adapts the previous \\emph{path graph} surface rendering algorithm. Our method leverages the information collected through multiple-scattering transport paths to compute lower-noise estimates, increasing computational efficiency by reducing the required sample count. Our key contributions include an extended path graph for participating media and new aggregation and propagation operators for efficient path reuse in volumes. Compared to previous methods, our approach significantly boosts convergence in scenes with challenging volumetric light transport, including heterogeneous media with high scattering albedos and dense, forward-scattering translucent materials, under complex lighting conditions.

Specifically, to tackle the detail variation problem from low altitude (drone-level) to high altitude (satellite-level), a source image selection method and an attention-based feature fusion approach are developed to extract and fuse the most relevant features of target view from multi-height images for high-fidelity rendering. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AG-NeRF achieves SOTA performance on 56 Leonard and Transamerica benchmarks and only requires a half hour of training time to reach the competitive PSNR as compared to the latest BungeeNeRF.

    "abstract": "The interactions between human and objects are important for recognizing object-centric actions. Existing methods usually adopt a two-stage pipeline, where object proposals are first detected using a pretrained detector, and then are fed to an action recognition model for extracting video features and learning the object relations for action recognition. However, since the action prior is unknown in the object detection stage, important objects could be easily overlooked, leading to inferior action recognition performance. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end object-centric action recognition framework that simultaneously performs Detection And Interaction Reasoning in one stage. Particularly, after extracting video features with a base network, we create three modules for concurrent object detection and interaction reasoning. First, a Patch-based Object Decoder generates proposals from video patch tokens. Then, an Interactive Object Refining and Aggregation identifies important objects for action recognition, adjusts proposal scores based on position and appearance, and aggregates object-level info into a global video representation. Lastly, an Object Relation Modeling module encodes object relations. These three modules together with the video feature extractor can be trained jointly in an end-to-end fashion, thus avoiding the heavy reliance on an off-the-shelf object detector, and reducing the multi-stage training burden. We conduct experiments on two datasets, Something-Else and Ikea-Assembly, to evaluate the performance of our proposed approach on conventional, compositional, and few-shot action recognition tasks. Through in-depth experimental analysis, we show the crucial role of interactive objects in learning for action recognition, and we can outperform state-of-the-art methods on both datasets. ",

Glucose prediction is a fundamental aspect of diabetes management, facilitating real-time decision-making. Recent research has introduced models focusing on long-term glucose trend prediction, which are unsuitable for real-time decision-making and result in delayed responses. Conversely, models designed to respond to immediate glucose level changes cannot analyze glucose variability comprehensively. Moreover, contemporary research generally integrates various physiological parameters (e.g. insulin doses, food intake, etc.), which inevitably raises data privacy concerns. To bridge such a research gap, we propose TimeGlu -- an end-to-end pipeline for short-term glucose prediction solely based on CGM time series data. We implement four baseline methods to conduct a comprehensive comparative analysis of the model's performance. Through extensive experiments on two contrasting datasets (CGM Glucose and Colas dataset), TimeGlu achieves state-of-the-art performance without the need for additional personal data from patients, providing effective guidance for real-world diabetic glucose management.

Recent distributed collaborative learning has been verified as an effective paradigm for privacy preservation in multimodal tasks.

Consequently, it poses an intriguing question of maximizing multimodal utilization to improve performance while simultaneously protecting necessary modalities. This paper forms the first attempt at modality-specified (i.e., audio and visual) privacy preservation in MSA tasks. We propose a novel Hybrid Distributed cross-modality cGAN framework (HyDiscGAN), which learns multimodality alignment to generate fake audio and visual features conditioned on shareable de-identified textual data. The objective is to leverage the fake features to approximate real audio and visual content to guarantee privacy preservation while effectively enhancing performance. Extensive experiments show that compared with the state-of-the-art MSA model, HyDiscGAN can achieve superior or competitive performance while preserving privacy. ",

To overcome these limitations, we introduce SIGformer, a new method that employs the transformer architecture to sign-aware graph-based recommendation. SIGformer incorporates two innovative positional encodings that capture the spectral properties and path patterns of the signed graph, enabling the full exploitation of the entire graph.

Our study highlights that a considerable majority of tweets belong to the less offensive and less hate intensity levels, underscoring the need for early interventions by stakeholders.

    "abstract": "Regional planning processes and associated redevelopment projects can be complex due to the vast amount of diverse data involved. However, all of this data shares a common geographical reference, especially in the renaturation of former open-cast mining areas. To ensure safety, it is crucial to maintain a comprehensive overview of the interrelated data and draw accurate conclusions. This requires special tools and can be a very time-consuming process. A geographical information system (GIS) is well-suited for this purpose, but even a GIS has limitations when dealing with multiple data types and sources. Additional tools are often necessary to process and view all the data, which can complicate the planning process. Our paper describes a system architecture that addresses the aforementioned issues and provides a simple, yet flexible tool for these activities. The architecture is based on microservices using Docker and is divided into a backend and a frontend. The backend simplifies and generalizes the integration of different data types, while a graph database is used to link relevant data and reveal potential new relationships between them. Finally, a modern web frontend displays the data and relationships. ",

    "abstract": "This paper introduces a novel approach, evolutionary multi-objective optimisation for fairness-aware self-adjusting memory classifiers, designed to enhance fairness in machine learning algorithms applied to data stream classification. With the growing concern over discrimination in algorithmic decision-making, particularly in dynamic data stream environments, there is a need for methods that ensure fair treatment of individuals across sensitive attributes like race or gender. The proposed approach addresses this challenge by integrating the strengths of the self-adjusting memory K-Nearest-Neighbour algorithm with evolutionary multi-objective optimisation. This combination allows the new approach to efficiently manage concept drift in streaming data and leverage the flexibility of evolutionary multi-objective optimisation to maximise accuracy and minimise discrimination simultaneously. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach through extensive experiments on various datasets, comparing its performance against several baseline methods in terms of accuracy and fairness metrics. Our results show that the proposed approach maintains competitive accuracy and significantly reduces discrimination, highlighting its potential as a robust solution for fairness-aware data stream classification. Further analyses also confirm the effectiveness of the strategies to trigger evolutionary multi-objective optimisation and adapt classifiers in the proposed approach. ",

    "abstract": "Change detection (CD) from remote sensing (RS) images using deep learning has been widely investigated in the literature. It is typically regarded as a pixel-wise labeling task that aims to classify each pixel as changed or unchanged. Although per-pixel classification networks in encoder-decoder structures have shown dominance, they still suffer from imprecise boundaries and incomplete object delineation at various scenes. For high-resolution RS images, partly or totally changed objects are more worthy of attention rather than a single pixel. Therefore, we revisit the CD task from the mask prediction and classification perspective and propose MaskCD to detect changed areas by adaptively generating categorized masks from input image pairs. Specifically, it utilizes a cross-level change representation perceiver (CLCRP) to learn multiscale change-aware representations and capture spatiotemporal relations from encoded features by exploiting deformable multihead self-attention (DeformMHSA). Subsequently, a masked-attention-based detection transformers (MA-DETR) decoder is developed to accurately locate and identify changed objects based on masked attention and self-attention mechanisms. It reconstructs the desired changed objects by decoding the pixel-wise representations into learnable mask proposals and making final predictions from these candidates. Experimental results on five benchmark datasets demonstrate the proposed approach outperforms other state-of-the-art models. Codes and pretrained models are available online (https://github.com/EricYu97/MaskCD). ",

    "abstract": "Embedding models play a pivot role in modern NLP applications such as IR and RAG. While the context limit of LLMs has been pushed beyond 1 million tokens, embedding models are still confined to a narrow context window not exceeding 8k tokens, refrained from application scenarios requiring long inputs such as legal contracts. This paper explores context window extension of existing embedding models, pushing the limit to 32k without requiring additional training. First, we examine the performance of current embedding models for long context retrieval on our newly constructed LongEmbed benchmark. LongEmbed comprises two synthetic tasks and four carefully chosen real-world tasks, featuring documents of varying length and dispersed target information. Benchmarking results underscore huge room for improvement in these models. Based on this, comprehensive experiments show that training-free context window extension strategies like position interpolation can effectively extend the context window of existing embedding models by several folds, regardless of their original context being 512 or beyond 4k. Furthermore, for models employing absolute position encoding (APE), we show the possibility of further fine-tuning to harvest notable performance gains while strictly preserving original behavior for short inputs. For models using rotary position embedding (RoPE), significant enhancements are observed when employing RoPE-specific methods, such as NTK and SelfExtend, indicating RoPE's superiority over APE for context window extension. To facilitate future research, we release E5-Base-4k and E5-RoPE-Base, along with the LongEmbed benchmark. ",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we consider the problem of reference tracking in uncertain nonlinear systems. A neural State-Space Model (NSSM) is used to approximate the nonlinear system, where a deep encoder network learns the nonlinearity from data, and a state-space component captures the temporal relationship. This transforms the nonlinear system into a linear system in a latent space, enabling the application of model predictive control (MPC) to determine effective control actions. Our objective is to design the optimal controller using limited data from the \\textit{target system} (the system of interest). To this end, we employ an implicit model-agnostic meta-learning (iMAML) framework that leverages information from \\textit{source systems} (systems that share similarities with the target system) to expedite training in the target system and enhance its control performance. The framework consists of two phases: the (offine) meta-training phase learns a aggregated NSSM using data from source systems, and the (online) meta-inference phase quickly adapts this aggregated model to the target system using only a few data points and few online training iterations, based on local loss function gradients. The iMAML algorithm exploits the implicit function theorem to exactly compute the gradient during training, without relying on the entire optimization path. By focusing solely on the optimal solution, rather than the path, we can meta-train with less storage complexity and fewer approximations than other contemporary meta-learning algorithms. We demonstrate through numerical examples that our proposed method can yield accurate predictive models by adaptation, resulting in a downstream MPC that outperforms several baselines. ",

    "abstract": "Community search over heterogeneous information networks has been applied to wide domains, such as activity organization and team formation. From these scenarios, the members of a group with the same treatment often have different levels of activity and workloads, which causes unfairness in the treatment between active members and inactive members (called individual unfairness). However, existing works do not pay attention to individual fairness and do not sufficiently consider the rich semantics of HINs (e.g., high-order structure), which disables complex queries. To fill the gap, we formally define the issue of individual fairest community search over HINs (denoted as IFCS), which aims to find a set of vertices from the HIN that own the same type, close relationships, and small difference of activity level and has been demonstrated to be NP-hard. To do this, we first develop an exploration-based filter that reduces the search space of the community effectively. Further, to avoid repeating computation and prune unfair communities in advance, we propose a message-based scheme and a lower bound-based scheme. At last, we conduct extensive experiments on four real-world datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed algorithms, which achieve at least X3 times faster than the baseline solution.

While the performance of these JCAS schemes for object tracking and parameter estimation has been studied in previous works, their performance on target detection in the presence of clutter has not been analyzed. In this paper, we propose a detection scheme for estimating the number of targets in JCAS cellular networks that employ TDM or CM resource sharing. The proposed detection method allows for the presence of clutter and/or temporally correlated noise. This scheme is studied with respect to the JCAS trade-off parameters that allow to control the time slots in TDM and the power resources in CM allocated to sensing and communications. The performance of two fundamental transmit beamforming schemes, typical for JCAS, is compared in terms of the receiver operating characteristics curves. Our results indicate that in general the TDM scheme gives a somewhat better detection performance compared to the CM scheme, although both schemes outperform existing approaches provided that their respective trade-off parameters are tuned properly.

The anomaly detection approach presented in this paper consists of three stages.The first stage identifies the repetitive cycles in the lengthy time series and segments them into individual time series corresponding to one task cycle, while accounting for possible temporal distortions.The second stage computes a prototype for the cycles using a GPU-based barycenter algorithm, specifically tailored for very large time series.The third stage uses the prototype to detect abnormal cycles by computing an anomaly score for each cycle.The overall approach, named WarpEd Time Series ANomaly Detection (WETSAND), makes use of the Dynamic Time Warping algorithm and its variants because they are suited to the distorted nature of the time series.The experiments show that \\wetsand scales to large signals, computes human-friendly prototypes, works with very little data, and outperforms some general purpose anomaly detection approaches such as autoencoders.

    "abstract": "This paper introduces an adaptive convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture capable of automating various topology optimization (TO) problems with diverse underlying physics. The proposed architecture has an encoder-decoder-type structure with dense layers added at the bottleneck region to capture complex geometrical features. The network is trained using datasets obtained by the problem-specific open-source TO codes. Tensorflow and Keras are the main libraries employed to develop and to train the model. Effectiveness and robustness of the proposed adaptive CNN model are demonstrated through its performance in compliance minimization problems involving constant and design-dependent loads and in addressing bulk modulus optimization. Once trained, the model takes user's input of the volume fraction as an image and instantly generates an output image of optimized design. The proposed CNN produces high-quality results resembling those obtained via open-source TO codes with negligible performance and volume fraction errors. The paper includes complete associated Python code (Appendix A) for the proposed CNN architecture and explains each part of the code to facilitate reproducibility and ease of learning. ",

    "abstract": "The autonomous driving industry is expected to grow by over 20 times in the coming decade and, thus, motivate researchers to delve into it. The primary focus of their research is to ensure safety, comfort, and efficiency. An autonomous vehicle has several modules responsible for one or more of the aforementioned items. Among these modules, the trajectory planner plays a pivotal role in the safety of the vehicle and the comfort of its passengers. The module is also responsible for respecting kinematic constraints and any applicable road constraints. In this paper, a novel online spatial-temporal graph trajectory planner is introduced to generate safe and comfortable trajectories. First, a spatial-temporal graph is constructed using the autonomous vehicle, its surrounding vehicles, and virtual nodes along the road with respect to the vehicle itself. Next, the graph is forwarded into a sequential network to obtain the desired states. To support the planner, a simple behavioral layer is also presented that determines kinematic constraints for the planner. Furthermore, a novel potential function is also proposed to train the network. Finally, the proposed planner is tested on three different complex driving tasks, and the performance is compared with two frequently used methods. The results show that the proposed planner generates safe and feasible trajectories while achieving similar or longer distances in the forward direction and comparable comfort ride. ",

    "abstract": "Although large language models (LLMs) have achieved significant success, their vulnerability to adversarial perturbations, including recent jailbreak attacks, has raised considerable concerns. However, the increasing size of these models and their limited access make improving their robustness a challenging task. Among various defense strategies, randomized smoothing has shown great potential for LLMs, as it does not require full access to the model's parameters or fine-tuning via adversarial training. However, randomized smoothing involves adding noise to the input before model prediction, and the final model's robustness largely depends on the model's performance on these noise corrupted data. Its effectiveness is often limited by the model's sub-optimal performance on noisy data. To address this issue, we propose to leverage the multitasking nature of LLMs to first denoise the noisy inputs and then to make predictions based on these denoised versions. We call this procedure self-denoised smoothing. Unlike previous denoised smoothing techniques in computer vision, which require training a separate model to enhance the robustness of LLMs, our method offers significantly better efficiency and flexibility. Our experimental results indicate that our method surpasses existing methods in both empirical and certified robustness in defending against adversarial attacks for both downstream tasks and human alignments (i.e., jailbreak attacks).

The escalating complexity of network architectures, however, has led to a semantic gap between these intents and their actual configurations, posing significant challenges to the accuracy and reliability of IDNs. While existing methodologies attempt to address this gap through a bottom-up analysis of network metadata, they often fall short, focusing primarily on intent extraction or reasoning without fully leveraging insights to tackle the inherent challenges of IDNs. To mitigate this, we introduce SAFLA, a semantic-aware framework specifically designed to assure the full lifecycle of intents within IDNs. By seamlessly integrating top-down and bottom-up approaches, SAFLA not only provides comprehensive intent assurance but also effectively bridges the semantic gap. This integration facilitates a self-healing mechanism, substantially reducing the need for manual intervention even in dynamically changing network environments. Experimental results demonstrate the framework's feasibility and efficiency, confirming its capacity to quickly adapt intents in response to network changes, thus marking an important advancement in the field of IDNs.

In particular, we restrict the functions to the class of overparameterized two-layer neural networks and study (i) the convergence of the gradient descent-ascent algorithm and (ii) the representation learning of the neural network. As an initial step, we consider the minimax optimization problem stemming from estimating a functional equation defined by conditional expectations via adversarial estimation, where the objective function is quadratic in the functional space. For this problem, we establish convergence under the mean-field regime by considering the continuous-time and infinite-width limit of the optimization dynamics. Under this regime, gradient descent-ascent corresponds to a Wasserstein gradient flow over the space of probability measures defined over the space of neural network parameters. We prove that the Wasserstein gradient flow converges globally to a stationary point of the minimax objective at a $\\mathcal{O}(T^{-1} + \\alpha^{-1} ) $ sublinear rate, and additionally finds the solution to the functional equation when the regularizer of the minimax objective is strongly convex. Here $T$ denotes the time and $\\alpha$ is a scaling parameter of the neural network. In terms of representation learning, our results show that the feature representation induced by the neural networks is allowed to deviate from the initial one by the magnitude of $\\mathcal{O}(\\alpha^{-1})$, measured in terms of the Wasserstein distance. Finally, we apply our general results to concrete examples including policy evaluation, nonparametric instrumental variable regression, and asset pricing. ",

The motivation is to better understand a model by querying whether it is using information from human-understandable features, e.g., anatomical shape, volume, or image texture. Our method is based on the principle that if a model is dependent on a feature, then removal of that feature should significantly harm its performance. A targeted feature is \"removed\" by collapsing the dimension in the data distribution that corresponds to that feature. We perform this by moving data points along the feature dimension to a baseline feature value while staying on the data manifold, as estimated by a deep generative model. Then we observe how the model's performance changes on the modified test data set, with the target feature dimension removed. We test our method on deep neural network models trained on synthetic image data with known ground truth, an Alzheimer's disease prediction task using MRI and hippocampus segmentations from the OASIS-3 dataset, and a cell nuclei classification task using the Lizard dataset.

While this approach has allowed for empirical accuracy, efficiency, and task adaptation via fine-tuning, it also comes with fundamental disadvantages. Existing networks often struggle to generalize across different datasets, even on the same task. By design, these networks ultimately reason about high-dimensional scene features, which are challenging to analyze. This is true especially when attempting to predict 3D information based on 2D images. We propose to recast 3D multi-object tracking from RGB cameras as an \\emph{Inverse Rendering (IR)} problem, by optimizing via a differentiable rendering pipeline over the latent space of pre-trained 3D object representations and retrieve the latents that best represent object instances in a given input image. To this end, we optimize an image loss over generative latent spaces that inherently disentangle shape and appearance properties. We investigate not only an alternate take on tracking but our method also enables examining the generated objects, reasoning about failure situations, and resolving ambiguous cases. We validate the generalization and scaling capabilities of our method by learning the generative prior exclusively from synthetic data and assessing camera-based 3D tracking on the nuScenes and Waymo datasets. Both these datasets are completely unseen to our method and do not require fine-tuning. Videos and code are available at https://light.princeton.edu/inverse-rendering-tracking/. ",

Addressing this issue is known as Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection. Many state-of-the-art OOD methods employ an auxiliary dataset as a surrogate for OOD data during training to achieve improved performance. However, these methods fail to fully exploit the local information embedded in the auxiliary dataset. In this work, we propose the idea of leveraging the information embedded in the gradient of the loss function during training to enable the network to not only learn a desired OOD score for each sample but also to exhibit similar behavior in a local neighborhood around each sample. We also develop a novel energy-based sampling method to allow the network to be exposed to more informative OOD samples during the training phase. This is especially important when the auxiliary dataset is large. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through extensive experiments on several OOD benchmarks, improving the existing state-of-the-art FPR95 by 4% on our ImageNet experiment. We further provide a theoretical analysis through the lens of certified robustness and Lipschitz analysis to showcase the theoretical foundation of our work.

Nevertheless, recent works discovered that by exploiting gradient information returned by the server to bottom models, with the knowledge of only a small set of auxiliary labels on a very limited subset of training data points, an adversary can infer the private labels. These attacks are known as label inference attacks in VFL. In our work, we propose a novel framework called KDk, that combines Knowledge Distillation and k-anonymity to provide a defense mechanism against potential label inference attacks in a VFL scenario.

Multimodal Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans play an important role in the study of glioma prognosis OS time.

However, these methods usually fuse multi-modal information at the beginning or at the end of the deep learning networks and lack the fusion of features from different scales. In addition, the fusion at the end of networks always adapts global with global (eg. fully connected after concatenation of global average pooling output) or local with local (eg. bilinear pooling), which loses the information of local with global.

These shutoffs, while mitigating the risk of disastrous ignition events, result in power outages that could negatively impacts vulnerable communities. In this paper, we consider how to equitably allocate funds to underground and effectively de-risk power lines in transmission networks. We explore the impact of the 2021 White House resource allocation policy called the Justice40 initiative, which states that 40% of the benefits of federally-funded climate-related investments should go to socially vulnerable communities. The definition of what constitutes a vulnerable community varies by organization, and we consider two major recently proposed vulnerability indices: the Justice40 index created under the 2021 White House and the Social Vulnerability Index (SVI) developed by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). We show that allocating budget according to these two indices fails to reduce power outages for indigenous communities and those subject to high wildfire ignition risk using a high-fidelity synthetic power grid dataset that matches the key features of the Texas transmission system. We discuss how aggregation of communities and \"one size fits all\" vulnerability indices might be the reasons for the misalignment between the goals of vulnerability indices and their realized impact in this particular case study.

Subsequently, we fix the capacity layouts and simulate their operation in every weather year, to evaluate resource adequacy and CO$_2$ emissions abatement. We show that interannual weather variability causes variation of $\\pm$10\\% in total system cost. The most expensive capacity layout obtains the lowest net CO$_2$ emissions but not the highest resource adequacy. Instead, capacity layouts designed with years including compound weather events result in a more robust and cost-effective design. Deploying CO$_2$-emitting backup generation is a cost-effective robustness measure, which only increase CO$_2$ emissions marginally as the average CO$_2$ emissions remain less than 1\\% of 1990 levels. Our findings highlight how extreme weather years drive investments in robustness measures, making them compatible with all weather conditions within six decades of historical weather data. ",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we study conditions for the existence of an embedding $\\widetilde{f} \\colon P \\to Q \\times \\mathbb{R}$ such that $f = \\mathrm{pr}_Q \\circ \\widetilde{f}$, where $f \\colon P \\to Q$ is a piecewise linear map between polyhedra. Our focus is on non-degenerate maps between graphs, where non-degeneracy means that the preimages of points are finite sets. We introduce combinatorial techniques and establish necessary and sufficient conditions for the general case. Using these results, we demonstrate that the problem of the existence of a lifting reduces to testing the satisfiability of a 3-CNF formula. Additionally, we construct a counterexample to a result by V. Po\\'{e}naru on lifting of smooth immersions to embeddings. Furthermore, by establishing connections between the stated problem and the approximability by embeddings, we deduce that, in the case of generic maps from a tree to a segment, a weaker condition becomes sufficient for the existence of a lifting.

    "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance in solving graph classification tasks. However, most GNN architectures aggregate information from all nodes and edges in a graph, regardless of their relevance to the task at hand, thus hindering the interpretability of their predictions. In contrast to prior work, in this paper we propose a GNN \\emph{training} approach that jointly i) finds the most predictive subgraph by removing edges and/or nodes -- -\\emph{without making assumptions about the subgraph structure} -- while ii) optimizing the performance of the graph classification task. To that end, we rely on reinforcement learning to solve the resulting bi-level optimization with a reward function based on conformal predictions to account for the current in-training uncertainty of the classifier. Our empirical results on nine different graph classification datasets show that our method competes in performance with baselines while relying on significantly sparser subgraphs, leading to more interpretable GNN-based predictions.
