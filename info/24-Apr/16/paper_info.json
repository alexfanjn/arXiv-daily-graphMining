    "abstract": "This decade has witnessed the initiation of the digital revolution, as anticipated with the advent of 5G networks. Looking ahead to the 6G communication era, considerations are being made regarding how individuals will engage with the digital virtual world. The design of 6G technology, which will present enormous opportunities to develop and enhance human potential, will have a major impact on communications in the 2030s. We believe that in 6G we will see an unprecedented transformation that will set it apart from earlier wireless cellular network generations. Specifically, 6G will leverage ubiquitous AI services ranging from the network's core to its end devices, going beyond unpredictable limits. Despite the numerous advantages offered by 6G over existing technologies, there remains a pressing need to address security concerns. For example, the automation of critical processes in the 6G infrastructure will lead to a significantly broader and more intricate attack surface. Thus, the significance of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in providing security aspects within the envisioned 6G paradigm is substantial, but its integration presents a dual-edged dynamic. Therefore, to strengthen and validate the relevance of AI in securing 6G networks, this article elucidates how AI can be strategically used in 6G security, addressing potential challenges, and proposing solutions to enhance its role in securing networks.

    "abstract": "Automated Essay Scoring (AES) systems are widely popular in the market as they constitute a cost-effective and time-effective option for grading systems. Nevertheless, many studies have demonstrated that the AES system fails to assign lower grades to irrelevant responses. Thus, detecting the off-topic response in automated essay scoring is crucial in practical tasks where candidates write unrelated text responses to the given task in the question. In this paper, we are proposing an unsupervised technique that jointly scores essays and detects off-topic essays. The proposed Automated Open Essay Scoring (AOES) model uses a novel topic regularization module (TRM), which can be attached on top of a transformer model, and is trained using a proposed hybrid loss function. After training, the AOES model is further used to calculate the Mahalanobis distance score for off-topic essay detection. Our proposed method outperforms the baseline we created and earlier conventional methods on two essay-scoring datasets in off-topic detection as well as on-topic scoring. Experimental evaluation results on different adversarial strategies also show how the suggested method is robust for detecting possible human-level perturbations. ",

We incorporate a contrastive learning strategy between users and locations to improve geolocation performance with no or limited training data. FewUser features a user representation module that harnesses a pre-trained language model (PLM) and a user encoder to process and fuse diverse social media inputs effectively. To bridge the gap between PLM's knowledge and geographical data, we introduce a geographical prompting module with hard, soft, and semi-soft prompts, to enhance the encoding of location information. Contrastive learning is implemented through a contrastive loss and a matching loss, complemented by a hard negative mining strategy to refine the learning process. We construct two datasets TwiU and FliU, containing richer metadata than existing benchmarks, to evaluate FewUser and the extensive experiments demonstrate that FewUser significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both zero-shot and various few-shot settings, achieving absolute improvements of 26.95\\% and \\textbf{41.62\\%} on TwiU and FliU, respectively, with only one training sample per class. We further conduct a comprehensive analysis to investigate the impact of user representation on geolocation performance and the effectiveness of FewUser's components, offering valuable insights for future research in this area.

    "abstract": "Automatic text summarization (TS) plays a pivotal role in condensing large volumes of information into concise, coherent summaries, facilitating efficient information retrieval and comprehension. This paper presents a novel framework for abstractive TS of single documents, which integrates three dominant aspects: structural, semantic, and neural-based approaches. The proposed framework merges machine learning and knowledge-based techniques to achieve a unified methodology. The framework consists of three main phases: pre-processing, machine learning, and post-processing. In the pre-processing phase, a knowledge-based Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) technique is employed to generalize ambiguous words, enhancing content generalization. Semantic content generalization is then performed to address out-of-vocabulary (OOV) or rare words, ensuring comprehensive coverage of the input document. Subsequently, the generalized text is transformed into a continuous vector space using neural language processing techniques. A deep sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) model with an attention mechanism is employed to predict a generalized summary based on the vector representation. In the post-processing phase, heuristic algorithms and text similarity metrics are utilized to refine the generated summary further. Concepts from the generalized summary are matched with specific entities, enhancing coherence and readability. Experimental evaluations conducted on prominent datasets, including Gigaword, Duc 2004, and CNN/DailyMail, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework. Results indicate significant improvements in handling rare and OOV words, outperforming existing state-of-the-art deep learning techniques. The proposed framework presents a comprehensive and unified approach towards abstractive TS, combining the strengths of structure, semantics, and neural-based methodologies. ",

    "abstract": "This work demonstrates two Privacy Policy (PP) summarisation models based on two different clustering algorithms: K-means clustering and Pre-determined Centroid (PDC) clustering. K-means is decided to be used for the first model after an extensive evaluation of ten commonly used clustering algorithms. The summariser model based on the PDC-clustering algorithm summarises PP documents by segregating individual sentences by Euclidean distance from each sentence to the pre-defined cluster centres. The cluster centres are defined according to General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)'s 14 essential topics that must be included in any privacy notices. The PDC model outperformed the K-means model for two evaluation methods, Sum of Squared Distance (SSD) and ROUGE by some margin (27% and 24% respectively). This result contrasts the K-means model's better performance in the general clustering of sentence vectors before running the task-specific evaluation. This indicates the effectiveness of operating task-specific fine-tuning measures on unsupervised machine-learning models. The summarisation mechanisms implemented in this paper demonstrates an idea of how to efficiently extract essential sentences that should be included in any PP documents. The summariser models could be further developed to an application that tests the GDPR-compliance (or any data privacy legislation) of PP documents. ",

ToxicTrap exploits greedy based search strategies to enable fast and effective generation of toxic adversarial examples. Two novel goal function designs allow ToxicTrap to identify weaknesses in both multiclass and multilabel toxic language detectors. Our empirical results show that SOTA toxicity text classifiers are indeed vulnerable to the proposed attacks, attaining over 98\\% attack success rates in multilabel cases. We also show how a vanilla adversarial training and its improved version can help increase robustness of a toxicity detector even against unseen attacks. ",

    "abstract": "A long-standing challenge is designing multi-scale structures with good connectivity between cells while optimizing each cell to reach close to the theoretical performance limit. We propose a new method for direct multi-scale topology optimization using neural networks. Our approach focuses on inverse homogenization that seamlessly maintains compatibility across neighboring microstructure cells. Our approach consists of a topology neural network that optimizes the microstructure shape and distribution across the design domain as a continuous field. Each microstructure cell is optimized based on a specified elasticity tensor that also accommodates in-plane rotations. The neural network takes as input the local coordinates within a cell to represent the density distribution within a cell, as well as the global coordinates of each cell to design spatially varying microstructure cells. As such, our approach models an n-dimensional multi-scale optimization problem as a 2n-dimensional inverse homogenization problem using neural networks. During the inverse homogenization of each unit cell, we extend the boundary of each cell by scaling the input coordinates such that the boundaries of neighboring cells are combined. Inverse homogenization on the combined cell improves connectivity. We demonstrate our method through the design and optimization of graded multi-scale structures. ",

    "abstract": "Nowadays large computers extensively output logs to record the runtime status and it has become crucial to identify any suspicious or malicious activities from the information provided by the realtime logs. Thus, fast log anomaly detection is a necessary task to be implemented for automating the infeasible manual detection. Most of the existing unsupervised methods are trained only on normal log data, but they usually require either additional abnormal data for hyperparameter selection or auxiliary datasets for discriminative model optimization. In this paper, aiming for a highly effective discriminative model that enables rapid anomaly detection,we propose FastLogAD, a generator-discriminator framework trained to exhibit the capability of generating pseudo-abnormal logs through the Mask-Guided Anomaly Generation (MGAG) model and efficiently identifying the anomalous logs via the Discriminative Abnormality Separation (DAS) model. Particularly, pseudo-abnormal logs are generated by replacing randomly masked tokens in a normal sequence with unlikely candidates. During the discriminative stage, FastLogAD learns a distinct separation between normal and pseudoabnormal samples based on their embedding norms, allowing the selection of a threshold without exposure to any test data and achieving competitive performance. Extensive experiments on several common benchmarks show that our proposed FastLogAD outperforms existing anomaly detection approaches. Furthermore, compared to previous methods, FastLogAD achieves at least x10 speed increase in anomaly detection over prior work.

    "abstract": "Accurate prediction of drivers' gaze is an important component of vision-based driver monitoring and assistive systems. Of particular interest are safety-critical episodes, such as performing maneuvers or crossing intersections. In such scenarios, drivers' gaze distribution changes significantly and becomes difficult to predict, especially if the task and context information is represented implicitly, as is common in many state-of-the-art models. However, explicit modeling of top-down factors affecting drivers' attention often requires additional information and annotations that may not be readily available. In this paper, we address the challenge of effective modeling of task and context with common sources of data for use in practical systems. To this end, we introduce SCOUT+, a task- and context-aware model for drivers' gaze prediction, which leverages route and map information inferred from commonly available GPS data. We evaluate our model on two datasets, DR(eye)VE and BDD-A, and demonstrate that using maps improves results compared to bottom-up models and reaches performance comparable to the top-down model SCOUT which relies on privileged ground truth information.

With this in mind, we take a fundamentally different approach: a pre-trained Vision-Language detector (VINVL) sensitive to attribute information is employed to efficiently obtain region features. A learned function maps the region features to region-specific attribute attention used to construct class part prototypes. We conduct experiments on a popular GZSL benchmark consisting of the CUB, SUN, and AWA2 datasets where our proposed Part Prototype Network (PPN) achieves promising results when compared with other popular base models.

However, neuroevolution is hindered by its inherent computational expense, requiring multiple generations, a large population, and numerous epochs. The most computationally intensive aspect lies in evaluating the fitness function of a single candidate solution. To address this challenge, we employ Surrogate-assisted EAs (SAEAs). While a few SAEAs approaches have been proposed in neuroevolution, none have been applied to truly large DNNs due to issues like intractable information usage. In this work, drawing inspiration from Genetic Programming semantics, we use phenotypic distance vectors, outputted from DNNs, alongside Kriging Partial Least Squares (KPLS), an approach that is effective in handling these large vectors, making them suitable for search. Our proposed approach, named Neuro-Linear Genetic Programming surrogate model (NeuroLGP-SM), efficiently and accurately estimates DNN fitness without the need for complete evaluations. NeuroLGP-SM demonstrates competitive or superior results compared to 12 other methods, including NeuroLGP without SM, convolutional neural networks, support vector machines, and autoencoders. Additionally, it is worth noting that NeuroLGP-SM is 25% more energy-efficient than its NeuroLGP counterpart.

Despite their global deployment, IoT devices are frequently targeted for security breaches due to inherent vulnerabilities. Among these threats, malware poses a significant risk to IoT devices. The lack of built-in security features and limited resources present challenges for implementing effective malware detection techniques on IoT devices. Moreover, existing methods assume access to all device resources for malware detection, which is often not feasible for IoT devices deployed in critical real-world scenarios. To overcome this challenge, this study introduces a novel approach to malware detection tailored for IoT devices, leveraging resource and workload awareness inspired by model parallelism. Initially, the device assesses available resources for malware detection using a lightweight regression model. Based on resource availability, ongoing workload, and communication costs, the malware detection task is dynamically allocated either on-device or offloaded to neighboring IoT nodes with sufficient resources. To uphold data integrity and user privacy, instead of transferring the entire malware detection task, the classifier is divided and distributed across multiple nodes, then integrated at the parent node for detection. Experimental results demonstrate that this proposed technique achieves a significant speedup of 9.8 x compared to on-device inference, while maintaining a high malware detection accuracy of 96.7%. ",

Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have proven particularly efficient in image processing tasks.

To further enhance throughput and minimize energy consumption, we incorporate precision scaling techniques tailored for CNN models. Our proposed PIM architecture exhibits a 1.09x higher throughput compared to existing Lookup Table (LUT)-based PIM architectures. Additionally, precision scaling combined with PIM enhances energy efficiency by 1.5x compared to full-precision operations, without sacrificing performance.

This method enhances deep learning model performance by generating visually realistic training samples from a single real-world wine label image, overcoming the challenges posed by the intricate combinations of text and logos. Classical Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) methods fall short in synthesizing such intricate content combination. Our proposed solution leverages time-tested computer vision and image processing strategies to expand our training dataset, thereby broadening the range of training samples for deep learning applications. This innovative approach to data augmentation circumvents the constraints of limited training resources. Using the augmented training images through batch-all triplet metric learning on a Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture, we can get the most discriminative embedding features for every wine label, enabling us to perform one-shot recognition of existing wine labels in the training classes or future newly collected wine labels unavailable in the training. Experimental results show a significant increase in recognition accuracy over conventional 2D data augmentation techniques. ",

    "abstract": "Over-/under-break excavation is a common phenomenon in shallow tunnelling, which is nonetheless not generally considered in existing complex variable solutions. In this paper, a new equilibrium mechanical model on over-/under-break shallow tunnelling in gravitational geomaterial is established by fixing far-field ground surface to form a corresponding mixed boundary problem. With integration of a newly proposed bidirectional composite conformal mapping using Charge Simulation Method, a complex variable solution of infinite complex potential series is subsequently derived using analytic continuation to tranform the mixed boundaries into a homogenerous Riemann-Hilbert problem, which is iteratively solved to obtain the stress and displacement in geomaterial. The infinite complex potential series of the complex variable solution are truncated to obtain numerical results, which is rectified by Lanczos filtering to reduce the oscillation of Gibbs phenomena. The bidirectional conformal mapping is discussed and validated via several numerical cases, and the subsequent complex variable solution is verified by examining the Lanczos filtering and solution convergence, and comparing with corresponding finite element solution and existing analytical solution. Further discussions are made to disclose possible defects of the proposed solution for objectivity. ",

Given the challenges associated with acquiring large, annotated datasets in this field, there is a need for methods that enable uncertainty quantification in small data AI approaches tailored to radiology images. In this study, we focused on uncertainty quantification within the context of the small data evolutionary strategies-based technique of deep neuroevolution (DNE). Specifically, we employed DNE to train a simple Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with MRI images of the eyes for binary classification. The goal was to distinguish between normal eyes and those with metastatic tumors called choroidal metastases. The training set comprised 18 images with choroidal metastases and 18 without tumors, while the testing set contained a tumor-to-normal ratio of 15:15. We trained CNN model weights via DNE for approximately 40,000 episodes, ultimately reaching a convergence of 100% accuracy on the training set. We saved all models that achieved maximal training set accuracy. Then, by applying these models to the testing set, we established an ensemble method for uncertainty quantification.The saved set of models produced distributions for each testing set image between the two classes of normal and tumor-containing. The relative frequencies permitted uncertainty quantification of model predictions. Intriguingly, we found that subjective features appreciated by human radiologists explained images for which uncertainty was high, highlighting the significance of uncertainty quantification in AI-driven radiological analyses.

    "abstract": "Remote sensing change detection (CD) is a pivotal technique that pinpoints changes on a global scale based on multi-temporal images. With the recent expansion of deep learning, supervised deep learning-based CD models have shown satisfactory performance. However, CD sample labeling is very time-consuming as it is densely labeled and requires expert knowledge. To alleviate this problem, we introduce ChangeAnywhere, a novel CD sample generation method using the semantic latent diffusion model and single-temporal images. Specifically, ChangeAnywhere leverages the relative ease of acquiring large single-temporal semantic datasets to generate large-scale, diverse, and semantically annotated bi-temporal CD datasets. ChangeAnywhere captures the two essentials of CD samples, i.e., change implies semantically different, and non-change implies reasonable change under the same semantic constraints. We generated ChangeAnywhere-100K, the largest synthesis CD dataset with 100,000 pairs of CD samples based on the proposed method. The ChangeAnywhere-100K significantly improved both zero-shot and few-shot performance on two CD benchmark datasets for various deep learning-based CD models, as demonstrated by transfer experiments. This paper delineates the enormous potential of ChangeAnywhere for CD sample generation and demonstrates the subsequent enhancement of model performance. Therefore, ChangeAnywhere offers a potent tool for remote sensing CD. All codes and pre-trained models will be available at https://github.com/tangkai-RS/ChangeAnywhere. ",

Here, we develop a general model, with no real-world training data, that accurately forecasts outbreaks and non-outbreaks. We propose a novel framework, using a feature-based time series classification method to forecast outbreaks and non-outbreaks. We tested our methods on synthetic data from a Susceptible-Infected-Recovered model for slowly changing, noisy disease dynamics. Outbreak sequences give a transcritical bifurcation within a specified future time window, whereas non-outbreak (null bifurcation) sequences do not. We identified incipient differences in time series of infectives leading to future outbreaks and non-outbreaks. These differences are reflected in 22 statistical features and 5 early warning signal indicators. Classifier performance, given by the area under the receiver-operating curve, ranged from 0.99 for large expanding windows of training data to 0.7 for small rolling windows. Real-world performances of classifiers were tested on two empirical datasets, COVID-19 data from Singapore and SARS data from Hong Kong, with two classifiers exhibiting high accuracy. In summary, we showed that there are statistical features that distinguish outbreak and non-outbreak sequences long before outbreaks occur. We could detect these differences in synthetic and real-world data sets, well before potential outbreaks occur. ",

To address these challenges, we present the first large-scale perirectal metastatic lymph node CT image dataset called Meply, which encompasses pixel-level annotations of 269 patients diagnosed with rectal cancer. Furthermore, we introduce a novel lymph-node segmentation model named CoSAM. The CoSAM utilizes sequence-based detection to guide the segmentation of metastatic lymph nodes in rectal cancer, contributing to improved localization performance for the segmentation model. It comprises three key components: sequence-based detection module, segmentation module, and collaborative convergence unit. To evaluate the effectiveness of CoSAM, we systematically compare its performance with several popular segmentation methods using the Meply dataset.

Although contemporary works, such as XProtoNet and MProtoNet, has sought to design interpretable prediction models for the issue, the localization precision of their resulting attribution maps can be further improved. To this end, we propose a Multi-scale Attentive Prototypical part Network, termed MAProtoNet, to provide more precise maps for attribution. Specifically, we introduce a concise multi-scale module to merge attentive features from quadruplet attention layers, and produces attribution maps. The proposed quadruplet attention layers can enhance the existing online class activation mapping loss via capturing interactions between the spatial and channel dimension, while the multi-scale module then fuses both fine-grained and coarse-grained information for precise maps generation. We also apply a novel multi-scale mapping loss for supervision on the proposed multi-scale module. Compared to existing interpretable prototypical part networks in medical imaging, MAProtoNet can achieve state-of-the-art performance in localization on brain tumor segmentation (BraTS) datasets, resulting in approximately 4% overall improvement on activation precision score (with a best score of 85.8%), without using additional annotated labels of segmentation.

Accurate anomaly detection in agricultural UAV images is vital for early identification of field irregularities. Traditional supervised learning faces challenges in adapting to diverse anomalies, necessitating extensive annotated data. In this work, we overcome this limitation with self-supervised learning using a masked image modeling approach. Masked Autoencoders (MAE) extract meaningful normal features from unlabeled image samples which produces high reconstruction error for the abnormal pixels during reconstruction. To remove the need of using only ``normal\" data while training, we use an anomaly suppression loss mechanism that effectively minimizes the reconstruction of anomalous pixels and allows the model to learn anomalous areas without explicitly separating ``normal\" images for training. Evaluation on the Agriculture-Vision data challenge shows a mIOU score improvement in comparison to prior state of the art in unsupervised and self-supervised methods.

Addressing this issue, our work replicates the effect that animal's camouflage can be easily revealed under a shifting spotlight, and leverages it for network co-supervision to form a compact yet efficient single-branch network, the Co-Supervised Spotlight Shifting Network (CS$^3$Net). The spotlight shifting strategy allows CS$^3$Net to learn additional prior within a single-branch framework, obviating the need for resource demanding multi-branch design. To leverage the prior of spotlight shifting co-supervision, we propose Shadow Refinement Module (SRM) and Projection Aware Attention (PAA) for feature refinement and enhancement. To ensure the continuity of multi-scale features aggregation, we utilize the Extended Neighbor Connection Decoder (ENCD) for generating the final predictions. Empirical evaluations on public datasets confirm that our CS$^3$Net offers an optimal balance between efficiency and performance: it accomplishes a 32.13% reduction in Multiply-Accumulate (MACs) operations compared to leading efficient COD models, while also delivering superior performance.

Existing works, however, have not fully utilized IMU measurements, particularly magnetometers, nor maximized the potential of deep learning to achieve the desired accuracy. To enhance the tracking accuracy for indoor robotic applications, we introduce NeurIT, a sequence-to-sequence framework that elevates tracking accuracy to a new level. NeurIT employs a Time-Frequency Block-recurrent Transformer (TF-BRT) at its core, combining the power of recurrent neural network (RNN) and Transformer to learn representative features in both time and frequency domains. To fully utilize IMU information, we strategically employ body-frame differentiation of the magnetometer, which considerably reduces the tracking error. NeurIT is implemented on a customized robotic platform and evaluated in various indoor environments. Experimental results demonstrate that NeurIT achieves a mere 1-meter tracking error over a 300-meter distance. Notably, it significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by 48.21% on unseen data. NeurIT also performs comparably to the visual-inertial approach (Tango Phone) in vision-favored conditions and surpasses it in plain environments. We believe NeurIT takes an important step forward toward practical neural inertial tracking for ubiquitous and scalable tracking of robotic things.

    "abstract": "Learning code representations has been the core prerequisite of many software engineering tasks such as code clone detection and code generation. State-of-the-art program representation techniques mainly utilize pre-trained language models (PLMs) such as CodeBERT. A Transformer encoder is firstly pre-trained on a large-scale code corpus to acquire general knowledge about source code. The pre-trained model is then fine-tuned on specific tasks using an amount of labeled data. However, gathering training samples for the downstream tasks can be prohibitively expensive and impractical for domain-specific languages or project-specific tasks. Besides, pre-training and downstream tasks are usually heterogeneous, which makes it difficult to fully explore the knowledge learned during pre-training. In this paper, we propose Zecoler, a zero-shot approach for learning code representations. Zecoler is built upon a pre-trained programming language model. In order to elicit knowledge from the PLMs efficiently, Zecoler casts the downstream tasks to the same form of pre-training objectives by inserting train-able prompts into the original input. These prompts can guide PLMs on how to generate better results. Subsequently, we employ the prompt tuning technique to search for the optimal prompts for PLMs automatically. This enables the representation model to efficiently fit the downstream tasks through fine-tuning on the dataset in source language domain and then reuse the pre-trained knowledge for the target domain in a zero-shot style. We evaluate Zecoler in five code intelligence tasks including code clone detection, code search, method name prediction, code summarization, and code generation. The results show that our approach significantly outperforms baseline models under the zero-shot setting. ",

    "abstract": "Low earth orbit (LEO) satellite communication networks have been considered as promising solutions to providing high data rate and seamless coverage, where satellite beam management plays a key role. However, due to the limitation of beam resource, dynamic network topology, beam spectrum reuse, time-varying traffic arrival and service continuity requirement, it is challenging to effectively allocate time-frequency resource of satellite beams to multiple cells. In this paper, aiming at reducing time-averaged beam revisit time and mitigate inter-satellite handover, a beam management problem is formulated for dynamic LEO satellite communication networks, under inter-cell interference and network stability constraints. Particularly, inter-cell interference constraints are further simplified into off-axis angle based constraints, which provide tractable rules for spectrum sharing between two beam cells. To deal with the long-term performance optimization, the primal problem is transformed into a series of single epoch problems by adopting Lyapunov optimization framework. Since the transformed problem is NP-hard, it is further divided into three subproblems, including serving beam allocation, beam service time allocation and serving satellite allocation. With the help of conflict graphs built with off-axis angle based constraints, serving beam allocation and beam service time allocation algorithms are developed to reduce beam revisit time and cell packet queue length. Then, we further develop a satellite-cell service relationship optimization algorithm to better adapt to dynamic network topology. Compared with baselines, numerical results show that our proposal can reduce average beam revisit time by 20.8% and keep strong network stability with similar inter-satellite handover frequency. ",

    "title": "Timing Advance Estimation in Low Earth Orbit Satellite Networks",
    "abstract": "Low earth orbit (LEO) satellite communication based on 3GPP standard is seen as a promising solution to rolling out communication services in areas without terrestrial base stations. However, due to the fast movement of satellites and large beam footprint size, the existing 5G timing advance (TA) estimation mechanism cannot be directly applied when global navigation satellite system is unavailable. In this article, an enhanced TA estimation approach is proposed for LEO satellite communication networks. Specifically, a user-side time-frequency pre-compensation method is introduced at first, which leverages frequency offset measurement on synchronization signal blocks broadcasted by satellites in initial cell search phase. For the random access phase, the upper bound of inter-preamble interference incurred by partial-period cross-correlation operations is derived for a preamble format advised by 3GPP, and it is shown that the interference level is closely related to the square of the number of such operations. Inspired by this result, a cyclic prefix free preamble format is further designed, which features extended guard time, differential power allocation and flexible preamble structure. Numerical results show that our proposal can reduce the missed detection rate of preamble within a beam. Particularly, the missed detection rates of preamble under 32, 48, and 64 users are lower than 1% when SNR = -6 dB, which is a significant improvement compared to baselines. In addition, our proposal can limit the TA estimation error of the detected users to the time length of 25 time-domain sampling points when the subcarrier spacing is 30 kHz and operation frequency is 27 GHz.

    "abstract": "The multimodal deep neural networks, represented by CLIP, have generated rich downstream applications owing to their excellent performance, thus making understanding the decision-making process of CLIP an essential research topic. Due to the complex structure and the massive pre-training data, it is often regarded as a black-box model that is too difficult to understand and interpret. Concept-based models map the black-box visual representations extracted by deep neural networks onto a set of human-understandable concepts and use the concepts to make predictions, enhancing the transparency of the decision-making process. However, these methods involve the datasets labeled with fine-grained attributes by expert knowledge, which incur high costs and introduce excessive human prior knowledge and bias. In this paper, we observe the long-tail distribution of concepts, based on which we propose a two-stage Concept Selection Model (CSM) to mine core concepts without introducing any human priors. The concept greedy rough selection algorithm is applied to extract head concepts, and then the concept mask fine selection method performs the extraction of core concepts. Experiments show that our approach achieves comparable performance to end-to-end black-box models, and human evaluation demonstrates that the concepts discovered by our method are interpretable and comprehensible for humans.

However, existing methods for underwater image enhancement mainly focus on improving the indicators in visual aspects, which may not benefit the tasks of underwater image detection, and may lead to serious degradation in performance. To alleviate this problem, we proposed a bidirectional-guided method for underwater object detection, referred to as BG-YOLO. In the proposed method, network is organized by constructing an enhancement branch and a detection branch in a parallel way. The enhancement branch consists of a cascade of an image enhancement subnet and an object detection subnet. And the detection branch only consists of a detection subnet. A feature guided module connects the shallow convolution layer of the two branches. When training the enhancement branch, the object detection subnet in the enhancement branch guides the image enhancement subnet to be optimized towards the direction that is most conducive to the detection task. The shallow feature map of the trained enhancement branch will be output to the feature guided module, constraining the optimization of detection branch through consistency loss and prompting detection branch to learn more detailed information of the objects. And hence the detection performance will be refined. During the detection tasks, only detection branch will be reserved so that no additional cost of computation will be introduced. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method shows significant improvement in performance of the detector in severely degraded underwater scenes while maintaining a remarkable detection speed.

Several recent studies seek to connect the generalization behavior of adversarially trained classifiers to various gradient-based min-max optimization algorithms used for their training. In this work, we study the generalization performance of adversarial training methods using the algorithmic stability framework. Specifically, our goal is to compare the generalization performance of the vanilla adversarial training scheme fully optimizing the perturbations at every iteration vs. the free adversarial training simultaneously optimizing the norm-bounded perturbations and classifier parameters. Our proven generalization bounds indicate that the free adversarial training method could enjoy a lower generalization gap between training and test samples due to the simultaneous nature of its min-max optimization algorithm. We perform several numerical experiments to evaluate the generalization performance of vanilla, fast, and free adversarial training methods. Our empirical findings also show the improved generalization performance of the free adversarial training method and further demonstrate that the better generalization result could translate to greater robustness against black-box attack schemes.

However, personalisation techniques often face the challenge of limited data for target individuals. This paper presents our work on an enhanced personalisation strategy, that leverages data augmentation to develop tailored models for continuous valence and arousal prediction. Our proposed approach, Distance Weighting Augmentation (DWA), employs a weighting-based augmentation method that expands a target individual's dataset, leveraging distance metrics to identify similar samples at the segment-level. Experimental results on the MuSe-Personalisation 2023 Challenge dataset demonstrate that our method significantly improves the performance of features sets which have low baseline performance, on the test set. This improvement in poor-performing features comes without sacrificing performance on high-performing features. In particular, our method achieves a maximum combined testing CCC of 0.78, compared to the reported baseline score of 0.76 (reproduced at 0.72). It also achieved a peak arousal and valence scores of 0.81 and 0.76, compared to reproduced baseline scores of 0.76 and 0.67 respectively. Through this work, we make significant contributions to the advancement of personalised affective computing models, enhancing the practicality and adaptability of data-level personalisation in real world contexts.

However, the current research fails to adequately address the prediction of mental health conditions from social media data in low-resource African languages like Swahili. This study introduces two distinct approaches utilising model-agnostic meta-learning and leveraging large language models (LLMs) to address this gap. Experiments are conducted on three datasets translated to low-resource language and applied to four mental health tasks, which include stress, depression, depression severity and suicidal ideation prediction. we first apply a meta-learning model with self-supervision, which results in improved model initialisation for rapid adaptation and cross-lingual transfer. The results show that our meta-trained model performs significantly better than standard fine-tuning methods, outperforming the baseline fine-tuning in macro F1 score with 18\\% and 0.8\\% over XLM-R and mBERT. In parallel, we use LLMs' in-context learning capabilities to assess their performance accuracy across the Swahili mental health prediction tasks by analysing different cross-lingual prompting approaches. Our analysis showed that Swahili prompts performed better than cross-lingual prompts but less than English prompts. Our findings show that in-context learning can be achieved through cross-lingual transfer through carefully crafted prompt templates with examples and instructions. ",

Consider for example the Navier-Stokes equations or wave propagation problems of acoustic or elastic waves. Current finite difference discretization methods are accurate and efficient on modern hardware, but they lack flexibility when it comes to complex geometries. In this work I extend the continuous summation-by-parts (SBP) framework to second derivatives and combine it with spectral-type SBP operators on Gauss-Lobatto quadrature points to obtain a highly efficient discretization (accurate with respect to runtime) of the Laplacian on complex domains. The resulting Laplace operator is defined on a grid without duplicated points on the interfaces, thus removing unnecessary degrees of freedom in the scheme, and is proven to satisfy a discrete equivalent to Green's first identity. Semi-discrete stability using the new Laplace operator is proven for the acoustic wave equation in 2D. Furthermore, the method can easily be coupled together with traditional finite difference operators using glue-grid interpolation operators, resulting in a method with great practical potential. Two numerical experiments are done on the acoustic wave equation in 2D. First on a problem with an analytical solution, demonstrating the accuracy and efficiency properties of the method. Finally, a more realistic problem is solved, where a complex region of the domain is discretized using the new method and coupled to the rest of the domain discretized using a traditional finite difference method.

    "abstract": "LLM-based code assistants are becoming increasingly popular among developers. These tools help developers improve their coding efficiency and reduce errors by providing real-time suggestions based on the developer's codebase. While beneficial, these tools might inadvertently expose the developer's proprietary code to the code assistant service provider during the development process. In this work, we propose two complementary methods to mitigate the risk of code leakage when using LLM-based code assistants. The first is a technique for reconstructing a developer's original codebase from code segments sent to the code assistant service (i.e., prompts) during the development process, enabling assessment and evaluation of the extent of code leakage to third parties (or adversaries). The second is CodeCloak, a novel deep reinforcement learning agent that manipulates the prompts before sending them to the code assistant service. CodeCloak aims to achieve the following two contradictory goals: (i) minimizing code leakage, while (ii) preserving relevant and useful suggestions for the developer. Our evaluation, employing GitHub Copilot, StarCoder, and CodeLlama LLM-based code assistants models, demonstrates the effectiveness of our CodeCloak approach on a diverse set of code repositories of varying sizes, as well as its transferability across different models. In addition, we generate a realistic simulated coding environment to thoroughly analyze code leakage risks and evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed mitigation techniques under practical development scenarios.

Therefore, we propose a reasoning-infused LLM agent to enhance this framework. This agent mimics human curiosity to ask follow-up questions to more efficiently navigate the search.

However, the large-scale development of satellite communication networks is constrained by the complex system models, whose modeling is challenging for massive users. Moreover, transmission interference between satellites and users seriously affects communication performance. To solve these problems, this paper develops generative artificial intelligence (AI) agents for model formulation and then applies a mixture of experts (MoE) approach to design transmission strategies. Specifically, we leverage large language models (LLMs) to build an interactive modeling paradigm and utilize retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to extract satellite expert knowledge that supports mathematical modeling. Afterward, by integrating the expertise of multiple specialized components, we propose an MoE-proximal policy optimization (PPO) approach to solve the formulated problem. Each expert can optimize the optimization variables at which it excels through specialized training through its own network and then aggregates them through the gating network to perform joint optimization. The simulation results validate the accuracy and effectiveness of employing a generative agent for problem formulation. Furthermore, the superiority of the proposed MoE-ppo approach over other benchmarks is confirmed in solving the formulated problem. The adaptability of MoE-PPO to various customized modeling problems has also been demonstrated. ",

Existing fusion strategies combine different types of images or merge different backbone features through elaborated neural network modules. However, these methods neglect that modality disparities affect cross-modality fusion performance, as different modalities with different camera focal lengths, placements, and angles are hardly fused. In this paper, we investigate cross-modality fusion by associating cross-modal features in a hidden state space based on an improved Mamba with a gating mechanism. We design a Fusion-Mamba block (FMB) to map cross-modal features into a hidden state space for interaction, thereby reducing disparities between cross-modal features and enhancing the representation consistency of fused features. FMB contains two modules: the State Space Channel Swapping (SSCS) module facilitates shallow feature fusion, and the Dual State Space Fusion (DSSF) enables deep fusion in a hidden state space. Through extensive experiments on public datasets, our proposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on $m$AP with 5.9% on $M^3FD$ and 4.9% on FLIR-Aligned datasets, demonstrating superior object detection performance.

This study addresses this gap by evaluating the impact of a haptic feedback, 360{\\deg} locomotion-integrated VR framework and longitudinal, heterogeneous training on decision-making performance in a complex search-and-shoot simulation. The study involved 32 participants from a defence simulation base in India, who were randomly divided into two groups: experimental (haptic feedback, 360{\\deg} locomotion-integrated VR framework with longitudinal, heterogeneous training) and placebo control (longitudinal, heterogeneous VR training without extrasensory modalities). The experiment lasted 10 days. On Day 1, all subjects executed a search-and-shoot simulation closely replicating the elements/situations in the real world. From Day 2 to Day 9, the subjects underwent heterogeneous training, imparted by the design of various complexity levels in the simulation using changes in behavioral attributes/artificial intelligence of the enemies. On Day 10, they repeated the search-and-shoot simulation executed on Day 1. The results showed that the experimental group experienced a gradual increase in presence, immersion, and engagement compared to the placebo control group. However, there was no significant difference in decision-making performance between the two groups on day 10.

However, coreset selection for object detection is more challenging as an image can contain multiple objects. As a result, much research has yet to be done on this topic. Therefore, we introduce a new approach, Coreset Selection for Object Detection (CSOD). CSOD generates imagewise and classwise representative feature vectors for multiple objects of the same class within each image. Subsequently, we adopt submodular optimization for considering both representativeness and diversity and utilize the representative vectors in the submodular optimization process to select a subset. When we evaluated CSOD on the Pascal VOC dataset, CSOD outperformed random selection by +6.4%p in AP$_{50}$ when selecting 200 images. ",

    "abstract": "Chain of thought finetuning aims to endow small student models with reasoning capacity to improve their performance towards a specific task by allowing them to imitate the reasoning procedure of large language models (LLMs) beyond simply predicting the answer to the question. However, the existing methods 1) generate rationale before the answer, making their answer correctness sensitive to the hallucination in the rationale;2) force the student model to repeat the exact LLMs rationale expression word-after-word, which could have the model biased towards learning the expression in rationale but count against the model from understanding the core logic behind it. Therefore, we propose a robust Post-Semantic-Thinking (PST) strategy to generate answers before rationale. Thanks to this answer-first setting, 1) the answering procedure can escape from the adverse effects caused by hallucinations in the rationale; 2) the complex reasoning procedure is tightly bound with the relatively concise answer, making the reasoning for questions easier with the prior information in the answer; 3) the efficiency of the method can also benefit from the setting since users can stop the generation right after answers are outputted when inference is conducted. Furthermore, the PST strategy loose the constraint against the generated rationale to be close to the LLMs gold standard in the hidden semantic space instead of the vocabulary space, thus making the small student model better comprehend the semantic reasoning logic in rationale. Extensive experiments conducted across 12 reasoning tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of PST. ",

    "abstract": "Self-supervised learning has emerged as a powerful way to pre-train generalizable machine learning models on large amounts of unlabeled data. It is particularly compelling in the music domain, where obtaining labeled data is time-consuming, error-prone, and ambiguous. During the self-supervised process, models are trained on pretext tasks, with the primary objective of acquiring robust and informative features that can later be fine-tuned for specific downstream tasks. The choice of the pretext task is critical as it guides the model to shape the feature space with meaningful constraints for information encoding. In the context of music, most works have relied on contrastive learning or masking techniques. In this study, we expand the scope of pretext tasks applied to music by investigating and comparing the performance of new self-supervised methods for music tagging. We open-source a simple ResNet model trained on a diverse catalog of millions of tracks. Our results demonstrate that, although most of these pre-training methods result in similar downstream results, contrastive learning consistently results in better downstream performance compared to other self-supervised pre-training methods. This holds true in a limited-data downstream context. ",

    "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved notable success in various applications over graph data. However, recent research has revealed that real-world graphs often contain noise, and GNNs are susceptible to noise in the graph. To address this issue, several Graph Structure Learning (GSL) models have been introduced. While GSL models are tailored to enhance robustness against edge noise through edge reconstruction, a significant limitation surfaces: their high reliance on node features. This inherent dependence amplifies their susceptibility to noise within node features. Recognizing this vulnerability, we present DEGNN, a novel GNN model designed to adeptly mitigate noise in both edges and node features. The core idea of DEGNN is to design two separate experts: an edge expert and a node feature expert. These experts utilize self-supervised learning techniques to produce modified edges and node features. Leveraging these modified representations, DEGNN subsequently addresses downstream tasks, ensuring robustness against noise present in both edges and node features of real-world graphs. Notably, the modification process can be trained end-to-end, empowering DEGNN to adjust dynamically and achieves optimal edge and node representations for specific tasks. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate DEGNN's efficacy in managing noise, both in original real-world graphs and in graphs with synthetic noise. ",

Due to its widespread use, fingerprint leakage may cause sensitive information theft, enormous economic and personnel losses, and even a potential compromise of national security. As a fingerprint that can coincidentally match a specific proportion of the overall fingerprint population, MasterPrint rings the alarm bells for the security of fingerprint authentication. In this paper, we propose a new side-channel attack on the minutiae-based Automatic Fingerprint Identification System (AFIS), called PrintListener, which leverages users' fingertip swiping actions on the screen to extract fingerprint pattern features (the first-level features) and synthesizes a stronger targeted PatternMasterPrint with potential second-level features. The attack scenario of PrintListener is extensive and covert. It only needs to record users' fingertip friction sound and can be launched by leveraging a large number of social media platforms. Extensive experimental results in realworld scenarios show that Printlistener can significantly improve the attack potency of MasterPrint. ",

In this paper, we introduce DetCLIPv3, a high-performing detector that excels not only at both open-vocabulary object detection, but also generating hierarchical labels for detected objects. DetCLIPv3 is characterized by three core designs: 1. Versatile model architecture: we derive a robust open-set detection framework which is further empowered with generation ability via the integration of a caption head. 2. High information density data: we develop an auto-annotation pipeline leveraging visual large language model to refine captions for large-scale image-text pairs, providing rich, multi-granular object labels to enhance the training. 3. Efficient training strategy: we employ a pre-training stage with low-resolution inputs that enables the object captioner to efficiently learn a broad spectrum of visual concepts from extensive image-text paired data. This is followed by a fine-tuning stage that leverages a small number of high-resolution samples to further enhance detection performance. With these effective designs, DetCLIPv3 demonstrates superior open-vocabulary detection performance, \\eg, our Swin-T backbone model achieves a notable 47.0 zero-shot fixed AP on the LVIS minival benchmark, outperforming GLIPv2, GroundingDINO, and DetCLIPv2 by 18.0/19.6/6.6 AP, respectively.

Semantic modeling within operating rooms, as a scene graph generation (SGG) task, is challenging since it involves consecutive recognition of subtle surgical actions over prolonged periods. To address this challenge, we propose a Tri-modal (i.e., images, point clouds, and language) confluence with Temporal dynamics framework, termed TriTemp-OR. Diverging from previous approaches that integrated temporal information via memory graphs, our method embraces two advantages: 1) we directly exploit bi-modal temporal information from the video streaming for hierarchical feature interaction, and 2) the prior knowledge from Large Language Models (LLMs) is embedded to alleviate the class-imbalance problem in the operating theatre. Specifically, our model performs temporal interactions across 2D frames and 3D point clouds, including a scale-adaptive multi-view temporal interaction (ViewTemp) and a geometric-temporal point aggregation (PointTemp). Furthermore, we transfer knowledge from the biomedical LLM, LLaVA-Med, to deepen the comprehension of intraoperative relations. The proposed TriTemp-OR enables the aggregation of tri-modal features through relation-aware unification to predict relations so as to generate scene graphs. Experimental results on the 4D-OR benchmark demonstrate the superior performance of our model for long-term OR streaming. ",

In the style of popular tower defense games, players strategically position magical portals that need to distinguish between creatures exhibiting the behavior described by correct code from those that are mutated, and thus faulty. When placing portals, players are implicitly testing: They choose test inputs (i.e., where to place portals), as well as test oracles (i.e., what behavior to expect), and they observe test executions as the creatures wander across the landscape passing the players' portals.

    "abstract": "The popularity of Machine Learning (ML) makes the privacy of sensitive data more imperative than ever. Collaborative learning techniques like Split Learning (SL) aim to protect client data while enhancing ML processes. Though promising, SL has been proved to be vulnerable to a plethora of attacks, thus raising concerns about its effectiveness on data privacy. In this work, we introduce a hybrid approach combining SL and Function Secret Sharing (FSS) to ensure client data privacy. The client adds a random mask to the activation map before sending it to the servers. The servers cannot access the original function but instead work with shares generated using FSS. Consequently, during both forward and backward propagation, the servers cannot reconstruct the client's raw data from the activation map. Furthermore, through visual invertibility, we demonstrate that the server is incapable of reconstructing the raw image data from the activation map when using FSS. It enhances privacy by reducing privacy leakage compared to other SL-based approaches where the server can access client input information. Our approach also ensures security against feature space hijacking attack, protecting sensitive information from potential manipulation. Our protocols yield promising results, reducing communication overhead by over 2x and training time by over 7x compared to the same model with FSS, without any SL. Also, we show that our approach achieves >96% accuracy and remains equivalent to the plaintext models. ",

PANet comprises a Haze-to-Parameter Mapper (HPM) to project hazy images into a parameter space and a Parameter-to-Haze Mapper (PHM) to map the resampled haze parameters back to hazy images. In the parameter space, we can pixel-wisely resample individual haze parameter maps to generate diverse hazy images with physically-explainable haze conditions unseen in the training set.

    "abstract": "Visual relocalization is a key technique to autonomous driving, robotics, and virtual/augmented reality. After decades of explorations, absolute pose regression (APR), scene coordinate regression (SCR), and hierarchical methods (HMs) have become the most popular frameworks. However, in spite of high efficiency, APRs and SCRs have limited accuracy especially in large-scale outdoor scenes; HMs are accurate but need to store a large number of 2D descriptors for matching, resulting in poor efficiency. In this paper, we propose an efficient and accurate framework, called VRS-NeRF, for visual relocalization with sparse neural radiance field. Precisely, we introduce an explicit geometric map (EGM) for 3D map representation and an implicit learning map (ILM) for sparse patches rendering. In this localization process, EGP provides priors of spare 2D points and ILM utilizes these sparse points to render patches with sparse NeRFs for matching. This allows us to discard a large number of 2D descriptors so as to reduce the map size. Moreover, rendering patches only for useful points rather than all pixels in the whole image reduces the rendering time significantly. This framework inherits the accuracy of HMs and discards their low efficiency. Experiments on 7Scenes, CambridgeLandmarks, and Aachen datasets show that our method gives much better accuracy than APRs and SCRs, and close performance to HMs but is much more efficient. ",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a Model Predictive Control (MPC) scheme for flight scheduling and energy management of electric aviation networks, where electric aircraft transport passengers between electrified airports equipped with sustainable energy sources and battery storage, with the goal of minimizing grid dependency. Specifically, we first model the aircraft flight and charge scheduling problem jointly with the airport energy management problem, explicitly accounting for local weather forecasts. Second, we frame the minimum-grid-energy operational problem as a mixed-integer linear program and solve it in a receding horizon fashion, where the route assignment and charging decisions of each aircraft can be dynamically reassigned to mitigate disruptions. We showcase the proposed MPC scheme on real-world data taken from conventional flights and weather conditions in the Dutch Leeward Antilles. Our results show that MPC can effectively guarantee operation of the network by efficiently re-assigning flights and rescheduling aircraft charging, whilst maximizing the efficiency of the on-site energy systems.

    "abstract": "In today's rapidly evolving landscape of Artificial Intelligence, large language models (LLMs) have emerged as a vibrant research topic. LLMs find applications in various fields and contribute significantly. Despite their powerful language capabilities, similar to pre-trained language models (PLMs), LLMs still face challenges in remembering events, incorporating new information, and addressing domain-specific issues or hallucinations. To overcome these limitations, researchers have proposed Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques, some others have proposed the integration of LLMs with Knowledge Graphs (KGs) to provide factual context, thereby improving performance and delivering more accurate feedback to user queries. Education plays a crucial role in human development and progress. With the technology transformation, traditional education is being replaced by digital or blended education. Therefore, educational data in the digital environment is increasing day by day. Data in higher education institutions are diverse, comprising various sources such as unstructured/structured text, relational databases, web/app-based API access, etc. Constructing a Knowledge Graph from these cross-data sources is not a simple task. This article proposes a method for automatically constructing a Knowledge Graph from multiple data sources and discusses some initial applications (experimental trials) of KG in conjunction with LLMs for question-answering tasks.

    "abstract": "Recent trends have shown that autonomous agents, such as Autonomous Ground Vehicles (AGVs), Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), and mobile robots, effectively improve human productivity in solving diverse tasks. However, since these agents are typically powered by portable batteries, they require extremely low power/energy consumption to operate in a long lifespan. To solve this challenge, neuromorphic computing has emerged as a promising solution, where bio-inspired Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) use spikes from event-based cameras or data conversion pre-processing to perform sparse computations efficiently. However, the studies of SNN deployments for autonomous agents are still at an early stage. Hence, the optimization stages for enabling efficient embodied SNN deployments for autonomous agents have not been defined systematically. Toward this, we propose a novel framework called SNN4Agents that consists of a set of optimization techniques for designing energy-efficient embodied SNNs targeting autonomous agent applications. Our SNN4Agents employs weight quantization, timestep reduction, and attention window reduction to jointly improve the energy efficiency, reduce the memory footprint, optimize the processing latency, while maintaining high accuracy. In the evaluation, we investigate use cases of event-based car recognition, and explore the trade-offs among accuracy, latency, memory, and energy consumption. The experimental results show that our proposed framework can maintain high accuracy (i.e., 84.12% accuracy) with 68.75% memory saving, 3.58x speed-up, and 4.03x energy efficiency improvement as compared to the state-of-the-art work for NCARS dataset, thereby enabling energy-efficient embodied SNN deployments for autonomous agents.

Taking CIFAR10 as an example, SOTA clean accuracy is about $100$%, but SOTA robustness to $\\ell_{\\infty}$-norm bounded perturbations barely exceeds $70$%. To understand this gap, we analyze how model size, dataset size, and synthetic data quality affect robustness by developing the first scaling laws for adversarial training. Our scaling laws reveal inefficiencies in prior art and provide actionable feedback to advance the field. For instance, we discovered that SOTA methods diverge notably from compute-optimal setups, using excess compute for their level of robustness. Leveraging a compute-efficient setup, we surpass the prior SOTA with $20$% ($70$%) fewer training (inference) FLOPs. We trained various compute-efficient models, with our best achieving $74$% AutoAttack accuracy ($+3$% gain). However, our scaling laws also predict robustness slowly grows then plateaus at $90$%: dwarfing our new SOTA by scaling is impractical, and perfect robustness is impossible. To better understand this predicted limit, we carry out a small-scale human evaluation on the AutoAttack data that fools our top-performing model. Concerningly, we estimate that human performance also plateaus near $90$%, which we show to be attributable to $\\ell_{\\infty}$-constrained attacks' generation of invalid images not consistent with their original labels. Having characterized limiting roadblocks, we outline promising paths for future research. ",

BR-GCN models use bi-level attention to learn node embeddings through (1) node-level attention, and (2) relation-level attention. The node-level self-attentional layers use intra-relational graph interactions to learn relation-specific node embeddings using a weighted aggregation of neighborhood features in a sparse subgraph region. The relation-level self-attentional layers use inter-relational graph interactions to learn the final node embeddings using a weighted aggregation of relation-specific node embeddings. The BR-GCN bi-level attention mechanism extends Transformer-based multiplicative attention from the natural language processing (NLP) domain, and Graph Attention Networks (GAT)-based attention, to large-scale heterogeneous graphs (HGs). On node classification, BR-GCN outperforms baselines from 0.29% to 14.95% as a stand-alone model, and on link prediction, BR-GCN outperforms baselines from 0.02% to 7.40% as an auto-encoder model. We also conduct ablation studies to evaluate the quality of BR-GCN's relation-level attention and discuss how its learning of graph structure may be transferred to enrich other graph neural networks (GNNs). Through various experiments, we show that BR-GCN's attention mechanism is both scalable and more effective in learning compared to state-of-the-art GNNs. ",

    "abstract": "The worldwide adoption of machine learning (ML) and deep learning models, particularly in critical sectors, such as healthcare and finance, presents substantial challenges in maintaining individual privacy and fairness. These two elements are vital to a trustworthy environment for learning systems. While numerous studies have concentrated on protecting individual privacy through differential privacy (DP) mechanisms, emerging research indicates that differential privacy in machine learning models can unequally impact separate demographic subgroups regarding prediction accuracy. This leads to a fairness concern, and manifests as biased performance. Although the prevailing view is that enhancing privacy intensifies fairness disparities, a smaller, yet significant, subset of research suggests the opposite view. In this article, with extensive evaluation results, we demonstrate that the impact of differential privacy on fairness is not monotonous. Instead, we observe that the accuracy disparity initially grows as more DP noise (enhanced privacy) is added to the ML process, but subsequently diminishes at higher privacy levels with even more noise. Moreover, implementing gradient clipping in the differentially private stochastic gradient descent ML method can mitigate the negative impact of DP noise on fairness. This mitigation is achieved by moderating the disparity growth through a lower clipping threshold. ",

However, there are growing concerns that DMs could be used to imitate unauthorized creations and thus raise copyright issues. To address this issue, we propose a novel framework that embeds personal watermarks in the generation of adversarial examples. Such examples can force DMs to generate images with visible watermarks and prevent DMs from imitating unauthorized images. We construct a generator based on conditional adversarial networks and design three losses (adversarial loss, GAN loss, and perturbation loss) to generate adversarial examples that have subtle perturbation but can effectively attack DMs to prevent copyright violations. Training a generator for a personal watermark by our method only requires 5-10 samples within 2-3 minutes, and once the generator is trained, it can generate adversarial examples with that watermark significantly fast (0.2s per image). We conduct extensive experiments in various conditional image-generation scenarios. Compared to existing methods that generate images with chaotic textures, our method adds visible watermarks on the generated images, which is a more straightforward way to indicate copyright violations. We also observe that our adversarial examples exhibit good transferability across unknown generative models. Therefore, this work provides a simple yet powerful way to protect copyright from DM-based imitation. ",

Nevertheless, directly predicting the coordinates of objects in 3D space from monocular images poses challenges. Therefore, an effective solution involves transforming monocular images into LiDAR-like representations and employing a LiDAR-based 3D object detector to predict the 3D coordinates of objects. The key step in this method is accurately converting the monocular image into a reliable point cloud form. In this paper, we present VFMM3D, an innovative approach that leverages the capabilities of Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) to accurately transform single-view images into LiDAR point cloud representations. VFMM3D utilizes the Segment Anything Model (SAM) and Depth Anything Model (DAM) to generate high-quality pseudo-LiDAR data enriched with rich foreground information. Specifically, the Depth Anything Model (DAM) is employed to generate dense depth maps. Subsequently, the Segment Anything Model (SAM) is utilized to differentiate foreground and background regions by predicting instance masks. These predicted instance masks and depth maps are then combined and projected into 3D space to generate pseudo-LiDAR points. Finally, any object detectors based on point clouds can be utilized to predict the 3D coordinates of objects. Comprehensive experiments are conducted on the challenging 3D object detection dataset KITTI. Our VFMM3D establishes a new state-of-the-art performance.

To move posterior matching closer to practical communication, this paper seeks to constrain how often feedback can be sent back to the transmitter.

However, because heterogeneous graphs inherently possess complex structures, such as hierarchical or power-law structures, distortions can occur when representing them in Euclidean space. To overcome this limitation, we propose Hyperbolic Heterogeneous Graph Attention Networks (HHGAT) that learn vector representations in hyperbolic spaces with meta-path instances. We conducted experiments on three real-world heterogeneous graph datasets, demonstrating that HHGAT outperforms state-of-the-art heterogeneous graph embedding models in node classification and clustering tasks.

    "abstract": "Gaussian splatting, renowned for its exceptional rendering quality and efficiency, has emerged as a prominent technique in 3D scene representation. However, the substantial data volume of Gaussian splatting impedes its practical utility in real-world applications. Herein, we propose an efficient 3D scene representation, named Compressed Gaussian Splatting (CompGS), which harnesses compact Gaussian primitives for faithful 3D scene modeling with a remarkably reduced data size. To ensure the compactness of Gaussian primitives, we devise a hybrid primitive structure that captures predictive relationships between each other. Then, we exploit a small set of anchor primitives for prediction, allowing the majority of primitives to be encapsulated into highly compact residual forms. Moreover, we develop a rate-constrained optimization scheme to eliminate redundancies within such hybrid primitives, steering our CompGS towards an optimal trade-off between bitrate consumption and representation efficacy. Experimental results show that the proposed CompGS significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving superior compactness in 3D scene representation without compromising model accuracy and rendering quality. Our code will be released on GitHub for further research. ",

To overcome their inherent incompleteness, multi-modal knowledge graph completion (MMKGC) aims to discover unobserved knowledge from given MMKGs, leveraging both structural information from the triples and multi-modal information of the entities. Existing MMKGC methods usually extract multi-modal features with pre-trained models and employ a fusion module to integrate multi-modal features with triple prediction. However, this often results in a coarse handling of multi-modal data, overlooking the nuanced, fine-grained semantic details and their interactions. To tackle this shortfall, we introduce a novel framework MyGO to process, fuse, and augment the fine-grained modality information from MMKGs. MyGO tokenizes multi-modal raw data as fine-grained discrete tokens and learns entity representations with a cross-modal entity encoder. To further augment the multi-modal representations, MyGO incorporates fine-grained contrastive learning to highlight the specificity of the entity representations. Experiments on standard MMKGC benchmarks reveal that our method surpasses 20 of the latest models, underlining its superior performance.

However, the testing and evaluation of HLS designs still typically rely on slow RTL-level simulators that can take hours to provide feedback, especially for complex designs. A recent work, LightningSim, helps to solve this problem by providing a simulation workflow one to two orders of magnitude faster than RTL simulation. However, it still exhibits inefficiencies due to several types of redundant computation, making it slow for large design simulation and design space exploration. Addressing these inefficiencies, we introduce LightningSimV2, a much faster and scalable simulation tool. LightningSimV2 features three main innovations. First, we perform compile-time static analysis, exploiting the repetitive structures in HLS designs, e.g., loops, to reduce the simulation workload. Second, we propose a novel graph-based simulation approach, with decoupled simulation graph construction step and graph traversal step, significantly reducing repeated computation. Third, benefiting from the decoupled approach, LightningSimV2 can perform incremental stall analysis extremely fast, enabling highly efficient design space exploration of large numbers of complex hardware parameters, e.g., optimal FIFO depths. Moreover, the DSE is well-suited for parallel computing, further improving the DSE efficiency. Compared with LightningSim, LightningSimV2 achieves up to 3.5x speedup in full simulation and up to 577x speed up for incremental DSE. Our code is open-source on GitHub. ",

    "abstract": "Weakly-supervised learning approaches have gained significant attention due to their ability to reduce the effort required for human annotations in training neural networks. This paper investigates a framework for weakly-supervised object localization, which aims to train a neural network capable of predicting both the object class and its location using only images and their image-level class labels. The proposed framework consists of a shared feature extractor, a classifier, and a localizer. The localizer predicts pixel-level class probabilities, while the classifier predicts the object class at the image level. Since image-level class labels are insufficient for training the localizer, weakly-supervised object localization methods often encounter challenges in accurately localizing the entire object region. To address this issue, the proposed method incorporates adversarial erasing and pseudo labels to improve localization accuracy. Specifically, novel losses are designed to utilize adversarially erased foreground features and adversarially erased feature maps, reducing dependence on the most discriminative region. Additionally, the proposed method employs pseudo labels to suppress activation values in the background while increasing them in the foreground. The proposed method is applied to two backbone networks (MobileNetV1 and InceptionV3) and is evaluated on three publicly available datasets (ILSVRC-2012, CUB-200-2011, and PASCAL VOC 2012). The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods across all evaluated metrics. ",

    "abstract": "Vision-based perception for autonomous driving requires an explicit modeling of a 3D space, where 2D latent representations are mapped and subsequent 3D operators are applied. However, operating on dense latent spaces introduces a cubic time and space complexity, which limits scalability in terms of perception range or spatial resolution. Existing approaches compress the dense representation using projections like Bird's Eye View (BEV) or Tri-Perspective View (TPV). Although efficient, these projections result in information loss, especially for tasks like semantic occupancy prediction. To address this, we propose SparseOcc, an efficient occupancy network inspired by sparse point cloud processing. It utilizes a lossless sparse latent representation with three key innovations. Firstly, a 3D sparse diffuser performs latent completion using spatially decomposed 3D sparse convolutional kernels. Secondly, a feature pyramid and sparse interpolation enhance scales with information from others. Finally, the transformer head is redesigned as a sparse variant. SparseOcc achieves a remarkable 74.9% reduction on FLOPs over the dense baseline. Interestingly, it also improves accuracy, from 12.8% to 14.1% mIOU, which in part can be attributed to the sparse representation's ability to avoid hallucinations on empty voxels. ",

Then, stochastic geometry is utilized to analyze the downlink coverage probability under the setting of shared frequency and distinct frequencies. Specifically, we derive mathematical expressions for the distances distribution from the serving station to the typical user and the associated probability based on the maximum bias power selection strategy (Max-BPR). Taking into account real-world satellite antenna beamforming patterns in two system scenarios, we derive the downlink coverage probabilities in terms of parameters such as base station density and orbital inclination. Finally, the correctness of the theoretical derivations is verified through experimental simulations, and the influence of network design parameters on the downlink coverage probability is analyzed.

However, traditional methods have struggled to accurately describe the quantitative structure-property relationships for complex structures. In our study, we bridge this gap by leveraging machine learning to analyze images of materials' microstructures, thus offering a novel way to understand and predict the properties of materials based on their microstructures. We introduce a method known as FAGC (Feature Augmentation on Geodesic Curves), specifically demonstrated for Cu-Cr-Zr alloys. This approach utilizes machine learning to examine the shapes within images of the alloys' microstructures and predict their mechanical and electronic properties. This generative FAGC approach can effectively expand the relatively small training datasets due to the limited availability of materials images labeled with quantitative properties. The process begins with extracting features from the images using neural networks. These features are then mapped onto the Pre-shape space to construct the Geodesic curves. Along these curves, new features are generated, effectively increasing the dataset. Moreover, we design a pseudo-labeling mechanism for these newly generated features to further enhance the training dataset. Our FAGC method has shown remarkable results, significantly improving the accuracy of predicting the electronic conductivity and hardness of Cu-Cr-Zr alloys, with R-squared values of 0.978 and 0.998, respectively. These outcomes underscore the potential of FAGC to address the challenge of limited image data in materials science, providing a powerful tool for establishing detailed and quantitative relationships between complex microstructures and material properties.

To solve this problem, domain adaptation approaches have been developed that use a small quantity of labeled data to adjust the model to the target domain. In this research, we introduced a synthetic document dataset called RanLayNet, enriched with automatically assigned labels denoting spatial positions, ranges, and types of layout elements. The primary aim of this endeavor is to develop a versatile dataset capable of training models with robustness and adaptability to diverse document formats. Through empirical experimentation, we demonstrate that a deep layout identification model trained on our dataset exhibits enhanced performance compared to a model trained solely on actual documents. Moreover, we conduct a comparative analysis by fine-tuning inference models using both PubLayNet and IIIT-AR-13K datasets on the Doclaynet dataset.

    "abstract": "This paper introduces a new method for estimating the penetration of the end effector and the parameters of a soft body using a collaborative robotic arm. This is possible using the dimensionality reduction method that simplifies the Hunt-Crossley model. The parameters can be found without a force sensor thanks to the information of the robotic arm controller. To achieve an online estimation, an extended Kalman filter is employed, which embeds the contact dynamic model. The algorithm is tested with various types of silicone, including samples with hard intrusions to simulate cancerous cells within a soft tissue. The results indicate that this technique can accurately determine the parameters and estimate the penetration of the end effector into the soft body. These promising preliminary results demonstrate the potential for robots to serve as an effective tool for early-stage cancer diagnostics. ",

    "abstract": "Click-through rate (CTR) prediction plays an indispensable role in online platforms. Numerous models have been proposed to capture users' shifting preferences by leveraging user behavior sequences. However, these historical sequences often suffer from severe homogeneity and scarcity compared to the extensive item pool. Relying solely on such sequences for user representations is inherently restrictive, as user interests extend beyond the scope of items they have previously engaged with. To address this challenge, we propose a data-driven approach to enrich user representations. We recognize user profiling and recall items as two ideal data sources within the cross-stage framework, encompassing the u2u (user-to-user) and i2i (item-to-item) aspects respectively. In this paper, we propose a novel architecture named Recall-Augmented Ranking (RAR). RAR consists of two key sub-modules, which synergistically gather information from a vast pool of look-alike users and recall items, resulting in enriched user representations. Notably, RAR is orthogonal to many existing CTR models, allowing for consistent performance improvements in a plug-and-play manner. Extensive experiments are conducted, which verify the efficacy and compatibility of RAR against the SOTA methods. ",

    "abstract": "Randomized Smoothing (RS) has been proven a promising method for endowing an arbitrary image classifier with certified robustness. However, the substantial uncertainty inherent in the high-dimensional isotropic Gaussian noise imposes the curse of dimensionality on RS. Specifically, the upper bound of ${\\ell_2}$ certified robustness radius provided by RS exhibits a diminishing trend with the expansion of the input dimension $d$, proportionally decreasing at a rate of $1/\\sqrt{d}$. This paper explores the feasibility of providing ${\\ell_2}$ certified robustness for high-dimensional input through the utilization of dual smoothing in the lower-dimensional space. The proposed Dual Randomized Smoothing (DRS) down-samples the input image into two sub-images and smooths the two sub-images in lower dimensions. Theoretically, we prove that DRS guarantees a tight ${\\ell_2}$ certified robustness radius for the original input and reveal that DRS attains a superior upper bound on the ${\\ell_2}$ robustness radius, which decreases proportionally at a rate of $(1/\\sqrt m + 1/\\sqrt n )$ with $m+n=d$. Extensive experiments demonstrate the generalizability and effectiveness of DRS, which exhibits a notable capability to integrate with established methodologies, yielding substantial improvements in both accuracy and ${\\ell_2}$ certified robustness baselines of RS on the CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets.

    "abstract": "Source code vulnerability detection aims to identify inherent vulnerabilities to safeguard software systems from potential attacks. Many prior studies overlook diverse vulnerability characteristics, simplifying the problem into a binary (0-1) classification task for example determining whether it is vulnerable or not. This poses a challenge for a single deep learning-based model to effectively learn the wide array of vulnerability characteristics. Furthermore, due to the challenges associated with collecting large-scale vulnerability data, these detectors often overfit limited training datasets, resulting in lower model generalization performance. To address the aforementioned challenges, in this work, we introduce a fine-grained vulnerability detector namely FGVulDet. Unlike previous approaches, FGVulDet employs multiple classifiers to discern characteristics of various vulnerability types and combines their outputs to identify the specific type of vulnerability. Each classifier is designed to learn type-specific vulnerability semantics. Additionally, to address the scarcity of data for some vulnerability types and enhance data diversity for learning better vulnerability semantics, we propose a novel vulnerability-preserving data augmentation technique to augment the number of vulnerabilities. Taking inspiration from recent advancements in graph neural networks for learning program semantics, we incorporate a Gated Graph Neural Network (GGNN) and extend it to an edge-aware GGNN to capture edge-type information. FGVulDet is trained on a large-scale dataset from GitHub, encompassing five different types of vulnerabilities. Extensive experiments compared with static-analysis-based approaches and learning-based approaches have demonstrated the effectiveness of FGVulDet. ",

    "abstract": "Human beings construct perception of space by integrating sparse observations into massively interconnected synapses and neurons, offering a superior parallelism and efficiency. Replicating this capability in AI finds wide applications in medical imaging, AR/VR, and embodied AI, where input data is often sparse and computing resources are limited. However, traditional signal reconstruction methods on digital computers face both software and hardware challenges. On the software front, difficulties arise from storage inefficiencies in conventional explicit signal representation. Hardware obstacles include the von Neumann bottleneck, which limits data transfer between the CPU and memory, and the limitations of CMOS circuits in supporting parallel processing. We propose a systematic approach with software-hardware co-optimizations for signal reconstruction from sparse inputs. Software-wise, we employ neural field to implicitly represent signals via neural networks, which is further compressed using low-rank decomposition and structured pruning. Hardware-wise, we design a resistive memory-based computing-in-memory (CIM) platform, featuring a Gaussian Encoder (GE) and an MLP Processing Engine (PE). The GE harnesses the intrinsic stochasticity of resistive memory for efficient input encoding, while the PE achieves precise weight mapping through a Hardware-Aware Quantization (HAQ) circuit. We demonstrate the system's efficacy on a 40nm 256Kb resistive memory-based in-memory computing macro, achieving huge energy efficiency and parallelism improvements without compromising reconstruction quality in tasks like 3D CT sparse reconstruction, novel view synthesis, and novel view synthesis for dynamic scenes. This work advances the AI-driven signal restoration technology and paves the way for future efficient and robust medical AI and 3D vision applications. ",

VLAP transforms the embedding space of pretrained vision models into the LLMs' word embedding space using a single linear layer for efficient and general-purpose visual and language understanding. Specifically, we harness well-established word embeddings to bridge two modality embedding spaces. The visual and text representations are simultaneously assigned to a set of word embeddings within pretrained LLMs by formulating the assigning procedure as an optimal transport problem. We predict the assignment of one modality from the representation of another modality data, enforcing consistent assignments for paired multimodal data. This allows vision and language representations to contain the same information, grounding the frozen LLMs' word embedding space in visual data. Moreover, a robust semantic taxonomy of LLMs can be preserved with visual data since the LLMs interpret and reason linguistic information from correlations between word embeddings. Experimental results show that VLAP achieves substantial improvements over the previous linear transformation-based approaches across a range of vision-language tasks, including image captioning, visual question answering, and cross-modal retrieval. We also demonstrate the learned visual representations hold a semantic taxonomy of LLMs, making visual semantic arithmetic possible. ",

    "abstract": "Large vision-language models (LVLMs) are markedly proficient in deriving visual representations guided by natural language. Recent explorations have utilized LVLMs to tackle zero-shot visual anomaly detection (VAD) challenges by pairing images with textual descriptions indicative of normal and abnormal conditions, referred to as anomaly prompts. However, existing approaches depend on static anomaly prompts that are prone to cross-semantic ambiguity, and prioritize global image-level representations over crucial local pixel-level image-to-text alignment that is necessary for accurate anomaly localization. In this paper, we present ALFA, a training-free approach designed to address these challenges via a unified model. We propose a run-time prompt adaptation strategy, which first generates informative anomaly prompts to leverage the capabilities of a large language model (LLM). This strategy is enhanced by a contextual scoring mechanism for per-image anomaly prompt adaptation and cross-semantic ambiguity mitigation. We further introduce a novel fine-grained aligner to fuse local pixel-level semantics for precise anomaly localization, by projecting the image-text alignment from global to local semantic spaces. Extensive evaluations on the challenging MVTec and VisA datasets confirm ALFA's effectiveness in harnessing the language potential for zero-shot VAD, achieving significant PRO improvements of 12.1% on MVTec AD and 8.9% on VisA compared to state-of-the-art zero-shot VAD approaches.

Specifically, SFPNet comprises a series of blocks named as Scenario-Tailoring Block, stacked sequentially. Each block initially deploys a parameter personalization unit to integrate scenario information at a coarse-grained level by redefining fundamental features. Subsequently, we consolidate scenario-adaptively adjusted feature representations to serve as context information. By employing residual connection, we incorporate this context into the representation of each historical behavior, allowing for context-aware fine-grained customization of the behavior representations at the scenario-level, which in turn supports scenario-aware user interest modeling.

However, good data is not a free lunch and is always hard to access due to privacy regulations like the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). A potential solution is to release a synthetic dataset with a similar distribution to that of the private dataset. Nevertheless, in some scenarios, it has been found that the attributes needed to train an AI model belong to different parties, and they cannot share the raw data for synthetic data publication due to privacy regulations. In PETS 2023, Xue et al. proposed the first generative adversary network-based model, VertiGAN, for vertically partitioned data publication. However, after thoroughly investigating, we found that VertiGAN is less effective in preserving the correlation among the attributes of different parties. This article proposes a Vertical Federated Learning-based Generative Adversarial Network, VFLGAN, for vertically partitioned data publication to address the above issues. Our experimental results show that compared with VertiGAN, VFLGAN significantly improves the quality of synthetic data. Taking the MNIST dataset as an example, the quality of the synthetic dataset generated by VFLGAN is 3.2 times better than that generated by VertiGAN w.r.t. the Fr\\'echet Distance. We also designed a more efficient and effective Gaussian mechanism for the proposed VFLGAN to provide the synthetic dataset with a differential privacy guarantee. On the other hand, differential privacy only gives the upper bound of the worst-case privacy guarantee. This article also proposes a practical auditing scheme that applies membership inference attacks to estimate privacy leakage through the synthetic dataset. ",

Most existing methods are CNN-based and estimate optical flow from the source image to the current driving frame, which is then inpainted and refined to produce the output animation. We propose a transformer-based encoder for computing a set-latent representation of the source image(s). We then predict the output color of a query pixel using a transformer-based decoder, which is conditioned with keypoints and a facial expression vector extracted from the driving frame. Latent representations of the source person are learned in a self-supervised manner that factorize their appearance, head pose, and facial expressions. Thus, they are perfectly suited for cross-reenactment. In contrast to most related work, our method naturally extends to multiple source images and can thus adapt to person-specific facial dynamics. We also propose data augmentation and regularization schemes that are necessary to prevent overfitting and support generalizability of the learned representations. We evaluated our approach in a randomized user study. The results indicate superior performance compared to the state-of-the-art in terms of motion transfer quality and temporal consistency. ",

    "abstract": "Drawing a graph in the plane with as few crossings as possible is one of the central problems in graph drawing and computational geometry. Another option is to remove the smallest number of vertices or edges such that the remaining graph can be drawn without crossings. We study both problems in a book-embedding setting for ordered graphs, that is, graphs with a fixed vertex order. In this setting, the vertices lie on a straight line, called the spine, in the given order, and each edge must be drawn on one of several pages of a book such that every edge has at most a fixed number of crossings. In book embeddings, there is another way to reduce or avoid crossings; namely by using more pages. The minimum number of pages needed to draw an ordered graph without any crossings is its (fixed-vertex-order) page number. We show that the page number of an ordered graph with $n$ vertices and $m$ edges can be computed in $2^m \\cdot n^{O(1)}$ time. An $O(\\log n)$-approximation of this number can be computed efficiently. We can decide in $2^{O(d \\sqrt{k} \\log (d+k))} \\cdot n^{O(1)}$ time whether it suffices to delete $k$ edges of an ordered graph to obtain a $d$-planar layout (where every edge crosses at most $d$ other edges) on one page. As an additional parameter, we consider the size $h$ of a hitting set, that is, a set of points on the spine such that every edge, seen as an open interval, contains at least one of the points. For $h=1$, we can efficiently compute the minimum number of edges whose deletion yields fixed-vertex-order page number $p$. For $h>1$, we give an XP algorithm with respect to $h+p$. Finally, we consider spine+$t$-track drawings, where some but not all vertices lie on the spine. The vertex order on the spine is given; we must map every vertex that does not lie on the spine to one of $t$ tracks, each of which is a straight line on a separate page, parallel to the spine. ",

    "title": "RandAlign: A Parameter-Free Method for Regularizing Graph Convolutional  Networks",
    "abstract": "Studies continually find that message-passing graph convolutional networks suffer from the over-smoothing issue. Basically, the issue of over-smoothing refers to the phenomenon that the learned embeddings for all nodes can become very similar to one another and therefore are uninformative after repeatedly applying message passing iterations. Intuitively, we can expect the generated embeddings become smooth asymptotically layerwisely, that is each layer of graph convolution generates a smoothed version of embeddings as compared to that generated by the previous layer. Based on this intuition, we propose RandAlign, a stochastic regularization method for graph convolutional networks. The idea of RandAlign is to randomly align the learned embedding for each node with that of the previous layer using randomly interpolation in each graph convolution layer. Through alignment, the smoothness of the generated embeddings is explicitly reduced. To better maintain the benefit yielded by the graph convolution, in the alignment step we introduce to first scale the embedding of the previous layer to the same norm as the generated embedding and then perform random interpolation for aligning the generated embedding. RandAlign is a parameter-free method and can be directly applied without introducing additional trainable weights or hyper-parameters. We experimentally evaluate RandAlign on different graph domain tasks on seven benchmark datasets. The experimental results show that RandAlign is a general method that improves the generalization performance of various graph convolutional network models and also improves the numerical stability of optimization, advancing the state of the art performance for graph representation learning.

    "abstract": "This work addresses the scattering problem of an incident wave at a junction connecting two semi-infinite waveguides, which we intend to solve using Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs). As with other deep learning-based approaches, PINNs are known to suffer from a spectral bias and from the hyperbolic nature of the Helmholtz equation. This makes the training process challenging, especially for higher wave numbers. We show an example where these limitations are present. In order to improve the learning capability of our model, we suggest an equivalent formulation of the Helmholtz Boundary Value Problem (BVP) that is based on splitting the total wave into a tapered continuation of the incoming wave and a remaining scattered wave. This allows the introduction of an inhomogeneity in the BVP, leveraging the information transmitted during back-propagation, thus, enhancing and accelerating the training process of our PINN model. The presented numerical illustrations are in accordance with the expected behavior, paving the way to a possible alternative approach to predicting scattering problems using PINNs. ",

    "abstract": "In this paper we are interested in the fine-grained complexity of deciding whether there is a homomorphism from an input graph $G$ to a fixed graph $H$ (the $H$-Coloring problem). The starting point is that these problems can be viewed as constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs), and that (partial) polymorphisms of binary relations are of paramount importance in the study of complexity classes of such CSPs. Thus, we first investigate the expressivity of binary symmetric relations $E_H$ and their corresponding (partial) polymorphisms pPol($E_H$). For irreflexive graphs we observe that there is no pair of graphs $H$ and $H'$ such that pPol($E_H$) $\\subseteq$ pPol($E_{H'}$), unless $E_{H'}= \\emptyset$ or $H =H'$. More generally we show the existence of an $n$-ary relation $R$ whose partial polymorphisms strictly subsume those of $H$ and such that CSP($R$) is NP-complete if and only if $H$ contains an odd cycle of length at most $n$. Motivated by this we also describe the sets of total polymorphisms of nontrivial cliques, odd cycles, as well as certain cores, and we give an algebraic characterization of projective cores. As a by-product, we settle the Okrasa and Rz\\k{a}\\.zewski conjecture for all graphs of at most 7 vertices. ",

    "abstract": "Message passing has become the dominant framework in graph representation learning. The essential idea of the message-passing framework is to update node embeddings based on the information aggregated from local neighbours. However, most existing aggregation methods have not encoded neighbour-level message interactions into the aggregated message, resulting in an information lost in embedding generation. And this information lost could be accumulated and become more serious as more layers are added to the graph network model. To address this issue, we propose a neighbour-level message interaction information encoding method for improving graph representation learning. For messages that are aggregated at a node, we explicitly generate an encoding between each message and the rest messages using an encoding function. Then we aggregate these learned encodings and take the sum of the aggregated encoding and the aggregated message to update the embedding for the node. By this way, neighbour-level message interaction information is integrated into the generated node embeddings. The proposed encoding method is a generic method which can be integrated into message-passing graph convolutional networks. Extensive experiments are conducted on six popular benchmark datasets across four highly-demanded tasks. The results show that integrating neighbour-level message interactions achieves improved performance of the base models, advancing the state of the art results for representation learning over graphs.

However, due to its complexity, the design and control of bi-Lipschitz architectures are falling behind, and a model that is precisely designed for bi-Lipschitzness realizing a direct and simple control of the constants along with solid theoretical analysis is lacking. In this work, we investigate and propose a novel framework for bi-Lipschitzness that can achieve such a clear and tight control based on convex neural networks and the Legendre-Fenchel duality. Its desirable properties are illustrated with concrete experiments. We also apply this framework to uncertainty estimation and monotone problem settings to illustrate its broad range of applications.

However, they are typically unreliable under adverse conditions prevalent in real-world scenarios, such as rainy, snowy, etc. In this paper, we propose a novel robust depth estimation method called D4RD, featuring a custom contrastive learning mode tailored for diffusion models to mitigate performance degradation in complex environments. Concretely, we integrate the strength of knowledge distillation into contrastive learning, building the `trinity' contrastive scheme. This scheme utilizes the sampled noise of the forward diffusion process as a natural reference, guiding the predicted noise in diverse scenes toward a more stable and precise optimum. Moreover, we extend noise-level trinity to encompass more generic feature and image levels, establishing a multi-level contrast to distribute the burden of robust perception across the overall network. Before addressing complex scenarios, we enhance the stability of the baseline diffusion model with three straightforward yet effective improvements, which facilitate convergence and remove depth outliers. Extensive experiments demonstrate that D4RD surpasses existing state-of-the-art solutions on synthetic corruption datasets and real-world weather conditions. The code for D4RD will be made available for further exploration and adoption. ",

Therefore, automated tools are needed to assist human players in interpreting binary code. In recent years, two groups of technologies have shown promising prospects: (1) Deep learning-based technologies have demonstrated competitive results in tasks related to binary code understanding, furthermore, (2) Large Language Models (LLMs) have been extensively pre-trained at the source-code level for tasks such as code understanding and generation. This makes participants wonder about the ability of LLMs in binary code understanding. In this work, we propose a benchmark to evaluate the effectiveness of LLMs in real-world reverse engineering scenarios. The benchmark covers two key binary code understanding tasks, including function name recovery and binary code summarization. We gain valuable insights into their capabilities and limitations through extensive evaluations of popular LLMs using our benchmark. Our evaluations reveal that existing LLMs can understand binary code to a certain extent, thereby improving the efficiency of binary code analysis.

    "abstract": "In a hyper-relational knowledge graph (HKG), each fact is composed of a main triple associated with attribute-value qualifiers, which express additional factual knowledge. The hyper-relational knowledge graph completion (HKGC) task aims at inferring plausible missing links in a HKG. Most existing approaches to HKGC focus on enhancing the communication between qualifier pairs and main triples, while overlooking two important properties that emerge from the monotonicity of the hyper-relational graphs representation regime. Stage Reasoning allows for a two-step reasoning process, facilitating the integration of coarse-grained inference results derived solely from main triples and fine-grained inference results obtained from hyper-relational facts with qualifiers. In the initial stage, coarse-grained results provide an upper bound for correct predictions, which are subsequently refined in the fine-grained step. More generally, Qualifier Monotonicity implies that by attaching more qualifier pairs to a main triple, we may only narrow down the answer set, but never enlarge it. This paper proposes the HyperMono model for hyper-relational knowledge graph completion, which realizes stage reasoning and qualifier monotonicity. To implement qualifier monotonicity HyperMono resorts to cone embeddings. Experiments on three real-world datasets with three different scenario conditions demonstrate the strong performance of HyperMono when compared to the SoTA. ",

In this paper, we investigate three crucial processes relevant to real-world construction scenarios: (a) the verification process, which arises from the necessity and limitations of human verifiers; (b) the mining process, which identifies the most promising candidates for verification; and (c) the training process, which harnesses verified data for subsequent utilization; in order to achieve a transition toward more realistic challenges. By integrating these three processes, we introduce the Progressive Knowledge Graph Completion (PKGC) task, which simulates the gradual completion of KGs in real-world scenarios. Furthermore, to expedite PKGC processing, we propose two acceleration modules: Optimized Top-$k$ algorithm and Semantic Validity Filter. These modules significantly enhance the efficiency of the mining procedure. Our experiments demonstrate that performance in link prediction does not accurately reflect performance in PKGC.

Moreover, we also take into account the impact of considering practical discrete phase shifts at the RIS patches instead of its ideal continuous counterpart. Furthermore, we claim as well as demonstrate that the existing classic least remaining distance (LRD)-based approach is not always the optimal solution.

Also, using vulnerable metrics as a loss for deep learning model training can mislead training to worsen visual quality. Because of that, quality metrics testing for vulnerability is a task of current interest. This paper proposes a new method for testing quality metrics vulnerability in the physical space. To our knowledge, quality metrics were not previously tested for vulnerability to this attack; they were only tested in the pixel space. We applied a physical adversarial Ti-Patch (Tiled Patch) attack to quality metrics and did experiments both in pixel and physical space. We also performed experiments on the implementation of physical adversarial wallpaper. The proposed method can be used as additional quality metrics in vulnerability evaluation, complementing traditional subjective comparison and vulnerability tests in the pixel space.

Existing methods tackle this task by leveraging region features of individuals following existing group activity recognition methods. However, the effectiveness of region features is susceptible to person localization and variable semantics of individual actions. To overcome these issues, we propose leveraging attention modules in transformers to generate social group features. In this method, multiple embeddings are used to aggregate features for a social group, each of which is assigned to a group member without duplication. Due to this non-duplicated assignment, the number of embeddings must be significant to avoid missing group members and thus renders attention in transformers ineffective. To find optimal attention designs with a large number of embeddings, we explore several design choices of queries for feature aggregation and self-attention modules in transformer decoders.

    "title": "Taming Latent Diffusion Model for Neural Radiance Field Inpainting",
    "abstract": "Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) is a representation for 3D reconstruction from multi-view images. Despite some recent work showing preliminary success in editing a reconstructed NeRF with diffusion prior, they remain struggling to synthesize reasonable geometry in completely uncovered regions. One major reason is the high diversity of synthetic contents from the diffusion model, which hinders the radiance field from converging to a crisp and deterministic geometry. Moreover, applying latent diffusion models on real data often yields a textural shift incoherent to the image condition due to auto-encoding errors. These two problems are further reinforced with the use of pixel-distance losses. To address these issues, we propose tempering the diffusion model's stochasticity with per-scene customization and mitigating the textural shift with masked adversarial training. During the analyses, we also found the commonly used pixel and perceptual losses are harmful in the NeRF inpainting task. Through rigorous experiments, our framework yields state-of-the-art NeRF inpainting results on various real-world scenes. Project page: https://hubert0527.github.io/MALD-NeRF ",

    "abstract": "Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a vital modality for gaining precise anatomical information, and it plays a significant role in medical imaging for diagnosis and therapy planning. Image synthesis problems have seen a revolution in recent years due to the introduction of deep learning techniques, specifically Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). This work investigates the use of Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks (DCGAN) for producing high-fidelity and realistic MRI image slices. The suggested approach uses a dataset with a variety of brain MRI scans to train a DCGAN architecture. While the discriminator network discerns between created and real slices, the generator network learns to synthesise realistic MRI image slices. The generator refines its capacity to generate slices that closely mimic real MRI data through an adversarial training approach. The outcomes demonstrate that the DCGAN promise for a range of uses in medical imaging research, since they show that it can effectively produce MRI image slices if we train them for a consequent number of epochs. This work adds to the expanding corpus of research on the application of deep learning techniques for medical image synthesis. The slices that are could be produced possess the capability to enhance datasets, provide data augmentation in the training of deep learning models, as well as a number of functions are made available to make MRI data cleaning easier, and a three ready to use and clean dataset on the major anatomical plans.

    "abstract": "This study examines the effects of de-globalization trends on international trade networks and their role in improving forecasts for economic growth. Using section-level trade data from nearly 200 countries from 2010 to 2022, we identify significant shifts in the network topology driven by rising trade policy uncertainty. Our analysis highlights key global players through centrality rankings, with the United States, China, and Germany maintaining consistent dominance. Using a horse race of supervised regressors, we find that network topology descriptors evaluated from section-specific trade networks substantially enhance the quality of a country's GDP growth forecast. We also find that non-linear models, such as Random Forest, XGBoost, and LightGBM, outperform traditional linear models used in the economics literature. Using SHAP values to interpret these non-linear model's predictions, we find that about half of most important features originate from the network descriptors, underscoring their vital role in refining forecasts. Moreover, this study emphasizes the significance of recent economic performance, population growth, and the primary sector's influence in shaping economic growth predictions, offering novel insights into the intricacies of economic growth forecasting.

In response to the critical need for accurate prognosis in cancer patients, the medical community has embraced the 5-year survival rate as a vital metric for estimating patient outcomes. This study introduces a pioneering approach to enhance survival prediction models for gastric and Colon adenocarcinoma patients. Leveraging advanced image analysis techniques, we sliced whole slide images (WSI) of these cancers, extracting comprehensive features to capture nuanced tumor characteristics. Subsequently, we constructed patient-level graphs, encapsulating intricate spatial relationships within tumor tissues. These graphs served as inputs for a sophisticated 4-layer graph convolutional neural network (GCN), designed to exploit the inherent connectivity of the data for comprehensive analysis and prediction. By integrating patients' total survival time and survival status, we computed C-index values for gastric cancer and Colon adenocarcinoma, yielding 0.57 and 0.64, respectively. Significantly surpassing previous convolutional neural network models, these results underscore the efficacy of our approach in accurately predicting patient survival outcomes. This research holds profound implications for both the medical and AI communities, offering insights into cancer biology and progression while advancing personalized treatment strategies. Ultimately, our study represents a significant stride in leveraging AI-driven methodologies to revolutionize cancer prognosis and improve patient outcomes on a global scale. ",

In the presence of multiple explanatory variables, how much of the change can be explained by each possible cause? We develop a new estimation strategy that, given a causal model, combines regression and re-weighting methods to quantify the contribution of each causal mechanism. Our proposed methodology is multiply robust, meaning that it still recovers the target parameter under partial misspecification. We prove that our estimator is consistent and asymptotically normal. Moreover, it can be incorporated into existing frameworks for causal attribution, such as Shapley values, which will inherit the consistency and large-sample distribution properties. Our method demonstrates excellent performance in Monte Carlo simulations, and we show its usefulness in an empirical application. ",

In the proposed approach, we selected the most significant EEG channels for the accurate identification of ADHD using an EnD-based channel selection approach. Secondly, a set of features is extracted from the selected channels and fed to a classifier. To verify the effectiveness of the channels selected, we explored three sets of features and classifiers. More specifically, we explored discrete wavelet transform (DWT), empirical mode decomposition (EMD) and symmetrically-weighted local binary pattern (SLBP)-based features. To perform automated classification, we have used k-nearest neighbor (k-NN), Ensemble classifier, and support vectors machine (SVM) classifiers. Our proposed approach yielded the highest accuracy of 99.29% using the public database. In addition, the proposed EnD-based channel selection has consistently provided better classification accuracies than the entropy-based channel selection approach. Also, the developed method ",

    "abstract": "We address the computational barrier of deploying advanced deep learning segmentation models in clinical settings by studying the efficacy of network compression through tensor decomposition. We propose a post-training Tucker factorization that enables the decomposition of pre-existing models to reduce computational requirements without impeding segmentation accuracy. We applied Tucker decomposition to the convolutional kernels of the TotalSegmentator (TS) model, an nnU-Net model trained on a comprehensive dataset for automatic segmentation of 117 anatomical structures. Our approach reduced the floating-point operations (FLOPs) and memory required during inference, offering an adjustable trade-off between computational efficiency and segmentation quality. This study utilized the publicly available TS dataset, employing various downsampling factors to explore the relationship between model size, inference speed, and segmentation performance. The application of Tucker decomposition to the TS model substantially reduced the model parameters and FLOPs across various compression rates, with limited loss in segmentation accuracy. We removed up to 88% of the model's parameters with no significant performance changes in the majority of classes after fine-tuning. Practical benefits varied across different graphics processing unit (GPU) architectures, with more distinct speed-ups on less powerful hardware. Post-hoc network compression via Tucker decomposition presents a viable strategy for reducing the computational demand of medical image segmentation models without substantially sacrificing accuracy. This approach enables the broader adoption of advanced deep learning technologies in clinical practice, offering a way to navigate the constraints of hardware capabilities. ",

Tree Containment asks whether the given phylogenetic tree (for instance, constructed from a DNA fragment showing tree-like evolution) is contained in the given phylogenetic network. In the general case, this is an NP-complete problem. We propose to solve it approximately using Graph Neural Networks. In particular, we propose to combine the given network and the tree and apply a Graph Neural Network to this network-tree graph. This way, we achieve the capability of solving the tree containment instances representing a larger number of species than the instances contained in the training dataset (i.e., our algorithm has the inductive learning ability). Our algorithm demonstrates an accuracy of over $95\\%$ in solving the tree containment problem on instances with up to 100 leaves. ",
