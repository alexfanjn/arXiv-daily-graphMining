    "abstract": "Jailbreak attacks cause large language models (LLMs) to generate harmful, unethical, or otherwise objectionable content. Evaluating these attacks presents a number of challenges, which the current collection of benchmarks and evaluation techniques do not adequately address. First, there is no clear standard of practice regarding jailbreaking evaluation. Second, existing works compute costs and success rates in incomparable ways. And third, numerous works are not reproducible, as they withhold adversarial prompts, involve closed-source code, or rely on evolving proprietary APIs. To address these challenges, we introduce JailbreakBench, an open-sourced benchmark with the following components: (1) a new jailbreaking dataset containing 100 unique behaviors, which we call JBB-Behaviors; (2) an evolving repository of state-of-the-art adversarial prompts, which we refer to as jailbreak artifacts; (3) a standardized evaluation framework that includes a clearly defined threat model, system prompts, chat templates, and scoring functions; and (4) a leaderboard that tracks the performance of attacks and defenses for various LLMs. We have carefully considered the potential ethical implications of releasing this benchmark, and believe that it will be a net positive for the community. Over time, we will expand and adapt the benchmark to reflect technical and methodological advances in the research community. ",

    "abstract": "With the advent of the era of big data, massive information, expert experience, and high-accuracy models bring great opportunities to the information cascade prediction of public emergencies. However, the involvement of specialist knowledge from various disciplines has resulted in a primarily application-specific focus (e.g., earthquakes, floods, infectious diseases) for information cascade prediction of public emergencies. The lack of a unified prediction framework poses a challenge for classifying intersectional prediction methods across different application fields. This survey paper offers a systematic classification and summary of information cascade modeling, prediction, and application. We aim to help researchers identify cutting-edge research and comprehend models and methods of information cascade prediction under public emergencies. By summarizing open issues and outlining future directions in this field, this paper has the potential to be a valuable resource for researchers conducting further studies on predicting information cascades.

    "abstract": "Bike-sharing systems (BSSs) are deployed in over a thousand cities worldwide and play an important role in many urban transportation systems. BSSs alleviate congestion, reduce pollution and promote physical exercise. It is essential to explore the spatiotemporal patterns of bike-sharing demand, as well as the factors that influence these patterns, in order to optimise system operational efficiency. In this study, an optimised geo-temporal graph is constructed using trip data from Moby Bikes, a dockless BSS operator. The process of optimising the graph unveiled prime locations for erecting new stations during future expansions of the BSS. The Louvain algorithm, a community detection technique, is employed to uncover usage patterns at different levels of temporal granularity. The community detection results reveal largely self-contained sub-networks that exhibit similar usage patterns at their respective levels of temporal granularity. Overall, this study reinforces that BSSs are intrinsically spatiotemporal systems, with community presence driven by spatiotemporal dynamics. These findings may aid operators in improving redistribution efficiency. ",

    "title": "Unraveling the Dynamics of Television Debates and Social Media  Engagement: Insights from an Indian News Show",
    "abstract": "The relationship between television shows and social media has become increasingly intertwined in recent years. Social media platforms, particularly Twitter, have emerged as significant sources of public opinion and discourse on topics discussed in television shows. In India, news debates leverage the popularity of social media to promote hashtags and engage users in discussions and debates on a daily basis. This paper focuses on the analysis of one of India's most prominent and widely-watched TV news debate shows: \"Arnab Goswami-The Debate\". The study examines the content of the show by analyzing the hashtags used to promote it and the social media data corresponding to these hashtags. The findings reveal that the show exhibits a strong bias towards the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), with over 60% of the debates featuring either pro-BJP or anti-opposition content. Social media support for the show primarily comes from BJP supporters. Notably, BJP leaders and influencers play a significant role in promoting the show on social media, leveraging their existing networks and resources to artificially trend specific hashtags. Furthermore, the study uncovers a reciprocal flow of information between the TV show and social media. We find evidence that the show's choice of topics is linked to social media posts made by party workers, suggesting a dynamic interplay between traditional media and online platforms. By exploring the complex interaction between television debates and social media support, this study contributes to a deeper understanding of the evolving relationship between these two domains in the digital age. The findings hold implications for media researchers and practitioners, offering insights into the ways in which social media can influence traditional media and vice versa. ",

    "abstract": "Finance-related news such as Bloomberg News, CNN Business and Forbes are valuable sources of real data for market screening systems. In news, an expert shares opinions beyond plain technical analyses that include context such as political, sociological and cultural factors. In the same text, the expert often discusses the performance of different assets. Some key statements are mere descriptions of past events while others are predictions. Therefore, understanding the temporality of the key statements in a text is essential to separate context information from valuable predictions. We propose a novel system to detect the temporality of finance-related news at discourse level that combines Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning techniques, and exploits sophisticated features such as syntactic and semantic dependencies. More specifically, we seek to extract the dominant tenses of the main statements, which may be either explicit or implicit. We have tested our system on a labelled dataset of finance-related news annotated by researchers with knowledge in the field. Experimental results reveal a high detection precision compared to an alternative rule-based baseline approach. Ultimately, this research contributes to the state-of-the-art of market screening by identifying predictive knowledge for financial decision making. ",

    "abstract": "Financial news items are unstructured sources of information that can be mined to extract knowledge for market screening applications. Manual extraction of relevant information from the continuous stream of finance-related news is cumbersome and beyond the skills of many investors, who, at most, can follow a few sources and authors. Accordingly, we focus on the analysis of financial news to identify relevant text and, within that text, forecasts and predictions. We propose a novel Natural Language Processing (NLP) system to assist investors in the detection of relevant financial events in unstructured textual sources by considering both relevance and temporality at the discursive level. Firstly, we segment the text to group together closely related text. Secondly, we apply co-reference resolution to discover internal dependencies within segments. Finally, we perform relevant topic modelling with Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to separate relevant from less relevant text and then analyse the relevant text using a Machine Learning-oriented temporal approach to identify predictions and speculative statements. We created an experimental data set composed of 2,158 financial news items that were manually labelled by NLP researchers to evaluate our solution. The ROUGE-L values for the identification of relevant text and predictions/forecasts were 0.662 and 0.982, respectively. To our knowledge, this is the first work to jointly consider relevance and temporality at the discursive level. It contributes to the transfer of human associative discourse capabilities to expert systems through the combination of multi-paragraph topic segmentation and co-reference resolution to separate author expression patterns, topic modelling with LDA to detect relevant text, and discursive temporality analysis to identify forecasts and predictions within this text.

The study aims to address the challenges of Bangla which is considered a less important language. To this end, a complete dataset containing about 50,000 news items is proposed. Several deep learning models have been tested on this dataset, including the bidirectional gated recurrent unit (GRU), the long short-term memory (LSTM), the 1D convolutional neural network (CNN), and hybrid architectures. For this research, we assessed the efficacy of the model utilizing a range of useful measures, including recall, precision, F1 score, and accuracy. This was done by employing a big application. We carry out comprehensive trials to show the effectiveness of these models in identifying bogus news in Bangla, with the Bidirectional GRU model having a stunning accuracy of 99.16%. Our analysis highlights the importance of dataset balance and the need for continual improvement efforts to a substantial degree. This study makes a major contribution to the creation of Bangla fake news detecting systems with limited resources, thereby setting the stage for future improvements in the detection process. ",

    "abstract": "In this uncertain world, data uncertainty is inherent in many applications and its importance is growing drastically due to the rapid development of modern technologies. Nowadays, researchers have paid more attention to mine patterns in uncertain databases. A few recent works attempt to mine frequent uncertain sequential patterns. Despite their success, they are incompetent to reduce the number of false-positive pattern generation in their mining process and maintain the patterns efficiently. In this paper, we propose multiple theoretically tightened pruning upper bounds that remarkably reduce the mining space. A novel hierarchical structure is introduced to maintain the patterns in a space-efficient way. Afterward, we develop a versatile framework for mining uncertain sequential patterns that can effectively handle weight constraints as well. Besides, with the advent of incremental uncertain databases, existing works are not scalable. There exist several incremental sequential pattern mining algorithms, but they are limited to mine in precise databases. Therefore, we propose a new technique to adapt our framework to mine patterns when the database is incremental. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on several real-life datasets and show the efficacy of our framework in different applications. ",

To jointly characterize the susceptibility of prediction accuracy and individual fairness to adversarial perturbations, we introduce a novel robustness definition termed robust accurate fairness. Informally, robust accurate fairness requires that predictions for an instance and its similar counterparts consistently align with the ground truth when subjected to input perturbations. We propose an adversarial attack approach dubbed RAFair to expose false or biased adversarial defects in DNN, which either deceive accuracy or compromise individual fairness. Then, we show that such adversarial instances can be effectively addressed by carefully designed benign perturbations, correcting their predictions to be accurate and fair. Our work explores the double-edged sword of input perturbations to robust accurate fairness in DNN and the potential of using benign perturbations to correct adversarial instances. ",

However, the computational cost of NeRF rendering and degradation in quality due to the presence of artifacts pose significant challenges for its application in real-time and robust robotic tasks, especially on embedded systems. This paper introduces a novel framework that integrates NeRF-derived localization information with Visual-Inertial Odometry(VIO) to provide a robust solution for robotic navigation in a real-time. By training an absolute pose regression network with augmented image data rendered from a NeRF and quantifying its uncertainty, our approach effectively counters positional drift and enhances system reliability. We also establish a mathematically sound foundation for combining visual inertial navigation with camera localization neural networks, considering uncertainty under a Bayesian framework. Experimental validation in the photorealistic simulation environment demonstrates significant improvements in accuracy compared to a conventional VIO approach. ",

    "abstract": "In the realm of food computing, segmenting ingredients from images poses substantial challenges due to the large intra-class variance among the same ingredients, the emergence of new ingredients, and the high annotation costs associated with large food segmentation datasets. Existing approaches primarily utilize a closed-vocabulary and static text embeddings setting. These methods often fall short in effectively handling the ingredients, particularly new and diverse ones. In response to these limitations, we introduce OVFoodSeg, a framework that adopts an open-vocabulary setting and enhances text embeddings with visual context. By integrating vision-language models (VLMs), our approach enriches text embedding with image-specific information through two innovative modules, eg, an image-to-text learner FoodLearner and an Image-Informed Text Encoder. The training process of OVFoodSeg is divided into two stages: the pre-training of FoodLearner and the subsequent learning phase for segmentation. The pre-training phase equips FoodLearner with the capability to align visual information with corresponding textual representations that are specifically related to food, while the second phase adapts both the FoodLearner and the Image-Informed Text Encoder for the segmentation task. By addressing the deficiencies of previous models, OVFoodSeg demonstrates a significant improvement, achieving an 4.9\\% increase in mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) on the FoodSeg103 dataset, setting a new milestone for food image segmentation.

We surveyed and interviewed 20 professionals from industry, government laboratories, and academia who regularly work with KGs and LLMs, either collaboratively or concurrently. Our findings show that participants overwhelmingly want an LLM to facilitate data retrieval from KGs through joint query construction, to identify interesting relationships in the KG through multi-turn conversation, and to create on-demand visualizations from the KG that enhance their trust in the LLM's outputs. To interact with an LLM, participants strongly prefer a chat-based 'widget,' built on top of their regular analysis workflows, with the ability to guide the LLM using their interactions with a visualization. When viewing an LLM's outputs, participants similarly prefer a combination of annotated visuals (e.g., subgraphs or tables extracted from the KG) alongside summarizing text. However, participants also expressed concerns about an LLM's ability to maintain semantic intent when translating natural language questions into KG queries, the risk of an LLM 'hallucinating' false data from the KG, and the difficulties of engineering a 'perfect prompt.' From the analysis of our interviews, we contribute a preliminary roadmap for the design of LLM-driven knowledge graph exploration systems and outline future opportunities in this emergent design space.

However, the majority of current time series causal discovery methods assume stationarity and linear relations in data, making them infeasible for the task. Further, the recent deep learning-based methods rely on the traditional causal structure learning approaches making them computationally expensive. In this paper, we propose a Time-Series Causal Neural Network (TS-CausalNN) - a deep learning technique to discover contemporaneous and lagged causal relations simultaneously. Our proposed architecture comprises (i) convolutional blocks comprising parallel custom causal layers, (ii) acyclicity constraint, and (iii) optimization techniques using the augmented Lagrangian approach. In addition to the simple parallel design, an advantage of the proposed model is that it naturally handles the non-stationarity and non-linearity of the data. Through experiments on multiple synthetic and real world datasets, we demonstrate the empirical proficiency of our proposed approach as compared to several state-of-the-art methods. The inferred graphs for the real world dataset are in good agreement with the domain understanding. ",

One particularly important class of applications are data structure implementations that rely on such libraries to provide a level of efficiency and scalability that may be otherwise difficult to achieve. However, because the specifications of the methods provided by these libraries are necessarily general and rarely specialized to the needs of any specific client, any required application-level invariants must often be expressed in terms of additional constraints on the (often) opaque state maintained by the library. In this paper, we consider the specification and verification of such representation invariants using symbolic finite automata (SFA). We show that SFAs can be used to succinctly and precisely capture fine-grained temporal and data-dependent histories of interactions between functional clients and stateful libraries. To facilitate modular and compositional reasoning, we integrate SFAs into a refinement type system to qualify stateful computations resulting from such interactions. The particular instantiation we consider, Hoare Automata Types (HATs), allows us to both specify and automatically type-check the representation invariants of a datatype, even when its implementation depends on stateful library methods that operate over hidden state. We also develop a new bidirectional type checking algorithm that implements an efficient subtyping inclusion check over HATs, enabling their translation into a form amenable for SMT-based automated verification. We present extensive experimental results on an implementation of this algorithm that demonstrates the feasibility of type-checking complex and sophisticated HAT-specified OCaml data structure implementations.

    "abstract": "A self-driving vehicle must understand its environment to determine the appropriate action. Traditional autonomy systems rely on object detection to find the agents in the scene. However, object detection assumes a discrete set of objects and loses information about uncertainty, so any errors compound when predicting the future behavior of those agents. Alternatively, dense occupancy grid maps have been utilized to understand free-space. However, predicting a grid for the entire scene is wasteful since only certain spatio-temporal regions are reachable and relevant to the self-driving vehicle. We present a unified, interpretable, and efficient autonomy framework that moves away from cascading modules that first perceive, then predict, and finally plan. Instead, we shift the paradigm to have the planner query occupancy at relevant spatio-temporal points, restricting the computation to those regions of interest. Exploiting this representation, we evaluate candidate trajectories around key factors such as collision avoidance, comfort, and progress for safety and interpretability. Our approach achieves better highway driving quality than the state-of-the-art in high-fidelity closed-loop simulations. ",

    "abstract": "A common practice in deep learning consists of training large neural networks on massive datasets to perform accurately for different domains and tasks. While this methodology may work well in numerous application areas, it only applies across modalities due to a larger distribution shift in data captured using different sensors. This paper focuses on the problem of adapting a large object detection model to one or multiple modalities while being efficient. To do so, we propose ModTr as an alternative to the common approach of fine-tuning large models. ModTr consists of adapting the input with a small transformation network trained to minimize the detection loss directly. The original model can therefore work on the translated inputs without any further change or fine-tuning to its parameters. Experimental results on translating from IR to RGB images on two well-known datasets show that this simple ModTr approach provides detectors that can perform comparably or better than the standard fine-tuning without forgetting the original knowledge. This opens the doors to a more flexible and efficient service-based detection pipeline in which, instead of using a different detector for each modality, a unique and unaltered server is constantly running, where multiple modalities with the corresponding translations can query it.

It is imperative to ensure that network services meet the performance and reliability requirements of various applications and users, thus, service assurance is one of the critical components in network slicing. One of the key functionalities of network slicing is the ability to scale Virtualized Network Functions (VNFs) in response to changing resource demand and to meet Customer Service Level agreements (SLAs). In this paper, we introduce a proactive closed-loop algorithm for end-to-end network orchestration, designed to provide service assurance in 5G and B5G networks. We focus on dynamically scaling resources to meet key performance indicators (KPIs) specific to each network slice and operate in parallel across multiple slices, making it scalable and capable of managing completely automatically real-time service assurance. Through our experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed algorithm effectively fulfills service assurance requirements for different network slice types, thereby minimizing network resource utilization and reducing the over-provisioning of spare resources.

Additionally, this evolution brings new features, like the ability to create multiple end-to-end isolated virtual networks using network slicing. Nevertheless, to ensure the quality of service, operators must maintain and optimize their networks in accordance with the key performance indicators (KPIs) and the slice service-level agreements (SLAs). In this paper, we introduce a machine learning (ML) model used to estimate throughput in 5G and B5G networks with end-to-end (E2E) network slices. Then, we combine the predicted throughput with the current network state to derive an estimate of other network KPIs, which can be used to further improve service assurance. To assess the efficiency of our solution, a performance metric was proposed. Numerical evaluations demonstrate that our KPI prediction model outperforms those derived from other methods with the same or nearly the same computational time. ",

Recent studies, which employ pre-trained language models to auto-regressively generate linearised graphs for constructing event temporal graphs, have shown promising results. However, these methods have often led to suboptimal graph generation as the linearised graphs exhibit set characteristics which are instead treated sequentially by language models. This discrepancy stems from the conventional text generation objectives, leading to erroneous penalisation of correct predictions caused by the misalignment of elements in target sequences. To address these challenges, we reframe the task as a conditional set generation problem, proposing a Set-aligning Framework tailored for the effective utilisation of Large Language Models (LLMs). The framework incorporates data augmentations and set-property regularisations designed to alleviate text generation loss penalties associated with the linearised graph edge sequences, thus encouraging the generation of more relation edges. Experimental results show that our framework surpasses existing baselines for event temporal graph generation. Furthermore, under zero-shot settings, the structural knowledge introduced through our framework notably improves model generalisation, particularly when the training examples available are limited.

An LLM-based code generator takes a prompt as input and produces code that implements the requirements specified in the prompt. Many software requirements include mathematical formulas that specify the expected behavior of the code to be generated. Given a code generation prompt that includes a mathematical formula, a reasonable expectation is that, if the formula is syntactically modified without changing its semantics, the generated code for the modified prompt should be semantically equivalent. We formalize this concept as syntactic robustness and investigate the syntactic robustness of GPT-3.5-Turbo and GPT-4 as code generators. To test syntactic robustness, we generate syntactically different but semantically equivalent versions of prompts using a set of mutators that only modify mathematical formulas in prompts. In this paper, we focus on prompts that ask for code that generates solutions to variables in an equation, when given coefficients of the equation as input. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates that GPT-3.5-Turbo and GPT-4 are not syntactically robust for this type of prompts. To improve syntactic robustness, we define a set of reductions that transform the formulas to a simplified form and use these reductions as a pre-processing step. Our experimental results indicate that the syntactic robustness of LLM-based code generation can be improved using our approach. ",

In contrast to existing Transformer-based methods that depend mostly on single-scale rain appearance, we develop an end-to-end multi-scale Transformer that leverages the potentially useful features in various scales to facilitate high-quality image reconstruction. To better explore the common degradation representations from spatially-varying rain streaks, we incorporate intra-scale implicit neural representations based on pixel coordinates with the degraded inputs in a closed-loop design, enabling the learned features to facilitate rain removal and improve the robustness of the model in complex scenarios. To ensure richer collaborative representation from different scales, we embed a simple yet effective inter-scale bidirectional feedback operation into our multi-scale Transformer by performing coarse-to-fine and fine-to-coarse information communication.

However, the substantial size of these models, especially large models, poses a significant challenge when it comes to fine-tuning them for specific downstream tasks. As an alternative approach, retrieval-based methods have emerged as a promising solution, augmenting model predictions without the need for fine-tuning. Despite their potential, a significant challenge is that the designs of these methods often rely on heuristics, leaving critical questions about what information should be stored or retrieved and how to interpolate such information for augmenting predictions. To tackle this challenge, we first perform a theoretical analysis of the fine-tuning process, highlighting the importance of delta logits as a catalyst for improving model predictions. Building on this insight, we develop a novel retrieval-based method, FT2Ra, which aims to mimic genuine fine-tuning. While FT2Ra adopts a retrieval-based mechanism, it uniquely adopts a paradigm with a learning rate and multi-epoch retrievals, which is similar to fine-tuning.In token-level completion, which represents a relatively easier task, FT2Ra achieves a 4.29% improvement in accuracy compared to the best baseline method on UniXcoder. In the more challenging line-level completion task, we observe a substantial more than twice increase in Exact Match (EM) performance, indicating the significant advantages of our theoretical analysis. Notably, even when operating without actual fine-tuning, FT2Ra exhibits competitive performance compared to the models with real fine-tuning. ",

Conventional attack methods employ perturbations at a single granularity, e.g., word-level or sentence-level, to a target document. However, limiting perturbations to a single level of granularity may reduce the flexibility of creating adversarial examples, thereby diminishing the potential threat of the attack. Therefore, we focus on generating high-quality adversarial examples by incorporating multi-granular perturbations. Achieving this objective involves tackling a combinatorial explosion problem, which requires identifying an optimal combination of perturbations across all possible levels of granularity, positions, and textual pieces. To address this challenge, we transform the multi-granular adversarial attack into a sequential decision-making process, where perturbations in the next attack step are influenced by the perturbed document in the current attack step. Since the attack process can only access the final state without direct intermediate signals, we use reinforcement learning to perform multi-granular attacks. During the reinforcement learning process, two agents work cooperatively to identify multi-granular vulnerabilities as attack targets and organize perturbation candidates into a final perturbation sequence. Experimental results show that our attack method surpasses prevailing baselines in both attack effectiveness and imperceptibility. ",

    "abstract": "In autonomous driving and robotics, there is a growing interest in utilizing short-term historical data to enhance multi-camera 3D object detection, leveraging the continuous and correlated nature of input video streams. Recent work has focused on spatially aligning BEV-based features over timesteps. However, this is often limited as its gain does not scale well with long-term past observations. To address this, we advocate for supervising a model to predict objects' poses given past observations, thus explicitly guiding to learn objects' temporal cues. To this end, we propose a model called DAP (Detection After Prediction), consisting of a two-branch network: (i) a branch responsible for forecasting the current objects' poses given past observations and (ii) another branch that detects objects based on the current and past observations. The features predicting the current objects from branch (i) is fused into branch (ii) to transfer predictive knowledge. We conduct extensive experiments with the large-scale nuScenes datasets, and we observe that utilizing such predictive information significantly improves the overall detection performance. Our model can be used plug-and-play, showing consistent performance gain. ",

    "abstract": "Frequent Subgraph Mining (FSM) is the process of identifying common subgraph patterns that surpass a predefined frequency threshold. While FSM is widely applicable in fields like bioinformatics, chemical analysis, and social network anomaly detection, its execution remains time-consuming and complex. This complexity stems from the need to recognize high-frequency subgraphs and ascertain if they exceed the set threshold. Current approaches to identifying these patterns often rely on edge or vertex extension methods. However, these strategies can introduce redundancies and cause increased latency. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a novel approach for identifying potential k-vertex patterns by combining two frequently observed (k - 1)-vertex patterns. This method optimizes the breadth-]first search, which allows for quicker search termination based on vertices count and support value. Another challenge in FSM is the validation of the presumed pattern against a specific threshold. Existing metrics, such as Maximum Independent Set (MIS) and Minimum Node Image (MNI), either demand significant computational time or risk overestimating pattern counts. Our innovative approach aligns with the MIS and identifies independent subgraphs. Through the \"Maximal Independent Set\" metric, this paper offers an efficient solution that minimizes latency and provides users with control over pattern overlap. Through extensive experimentation, our proposed method achieves an average of 10.58x speedup when compared to GraMi and an average 3x speedup when compared to T-FSM ",

Traditional physics-based approaches encounter difficulties in accurately modeling dynamic systems and external disturbance.

By merging the advantages of both methods, neuro-symbolic approaches present a promising direction. These methods embed physical laws into neural models, potentially significantly improving generalization capabilities. However, no prior works were evaluated in real-world settings for off-road driving. To bridge this gap, we present PhysORD, a neural-symbolic approach integrating the conservation law, i.e., the Euler-Lagrange equation, into data-driven neural models for motion prediction in off-road driving. Our experiments showed that PhysORD can accurately predict vehicle motion and tolerate external disturbance by modeling uncertainties.

    "abstract": "Remote sensing target detection aims to identify and locate critical targets within remote sensing images, finding extensive applications in agriculture and urban planning. Feature pyramid networks (FPNs) are commonly used to extract multi-scale features. However, existing FPNs often overlook extracting low-level positional information and fine-grained context interaction. To address this, we propose a novel location refined feature pyramid network (LR-FPN) to enhance the extraction of shallow positional information and facilitate fine-grained context interaction. The LR-FPN consists of two primary modules: the shallow position information extraction module (SPIEM) and the contextual interaction module (CIM). Specifically, SPIEM first maximizes the retention of solid location information of the target by simultaneously extracting positional and saliency information from the low-level feature map. Subsequently, CIM injects this robust location information into different layers of the original FPN through spatial and channel interaction, explicitly enhancing the object area. Moreover, in spatial interaction, we introduce a simple local and non-local interaction strategy to learn and retain the saliency information of the object. Lastly, the LR-FPN can be readily integrated into common object detection frameworks to improve performance significantly. Extensive experiments on two large-scale remote sensing datasets (i.e., DOTAV1.0 and HRSC2016) demonstrate that the proposed LR-FPN is superior to state-of-the-art object detection approaches.

The goal is to run graph analytics queries over a set of devices that are organized as a graph while keeping the raw data on the devices rather than centralizing it. Further, no entity may learn any new information except for the final query result. For instance, a device may not learn a neighbor's data. The state-of-the-art prior work for this problem provides privacy guarantees for a broad set of queries in a strong threat model where the devices can be malicious. However, it imposes an impractical overhead: each device locally requires over 8.79 hours of cpu time and 5.73 GiBs of network transfers per query. This paper presents Colo, a new, low-cost system for privacy-preserving federated graph analytics that requires minutes of cpu time and a few MiBs in network transfers, for a particular subset of queries. At the heart of Colo is a new secure computation protocol that enables a device to securely and efficiently evaluate a graph query in its local neighborhood while hiding device data, edge data, and topology data. An implementation and evaluation of Colo shows that for running a variety of COVID-19 queries over a population of 1M devices, it requires less than 8.4 minutes of a device's CPU time and 4.93 MiBs in network transfers - improvements of up to three orders of magnitude.

(2) CT-scan contains large number of out-of-distribution (OOD) slices. The crucial features may only be present in specific spatial regions and slices of the entire CT scan. How can we effectively figure out where these are located? To deal with this, we introduce an enhanced Spatial-Slice Feature Learning (SSFL++) framework specifically designed for CT scan. It aim to filter out a OOD data within whole CT scan, enabling our to select crucial spatial-slice for analysis by reducing 70% redundancy totally. Meanwhile, we proposed Kernel-Density-based slice Sampling (KDS) method to improve the stability when training and inference stage, therefore speeding up the rate of convergence and boosting performance. As a result, the experiments demonstrate the promising performance of our model using a simple EfficientNet-2D (E2D) model, even with only 1% of the training data.

We propose a novel contrastive learning-based approach, named ContrastCAD, that effectively captures semantic information within the construction sequences of the CAD model. ContrastCAD generates augmented views using dropout techniques without altering the shape of the CAD model.

Experimental results show that the proposed RRE augmentation method significantly enhances the learning performance of Transformer-based autoencoders, even for complex CAD models having very long construction sequences. The proposed ContrastCAD model is shown to be robust to permutation changes of construction sequences and performs better representation learning by generating representation spaces where similar CAD models are more closely clustered.

However, collecting high-quality annotations from doctors is costly and time-consuming, creating a bottleneck in AI progress. This study investigates eye-tracking as a cost-effective technology to collect doctors' behavioral data for AI training with a focus on the pathology task of mitosis detection. One major challenge in using eye-gaze data is the low signal-to-noise ratio, which hinders the extraction of meaningful information. We tackled this by levering the properties of inter-observer eye-gaze consistencies and creating eye-gaze labels from consistent eye-fixations shared by a group of observers. Our study involved 14 non-medical participants, from whom we collected eye-gaze data and generated eye-gaze labels based on varying group sizes. We assessed the efficacy of such eye-gaze labels by training Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and comparing their performance to those trained with ground truth annotations and a heuristic-based baseline. Results indicated that CNNs trained with our eye-gaze labels closely followed the performance of ground-truth-based CNNs, and significantly outperformed the baseline. Although primarily focused on mitosis, we envision that insights from this study can be generalized to other medical imaging tasks. ",

These devices are Artificial Intelligence (AI) enabled and are capable of perspective analytics. By 2023, it's anticipated that over 14 billion smart devices will be available on the Internet. These applications operate in a wireless environment where memory, power, and other resource limitations apply to the nodes. In addition, the conventional routing method is ineffective in networks with limited resource devices, lossy links, and slow data rates. Routing Protocol for Low Power and Lossy Networks (RPL), a new routing protocol for such networks, was proposed by the IETF's ROLL group. RPL operates in two modes: Storing and Non-Storing. In Storing mode, each node have the information to reach to other node. In Non-Storing mode, the routing information lies with the root node only. The attacker may exploit the Non-Storing feature of the RPL. When the root node transmits User Datagram Protocol~(UDP) or control message packet to the child nodes, the routing information is stored in the extended header of the IPv6 packet. The attacker may modify the address from the source routing header which leads to Denial of Service (DoS) attack. This attack is RPL specific which is known as Hatchetman attack. This paper shows significant degradation in terms of network performance when an attacker exploits this feature. We also propose a lightweight mitigation of Hatchetman attack using game theoretic approach to detect the Hatchetman attack in IoT. ",

While deep learning has been applied successfully for structure-based protein function prediction tasks, current methods usually employ distinct training for each task. However, each of the tasks is of small size, and such a single-task strategy hinders the models' performance and generalization ability. As some labeled 3D protein datasets are biologically related, combining multi-source datasets for larger-scale multi-task learning is one way to overcome this problem. In this paper, we propose a neural network model to address multiple tasks jointly upon the input of 3D protein structures. In particular, we first construct a standard structure-based multi-task benchmark called Protein-MT, consisting of 6 biologically relevant tasks, including affinity prediction and property prediction, integrated from 4 public datasets. Then, we develop a novel graph neural network for multi-task learning, dubbed Heterogeneous Multichannel Equivariant Network (HeMeNet), which is E(3) equivariant and able to capture heterogeneous relationships between different atoms. Besides, HeMeNet can achieve task-specific learning via the task-aware readout mechanism. Extensive evaluations on our benchmark verify the effectiveness of multi-task learning, and our model generally surpasses state-of-the-art models. ",

    "abstract": "Temporal Knowledge Graph (TKG), which characterizes temporally evolving facts in the form of (subject, relation, object, timestamp), has attracted much attention recently. TKG reasoning aims to predict future facts based on given historical ones. However, existing TKG reasoning models are unable to abstain from predictions they are uncertain, which will inevitably bring risks in real-world applications. Thus, in this paper, we propose an abstention mechanism for TKG reasoning, which helps the existing models make selective, instead of indiscriminate, predictions. Specifically, we develop a confidence estimator, called Confidence Estimator with History (CEHis), to enable the existing TKG reasoning models to first estimate their confidence in making predictions, and then abstain from those with low confidence. To do so, CEHis takes two kinds of information into consideration, namely, the certainty of the current prediction and the accuracy of historical predictions. Experiments with representative TKG reasoning models on two benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed CEHis. ",

However, their practical applicability is often hampered by poor efficiency, stemming from the requirement of thousands or hundreds of sampling steps. Inspired by the efficient text-to-image approach adversarial diffusion distillation (ADD), we design AddSR to address this issue by incorporating the ideas of both distillation and ControlNet. Specifically, we first propose a prediction-based self-refinement strategy to provide high-frequency information in the student model output with marginal additional time cost. Furthermore, we refine the training process by employing HR images, rather than LR images, to regulate the teacher model, providing a more robust constraint for distillation. Second, we introduce a timestep-adapting loss to address the perception-distortion imbalance problem introduced by ADD. Extensive experiments demonstrate our AddSR generates better restoration results, while achieving faster speed than previous SD-based state-of-the-art models (e.g., 7x faster than SeeSR). ",

The core challenge of this task lies in understanding the complex semantic information regarding multiple types of time constraints (e.g., before, first) in questions. Existing end-to-end methods implicitly model the time constraints by learning time-aware embeddings of questions and candidate answers, which is far from understanding the question comprehensively. Motivated by semantic-parsing-based approaches that explicitly model constraints in questions by generating logical forms with symbolic operators, we design fundamental temporal operators for time constraints and introduce a novel self-improvement Programming method for TKGQA (Prog-TQA). Specifically, Prog-TQA leverages the in-context learning ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to understand the combinatory time constraints in the questions and generate corresponding program drafts with a few examples given. Then, it aligns these drafts to TKGs with the linking module and subsequently executes them to generate the answers. To enhance the ability to understand questions, Prog-TQA is further equipped with a self-improvement strategy to effectively bootstrap LLMs using high-quality self-generated drafts. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed Prog-TQA on MultiTQ and CronQuestions datasets, especially in the Hits@1 metric. ",

In this paper, we identify media bias at the sentence level, and pinpoint bias sentences that intend to sway readers' opinions. As bias sentences are often expressed in a neutral and factual way, considering broader context outside a sentence can help reveal the bias. In particular, we observe that events in a bias sentence need to be understood in associations with other events in the document. Therefore, we propose to construct an event relation graph to explicitly reason about event-event relations for sentence-level bias identification. The designed event relation graph consists of events as nodes and four common types of event relations: coreference, temporal, causal, and subevent relations. Then, we incorporate event relation graph for bias sentences identification in two steps: an event-aware language model is built to inject the events and event relations knowledge into the basic language model via soft labels; further, a relation-aware graph attention network is designed to update sentence embedding with events and event relations information based on hard labels. Experiments on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach with the aid of event relation graph improves both precision and recall of bias sentence identification. ",

Recent approaches address this issue by pre-training according to pseudo-labels, which align object regions with HOI triplets parsed from image captions. However, pseudo-labeling is tricky and noisy, making HOI pre-training a complex process. Therefore, we propose an efficient disentangled pre-training method for HOI detection (DP-HOI) to address this problem. First, DP-HOI utilizes object detection and action recognition datasets to pre-train the detection and interaction decoder layers, respectively. Then, we arrange these decoder layers so that the pre-training architecture is consistent with the downstream HOI detection task. This facilitates efficient knowledge transfer. Specifically, the detection decoder identifies reliable human instances in each action recognition dataset image, generates one corresponding query, and feeds it into the interaction decoder for verb classification. Next, we combine the human instance verb predictions in the same image and impose image-level supervision. The DP-HOI structure can be easily adapted to the HOI detection task, enabling effective model parameter initialization. Therefore, it significantly enhances the performance of existing HOI detection models on a broad range of rare categories.

More specifically, we employ the physical constraint regularization during the training phase to guide the model towards predicting grasps that comply with the physical rule on grasping. For the unstable grasp poses predicted on novel objects, we design a contact-score joint optimization using the projection contact map to refine these poses in cluttered scenarios. Extensive experiments conducted on the GraspNet-1billion benchmark demonstrate a substantial performance gain on the novel object set and the real-world grasping experiments also demonstrate the effectiveness of our generalizing 6-DoF grasp detection method.

Moreover, approximation techniques, such as quantization, have been introduced, which reduce the computational and storage requirements, thus enabling the integration of larger NNs into FPGA devices. On the other hand, FPGAs are sensitive to radiation-induced Single Event Upsets (SEUs). In this work, we perform an in-depth reliability analysis in an FPGA-based Binarized Fully Connected Neural Network (BNN) accelerator running a statistical fault injection campaign. The BNN benchmark has been produced by FINN, an open-source framework that provides an end-to-end flow from abstract level to design, making it easy to design customized FPGA NN accelerators, while it also supports various approximation techniques. The campaign includes the injection of faults in the configuration memory of a state-of-the-art Xilinx Ultrascale+ FPGA running the BNN, as well an exhaustive fault injection in the user flip flops. We have analyzed the fault injection results characterizing the SEU vulnerability of the circuit per network layer, per clock cycle, and register. In general, the results show that the BNNs are inherently resilient to soft errors, since a low portion of SEUs in the configuration memory and the flip flops, cause system crashes or misclassification errors.

These new classes usually have only a few labeled instances as it is time-consuming and labor-intensive to annotate a large number of unlabeled instances. Therefore, this paper proposes a new task, called class-incremental few-shot event detection. Nevertheless, this task faces two problems, i.e., old knowledge forgetting and new class overfitting. To solve these problems, this paper further presents a novel knowledge distillation and prompt learning based method, called Prompt-KD. Specifically, to handle the forgetting problem about old knowledge, Prompt-KD develops an attention based multi-teacher knowledge distillation framework, where the ancestor teacher model pre-trained on base classes is reused in all learning sessions, and the father teacher model derives the current student model via adaptation. On the other hand, in order to cope with the few-shot learning scenario and alleviate the corresponding new class overfitting problem, Prompt-KD is also equipped with a prompt learning mechanism. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets, i.e., FewEvent and MAVEN, demonstrate the superior performance of Prompt-KD. ",

Finally, we develop a series of stereotype elicitation prompts and evaluate the presence of stereotypes in text generation tasks with popular LLMs, using one of our best performing previously presented stereotypes detectors. Our experiments yielded several key findings: i) Training stereotype detectors in a multi-dimension setting yields better results than training multiple single-dimension classifiers.ii) The integrated MGS Dataset enhances both the in-dataset and cross-dataset generalisation ability of stereotype detectors compared to using the datasets separately. iii) There is a reduction in stereotypes in the content generated by GPT Family LLMs with newer versions.

Initially, we establish a baseline by training a transformer-based model for standard emotion classification, achieving state-of-the-art performance. We argue that not all misclassifications are of the same importance, as there are perceptual similarities among emotional classes. We thus redefine the emotion labeling problem by shifting it from a traditional classification model to an ordinal classification one, where discrete emotions are arranged in a sequential order according to their valence levels. Finally, we propose a method that performs ordinal classification in the two-dimensional emotion space, considering both valence and arousal scales. The results show that our approach not only preserves high accuracy in emotion prediction but also significantly reduces the magnitude of errors in cases of misclassification. ",

    "title": "Defense without Forgetting: Continual Adversarial Defense with  Anisotropic & Isotropic Pseudo Replay",
    "abstract": "Deep neural networks have demonstrated susceptibility to adversarial attacks. Adversarial defense techniques often focus on one-shot setting to maintain robustness against attack. However, new attacks can emerge in sequences in real-world deployment scenarios. As a result, it is crucial for a defense model to constantly adapt to new attacks, but the adaptation process can lead to catastrophic forgetting of previously defended against attacks. In this paper, we discuss for the first time the concept of continual adversarial defense under a sequence of attacks, and propose a lifelong defense baseline called Anisotropic \\& Isotropic Replay (AIR), which offers three advantages: (1) Isotropic replay ensures model consistency in the neighborhood distribution of new data, indirectly aligning the output preference between old and new tasks. (2) Anisotropic replay enables the model to learn a compromise data manifold with fresh mixed semantics for further replay constraints and potential future attacks. (3) A straightforward regularizer mitigates the 'plasticity-stability' trade-off by aligning model output between new and old tasks. Experiment results demonstrate that AIR can approximate or even exceed the empirical performance upper bounds achieved by Joint Training. ",

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have risen significantly in popularity and are increasingly being adopted across multiple applications. These LLMs are heavily aligned to resist engaging in illegal or unethical topics as a means to avoid contributing to responsible AI harms. However, a recent line of attacks, known as \"jailbreaks\", seek to overcome this alignment. Intuitively, jailbreak attacks aim to narrow the gap between what the model can do and what it is willing to do. In this paper, we introduce a novel jailbreak attack called Crescendo. Unlike existing jailbreak methods, Crescendo is a multi-turn jailbreak that interacts with the model in a seemingly benign manner. It begins with a general prompt or question about the task at hand and then gradually escalates the dialogue by referencing the model's replies, progressively leading to a successful jailbreak. We evaluate Crescendo on various public systems, including ChatGPT, Gemini Pro, Gemini-Ultra, LlaMA-2 70b Chat, and Anthropic Chat. Our results demonstrate the strong efficacy of Crescendo, with it achieving high attack success rates across all evaluated models and tasks. Furthermore, we introduce Crescendomation, a tool that automates the Crescendo attack, and our evaluation showcases its effectiveness against state-of-the-art models. ",

To address this growing problem, accurate methods of detection are needed to identify loneliness and to differentiate social and emotional loneliness so that intervention can be personalized to individual need. Passive sensing technology provides a unique technique to capture behavioral patterns linked with distinct loneliness forms, allowing for more nuanced understanding and interventions for loneliness. Methods: To differentiate between social and emotional loneliness using digital biomarkers, our study included statistical tests, machine learning for predictive modeling, and SHAP values for feature importance analysis, revealing important factors in loneliness classification. Results: Our analysis revealed significant behavioral differences between socially and emotionally lonely groups, particularly in terms of phone usage and location-based features , with machine learning models demonstrating substantial predictive power in classifying loneliness levels. The XGBoost model, in particular, showed high accuracy and was effective in identifying key digital biomarkers, including phone usage duration and location-based features, as significant predictors of loneliness categories. Conclusion: This study underscores the potential of passive sensing data, combined with machine learning techniques, to provide insights into the behavioral manifestations of social and emotional loneliness among students. The identification of key digital biomarkers paves the way for targeted interventions aimed at mitigating loneliness in this population. ",

    "abstract": "While recent Transformer-based approaches have shown impressive performances on event-based object detection tasks, their high computational costs still diminish the low power consumption advantage of event cameras. Image-based works attempt to reduce these costs by introducing sparse Transformers. However, they display inadequate sparsity and adaptability when applied to event-based object detection, since these approaches cannot balance the fine granularity of token-level sparsification and the efficiency of window-based Transformers, leading to reduced performance and efficiency. Furthermore, they lack scene-specific sparsity optimization, resulting in information loss and a lower recall rate. To overcome these limitations, we propose the Scene Adaptive Sparse Transformer (SAST). SAST enables window-token co-sparsification, significantly enhancing fault tolerance and reducing computational overhead. Leveraging the innovative scoring and selection modules, along with the Masked Sparse Window Self-Attention, SAST showcases remarkable scene-aware adaptability: It focuses only on important objects and dynamically optimizes sparsity level according to scene complexity, maintaining a remarkable balance between performance and computational cost. The evaluation results show that SAST outperforms all other dense and sparse networks in both performance and efficiency on two large-scale event-based object detection datasets (1Mpx and Gen1).

Our work builds on the state-of-the-art CLIP-LIT approach, which learns a prompt pair by constraining the text-image similarity between a prompt (negative/positive sample) and a corresponding image (backlit image/well-lit image) in the CLIP embedding space. Learned prompts then guide an image enhancement network. Based on the CLIP-LIT framework, we propose two novel methods for CLIP guidance. First, we show that instead of tuning prompts in the space of text embeddings, it is possible to directly tune their embeddings in the latent space without any loss in quality. This accelerates training and potentially enables the use of additional encoders that do not have a text encoder. Second, we propose a novel approach that does not require any prompt tuning. Instead, based on CLIP embeddings of backlit and well-lit images from training data, we compute the residual vector in the embedding space as a simple difference between the mean embeddings of the well-lit and backlit images. This vector then guides the enhancement network during training, pushing a backlit image towards the space of well-lit images. This approach further dramatically reduces training time, stabilizes training and produces high quality enhanced images without artifacts, both in supervised and unsupervised training regimes. Additionally, we show that residual vectors can be interpreted, revealing biases in training data, and thereby enabling potential bias correction. ",

They typically draw inspiration from diffusion-based methods to introduce a novel propagation scheme, which is analyzed using ordinary differential equations (ODE). However, the implementation of CGNNs requires significant computational power, making them challenging to deploy on battery-powered devices. Inspired by recent spiking neural networks (SNNs), which emulate a biological inference process and provide an energy-efficient neural architecture, we incorporate the SNNs with CGNNs in a unified framework, named Continuous Spiking Graph Neural Networks (COS-GNN). We employ SNNs for graph node representation at each time step, which are further integrated into the ODE process along with time. To enhance information preservation and mitigate information loss in SNNs, we introduce the high-order structure of COS-GNN, which utilizes the second-order ODE for spiking representation and continuous propagation. Moreover, we provide the theoretical proof that COS-GNN effectively mitigates the issues of exploding and vanishing gradients, enabling us to capture long-range dependencies between nodes. Experimental results on graph-based learning tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed COS-GNN over competitive baselines. ",

However, their performance is very sensitive to syntactic features, such as the names of variables and types, the structure of code, and presence of type hints. We contribute an inference-time technique to make CodeLLMs more robust to syntactic distractors that are semantically irrelevant. Our methodology relies on activation steering, which involves editing internal model activations to steer the model towards the correct prediction. We contribute a novel way to construct steering vectors by taking inspiration from mutation testing, which constructs minimal semantics-breaking code edits. In contrast, we construct steering vectors from semantics-preserving code edits. We apply our approach to the task of type prediction for the gradually typed languages Python and TypeScript. This approach corrects up to 90% of type mispredictions. Finally, we show that steering vectors calculated from Python activations reliably correct type mispredictions in TypeScript, and vice versa. This result suggests that LLMs may be learning to transfer knowledge of types across programming languages. ",

While well-trained text detectors have demonstrated promising performance on unseen test data, recent research suggests that these detectors have vulnerabilities when dealing with adversarial attacks such as paraphrasing. In this paper, we propose a framework for a broader class of adversarial attacks, designed to perform minor perturbations in machine-generated content to evade detection. We consider two attack settings: white-box and black-box, and employ adversarial learning in dynamic scenarios to assess the potential enhancement of the current detection model's robustness against such attacks. The empirical results reveal that the current detection models can be compromised in as little as 10 seconds, leading to the misclassification of machine-generated text as human-written content. Furthermore, we explore the prospect of improving the model's robustness over iterative adversarial learning. Although some improvements in model robustness are observed, practical applications still face significant challenges. These findings shed light on the future development of AI-text detectors, emphasizing the need for more accurate and robust detection methods. ",

The main motivation for the model is to integrate the temporal dimension into the analysis of players' passing networks in order to gain deeper insights into the dynamics of system behavior, particularly how a system exploits the degeneracy property to self-regulate. First, the temporal graph model and the entropy measures used to assess the complexity of the dynamics of the network structure are introduced and illustrated. Second, an experiment using basketball data is conducted to investigate the relationship between the complexity level and team performance. This is accomplished by examining the correlations between the entropy measures in a team's behavior and the team's final performance, as well as the link between the relative score compared to that of the opponent and the entropy in the team's behavior. Results indicate positive correlations between entropy measures and final team performance, and threshold values of relative score associated with changes in team behavior -- thereby revealing common and unique team signatures. From a complexity science perspective, the model proves useful for identifying key performance factors in team sports and for studying the effects of given constraints on the exploitation of degeneracy to organize team behavior through various network structures. Future research can easily extend the model and apply it to other types of social networks. ",

To address this obstacle, we propose SCANNER (Span CANdidate detection and recognition for NER), a model capable of effectively handling all three NER variants. SCANNER is a two-stage structure; we extract entity candidates in the first stage and use it as a query to get knowledge, effectively pulling knowledge from various sources. We can boost our performance by utilizing this entity-centric extracted knowledge to address unseen entities. Furthermore, to tackle the challenges arising from noisy annotations in NER datasets, we introduce a novel self-distillation method, enhancing the robustness and accuracy of our model in processing training data with inherent uncertainties.

All proposed approaches outperform existing state-of-the-art methods and can be used in CPU-based real-time applications.

    "abstract": "Advancements in deep image synthesis techniques, such as generative adversarial networks (GANs) and diffusion models (DMs), have ushered in an era of generating highly realistic images. While this technological progress has captured significant interest, it has also raised concerns about the potential difficulty in distinguishing real images from their synthetic counterparts. This paper takes inspiration from the potent convergence capabilities between vision and language, coupled with the zero-shot nature of vision-language models (VLMs). We introduce an innovative method called Bi-LORA that leverages VLMs, combined with low-rank adaptation (LORA) tuning techniques, to enhance the precision of synthetic image detection for unseen model-generated images. The pivotal conceptual shift in our methodology revolves around reframing binary classification as an image captioning task, leveraging the distinctive capabilities of cutting-edge VLM, notably bootstrapping language image pre-training (BLIP2). Rigorous and comprehensive experiments are conducted to validate the effectiveness of our proposed approach, particularly in detecting unseen diffusion-generated images from unknown diffusion-based generative models during training, showcasing robustness to noise, and demonstrating generalization capabilities to GANs. The obtained results showcase an impressive average accuracy of 93.41% in synthetic image detection on unseen generation models.

Existing air quality estimation methods divide the study area into disjointed grid regions, and apply 2D convolution to model the spatial dependencies of adjacent grid regions based on the first law of geography, failing to model the spatial dependencies of distant grid regions. To this end, we propose a Dual-view Supergrid-aware Graph Neural Network (DSGNN) for regional air quality estimation, which can model the spatial dependencies of distant grid regions from dual views (i.e., satellite-derived aerosol optical depth (AOD) and meteorology). Specifically, images are utilized to represent the regional data (i.e., AOD data and meteorology data). The dual-view supergrid learning module is introduced to generate supergrids in a parameterized way. Based on the dual-view supergrids, the dual-view implicit correlation encoding module is introduced to learn the correlations between pairwise supergrids. In addition, the dual-view message passing network is introduced to implement the information interaction on the supergrid graphs and images. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate that DSGNN achieves the state-of-the-art performances on the air quality estimation task, outperforming the best baseline by an average of 19.64% in MAE.

To address this problem, we propose a \\textbf{Co}operative \\textbf{S}tudents (\\textbf{CoS}) framework that innovatively employs global-local transformations (GLT) and a proxy-based target consistency (PTC) mechanism to capture the spatial consistency in day- and night-time scenarios effectively, and thus bridge the significant domain shift across contexts.

Unlike current state-of-the-art fully-supervised methods, our approach does not require any 2d or 3d ground-truth poses and uses only the multi-view input images from a calibrated camera setup and 2d pseudo poses generated from an off-the-shelf 2d human pose estimator. We propose two self-supervised learning objectives: self-supervised person localization in 3d space and self-supervised 3d pose estimation. We achieve self-supervised 3d person localization by training the model on synthetically generated 3d points, serving as 3d person root positions, and on the projected root-heatmaps in all the views. We then model the 3d poses of all the localized persons with a bottleneck representation, map them onto all views obtaining 2d joints, and render them using 2d Gaussian heatmaps in an end-to-end differentiable manner. Afterwards, we use the corresponding 2d joints and heatmaps from the pseudo 2d poses for learning. To alleviate the intrinsic inaccuracy of the pseudo labels, we propose an adaptive supervision attention mechanism to guide the self-supervision.

Our work considers noise masking attacks, introduced by Amid et al. 2022, which attack automatic speech recognition (ASR) models by requesting a transcript of an utterance which is partially replaced with noise. They show that when a record has been seen at training time, the model will transcribe the noisy record with its memorized sensitive transcript. In our work, we extend these attacks beyond ASR models, to attack pretrained speech encoders. Our method fine-tunes the encoder to produce an ASR model, and then performs noise masking on this model, which we find recovers private information from the pretraining data, despite the model never having seen transcripts at pretraining time! We show how to improve the precision of these attacks and investigate a number of countermeasures to our attacks. ",

We find that the existing state-of-the-art methods are generally superior to LLMs in software vulnerability detection. Although LLMs improve accuracy when providing context information, they still have limitations in accurately predicting severity ratings for certain CWE types. In addition, LLMs demonstrate some ability to locate vulnerabilities for certain CWE types, but their performance varies among different CWE types. Finally, LLMs show uneven performance in generating CVE descriptions for various CWE types, with limited accuracy in a few-shot setting. Overall, though LLMs perform well in some aspects, they still need improvement in understanding the subtle differences in code vulnerabilities and the ability to describe vulnerabilities to fully realize their potential. Our evaluation pipeline provides valuable insights for further enhancing LLMs' software vulnerability handling capabilities. ",

While Parameter-efficient Fine-tuning (PEFT) is commonly used to adapt foundation models for recommendation tasks, most research prioritizes parameter efficiency, often overlooking critical factors like GPU memory efficiency and training speed. Addressing this gap, our paper introduces IISAN (Intra- and Inter-modal Side Adapted Network for Multimodal Representation), a simple plug-and-play architecture using a Decoupled PEFT structure and exploiting both intra- and inter-modal adaptation. IISAN matches the performance of full fine-tuning (FFT) and state-of-the-art PEFT. More importantly, it significantly reduces GPU memory usage - from 47GB to just 3GB for multimodal sequential recommendation tasks. Additionally, it accelerates training time per epoch from 443s to 22s compared to FFT. This is also a notable improvement over the Adapter and LoRA, which require 37-39 GB GPU memory and 350-380 seconds per epoch for training. Furthermore, we propose a new composite efficiency metric, TPME (Training-time, Parameter, and GPU Memory Efficiency) to alleviate the prevalent misconception that \"parameter efficiency represents overall efficiency\". TPME provides more comprehensive insights into practical efficiency comparisons between different methods. Besides, we give an accessible efficiency analysis of all PEFT and FFT approaches, which demonstrate the superiority of IISAN.

After DETR was developed, one-stage SGG models based on a one-stage object detector have been actively studied. However, complex modeling is used to predict the relationship between objects, and the inherent relationship between object queries learned in the multi-head self-attention of the object detector has been neglected. We propose a lightweight one-stage SGG model that extracts the relation graph from the various relationships learned in the multi-head self-attention layers of the DETR decoder. By fully utilizing the self-attention by-products, the relation graph can be extracted effectively with a shallow relation extraction head. Considering the dependency of the relation extraction task on the object detection task, we propose a novel relation smoothing technique that adjusts the relation label adaptively according to the quality of the detected objects. By the relation smoothing, the model is trained according to the continuous curriculum that focuses on object detection task at the beginning of training and performs multi-task learning as the object detection performance gradually improves. Furthermore, we propose a connectivity prediction task that predicts whether a relation exists between object pairs as an auxiliary task of the relation extraction.

For this, a population size $\\lambda$ suffices that is at least logarithmic in the problem size $n$. The only previous result in this direction regarded the less realistic one-bit noise model, required a population size super-linear in the problem size, and proved a runtime guarantee roughly cubic in the noiseless runtime for the OneMax benchmark. Our significantly stronger results are based on the novel proof argument that the noiseless offspring can be seen as a biased uniform crossover between the parent and the noisy offspring.

Leveraging Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (ODE) for registration, this extension work discusses how this framework can aid in the characterization of sequential biological processes. Utilizing the Neural ODE's ability to model state derivatives with neural networks, our Neural Ordinary Differential Equation Optimization-based (NODEO) framework considers voxels as particles within a dynamic system, defining deformation fields through the integration of neural differential equations. This method learns dynamics directly from data, bypassing the need for physical priors, making it exceptionally suitable for medical scenarios where such priors are unavailable or inapplicable. Consequently, the framework can discern underlying dynamics and use sequence data to regularize the transformation trajectory. We evaluated our framework on two clinical datasets: one for cardiac motion tracking and another for longitudinal brain MRI analysis. Demonstrating its efficacy in both 2D and 3D imaging scenarios, our framework offers flexibility and model agnosticism, capable of managing image sequences and facilitating label propagation throughout these sequences.

First, we demonstrate how to successfully leverage access to logprobs for jailbreaking: we initially design an adversarial prompt template (sometimes adapted to the target LLM), and then we apply random search on a suffix to maximize the target logprob (e.g., of the token \"Sure\"), potentially with multiple restarts. In this way, we achieve nearly 100\\% attack success rate -- according to GPT-4 as a judge -- on GPT-3.5/4, Llama-2-Chat-7B/13B/70B, Gemma-7B, and R2D2 from HarmBench that was adversarially trained against the GCG attack. We also show how to jailbreak all Claude models -- that do not expose logprobs -- via either a transfer or prefilling attack with 100\\% success rate. In addition, we show how to use random search on a restricted set of tokens for finding trojan strings in poisoned models -- a task that shares many similarities with jailbreaking -- which is the algorithm that brought us the first place in the SaTML'24 Trojan Detection Competition. The common theme behind these attacks is that adaptivity is crucial: different models are vulnerable to different prompting templates (e.g., R2D2 is very sensitive to in-context learning prompts), some models have unique vulnerabilities based on their APIs (e.g., prefilling for Claude), and in some settings it is crucial to restrict the token search space based on prior knowledge (e.g., for trojan detection). We provide the code, prompts, and logs of the attacks at https://github.com/tml-epfl/llm-adaptive-attacks. ",

We call this property alpha invariance. For NeRFs to better maintain alpha invariance, we recommend 1) parameterizing both distance and volume densities in log space, and 2) a discretization-agnostic initialization strategy to guarantee high ray transmittance. We revisit a few popular radiance field models and find that these systems use various heuristics to deal with issues arising from scene scaling. We test their behaviors and show our recipe to be more robust. ",

To promptly detect overlooked ASEs, we developed a digital health methodology capable of analyzing massive public data from social media, published clinical research, manufacturers' reports, and ChatGPT.

Our data-analytic approach revolutionizes the detection of unreported ASEs associated with newly deployed drugs, leveraging cutting-edge AI-driven social media analytics.

    "abstract": "The recent emergence of the hybrid quantum-classical neural network (HQCNN) architecture has garnered considerable attention due to the potential advantages associated with integrating quantum principles to enhance various facets of machine learning algorithms and computations. However, the current investigated serial structure of HQCNN, wherein information sequentially passes from one network to another, often imposes limitations on the trainability and expressivity of the network. In this study, we introduce a novel architecture termed Parallel Proportional Fusion of Quantum and Spiking Neural Networks (PPF-QSNN). The dataset information is simultaneously fed into both the spiking neural network and the variational quantum circuits, with the outputs amalgamated in proportion to their individual contributions. We systematically assess the impact of diverse PPF-QSNN parameters on network performance for image classification, aiming to identify the optimal configuration. Numerical results on the MNIST dataset unequivocally illustrate that our proposed PPF-QSNN outperforms both the existing spiking neural network and the serial quantum neural network across metrics such as accuracy, loss, and robustness. This study introduces a novel and effective amalgamation approach for HQCNN, thereby laying the groundwork for the advancement and application of quantum advantage in artificial intelligent computations.

Our algorithm adopts the simple form of alternating iterations of an oracle and a continuous-time quantum walk operator, which is a generalization of Grover's search algorithm. We address the most general case of multiple marked states, so there is a problem of estimating the number of marked states. To this end, we construct a quantum counting algorithm based on the spectrum structure of the search operator. To implement the continuous-time quantum walk operator, we perform Hamiltonian simulation in the quantum circuit model. We achieve simulation in constant time, that is, the complexity of the quantum circuit does not scale with the evolution time. Besides, deterministic search serves as a simple tool for perfect state transfer (PST). As an application, we explore the problem of PST on complete bipartite graphs. ",

One-dimensional models simulate large blood vessel flow, whereas zerodimensional models are used for simulating blood flow in vascular subsystems corresponding to peripheral arteries and organs. Transmission conditions at bifurcation and confluence are solved using Riemann invariants. Blood circulation simulation in the portal venous system and related organs (liver, stomach, spleen, pancreas, intestine) is particularly targeted. Those organs play important roles in metabolic system dynamics. The proposed efficient parallel algorithms for multicore environments solve these equations much faster than serial computations. ",

    "abstract": "The segmentation of organs in volumetric medical images plays an important role in computer-aided diagnosis and treatment/surgery planning. Conventional 2D convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can hardly exploit the spatial correlation of volumetric data. Current 3D CNNs have the advantage to extract more powerful volumetric representations but they usually suffer from occupying excessive memory and computation nevertheless. In this study we aim to enhance the 2D networks with contextual information for better volumetric image segmentation. Accordingly, we propose a contextual embedding learning approach to facilitate 2D CNNs capturing spatial information properly. Our approach leverages the learned embedding and the slice-wisely neighboring matching as a soft cue to guide the network. In such a way, the contextual information can be transferred slice-by-slice thus boosting the volumetric representation of the network. Experiments on challenging prostate MRI dataset (PROMISE12) and abdominal CT dataset (CHAOS) show that our contextual embedding learning can effectively leverage the inter-slice context and improve segmentation performance. The proposed approach is a plug-and-play, and memory-efficient solution to enhance the 2D networks for volumetric segmentation. The code will be publicly available. ",

In this paper, we study the use of transfer learning from Whisper, a state-of-the-art deep learning model for automatic speech recognition, for microscopic intelligibility prediction at the level of lexical responses.

Optical wireless communication (OWC) arises as a complementary technology to radio frequency (RF) systems that can support high aggregate data rates. However, OWC systems face some challenges including beam-blockage. Intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRSs) can offer alternative pathways for the optical signal, ensuring continuous connectivity. In this work, we investigate the potential of using IRS in an indoor OWC network. In particular, we define a system model of indoor OWC that employs IRS in conjunction with angle diversity transmitters (ADT) using vertical-cavity surface-emitting laser (VCSEL) arrays. The VCSEL beam is narrow, directed, and easy to block, however, it can deliver high data rates under eye safety regulations. Simulation results show that the deployment of IRS can significantly improve the achievable data rates of Laser-based OWC systems. ",

In the oblivious adversarial case with $K$ base arms and time horizon $T$, we derive lower bounds for the minimax regret and design algorithms to approach them. To prove these lower bounds, we design stochastic loss sequences for both feedback settings, building on an idea from previous work in Dekel et al. (2014). The lower bound for bandit feedback is $ \\tilde{\\Omega}\\big( (\\lambda K)^{\\frac{1}{3}} (TI)^{\\frac{2}{3}}\\big)$ while that for semi-bandit feedback is $ \\tilde{\\Omega}\\big( (\\lambda K I)^{\\frac{1}{3}} T^{\\frac{2}{3}}\\big)$ where $I$ is the number of base arms in the combinatorial arm played in each round. To approach these lower bounds, we design algorithms that operate in batches by dividing the time horizon into batches to restrict the number of switches between actions. For the bandit feedback setting, where only the total loss of the combinatorial arm is observed, we introduce the Batched-Exp2 algorithm which achieves a regret upper bound of $\\tilde{O}\\big((\\lambda K)^{\\frac{1}{3}}T^{\\frac{2}{3}}I^{\\frac{4}{3}}\\big)$ as $T$ tends to infinity.

    "abstract": "This study aims to establish a computer-aided diagnostic system for lung lesions using bronchoscope endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) to assist physicians in identifying lesion areas. During EBUS-transbronchial needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA) procedures, physicians rely on grayscale ultrasound images to determine the location of lesions. However, these images often contain significant noise and can be influenced by surrounding tissues or blood vessels, making interpretation challenging. Previous research has lacked the application of object detection models to EBUS-TBNA, and there has been no well-defined solution for annotating the EBUS-TBNA dataset. In related studies on ultrasound images, although models have been successful in capturing target regions for their respective tasks, their training and predictions have been based on two-dimensional images, limiting their ability to leverage temporal features for improved predictions. This study introduces a three-dimensional image-based object detection model. It utilizes an attention mechanism to capture temporal correlations and we will implements a filtering mechanism to select relevant information from previous frames. Subsequently, a teacher-student model training approach is employed to optimize the model further, leveraging unlabeled data. To mitigate the impact of poor-quality pseudo-labels on the student model, we will add a special Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) to ensure the quality of pseudo-labels. ",

Our method trains deep learning models, demonstrated here with the UNet architecture, using label maps derived from healthy and stroke datasets, facilitating the segmentation of both healthy tissue and pathological lesions without sequence-specific training data. Evaluated against in-domain and out-of-domain (OOD) datasets, our framework demonstrates robust performance, rivaling current methods within the training domain and significantly outperforming them on OOD data.
