    "abstract": "In this digital era, our lives highly depend on the internet and worldwide technology. Wide usage of technology and platforms of communication makes our lives better and easier. But on the other side it carries out some security issues and cruel activities, phishing is one activity of these cruel activities. It is a type of cybercrime, which has the purpose of stealing the personal information of the computer user, and enterprises, which carry out fake websites that are the copy of the original websites. The attackers used personal information like account IDs, passwords, and usernames for the purpose of some fraudulent activities against the user of the computer. To overcome this problem researchers focused on the machine learning and deep learning approaches. In our study, we are going to use machine learning and deep learning models to identify the fake web pages on the secondary dataset. ",

    "abstract": "Graph embeddings have emerged as a powerful tool for representing complex network structures in a low-dimensional space, enabling the use of efficient methods that employ the metric structure in the embedding space as a proxy for the topological structure of the data. In this paper, we explore several aspects that affect the quality of a vertex embedding of graph-structured data. To this effect, we first present a family of flexible distance functions that faithfully capture the topological distance between different vertices. Secondly, we analyze vertex embeddings as resulting from a fitted transformation of the distance matrix rather than as a direct result of optimization. Finally, we evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed embedding constructions by performing community detection on a host of benchmark datasets. The reported results are competitive with classical algorithms that operate on the entire graph while benefitting from a substantially reduced computational complexity due to the reduced dimensionality of the representations.

    "abstract": "Deep neural networks for classification are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, where small perturbations to input samples lead to incorrect predictions. This susceptibility, combined with the black-box nature of such networks, limits their adoption in critical applications like autonomous driving. Feature-attribution-based explanation methods provide relevance of input features for model predictions on input samples, thus explaining model decisions. However, we observe that both model predictions and feature attributions for input samples are sensitive to noise. We develop a practical method for this characteristic of model prediction and feature attribution to detect adversarial samples. Our method, PASA, requires the computation of two test statistics using model prediction and feature attribution and can reliably detect adversarial samples using thresholds learned from benign samples. We validate our lightweight approach by evaluating the performance of PASA on varying strengths of FGSM, PGD, BIM, and CW attacks on multiple image and non-image datasets. On average, we outperform state-of-the-art statistical unsupervised adversarial detectors on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet by 14\\% and 35\\% ROC-AUC scores, respectively. Moreover, our approach demonstrates competitive performance even when an adversary is aware of the defense mechanism. ",

    "abstract": "Adversarial machine learning attacks on video action recognition models is a growing research area and many effective attacks were introduced in recent years. These attacks show that action recognition models can be breached in many ways. Hence using these models in practice raises significant security concerns. However, there are very few works which focus on defending against or detecting attacks. In this work, we propose a novel universal detection method which is compatible with any action recognition model. In our extensive experiments, we show that our method consistently detects various attacks against different target models with high true positive rates while satisfying very low false positive rates. Tested against four state-of-the-art attacks targeting four action recognition models, the proposed detector achieves an average AUC of 0.911 over 16 test cases while the best performance achieved by the existing detectors is 0.645 average AUC. This 41.2% improvement is enabled by the robustness of the proposed detector to varying attack methods and target models. The lowest AUC achieved by our detector across the 16 test cases is 0.837 while the competing detector's performance drops as low as 0.211. We also show that the proposed detector is robust to varying attack strengths. In addition, we analyze our method's real-time performance with different hardware setups to demonstrate its potential as a practical defense mechanism. ",

    "abstract": "The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence within the realm of cybersecurity raises significant security concerns. The vulnerability of deep learning models in adversarial attacks is one of the major issues. In adversarial machine learning, malicious users try to fool the deep learning model by inserting adversarial perturbation inputs into the model during its training or testing phase. Subsequently, it reduces the model confidence score and results in incorrect classifications. The novel key contribution of the research is to empirically test the black-box adversarial transferability phenomena in cyber attack detection systems. It indicates that the adversarial perturbation input generated through the surrogate model has a similar impact on the target model in producing the incorrect classification. To empirically validate this phenomenon, surrogate and target models are used. The adversarial perturbation inputs are generated based on the surrogate-model for which the hacker has complete information. Based on these adversarial perturbation inputs, both surrogate and target models are evaluated during the inference phase. We have done extensive experimentation over the CICDDoS-2019 dataset, and the results are classified in terms of various performance metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and f1-score. The findings indicate that any deep learning model is highly susceptible to adversarial attacks, even if the attacker does not have access to the internal details of the target model. The results also indicate that white-box adversarial attacks have a severe impact compared to black-box adversarial attacks. There is a need to investigate and explore adversarial defence techniques to increase the robustness of the deep learning models against adversarial attacks. ",

    "abstract": "In recent years, pre-trained multimodal large models have attracted widespread attention due to their outstanding performance in various multimodal applications. Nonetheless, the extensive computational resources and vast datasets required for their training present significant hurdles for deployment in environments with limited computational resources. To address this challenge, we propose a novel dynamic self-adaptive multiscale distillation from pre-trained multimodal large model for efficient cross-modal representation learning for the first time. Unlike existing distillation methods, our strategy employs a multiscale perspective, enabling the extraction structural knowledge across from the pre-trained multimodal large model. Ensuring that the student model inherits a comprehensive and nuanced understanding of the teacher knowledge. To optimize each distillation loss in a balanced and efficient manner, we propose a dynamic self-adaptive distillation loss balancer, a novel component eliminating the need for manual loss weight adjustments and dynamically balances each loss item during the distillation process. Our methodology streamlines pre-trained multimodal large models using only their output features and original image-level information, requiring minimal computational resources. This efficient approach is suited for various applications and allows the deployment of advanced multimodal technologies even in resource-limited settings. Extensive experiments has demonstrated that our method maintains high performance while significantly reducing model complexity and training costs. Moreover, our distilled student model utilizes only image-level information to achieve state-of-the-art performance on cross-modal retrieval tasks, surpassing previous methods that relied on region-level information.

The work proposes a Federated Learning model which can identify the participants in a conversation without the requirement of a large audio database for training. An unsupervised online update mechanism is proposed for the Federated Learning model which depends on cosine similarity of speaker embeddings. Moreover, the proposed diarization system solves the problem of speaker change detection via. unsupervised segmentation techniques using Hotelling's t-squared Statistic and Bayesian Information Criterion. In this new approach, speaker change detection is biased around detected quasi-silences, which reduces the severity of the trade-off between the missed detection and false detection rates. Additionally, the computational overhead due to frame-by-frame identification of speakers is reduced via. unsupervised clustering of speech segments. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed training method in the presence of non-IID speech data. It also shows a considerable improvement in the reduction of false and missed detection at the segmentation stage, while reducing the computational overhead. Improved accuracy and reduced computational cost makes the mechanism suitable for real-time speaker diarization across a distributed IoT audio network. ",

Recent studies that have critically examined this issue are often situated in the Western context, and solely document differences across age, gender, or racial groups. As a result, NLP research on subjectivity have overlooked the fact that individuals within demographic groups may hold diverse values, which can influence their perceptions beyond their group norms. To effectively incorporate these considerations into NLP pipelines, we need datasets with extensive parallel annotations from various social and cultural groups. In this paper we introduce the \\dataset dataset: a large-scale cross-cultural dataset of parallel annotations for offensive language in over 4.5K sentences annotated by a pool of over 4k annotators, balanced across gender and age, from across 21 countries, representing eight geo-cultural regions. The dataset contains annotators' moral values captured along six moral foundations: care, equality, proportionality, authority, loyalty, and purity. Our analyses reveal substantial regional variations in annotators' perceptions that are shaped by individual moral values, offering crucial insights for building pluralistic, culturally sensitive NLP models.

To close this gap, we present a new task called Open-Set Object Detection and Discovery (OSODD) and as a solution propose the Open-Set Regions with ViT features (OSR-ViT) detection framework. OSR-ViT combines a class-agnostic proposal network with a powerful ViT-based classifier. Its modular design simplifies optimization and allows users to easily swap proposal solutions and feature extractors to best suit their application. Using our multifaceted evaluation protocol, we show that OSR-ViT obtains performance levels that far exceed state-of-the-art supervised methods.

    "abstract": "Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms often struggle to learn policies that generalize to novel situations due to issues such as causal confusion, overfitting to irrelevant factors, and failure to isolate control of state factors. These issues stem from a common source: a failure to accurately identify and exploit state-specific causal relationships in the environment. While some prior works in RL aim to identify these relationships explicitly, they rely on informal domain-specific heuristics such as spatial and temporal proximity. Actual causality offers a principled and general framework for determining the causes of particular events. However, existing definitions of actual cause often attribute causality to a large number of events, even if many of them rarely influence the outcome. Prior work on actual causality proposes normality as a solution to this problem, but its existing implementations are challenging to scale to complex and continuous-valued RL environments. This paper introduces functional actual cause (FAC), a framework that uses context-specific independencies in the environment to restrict the set of actual causes. We additionally introduce Joint Optimization for Actual Cause Inference (JACI), an algorithm that learns from observational data to infer functional actual causes. We demonstrate empirically that FAC agrees with known results on a suite of examples from the actual causality literature, and JACI identifies actual causes with significantly higher accuracy than existing heuristic methods in a set of complex, continuous-valued environments.

To address widespread problems like harassment, disinformation, information access, and mental health concerns, we need to rethink the foundations of how social technologies are designed, sustained, and governed. This report is based on discussions at the Computing Community Consortium Workshop, The Future of Research on Social Technologies, that was held November 2-3, 2023 in Washington, DC. The visioning workshop came together to focus on two questions. What should we know about social technologies, and what is needed to get there? The workshop brought together over 50 information and computer scientists, social scientists, communication and journalism scholars, and policy experts. We used a discussion format, with one day of guiding topics and a second day using an unconference model where participants created discussion topics. The interdisciplinary group of attendees discussed gaps in existing scholarship and the methods, resources, access, and collective effort needed to address those gaps. We also discussed approaches for translating scholarship for various audiences including citizens, funders, educators, industry professionals, and policymakers. This report presents a synthesis of major themes during our discussions. The themes presented are not a summary of what we know already, they are an exploration of what we do not know enough about, and what we should spend more effort and investment on in the coming years.

Because diabetes may develop into potential serious complications, early glucose prediction for diabetic patients is necessary for timely medical treatment. Existing glucose prediction methods typically utilize patients' private data (e.g. age, gender, ethnicity) and physiological parameters (e.g. blood pressure, heart rate) as reference features for glucose prediction, which inevitably leads to privacy protection concerns. Moreover, these models generally focus on either long-term (monthly-based) or short-term (minute-based) predictions. Long-term prediction methods are generally inaccurate because of the external uncertainties that can greatly affect the glucose values, while short-term ones fail to provide timely medical guidance. Based on the above issues, we propose CrossGP, a novel machine-learning framework for cross-day glucose prediction solely based on the patient's external activities without involving any physiological parameters. Meanwhile, we implement three baseline models for comparison. Extensive experiments on Anderson's dataset strongly demonstrate the superior performance of CrossGP and prove its potential for future real-life applications. ",

    "abstract": "Human communication is multi-modal; e.g., face-to-face interaction involves auditory signals (speech) and visual signals (face movements and hand gestures). Hence, it is essential to exploit multiple modalities when designing machine learning-based facial expression recognition systems. In addition, given the ever-growing quantities of video data that capture human facial expressions, such systems should utilize raw unlabeled videos without requiring expensive annotations. Therefore, in this work, we employ a multitask multi-modal self-supervised learning method for facial expression recognition from in-the-wild video data. Our model combines three self-supervised objective functions: First, a multi-modal contrastive loss, that pulls diverse data modalities of the same video together in the representation space. Second, a multi-modal clustering loss that preserves the semantic structure of input data in the representation space. Finally, a multi-modal data reconstruction loss. We conduct a comprehensive study on this multimodal multi-task self-supervised learning method on three facial expression recognition benchmarks. To that end, we examine the performance of learning through different combinations of self-supervised tasks on the facial expression recognition downstream task. Our model ConCluGen outperforms several multi-modal self-supervised and fully supervised baselines on the CMU-MOSEI dataset. Our results generally show that multi-modal self-supervision tasks offer large performance gains for challenging tasks such as facial expression recognition, while also reducing the amount of manual annotations required.

To overcome this challenge, we propose a simple, fast, yet highly effective approach to matching using Random Hyperplane Tessellations (RHPT). First, we prove that the RHPT representation is an approximate balancing score -- thus maintaining the strong ignorability assumption -- and provide empirical evidence for this claim. Second, we report results of extensive experiments showing that matching using RHPT outperforms traditional matching techniques and is competitive with state-of-the-art deep learning methods for causal effect estimation. In addition, RHPT avoids the need for computationally expensive training of deep neural networks. ",

    "abstract": "Inquisitive questions -- open-ended, curiosity-driven questions people ask as they read -- are an integral part of discourse processing (Kehler and Rohde, 2017; Onea, 2016) and comprehension (Prince, 2004). Recent work in NLP has taken advantage of question generation capabilities of LLMs to enhance a wide range of applications. But the space of inquisitive questions is vast: many questions can be evoked from a given context. So which of those should be prioritized to find answers? Linguistic theories, unfortunately, have not yet provided an answer to this question. This paper presents QSALIENCE, a salience predictor of inquisitive questions. QSALIENCE is instruction-tuned over our dataset of linguist-annotated salience scores of 1,766 (context, question) pairs. A question scores high on salience if answering it would greatly enhance the understanding of the text (Van Rooy, 2003). We show that highly salient questions are empirically more likely to be answered in the same article, bridging potential questions (Onea, 2016) with Questions Under Discussion (Roberts, 2012). We further validate our findings by showing that answering salient questions is an indicator of summarization quality in news. ",

    "abstract": "For natural language understanding and generation, embedding concepts using an order-based representation is an essential task. Unlike traditional point vector based representation, an order-based representation imposes geometric constraints on the representation vectors for explicitly capturing various semantic relationships that may exist between a pair of concepts. In existing literature, several approaches on order-based embedding have been proposed, mostly focusing on capturing hierarchical relationships; examples include vectors in Euclidean space, complex, Hyperbolic, order, and Box Embedding. Box embedding creates region-based rich representation of concepts, but along the process it sacrifices simplicity, requiring a custom-made optimization scheme for learning the representation. Hyperbolic embedding improves embedding quality by exploiting the ever-expanding property of Hyperbolic space, but it also suffers from the same fate as box embedding as gradient descent like optimization is not simple in the Hyperbolic space. In this work, we propose Binder, a novel approach for order-based representation. Binder uses binary vectors for embedding, so the embedding vectors are compact with an order of magnitude smaller footprint than other methods. Binder uses a simple and efficient optimization scheme for learning representation vectors with a linear time complexity. Our comprehensive experimental results show that Binder is very accurate, yielding competitive results on the representation task. But Binder stands out from its competitors on the transitive closure link prediction task as it can learn concept embeddings just from the direct edges, whereas all existing order-based approaches rely on the indirect edges.

    "abstract": "Gig economy consists of two market groups connected via an intermediary. Popular examples are rideshares where passengers and drivers are mediated via platforms such as Uber and Lyft. In a duopoly market, the platforms must compete to attract not only the passengers by providing a lower rate but also the drivers by providing better wages. While this should indicate better driver payout, as platforms compete to attract the driver pool, real world statistics does not indicate such. This goes completely against the intuition that the worker side of a gig economy, given their importance, should always earn better. We attempt to answer the low wages of drivers in the gig economy by modeling the ridesharing game between duopoly platforms, drivers, and passengers using Mathematical Program Networks. Our model is parsimonious, expressive, models the same-side and cross-side externalities of the economy, and has interpretations under both single-homing and multi-homing regimes. We derive the conditions for the existence of a profitable duopoly and show that it can only happen if the platforms collude together to pay the bare minimum to the drivers. This not only answers why drivers are paid less but also provides strong managerial insights to any interested policy maker. ",

Neuromorphic vision sensors are tailored for motion perception due to their asynchronous nature, high temporal resolution, and reduced power consumption. However, their unconventional output requires novel perception paradigms to leverage their spatially sparse and temporally dense nature. In this work, we propose a novel event-based motion segmentation algorithm using a Graph Transformer Neural Network, dubbed GTNN. Our proposed algorithm processes event streams as 3D graphs by a series of nonlinear transformations to unveil local and global spatiotemporal correlations between events. Based on these correlations, events belonging to moving objects are segmented from the background without prior knowledge of the dynamic scene geometry. The algorithm is trained on publicly available datasets including MOD, EV-IMO, and \\textcolor{black}{EV-IMO2} using the proposed training scheme to facilitate efficient training on extensive datasets. Moreover, we introduce the Dynamic Object Mask-aware Event Labeling (DOMEL) approach for generating approximate ground-truth labels for event-based motion segmentation datasets. We use DOMEL to label our own recorded Event dataset for Motion Segmentation (EMS-DOMEL), which we release to the public for further research and benchmarking. Rigorous experiments are conducted on several unseen publicly-available datasets where the results revealed that GTNN outperforms state-of-the-art methods in the presence of dynamic background variations, motion patterns, and multiple dynamic objects with varying sizes and velocities. GTNN achieves significant performance gains with an average increase of 9.4% and 4.5% in terms of motion segmentation accuracy (IoU%) and detection rate (DR%), respectively. ",

As such, analysts often resort to text search techniques to identify existing malware reports based on the symptoms they observe, exploiting the fact that malware samples share a lot of similarity, especially those from the same origin. In this paper, we propose a novel malware behavior search technique that is based on graph isomorphism at the attention layers of Transformer models.

Our technique outperforms state-of-the-art methods, such as those based on sentence embeddings and keywords by 6-14%.

Our modification to the identity shortcuts within a VIT-B/16 backbone of an MAE boosts linear probing accuracy on ImageNet from 67.3% to 72.3%. This significant gap suggests that, while residual connection structure serves an essential role in facilitating gradient propagation, it may have a harmful side effect of reducing capacity for abstract learning by virtue of injecting an echo of shallower representations into deeper layers. We ameliorate this downside via a fixed formula for monotonically decreasing the contribution of identity connections as layer depth increases. Our design promotes the gradual development of feature abstractions, without impacting network trainability. Analyzing the representations learned by our modified residual networks, we find correlation between low effective feature rank and downstream task performance. ",

To overcome these limitations, we present a novel approach to infer the Group-Aware Coordination Graph (GACG), which is designed to capture both the cooperation between agent pairs based on current observations and group-level dependencies from behaviour patterns observed across trajectories. This graph is further used in graph convolution for information exchange between agents during decision-making. To further ensure behavioural consistency among agents within the same group, we introduce a group distance loss, which promotes group cohesion and encourages specialization between groups. Our evaluations, conducted on StarCraft II micromanagement tasks, demonstrate GACG's superior performance. An ablation study further provides experimental evidence of the effectiveness of each component of our method. ",

Graph continual learning (GCL) tackles this problem by continually adapting GNNs to the expanded graph of the current task while maintaining the performance over the graph of previous tasks. Memory replay-based methods, which aim to replay data of previous tasks when learning new tasks, have been explored as one principled approach to mitigate the forgetting of the knowledge learned from the previous tasks. In this paper we extend this methodology with a novel framework, called Debiased Lossless Memory replay (DeLoMe). Unlike existing methods that sample nodes/edges of previous graphs to construct the memory, DeLoMe learns small lossless synthetic node representations as the memory. The learned memory can not only preserve the graph data privacy but also capture the holistic graph information, for which the sampling-based methods are not viable. Further, prior methods suffer from bias toward the current task due to the data imbalance between the classes in the memory data and the current data. A debiased GCL loss function is devised in DeLoMe to effectively alleviate this bias. Extensive experiments on four graph datasets show the effectiveness of DeLoMe under both class- and task-incremental learning settings. ",

In CPDP, deciding on a particular historical project to build a training model can be difficult. To help with this decision, a Bandit Algorithm (BA) based approach has been proposed in prior research to select the most suitable learning project. However, this BA method could lead to the selection of unsuitable data during the early iteration of BA (i.e., early stage of software testing). Selecting an unsuitable model can reduce the prediction accuracy, leading to potential defect overlooking. This study aims to improve the BA method to reduce defects overlooking, especially during the early stage of testing. Once all modules have been tested, modules tested in the early stage are re-predicted, and some modules are retested based on the re-prediction. To assess the impact of re-prediction and retesting, we applied five kinds of BA methods, using 8, 16, and 32 OSS projects as learning data. The results show that the newly proposed approach steadily reduced the probability of defect overlooking on 86.7% of the BA methods and projects combinations. ",

Our method utilizes a newly designed multilateral temporal-view encoder to extract various collaborations of spatial-temporal clues and introduces a deformable window-based temporal-view interaction module to enhance the diversity of these collaborations. Subsequently, we develop a multi-pyramid decoder to aggregate the various types of features and generate detection maps. By adjusting the contribution strength of spatial and temporal clues, our method can effectively identify inpainted regions. We validate our method on existing datasets and also introduce a new challenging and large-scale Video Inpainting dataset based on the YouTube-VOS dataset, which employs several more recent inpainting methods. The results demonstrate the superiority of our method in both in-domain and cross-domain evaluation scenarios. ",

    "abstract": "Sentiment analysis (SA) aims to identify the sentiment expressed in a text, such as a product review. Given a review and the sentiment associated with it, this paper formulates SA as a combination of two tasks: (1) a causal discovery task that distinguishes whether a review \"primes\" the sentiment (Causal Hypothesis C1), or the sentiment \"primes\" the review (Causal Hypothesis C2); and (2) the traditional prediction task to model the sentiment using the review as input. Using the peak-end rule in psychology, we classify a sample as C1 if its overall sentiment score approximates an average of all the sentence-level sentiments in the review, and C2 if the overall sentiment score approximates an average of the peak and end sentiments. For the prediction task, we use the discovered causal mechanisms behind the samples to improve the performance of LLMs by proposing causal prompts that give the models an inductive bias of the underlying causal graph, leading to substantial improvements by up to 32.13 F1 points on zero-shot five-class SA.

    "abstract": "Brain-Computer Interfaces connect the brain to external control devices, necessitating the accurate translation of brain signals such as from electroencephalography (EEG) into executable commands. Graph Neural Networks (GCN) have been increasingly applied for classifying EEG Motor Imagery signals, primarily because they incorporates the spatial relationships among EEG channels, resulting in improved accuracy over traditional convolutional methods. Recent advances by GCNs-Net in real-time EEG MI signal classification utilised Pearson Coefficient Correlation (PCC) for constructing adjacency matrices, yielding significant results on the PhysioNet dataset. Our paper introduces the EEG Graph Lottery Ticket (EEG_GLT) algorithm, an innovative technique for constructing adjacency matrices for EEG channels. It does not require pre-existing knowledge of inter-channel relationships, and it can be tailored to suit both individual subjects and GCN model architectures. Our findings demonstrated that the PCC method outperformed the Geodesic approach by 9.65% in mean accuracy, while our EEG_GLT matrix consistently exceeded the performance of the PCC method by a mean accuracy of 13.39%. Also, we found that the construction of the adjacency matrix significantly influenced accuracy, to a greater extent than GCN model configurations. A basic GCN configuration utilising our EEG_GLT matrix exceeded the performance of even the most complex GCN setup with a PCC matrix in average accuracy. Our EEG_GLT method also reduced MACs by up to 97% compared to the PCC method, while maintaining or enhancing accuracy. In conclusion, the EEG_GLT algorithm marks a breakthrough in the development of optimal adjacency matrices, effectively boosting both computational accuracy and efficiency, making it well-suited for real-time classification of EEG MI signals that demand intensive computational resources.

    "abstract": "Multimodal Recommendation focuses mainly on how to effectively integrate behavior and multimodal information in the recommendation task. Previous works suffer from two major issues. Firstly, the training process tightly couples the behavior module and multimodal module by jointly optimizing them using the sharing model parameters, which leads to suboptimal performance since behavior signals and modality signals often provide opposite guidance for the parameters updates. Secondly, previous approaches fail to take into account the significant distribution differences between behavior and modality when they attempt to fuse behavior and modality information. This resulted in a misalignment between the representations of behavior and modality. To address these challenges, in this paper, we propose a novel Dual Representation learning framework for Multimodal Recommendation called DRepMRec, which introduce separate dual lines for coupling problem and Behavior-Modal Alignment (BMA) for misalignment problem. Specifically, DRepMRec leverages two independent lines of representation learning to calculate behavior and modal representations. After obtaining separate behavior and modal representations, we design a Behavior-Modal Alignment Module (BMA) to align and fuse the dual representations to solve the misalignment problem. Furthermore, we integrate the BMA into other recommendation models, resulting in consistent performance improvements. To ensure dual representations maintain their semantic independence during alignment, we introduce Similarity-Supervised Signal (SSS) for representation learning. We conduct extensive experiments on three public datasets and our method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) results. The source code will be available upon acceptance. ",

Previous approaches have focused on either fine-tuning pre-trained T2I models on specific datasets to generate certain kinds of images (e.g., with a specific object or person), or on optimizing the weights, text prompts, and/or learning features for each input image in an attempt to coax the image generator to produce the desired result. However, these approaches all have shortcomings and fail to produce good results in a predictable and controllable manner. To address this problem, we present TiNO-Edit, an SD-based method that focuses on optimizing the noise patterns and diffusion timesteps during editing, something previously unexplored in the literature. With this simple change, we are able to generate results that both better align with the original images and reflect the desired result. Furthermore, we propose a set of new loss functions that operate in the latent domain of SD, greatly speeding up the optimization when compared to prior approaches, which operate in the pixel domain. Our method can be easily applied to variations of SD including Textual Inversion and DreamBooth that encode new concepts and incorporate them into the edited results.

In this paper, we present an innovative prospective learning approach for personalized heart disease detection, which generates digital twins of healthy individuals' anomalous ECGs and enhances the model sensitivity to the personalized symptoms. In our approach, a vector quantized feature separator is proposed to locate and isolate the disease symptom and normal segments in ECG signals with ECG report guidance. Thus, the ECG digital twins can simulate specific heart diseases used to train a personalized heart disease detection model.

In addition, CNT metrics have been applied to a limited range of architectures, mainly including Fully Connected neural networks. In this work, we extend the existing CNT metrics with measures that sample from the DNNs' training distribution, shifting from a purely topological analysis to one that connects with the interpretability of deep learning. For the novel metrics, in addition to the existing ones, we provide a mathematical formalisation for Fully Connected, AutoEncoder, Convolutional and Recurrent neural networks, of which we vary the activation functions and the number of hidden layers. We show that these metrics differentiate DNNs based on the architecture, the number of hidden layers, and the activation function.

However, in addition to users' true preferences, the user-item interactions might also be affected by confounders (e.g., free shipping, sales promotion). As a result, dual-target CDR has to meet two challenges: (1) how to effectively decouple observed confounders, including single-domain confounders and cross-domain confounders, and (2) how to preserve the positive effects of observed confounders on predicted interactions, while eliminating their negative effects on capturing comprehensive user preferences. To address the above two challenges, we propose a Causal Deconfounding framework via Confounder Disentanglement for dual-target Cross-Domain Recommendation, called CD2CDR. In CD2CDR, we first propose a confounder disentanglement module to effectively decouple observed single-domain and cross-domain confounders. We then propose a causal deconfounding module to preserve the positive effects of such observed confounders and eliminate their negative effects via backdoor adjustment, thereby enhancing the recommendation accuracy in each domain. Extensive experiments conducted on five real-world datasets demonstrate that CD2CDR significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. ",

Experimental validation on variants of the KITTI dataset demonstrates a significant improvement in mean Average Precision (mAP), resulting in a 3.8-8.1% relative enhancement in detection under non-ideal conditions compared to the baseline model, and a less marginal performance difference within 1.3% of the mAP@[0.5:0.95] achieved under ideal conditions by the standard Faster RCNN algorithm.

This paper introduces AndroLog a novel tool developed on top of the Soot framework, designed to provide fine-grained coverage information at multiple levels, including class, methods, statements, and Android components. In contrast to existing tools, AndroLog leaves the responsibility to test apps to analysts, and its motto is simplicity. As demonstrated in this paper, AndroLog can instrument up to 98% of recent Android apps compared to existing tools with 79% and 48% respectively for COSMO and ACVTool. AndroLog also stands out for its potential for future enhancements to increase granularity on demand. We make AndroLog available to the community and provide a video demonstration of AndroLog (see section 8). ",

    "abstract": "Motivated by the need to improve model performance in traffic monitoring tasks with limited labeled samples, we propose a straightforward augmentation technique tailored for object detection datasets, specifically designed for stationary camera-based applications. Our approach focuses on placing objects in the same positions as the originals to ensure its effectiveness. By applying in-place augmentation on objects from the same camera input image, we address the challenge of overlapping with original and previously selected objects. Through extensive testing on two traffic monitoring datasets, we illustrate the efficacy of our augmentation strategy in improving model performance, particularly in scenarios with limited labeled samples and imbalanced class distributions. Notably, our method achieves comparable performance to models trained on the entire dataset while utilizing only 8.5 percent of the original data. Moreover, we report significant improvements, with mAP@.5 increasing from 0.4798 to 0.5025, and the mAP@.5:.95 rising from 0.29 to 0.3138 on the FishEye8K dataset. These results highlight the potential of our augmentation approach in enhancing object detection models for traffic monitoring applications. ",

    "abstract": "Clover fixates nitrogen from the atmosphere to the ground, making grass-clover mixtures highly desirable to reduce external nitrogen fertilization. Herbage containing clover additionally promotes higher food intake, resulting in higher milk production. Herbage probing however remains largely unused as it requires a time-intensive manual laboratory analysis. Without this information, farmers are unable to perform localized clover sowing or take targeted fertilization decisions. Deep learning algorithms have been proposed with the goal to estimate the dry biomass composition from images of the grass directly in the fields. The energy-intensive nature of deep learning however limits deployment to practical edge devices such as smartphones. This paper proposes to fill this gap by applying filter pruning to reduce the energy requirement of existing deep learning solutions. We report that although pruned networks are accurate on controlled, high-quality images of the grass, they struggle to generalize to real-world smartphone images that are blurry or taken from challenging angles. We address this challenge by training filter-pruned models using a variance attenuation loss so they can predict the uncertainty of their predictions. When the uncertainty exceeds a threshold, we re-infer using a more accurate unpruned model. This hybrid approach allows us to reduce energy consumption while retaining a high accuracy. We evaluate our algorithm on two datasets: the GrassClover and the Irish clover using an NVIDIA Jetson Nano edge device. We find that we reduce energy reduction with respect to state-of-the-art solutions by 50% on average with only 4% accuracy loss. ",

In this study, we benefited from recent advances in deep learning at both global and local planning levels to achieve human-aware navigation on a simulated robot. Two distinct deep models are trained with respective objectives: one for global planning and one for local planning. These models are then employed in the simulated robot.

Previous studies of MIAs revealed that likelihood-based classification is effective for detecting leaks in LLMs. However, the existing methods cannot be applied to some proprietary models like ChatGPT or Claude 3 because the likelihood is unavailable to the user. In this study, we propose a Sampling-based Pseudo-Likelihood (\\textbf{SPL}) method for MIA (\\textbf{SaMIA}) that calculates SPL using only the text generated by an LLM to detect leaks. The SaMIA treats the target text as the reference text and multiple outputs from the LLM as text samples, calculates the degree of $n$-gram match as SPL, and determines the membership of the text in the training data.

For this purpose, we present corner case criteria based on the predictive uncertainty. With our corner case criteria, we are able to detect uncertainty-based corner cases of an object instance segmentation model without relying on ground truth (GT) data. We evaluated each corner case criterion using the COCO and the NuImages dataset to analyze the potential of our approach. We also provide a corner case decision function that allows us to distinguish each object into True Positive (TP), localization and/or classification corner case, or False Positive (FP). We also present our first results of an iterative training cycle that outperforms the baseline and where the data added to the training dataset is selected based on the corner case decision function.

    "abstract": "Time series anomaly detection (TAD) faces a significant challenge due to the scarcity of labelled data, which hinders the development of accurate detection models. Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) addresses this challenge by leveraging a labelled dataset from a related domain to detect anomalies in a target dataset. Existing domain adaptation techniques assume that the number of anomalous classes does not change between the source and target domains. In this paper, we propose a novel Domain Adaptation Contrastive learning for Anomaly Detection in multivariate time series (DACAD) model to address this issue by combining UDA and contrastive representation learning. DACAD's approach includes an anomaly injection mechanism that introduces various types of synthetic anomalies, enhancing the model's ability to generalise across unseen anomalous classes in different domains. This method significantly broadens the model's adaptability and robustness. Additionally, we propose a supervised contrastive loss for the source domain and a self-supervised contrastive triplet loss for the target domain, improving comprehensive feature representation learning and extraction of domain-invariant features. Finally, an effective Centre-based Entropy Classifier (CEC) is proposed specifically for anomaly detection, facilitating accurate learning of normal boundaries in the source domain. Our extensive evaluation across multiple real-world datasets against leading models in time series anomaly detection and UDA underscores DACAD's effectiveness. The results validate DACAD's superiority in transferring knowledge across domains and its potential to mitigate the challenge of limited labelled data in time series anomaly detection. ",

    "abstract": "To reduce network traffic and support environments with limited resources, a method for transmitting images with low amounts of transmission data is required. Machine learning-based image compression methods, which compress the data size of images while maintaining their features, have been proposed. However, in certain situations, reconstructing a part of semantic information of images at the receiver end may be sufficient. To realize this concept, semantic-information-based communication, called semantic communication, has been proposed, along with an image transmission method using semantic communication. This method transmits only the semantic information of an image, and the receiver reconstructs the image using an image-generation model. This method utilizes one type of semantic information, but reconstructing images similar to the original image using only it is challenging. This study proposes a multi-modal image transmission method that leverages diverse semantic information for efficient semantic communication. The proposed method extracts multi-modal semantic information from an image and transmits only it. Subsequently, the receiver generates multiple images using an image-generation model and selects an output based on semantic similarity. The receiver must select the output based only on the received features; however, evaluating semantic similarity using conventional metrics is challenging. Therefore, this study explored new metrics to evaluate the similarity between semantic features of images and proposes two scoring procedures. The results indicate that the proposed procedures can compare semantic similarities, such as position and composition, between semantic features of the original and generated images. Thus, the proposed method can facilitate the transmission and utilization of photographs through mobile networks for various service applications. ",

    "abstract": "Log analysis is one of the main techniques that engineers use for troubleshooting large-scale software systems. Over the years, many supervised, semi-supervised, and unsupervised log analysis methods have been proposed to detect system anomalies by analyzing system logs. Among these, semi-supervised methods have garnered increasing attention as they strike a balance between relaxed labeled data requirements and optimal detection performance, contrasting with their supervised and unsupervised counterparts. However, existing semi-supervised methods overlook the potential bias introduced by highly frequent log messages on the learned normal patterns, which leads to their less than satisfactory performance. In this study, we propose LogSD, a novel semi-supervised self-supervised learning approach. LogSD employs a dual-network architecture and incorporates a frequency-based masking scheme, a global-to-local reconstruction paradigm and three self-supervised learning tasks. These features enable LogSD to focus more on relatively infrequent log messages, thereby effectively learning less biased and more discriminative patterns from historical normal data. This emphasis ultimately leads to improved anomaly detection performance. Extensive experiments have been conducted on three commonly-used datasets and the results show that LogSD significantly outperforms eight state-of-the-art benchmark methods. ",

To investigate this, in this paper, we build a parallel model to illuminate and understand the internal operation of neural networks, such as the RNN, which store their internal state in order to process sequential inputs. This model is widely applicable in that it can be used with any input domain where the inputs can be represented by a Gaussian mixture. By looking at the RNN processing from a probability density function perspective, we are able to show how each layer of the RNN transforms the input distributions to increase detection accuracy. At the same time we also discover a side effect acting to limit the improvement in accuracy. To demonstrate the fidelity of the model we validate it against each stage of RNN processing as well as the output predictions. As a result, we have been able to explain the reasons for the RNN performance limits with useful insights for future designs for RNNs and similar types of neural network. ",

We first develop an alternating optimization algorithm, obtaining the active and passive beamforming vectors maximizing the sensing signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) under minimum signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) constraints for the communication users and finite power budget. We also investigate the destructive potential of RIS by devising a RIS phase-shift optimization algorithm that minimizes sensing SNR while preserving the same minimum communication SINR previously guaranteed by the system. We further investigate the impact of the RIS's individual element failures on the system performances. The simulation results show that the RIS performance-boosting potential is as good as its destructive one and that both of our optimization strategies show some resilience towards the investigated impairments.

Due to the large temporal and spatial span of data collection in change detection image pairs, there are often a significant amount of task-specific and task-agnostic noise. Previous effort has focused excessively on denoising, with this goes a great deal of loss of fine-grained information. In this paper, we revisit the importance of fine-grained features in change detection and propose a series of operations for fine-grained information compensation and noise decoupling (FINO). First, the context is utilized to compensate for the fine-grained information in the feature space. Next, a shape-aware and a brightness-aware module are designed to improve the capacity for representation learning. The shape-aware module guides the backbone for more precise shape estimation, guiding the backbone network in extracting object shape features. The brightness-aware module learns a overall brightness estimation to improve the model's robustness to task-agnostic noise. Finally, a task-specific noise decoupling structure is designed as a way to improve the model's ability to separate noise interference from feature similarity. With these training schemes, our proposed method achieves new state-of-the-art (SOTA) results in multiple change detection benchmarks. The code will be made available. ",

Human trajectories emerge as crucial cues in Social Navigation, but they are partially observable from the robot's egocentric view and computationally complex to process. We propose the first Social Dynamics Adaptation model (SDA) based on the robot's state-action history to infer the social dynamics. We propose a two-stage Reinforcement Learning framework: the first learns to encode the human trajectories into social dynamics and learns a motion policy conditioned on this encoded information, the current status, and the previous action. Here, the trajectories are fully visible, i.e., assumed as privileged information. In the second stage, the trained policy operates without direct access to trajectories. Instead, the model infers the social dynamics solely from the history of previous actions and statuses in real-time. Tested on the novel Habitat 3.0 platform, SDA sets a novel state of the art (SoA) performance in finding and following humans. ",

    "abstract": "Adverse reactions caused by drug combinations are an increasingly common phenomenon, making their accurate prediction an important challenge in modern medicine. However, the polynomial nature of this problem renders lab-based identification of adverse reactions insufficient. Dozens of computational approaches have therefore been proposed for the task in recent years, with varying degrees of success. One group of methods that has seemingly been under-utilised in this area is tensor factorisation, despite their clear applicability to this type of data. In this work, we apply three such models to a benchmark dataset in order to compare them against established techniques. We find, in contrast to previous reports, that for this task tensor factorisation models are competitive with state-of-the-art graph neural network models and we recommend that future work in this field considers cheaper methods with linear complexity before running costly deep learning processes.

    "abstract": "Key Point Analysis (KPA), the summarization of multiple arguments into a concise collection of key points, continues to be a significant and unresolved issue within the field of argument mining. Existing models adapt a two-stage pipeline of clustering arguments or generating key points for argument clusters. This approach rely on semantic similarity instead of measuring the existence of shared key points among arguments. Additionally, it only models the intra-cluster relationship among arguments, disregarding the inter-cluster relationship between arguments that do not share key points. To address these limitations, we propose a novel approach for KPA with pairwise generation and graph partitioning. Our objective is to train a generative model that can simultaneously provide a score indicating the presence of shared key point between a pair of arguments and generate the shared key point. Subsequently, to map generated redundant key points to a concise set of key points, we proceed to construct an arguments graph by considering the arguments as vertices, the generated key points as edges, and the scores as edge weights. We then propose a graph partitioning algorithm to partition all arguments sharing the same key points to the same subgraph. Notably, our experimental findings demonstrate that our proposed model surpasses previous models when evaluated on both the ArgKP and QAM datasets. ",

Specifically, based on the spectral bias property of neural networks, we first optimize the neural rendering pipeline to obtain a low-frequency scene representation. Subsequently, we jointly optimize the two modules, driven by the proposed adaptive direction-sensitive gradient-based reconstruction loss, which encourages the network to distinguish between scene details and rain streaks, facilitating the propagation of gradients to the relevant components. Extensive experiments on both the classic neural radiance field and the recently proposed 3D Gaussian splatting demonstrate the superiority of our method in effectively eliminating rain streaks and rendering clean images, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

In this paper, we evaluate three different AI text detectors-Kirchenbauer et al. watermarks, ZeroGPT, and GPTZero-against human and AI-generated essays.

In this paper, we identify shortcomings in directly applying DPMs to the task of pansharpening as an inverse problem: 1) initiating sampling directly from Gaussian noise neglects the low-resolution multispectral image (LRMS) as a prior; 2) low sampling efficiency often necessitates a higher number of sampling steps. We first reformulate pansharpening into the stochastic differential equation (SDE) form of an inverse problem. Building upon this, we propose a Schr\\\"odinger bridge matching method that addresses both issues. We design an efficient deep neural network architecture tailored for the proposed SB matching. In comparison to the well-established DL-regressive-based framework and the recent DPM framework, our method demonstrates SOTA performance with fewer sampling steps.

We propose a novel coarse-to-fine tracking model tailored for Neural Radiance Field SLAM (NeRF-SLAM) to achieve state-of-the-art tracking performance. Notably, existing NeRF-SLAM systems consistently exhibit inferior tracking performance compared to traditional SLAM algorithms. NeRF-SLAM methods solve camera tracking via image alignment and photometric bundle-adjustment. Such optimization processes are difficult to optimize due to the narrow basin of attraction of the optimization loss in image space (local minima) and the lack of initial correspondences. We mitigate these limitations by implementing a Gaussian pyramid filter on top of NeRF, facilitating a coarse-to-fine tracking optimization strategy. Furthermore, NeRF systems encounter challenges in converging to the right geometry with limited input views. While prior approaches use a Signed-Distance Function (SDF)-based NeRF and directly supervise SDF values by approximating ground truth SDF through depth measurements, this often results in suboptimal geometry. In contrast, our method employs a volume density representation and introduces a novel KL regularizer on the ray termination distribution, constraining scene geometry to consist of empty space and opaque surfaces. Our solution implements both local and global bundle-adjustment to produce a robust (coarse-to-fine) and accurate (KL regularizer) SLAM solution. We conduct experiments on multiple datasets (ScanNet, TUM, Replica) showing state-of-the-art results in tracking and in reconstruction accuracy. ",

Nevertheless, on account of their nonlinear and non-stationary nature, their short-term forecast is extremely challenging. Therefore, this dissertation raises one short-term wind speed forecast pattern on the foundation of attention with an improved gated recurrent neural network (AtGRU) and a tactic of error correction. That model uses the AtGRU model as the preliminary predictor and the GRU model as the error corrector. At the beginning, SSA (singular spectrum analysis) is employed in previous wind speed series for lessening the noise. Subsequently, historical wind speed series is going to be used for the predictor training. During this process, the prediction can have certain errors. The sequence of these errors processed by variational modal decomposition (VMD) is used to train the corrector of error. The eventual forecast consequence is just the sum of predictor forecast and error corrector. The proposed SSA-AtGRU-VMD-GRU model outperforms the compared models in three case studies on Woodburn, St. Thomas, and Santa Cruz. It is indicated that the model evidently enhances the correction of the wind speed forecast. ",

In current society, individuals frequently express negative emotions on social media on specific topics, often exhibiting cognitive distortions, including suicidal behaviors in extreme cases. Yet, there is a notable absence of methodologies for analyzing cognitive pathways that could aid psychotherapists in conducting effective interventions online. In this study, we gathered data from social media and established the task of extracting cognitive pathways, annotating the data based on a cognitive theoretical framework. We initially categorized the task of extracting cognitive pathways as a hierarchical text classification with four main categories and nineteen subcategories. Following this, we structured a text summarization task to help psychotherapists quickly grasp the essential information. Our experiments evaluate the performance of deep learning and large language models (LLMs) on these tasks. The results demonstrate that our deep learning method achieved a micro-F1 score of 62.34% in the hierarchical text classification task. Meanwhile, in the text summarization task, GPT-4 attained a Rouge-1 score of 54.92 and a Rouge-2 score of 30.86, surpassing the experimental deep learning model's performance. However, it may suffer from an issue of hallucination. We have made all models and codes publicly available to support further research in this field. ",

Due to the sensitive nature of the location data, directly sharing user trajectories suffers from privacy leakage issues. Local differential privacy (LDP), which perturbs sensitive data on the user side before it is shared or analyzed, emerges as a promising solution for private trajectory stream collection and analysis. Unfortunately, existing stream release approaches often neglect the rich spatial-temporal context information within trajectory streams, resulting in suboptimal utility and limited types of downstream applications. To this end, we propose RetraSyn, a novel real-time trajectory synthesis framework, which is able to perform on-the-fly trajectory synthesis based on the mobility patterns privately extracted from users' trajectory streams. Thus, the downstream trajectory analysis can be performed on the high-utility synthesized data with privacy protection. We also take the genuine behaviors of real-world mobile travelers into consideration, ensuring authenticity and practicality. The key components of RetraSyn include the global mobility model, dynamic mobility update mechanism, real-time synthesis, and adaptive allocation strategy. We conduct extensive experiments on multiple real-world and synthetic trajectory datasets under various location-based utility metrics, encompassing both streaming and historical scenarios. The empirical results demonstrate the superiority and versatility of our proposed framework. ",

A significant research branch in this domain focuses on user behavior modeling. Current research predominantly centers on modeling co-occurrence relationships between the target item and items previously interacted with by users in their historical data. However, this focus neglects the intricate modeling of user behavior patterns. In reality, the abundance of user interaction records encompasses diverse behavior patterns, indicative of a spectrum of habitual paradigms. These patterns harbor substantial potential to significantly enhance CTR prediction performance. To harness the informational potential within user behavior patterns, we extend Target Attention (TA) to Target Pattern Attention (TPA) to model pattern-level dependencies. Furthermore, three critical challenges demand attention: the inclusion of unrelated items within behavior patterns, data sparsity in behavior patterns, and computational complexity arising from numerous patterns. To address these challenges, we introduce the Deep Pattern Network (DPN), designed to comprehensively leverage information from user behavior patterns. DPN efficiently retrieves target-related user behavior patterns using a target-aware attention mechanism. Additionally, it contributes to refining user behavior patterns through a pre-training paradigm based on self-supervised learning while promoting dependency learning within sparse patterns. Our comprehensive experiments, conducted across three public datasets, substantiate the superior performance and broad compatibility of DPN. ",

Since most social media data originates from end users, we propose a privacy preserving decentralized architecture for identifying offensive language online by introducing Federated Learning (FL) in the context of offensive language identification. FL is a decentralized architecture that allows multiple models to be trained locally without the need for data sharing hence preserving users' privacy. We propose a model fusion approach to perform FL. We trained multiple deep learning models on four publicly available English benchmark datasets (AHSD, HASOC, HateXplain, OLID) and evaluated their performance in detail.

In this paper, we analyse EDO on a 3-objective function LOTZ$_k$, which is a modification of the 2-objective benchmark function (LeadingOnes, TrailingZeros). We prove that the GSEMO computes a set of all Pareto-optimal solutions in $O(kn^3)$ expected iterations. We also analyze the runtime of the GSEMO$_D$ (a modification of the GSEMO for diversity optimization) until it finds a population with the best possible diversity for two different diversity measures, the total imbalance and the sorted imbalances vector. For the first measure we show that the GSEMO$_D$ optimizes it asymptotically faster than it finds a Pareto-optimal population, in $O(kn^2\\log(n))$ expected iterations, and for the second measure we show an upper bound of $O(k^2n^3\\log(n))$ expected iterations. We complement our theoretical analysis with an empirical study, which shows a very similar behavior for both diversity measures that is close to the theory predictions. ",

    "abstract": "Phonetic representations are used when recording spoken languages, but no equivalent exists for recording signed languages. As a result, linguists have proposed several annotation systems that operate on the gloss or sub-unit level; however, these resources are notably irregular and scarce. Sign Language Production (SLP) aims to automatically translate spoken language sentences into continuous sequences of sign language. However, current state-of-the-art approaches rely on scarce linguistic resources to work. This has limited progress in the field. This paper introduces an innovative solution by transforming the continuous pose generation problem into a discrete sequence generation problem. Thus, overcoming the need for costly annotation. Although, if available, we leverage the additional information to enhance our approach. By applying Vector Quantisation (VQ) to sign language data, we first learn a codebook of short motions that can be combined to create a natural sequence of sign. Where each token in the codebook can be thought of as the lexicon of our representation. Then using a transformer we perform a translation from spoken language text to a sequence of codebook tokens. Each token can be directly mapped to a sequence of poses allowing the translation to be performed by a single network. Furthermore, we present a sign stitching method to effectively join tokens together. We evaluate on the RWTH-PHOENIX-Weather-2014T (PHOENIX14T) and the more challenging Meine DGS Annotated (mDGS) datasets. An extensive evaluation shows our approach outperforms previous methods, increasing the BLEU-1 back translation score by up to 72%. ",

It ensures that individuals are free to engage in discussions, participate in groups, and form relationships online or offline without fear of their data being inappropriately harvested, analyzed, or otherwise used to harm them. Preserving privacy has emerged as a critical factor in research, particularly in the computational social science (CSS), artificial intelligence (AI) and data science domains, given their reliance on individuals' data for novel insights. The increasing use of advanced computational models stands to exacerbate privacy concerns because, if inappropriately used, they can quickly infringe privacy rights and lead to adverse effects for individuals - especially vulnerable groups - and society. We have already witnessed a host of privacy issues emerge with the advent of large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, which further demonstrate the importance of embedding privacy from the start. This article contributes to the field by discussing the role of privacy and the primary issues that researchers working in CSS, AI, data science and related domains are likely to face. It then presents several key considerations for researchers to ensure participant privacy is best preserved in their research design, data collection and use, analysis, and dissemination of research results.

    "abstract": "Multi-behavioral recommender systems have emerged as a solution to address data sparsity and cold-start issues by incorporating auxiliary behaviors alongside target behaviors. However, existing models struggle to accurately capture varying user preferences across different behaviors and fail to account for diverse item preferences within behaviors. Various user preference factors (such as price or quality) entangled in the behavior may lead to sub-optimization problems. Furthermore, these models overlook the personalized nature of user behavioral preferences by employing uniform transformation networks for all users and items. To tackle these challenges, we propose the Disentangled Cascaded Graph Convolutional Network (Disen-CGCN), a novel multi-behavior recommendation model. Disen-CGCN employs disentangled representation techniques to effectively separate factors within user and item representations, ensuring their independence. In addition, it incorporates a multi-behavioral meta-network, enabling personalized feature transformation across user and item behaviors. Furthermore, an attention mechanism captures user preferences for different item factors within each behavior. By leveraging attention weights, we aggregate user and item embeddings separately for each behavior, computing preference scores that predict overall user preferences for items. Our evaluation on benchmark datasets demonstrates the superiority of Disen-CGCN over state-of-the-art models, showcasing an average performance improvement of 7.07% and 9.00% on respective datasets. These results highlight Disen-CGCN's ability to effectively leverage multi-behavioral data, leading to more accurate recommendations. ",

    "abstract": "Sign languages, often categorised as low-resource languages, face significant challenges in achieving accurate translation due to the scarcity of parallel annotated datasets. This paper introduces Select and Reorder (S&R), a novel approach that addresses data scarcity by breaking down the translation process into two distinct steps: Gloss Selection (GS) and Gloss Reordering (GR). Our method leverages large spoken language models and the substantial lexical overlap between source spoken languages and target sign languages to establish an initial alignment. Both steps make use of Non-AutoRegressive (NAR) decoding for reduced computation and faster inference speeds. Through this disentanglement of tasks, we achieve state-of-the-art BLEU and Rouge scores on the Meine DGS Annotated (mDGS) dataset, demonstrating a substantial BLUE-1 improvement of 37.88% in Text to Gloss (T2G) Translation. This innovative approach paves the way for more effective translation models for sign languages, even in resource-constrained settings. ",

By conducting extensive experiments, we show that GenFighter outperforms state-of-the-art defenses in accuracy under attack and attack success rate metrics. Additionally, it requires a high number of queries per attack, making the attack more challenging in real scenarios. The ablation study shows that our approach integrates transfer learning, a generative/evolutive procedure, and an ensemble method, providing an effective defense against NLP adversarial attacks. ",

    "abstract": "We consider a two-person network inspection game, in which a defender positions a limited number of detectors to detect multiple attacks caused by an attacker. We assume that detection is imperfect, and each detector location is associated with a probability of detecting attacks within its set of monitored network components. The objective of the defender (resp. attacker) is to minimize (resp. maximize) the expected number of undetected attacks. To compute Nash Equilibria (NE) for this large-scale zero-sum game, we formulate a linear program with a small number of constraints, which we solve via column generation. We provide an exact mixed-integer program for the pricing problem, which entails computing a defender's pure best response, and leverage its supermodular structure to derive two efficient approaches to obtain approximate NE with theoretical guarantees: A column generation and a multiplicative weights update (MWU) algorithm with approximate best responses. To address the computational challenges posed by combinatorial attacker strategies, each iteration of our MWU algorithm requires computing a projection under the unnormalized relative entropy. We provide a closed-form solution and a linear-time algorithm for the projection problem. Our computational results in real-world gas distribution networks illustrate the performance and scalability of our solution approaches. ",

Practitioners have observed a strong relationship between model size, dataset size, and performance. However, structure-based architectures such as Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are yet to show the benefits of scale mainly due to the lower efficiency of sparse operations, large data requirements, and lack of clarity about the effectiveness of various architectures. We address this drawback of GNNs by studying their scaling behavior. Specifically, we analyze message-passing networks, graph Transformers, and hybrid architectures on the largest public collection of 2D molecular graphs. For the first time, we observe that GNNs benefit tremendously from the increasing scale of depth, width, number of molecules, number of labels, and the diversity in the pretraining datasets, resulting in a 30.25% improvement when scaling to 1 billion parameters and 28.98% improvement when increasing size of dataset to eightfold. We further demonstrate strong finetuning scaling behavior on 38 tasks, outclassing previous large models. We hope that our work paves the way for an era where foundational GNNs drive pharmaceutical drug discovery. ",

    "abstract": "Stochastic video prediction enables the consideration of uncertainty in future motion, thereby providing a better reflection of the dynamic nature of the environment. Stochastic video prediction methods based on image auto-regressive recurrent models need to feed their predictions back into the latent space. Conversely, the state-space models, which decouple frame synthesis and temporal prediction, proves to be more efficient. However, inferring long-term temporal information about motion and generalizing to dynamic scenarios under non-stationary assumptions remains an unresolved challenge. In this paper, we propose a state-space decomposition stochastic video prediction model that decomposes the overall video frame generation into deterministic appearance prediction and stochastic motion prediction. Through adaptive decomposition, the model's generalization capability to dynamic scenarios is enhanced. In the context of motion prediction, obtaining a prior on the long-term trend of future motion is crucial. Thus, in the stochastic motion prediction branch, we infer the long-term motion trend from conditional frames to guide the generation of future frames that exhibit high consistency with the conditional frames. Experimental results demonstrate that our model outperforms baselines on multiple datasets. ",

In this work, we describe our design goals for EDGE and walk through the extensions we add to Einsums to support more complex operations common in graph algorithms. Additionally, we provide a few examples of how to express graph algorithms in our proposed notation. We hope that a single, mathematical notation for graph algorithms will (1) allow researchers to more easily compare different algorithms and different implementations of a graph algorithm; (2) enable developers to factor complexity by separating the concerns of what to compute (described with the extended Einsum notation) from the lower level details of how to compute; and (3) enable the discovery of different algorithmic variants of a problem through algebraic manipulations and transformations on a given EDGE expression.

This paper addresses the problem of finding a cost-effective CRP (the CRP problem). First, we introduce a novel community state evolutionary model and, thereby, establish an optimal control model for the CRP problem (the CRP model). Second, based on the optimality system for the CRP model, we present an iterative algorithm for solving the CRP model (the CRP algorithm). Thirdly, through extensive numerical experiments, we conclude that the CRP algorithm converges and the resulting CRP exhibits excellent cost benefit. Consequently, we recommend the resulting CRP to companies that embrace product co-creation. Next, we discuss how to implement the resulting CRP. Finally, we investigate the effect of some factors on the cost benefit of the resulting CRP. To our knowledge, this work is the first attempt to study value co-creation through optimal control theoretic approach. ",

Classical force field methods often rely on insufficient local energy minimization, while neural network force field models require large labeled datasets encompassing both equilibrium and non-equilibrium structures. As a remedy, we propose MoreRed, molecular relaxation by reverse diffusion, a conceptually novel and purely statistical approach where non-equilibrium structures are treated as noisy instances of their corresponding equilibrium states. To enable the denoising of arbitrarily noisy inputs via a generative diffusion model, we further introduce a novel diffusion time step predictor. Notably, MoreRed learns a simpler pseudo potential energy surface instead of the complex physical potential energy surface. It is trained on a significantly smaller, and thus computationally cheaper, dataset consisting of solely unlabeled equilibrium structures, avoiding the computation of non-equilibrium structures altogether. We compare MoreRed to classical force fields, equivariant neural network force fields trained on a large dataset of equilibrium and non-equilibrium data, as well as a semi-empirical tight-binding model. To assess this quantitatively, we evaluate the root-mean-square deviation between the found equilibrium structures and the reference equilibrium structures as well as their DFT energies. ",

First, we show that the straightforward implementation of a projected clipped SGD (PCSGD) algorithm may converge to a biased solution compared to the performative stable solution. We quantify the lower and upper bound for the magnitude of the bias and demonstrate a bias amplification phenomenon where the bias grows with the sensitivity of the data distribution. Second, we suggest two remedies to the bias amplification effect. The first one utilizes an optimal step size design for PCSGD that takes the privacy guarantee into account. The second one uses the recently proposed DiceSGD algorithm [Zhang et al., 2024]. We show that the latter can successfully remove the bias and converge to the performative stable solution.

Yet, detecting these lesions remains a challenging task as these lesions vary significantly in their size, shape, texture, and contrast with respect to surrounding tissue. Therefore, radiologists need to have an extensive experience to be able to identify and detect these lesions. Segmentation-based neural networks can assist radiologists with this task. Current state-of-the-art lesion segmentation networks use the encoder-decoder design paradigm based on the UNet architecture where the multi-phase CT scan volume is fed to the network as a multi-channel input. Although this approach utilizes information from all the phases and outperform single-phase segmentation networks, we demonstrate that their performance is not optimal and can be further improved by incorporating the learning from models trained on each single-phase individually. Our approach comprises three stages. The first stage identifies the regions within the liver where there might be lesions at three different scales (4, 8, and 16 mm). The second stage includes the main segmentation model trained using all the phases as well as a segmentation model trained on each of the phases individually. The third stage uses the multi-phase CT volumes together with the predictions from each of the segmentation models to generate the final segmentation map. Overall, our approach improves relative liver lesion segmentation performance by 1.6% while reducing performance variability across subjects by 8% when compared to the current state-of-the-art models.

    "title": "Toward Understanding the Disagreement Problem in Neural Network Feature  Attribution",
    "abstract": "In recent years, neural networks have demonstrated their remarkable ability to discern intricate patterns and relationships from raw data. However, understanding the inner workings of these black box models remains challenging, yet crucial for high-stake decisions. Among the prominent approaches for explaining these black boxes are feature attribution methods, which assign relevance or contribution scores to each input variable for a model prediction. Despite the plethora of proposed techniques, ranging from gradient-based to backpropagation-based methods, a significant debate persists about which method to use. Various evaluation metrics have been proposed to assess the trustworthiness or robustness of their results. However, current research highlights disagreement among state-of-the-art methods in their explanations. Our work addresses this confusion by investigating the explanations' fundamental and distributional behavior. Additionally, through a comprehensive simulation study, we illustrate the impact of common scaling and encoding techniques on the explanation quality, assess their efficacy across different effect sizes, and demonstrate the origin of inconsistency in rank-based evaluation metrics.

    "abstract": "The $d$-Cut problem is to decide if a graph has an edge cut such that each vertex has at most $d$ neighbours at the opposite side of the cut. If $d=1$, we obtain the intensively studied Matching Cut problem. The $d$-Cut problem has been studied as well, but a systematic study for special graph classes was lacking. We initiate such a study and consider classes of bounded diameter, bounded radius and $H$-free graphs. We prove that for all $d\\geq 2$, $d$-Cut is polynomial-time solvable for graphs of diameter $2$, $(P_3+P_4)$-free graphs and $P_5$-free graphs. These results extend known results for $d=1$. However, we also prove several NP-hardness results for $d$-Cut that contrast known polynomial-time results for $d=1$. Our results lead to full dichotomies for bounded diameter and bounded radius and to almost-complete dichotomies for $H$-free graphs. ",

    "abstract": "Estimating the sound absorption in situ relies on accurately describing the measured sound field. Evidence suggests that modeling the reflection of impinging spherical waves is important, especially for compact measurement systems. This article proposes a method for estimating the sound absorption coefficient of a material sample by mapping the sound pressure, measured by a microphone array, to a distribution of monopoles along a line in the complex plane. The proposed method is compared to modeling the sound field as a superposition of two sources (a monopole and an image source). The obtained inverse problems are solved with Tikhonov regularization, with automatic choice of the regularization parameter by the L-curve criterion. The sound absorption measurement is tested with simulations of the sound field above infinite and finite porous absorbers. The approaches are compared to the plane-wave absorption coefficient and the one obtained by spherical wave incidence. Experimental analysis of two porous samples and one resonant absorber is also carried out in situ. Four arrays were tested with an increasing aperture and number of sensors. It was demonstrated that measurements are feasible even with an array with only a few microphones. The discretization of the integral equation led to a more accurate reconstruction of the sound pressure and particle velocity at the sample's surface. The resulting absorption coefficient agrees with the one obtained for spherical wave incidence, indicating that including more monopoles along the complex line is an essential feature of the sound field.

    "abstract": "Urban highways are common, especially in the US, making cities more car-centric. They promise the annihilation of distance but obstruct pedestrian mobility, thus playing a key role in limiting social interactions locally. Although this limiting role is widely acknowledged in urban studies, the quantitative relationship between urban highways and social ties is barely tested. Here we define a Barrier Score that relates massive, geolocated online social network data to highways in the 50 largest US cities. At the unprecedented granularity of individual social ties, we show that urban highways are associated with decreased social connectivity. This barrier effect is especially strong for short distances and consistent with historical cases of highways that were built to purposefully disrupt or isolate Black neighborhoods. By combining spatial infrastructure with social tie data, our method adds a new dimension to demographic studies of social segregation. Our study can inform reparative planning for an evidence-based reduction of spatial inequality, and more generally, support a better integration of the social fabric in urban planning. ",
