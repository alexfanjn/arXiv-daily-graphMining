In this work, we present ApproxDARTS, a neural architecture search (NAS) method enabling the popular differentiable neural architecture search method called DARTS to exploit approximate multipliers and thus reduce the power consumption of generated neural networks. We showed on the CIFAR-10 data set that the ApproxDARTS is able to perform a complete architecture search within less than $10$ GPU hours and produce competitive convolutional neural networks (CNN) containing approximate multipliers in convolutional layers. For example, ApproxDARTS created a CNN showing an energy consumption reduction of (a) $53.84\\%$ in the arithmetic operations of the inference phase compared to the CNN utilizing the native $32$-bit floating-point multipliers and (b) $5.97\\%$ compared to the CNN utilizing the exact $8$-bit fixed-point multipliers, in both cases with a negligible accuracy drop. Moreover, the ApproxDARTS is $2.3\\times$ faster than a similar but evolutionary algorithm-based method called EvoApproxNAS. ",

    "abstract": "As a vital component in autonomous driving, accurate trajectory prediction effectively prevents traffic accidents and improves driving efficiency. To capture complex spatial-temporal dynamics and social interactions, recent studies developed models based on advanced deep-learning methods. On the other hand, recent studies have explored the use of deep generative models to further account for trajectory uncertainties. However, the current approaches demonstrating indeterminacy involve inefficient and time-consuming practices such as sampling from trained models. To fill this gap, we proposed a novel model named Graph Recurrent Attentive Neural Process (GRANP) for vehicle trajectory prediction while efficiently quantifying prediction uncertainty. In particular, GRANP contains an encoder with deterministic and latent paths, and a decoder for prediction. The encoder, including stacked Graph Attention Networks, LSTM and 1D convolutional layers, is employed to extract spatial-temporal relationships. The decoder is used to learn a latent distribution and thus quantify prediction uncertainty. To reveal the effectiveness of our model, we evaluate the performance of GRANP on the highD dataset. Extensive experiments show that GRANP achieves state-of-the-art results and can efficiently quantify uncertainties. Additionally, we undertake an intuitive case study that showcases the interpretability of the proposed approach. The code is available at https://github.com/joy-driven/GRANP. ",

We show that for the task of code summarization, the performance of these models on individual examples often depends on the amount of (subword) token overlap between the code and the corresponding reference natural language descriptions in the dataset. This token overlap arises because the reference descriptions in standard datasets (corresponding to docstrings in large code bases) are often highly similar to the names of the functions they describe. We also show that this token overlap occurs largely in the function names of the code and compare the relative performance of these models after removing function names versus removing code structure. We also show that using multiple evaluation metrics like BLEU and BERTScore gives us very little additional insight since these metrics are highly correlated with each other. ",

    "abstract": "Trajectory similarity search plays an essential role in autonomous driving, as it enables vehicles to analyze the information and characteristics of different trajectories to make informed decisions and navigate safely in dynamic environments. Existing work on the trajectory similarity search task primarily utilizes sequence-processing algorithms or Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), which suffer from the inevitable issues of complicated architecture and heavy training costs. Considering the intricate connections between trajectories, using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for data modeling is feasible. However, most methods directly use existing mathematical graph structures as the input instead of constructing specific graphs from certain vehicle trajectory data. This ignores such data's unique and dynamic characteristics. To bridge such a research gap, we propose VeTraSS -- an end-to-end pipeline for Vehicle Trajectory Similarity Search. Specifically, VeTraSS models the original trajectory data into multi-scale graphs, and generates comprehensive embeddings through a novel multi-layer attention-based GNN. The learned embeddings can be used for searching similar vehicle trajectories. Extensive experiments on the Porto and Geolife datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of VeTraSS, where our model outperforms existing work and reaches the state-of-the-art. This demonstrates the potential of VeTraSS for trajectory analysis and safe navigation in self-driving vehicles in the real world. ",

Nevertheless, existing methods have not fully utilized the inherent hierarchical structure within both whole slide images (WSIs) and transcriptomic data, from which better intra-modal representations and inter-modal integration could be derived. Moreover, many existing studies attempt to improve multi-modal representations through attention mechanisms, which inevitably lead to high complexity when processing high-dimensional WSIs and transcriptomic data. Recently, a structured state space model named Mamba emerged as a promising approach for its superior performance in modeling long sequences with low complexity. In this study, we propose Mamba with multi-grained multi-modal interaction (SurvMamba) for survival prediction. SurvMamba is implemented with a Hierarchical Interaction Mamba (HIM) module that facilitates efficient intra-modal interactions at different granularities, thereby capturing more detailed local features as well as rich global representations. In addition, an Interaction Fusion Mamba (IFM) module is used for cascaded inter-modal interactive fusion, yielding more comprehensive features for survival prediction. Comprehensive evaluations on five TCGA datasets demonstrate that SurvMamba outperforms other existing methods in terms of performance and computational cost. ",

Despite its recognized advantages, FL encounters obstacles linked to statistical data heterogeneity and labeled data scarcity during the training of single-task models for machine learning-based traffic classification, leading to hindered learning performance. In response to these challenges, adopting a hard-parameter sharing multi-task learning model with auxiliary tasks proves to be a suitable approach. Such a model has the capability to reduce communication and computation costs, navigate statistical complexities inherent in FL contexts, and overcome labeled data scarcity by leveraging knowledge derived from interconnected auxiliary tasks. This paper introduces a new framework for federated auxiliary hard-parameter sharing multi-task learning, namely, FedAuxHMTL. The introduced framework incorporates model parameter exchanges between edge server and base stations, enabling base stations from distributed areas to participate in the FedAuxHMTL process and enhance the learning performance of the main task-network edge traffic classification. Empirical experiments are conducted to validate and demonstrate the FedAuxHMTL's effectiveness in terms of accuracy, total global loss, communication costs, computing time, and energy consumption compared to its counterparts.

By fostering new levels of automation, efficiency, and predictive maintenance, IIoT is transforming traditional industries into intelligent, seamlessly interconnected ecosystems. However, achieving highly reliable IIoT can be hindered by factors such as the cost of installing large numbers of sensors, limitations in retrofitting existing systems with sensors, or harsh environmental conditions that may make sensor installation impractical. Soft (virtual) sensing leverages mathematical models to estimate variables from physical sensor data, offering a solution to these challenges. Data-driven and physics-based modeling are the two main methodologies widely used for soft sensing. The choice between these strategies depends on the complexity of the underlying system, with the data-driven approach often being preferred when the physics-based inference models are intricate and present challenges for state estimation. However, conventional deep learning models are typically hindered by their inability to explicitly represent the complex interactions among various sensors. To address this limitation, we adopt Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), renowned for their ability to effectively capture the complex relationships between sensor measurements. In this research, we propose physics-enhanced GNNs, which integrate principles of physics into graph-based methodologies. This is achieved by augmenting additional nodes in the input graph derived from the underlying characteristics of the physical processes. Our evaluation of the proposed methodology on the case study of district heating networks reveals significant improvements over purely data-driven GNNs, even in the presence of noise and parameter inaccuracies.

These include the high-dimensionality of the data, high codimension in the ambient space of the data manifolds of interest, and that the structure of machine learning models may encourage classifiers to develop decision boundaries close to data points. This article proposes a new framework for studying adversarial examples that does not depend directly on the distance to the decision boundary. Similarly to the smoothed classifier literature, we define a (natural or adversarial) data point to be $(\\gamma,\\sigma)$-stable if the probability of the same classification is at least $\\gamma$ for points sampled in a Gaussian neighborhood of the point with a given standard deviation $\\sigma$. We focus on studying the differences between persistence metrics along interpolants of natural and adversarial points. We show that adversarial examples have significantly lower persistence than natural examples for large neural networks in the context of the MNIST and ImageNet datasets. We connect this lack of persistence with decision boundary geometry by measuring angles of interpolants with respect to decision boundaries. Finally, we connect this approach with robustness by developing a manifold alignment gradient metric and demonstrating the increase in robustness that can be achieved when training with the addition of this metric.

Second, we propose a new active learning method called SQBC based on the \"Query-by-Comittee\" approach. The key idea is to use LLM-generated synthetic data as an oracle to identify the most informative unlabelled samples, that are selected for manual labelling.

Conventional full-order models based on the Navier-Stokes equations are unsuitable, and sophisticated model reduction methods may be ineffective for accurately predicting far-field noise in environments with seamounts and significant variations in bathymetry. Recent advances in reduced-order models, particularly those based on convolutional and recurrent neural networks, offer a faster and more accurate alternative. These models use convolutional neural networks to reduce data dimensions effectively. However, current deep-learning models face challenges in predicting wave propagation over long periods and for remote locations, often relying on auto-regressive prediction and lacking far-field bathymetry information. This research aims to improve the accuracy of deep-learning models for predicting underwater radiated noise in far-field scenarios. We propose a novel range-conditional convolutional neural network that incorporates ocean bathymetry data into the input. By integrating this architecture into a continual learning framework, we aim to generalize the model for varying bathymetry worldwide. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we analyze our model on several test cases and a benchmark scenario involving far-field prediction over Dickin's seamount in the Northeast Pacific. Our proposed architecture effectively captures transmission loss over a range-dependent, varying bathymetry profile. This architecture can be integrated into an adaptive management system for underwater radiated noise, providing real-time end-to-end mapping between near-field ship noise sources and received noise at the marine mammal's location.

Here, we use extensive registry data -- including PCR test results and population-level networks -- to investigate the impact of school, family, and other social contacts on SARS-CoV-2 transmission in the Netherlands (June 2020--October 2021). We isolate and compare different contexts of potential SARS-CoV-2 transmission by matching pairs of students based on their attendance at the same or different primary school (in 2020) and secondary school (in 2021) and their geographic proximity. We then calculated the probability of temporally associated infections -- i.e. the probability of both students testing positive within a 14-day period. Our results highlight the relative importance of household and family transmission in the spread of SARS-CoV-2 compared to school settings. The probability of temporally associated infections for siblings and parent-child pairs living in the same household was 22.6--23.2\\%, and 4.7--7.9\\% for family members living in different household. In contrast, the probability of temporally associated infections was 0.52\\% for pairs of students living nearby but not attending the same primary or secondary school, 0.66\\% for pairs attending different secondary schools but having attended the same primary school, and 1.65\\% for pairs attending the same secondary school. Finally, we used multilevel regression analyses to examine how individual, school, and geographic factors contribute to transmission risk. We found that the largest differences in transmission probabilities were due to unobserved individual (60\\%) and school-level (34\\%) factors. Only a small proportion (3\\%) could be attributed to geographic proximity of students or to school size, denomination, or the median income of the school area. ",

    "abstract": "The demand-side control of district heating networks is notoriously challenging due to the large number of connected users and the high number of states to be considered. To overcome these challenges, this paper presents a hierarchical optimization scheme using the flexibility in heating demand provided by the users to improve the performance of the network. This hierarchical scheme relies on a low level controller to calculate the costs for a subsystem over a given set of potential pressure drops for that subsystem. The high level controller then uses these calculated costs to determine the optimal set of pressure drops for every subgraph of the partitioned network. The proposed hierarchical optimization scheme is demonstrated on a representative 20 user district heating network, resulting in a 67\\% reduction in bypass mass flow while ensuring all network users stay within 2 \\degree C of their desired nominal temperatures.

    "abstract": "The prediction of intrinsic disorder regions has significant implications for understanding protein function, structure, and dynamics. It can help to discover novel functions or protein-protein interactions essential to designing new drugs, therapies, or enzymes. Recently, a new generation of predictors based on protein language models is emerging. These algorithms reach state-of-the-art accuracy without calculating time-consuming multiple sequence alignments (MSAs). The article pre-sents a new protein intrinsic disorder predictor DisorderUnetLM based on the Attention U-Net convolutional neural network using features from the protein language model ProtTrans. DisorderUnetLM shows top results in the direct comparison with flDPnn and IDP-CRF predictors using MSAs and with the SETH predictor using features from the same ProtTrans model. Moreover, among 41 predictors from the latest Critical Assessment of Protein Intrinsic Disorder Prediction (CAID-2) benchmark, it ranks 9th for the Disorder-PDB subset (with ROC-AUC of 0.924) and 1st for the Disorder-NOX subset (with ROC-AUC of 0.844) which confirms its potential to perform well in the upcoming CAID-3 challenge for which Disor-derUnetLM was submitted.

    "abstract": "Single-step adversarial training (SSAT) has demonstrated the potential to achieve both efficiency and robustness. However, SSAT suffers from catastrophic overfitting (CO), a phenomenon that leads to a severely distorted classifier, making it vulnerable to multi-step adversarial attacks. In this work, we observe that some adversarial examples generated on the SSAT-trained network exhibit anomalous behaviour, that is, although these training samples are generated by the inner maximization process, their associated loss decreases instead, which we named abnormal adversarial examples (AAEs). Upon further analysis, we discover a close relationship between AAEs and classifier distortion, as both the number and outputs of AAEs undergo a significant variation with the onset of CO. Given this observation, we re-examine the SSAT process and uncover that before the occurrence of CO, the classifier already displayed a slight distortion, indicated by the presence of few AAEs. Furthermore, the classifier directly optimizing these AAEs will accelerate its distortion, and correspondingly, the variation of AAEs will sharply increase as a result. In such a vicious circle, the classifier rapidly becomes highly distorted and manifests as CO within a few iterations. These observations motivate us to eliminate CO by hindering the generation of AAEs. Specifically, we design a novel method, termed Abnormal Adversarial Examples Regularization (AAER), which explicitly regularizes the variation of AAEs to hinder the classifier from becoming distorted. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method can effectively eliminate CO and further boost adversarial robustness with negligible additional computational overhead. ",

In particular, industry settings like healthcare, require high precision and high flexibility to navigate differently based on the conversation history and dialogue states. This makes it both more challenging and more critical to accurately detect dialog breakdown. To accurately detect breakdown, we found it requires processing audio inputs along with downstream NLP model inferences on transcribed text in real time.

Here we present a new evolutionary algorithm structure that utilizes a reinforcement learning-based agent aimed at addressing these issues. The agent employs a double deep q-network to choose a specific evolutionary operator based on feedback it receives from the environment during optimization. The algorithm's structure contains five single-objective evolutionary algorithm operators. This single-objective structure is transformed into a multi-objective one using the R2 indicator. This indicator serves two purposes within our structure: first, it renders the algorithm multi-objective, and second, provides a means to evaluate each algorithm's performance in each generation to facilitate constructing the reinforcement learning-based reward function. The proposed R2-reinforcement learning multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (R2-RLMOEA) is compared with six other multi-objective algorithms that are based on R2 indicators. These six algorithms include the operators used in R2-RLMOEA as well as an R2 indicator-based algorithm that randomly selects operators during optimization. We benchmark performance using the CEC09 functions, with performance measured by inverted generational distance and spacing. The R2-RLMOEA algorithm outperforms all other algorithms with strong statistical significance (p<0.001) when compared with the average spacing metric across all ten benchmarks. ",

    "abstract": "We study comparison sorting in the evolving data model [AKMU11], where the true total order changes while the sorting algorithm is processing the input. More precisely, each comparison operation of the algorithm is followed by a sequence of evolution steps, where an evolution step perturbs the rank of a random item by a \"small\" random value. The goal is to maintain an ordering that remains close to the true order over time. Previous works have analyzed adaptations of classic sorting algorithms, assuming that an evolution step changes the rank of an item by just one, and that a fixed constant number $b$ of evolution steps take place between two comparisons. In fact, the only previous result achieving optimal $O(n)$ total deviation from the true order, where $n$ is the number of items, applies just for $b=1$ [BDEGJ18]. We analyze a very simple sorting algorithm suggested in [M14], which samples a random pair of adjacent items in each step and swaps them if they are out of order. We show that the algorithm achieves and maintains, w.h.p., optimal total deviation, $O(n)$, and optimal maximum deviation, $O(\\log n)$, under very general model settings. Namely, the perturbation introduced by each evolution step follows a distribution of bounded moment generating function, and over a linear number of steps, on average the number of evolution steps between two sorting steps is bounded by an arbitrary constant. Our proof consists of a novel potential function argument that inserts \"gaps\" in the list of items, and a general framework which separates the analysis of sorting from that of the evolution steps, and is applicable to a variety of settings for which previous approaches do not apply. Our results settle conjectures by [AKMU11] and [M14], and provide theoretical support for the empirical evidence that simple quadratic algorithms are optimal and robust for sorting evolving data [BDEGJ18].

We consider a bi-objective formulation that maximises expected profit and minimises variance, which allows optimising the problem independent of a specific confidence level on the profit. We derive a three-objective formulation by relaxing the weight constraint into an additional objective. We consider the GSEMO algorithm with standard and a sliding window-based parent selection to evaluate the objective formulations. Moreover, we modify fitness formulations and algorithms for the dynamic problem variant to store some infeasible solutions to cater to future changes. We conduct experimental investigations on both problems using the proposed problem formulations and algorithms.

    "abstract": "Multivariate Time Series (MTS) anomaly detection focuses on pinpointing samples that diverge from standard operational patterns, which is crucial for ensuring the safety and security of industrial applications. The primary challenge in this domain is to develop representations capable of discerning anomalies effectively. The prevalent methods for anomaly detection in the literature are predominantly reconstruction-based and predictive in nature. However, they typically concentrate on a single-dimensional instance level, thereby not fully harnessing the complex associations inherent in industrial MTS. To address this issue, we propose a novel self-supervised hierarchical contrastive consistency learning method for detecting anomalies in MTS, named HCL-MTSAD. It innovatively leverages data consistency at multiple levels inherent in industrial MTS, systematically capturing consistent associations across four latent levels-measurement, sample, channel, and process. By developing a multi-layer contrastive loss, HCL-MTSAD can extensively mine data consistency and spatio-temporal association, resulting in more informative representations. Subsequently, an anomaly discrimination module, grounded in self-supervised hierarchical contrastive learning, is designed to detect timestamp-level anomalies by calculating multi-scale data consistency. Extensive experiments conducted on six diverse MTS datasets retrieved from real cyber-physical systems and server machines, in comparison with 20 baselines, indicate that HCL-MTSAD's anomaly detection capability outperforms the state-of-the-art benchmark models by an average of 1.8\\% in terms of F1 score.

In this context, Kempe et al. \\cite{kempe2003maximizing} introduced the Influence Maximization (IM) problem, which identifies $k$ most influential nodes (spreader nodes), such that the maximum number of people in the network adopts the promotional message. Many variants of the IM problem have been studied in the literature, namely, Perfect Evangelising Set (PES), Perfect Awareness Problem (PAP), etc. In this work, we propose a maximization version of PAP called the \\IM{} problem. Different people have different levels of interest in a particular product. This is modeled by assigning an interest value to each node in the network. Then, the problem is to select $k$ initial spreaders such that the sum of the interest values of the people (nodes) who become aware of the message is maximized. We study the \\IM{} problem under two popular diffusion models: the Linear Threshold Model (LTM) and the Independent Cascade Model (ICM). We show that the \\IM{} problem is NP-Hard under LTM. We give linear programming formulation for the problem under LTM.

The first module, an interpretable dense registration module, establishes a Vision Transformer (ViT)-based Siamese Network to capture long-range dependencies and the global context in fingerprint pairs. It provides interpretable dense pixel-wise correspondences of feature points for fingerprint alignment and enhances the interpretability in the subsequent matching stage. The second module takes into account both local and global representations of the aligned fingerprint pair to achieve an interpretable fixed-length representation extraction and matching. It employs the ViTs trained in the first module with the additional fully connected layer and retrains them to simultaneously produce the discriminative fixed-length representation and interpretable dense pixel-wise correspondences of feature points. Extensive experimental results on diverse publicly available fingerprint databases demonstrate that the proposed framework not only exhibits superior performance on dense registration and matching but also significantly promotes the interpretability in deep fixed-length representations-based fingerprint matching.

We further show that \"density restrictions\" based on sparse structure-from-motion points can help greatly improve geometric accuracy with a slight drop in novel view synthesis metrics. Our experiments show 4x the performance of RegNeRF and 8x that of FreeNeRF on average F1@2cm for ETH3D MVS benchmark, suggesting a fruitful research direction to improve the geometric accuracy of NeRF-based models, and sheds light on a potential future approach to enable NeRF-based optimization to eventually outperform traditional MVS.

    "abstract": "Segment Anything Models (SAM) have made significant advancements in image segmentation, allowing users to segment target portions of an image with a single click (i.e., user prompt). Given its broad applications, the robustness of SAM against adversarial attacks is a critical concern. While recent works have explored adversarial attacks against a pre-defined prompt/click, their threat model is not yet realistic: (1) they often assume the user-click position is known to the attacker (point-based attack), and (2) they often operate under a white-box setting with limited transferability. In this paper, we propose a more practical region-level attack where attackers do not need to know the precise user prompt. The attack remains effective as the user clicks on any point on the target object in the image, hiding the object from SAM. Also, by adapting a spectrum transformation method, we make the attack more transferable under a black-box setting. Both control experiments and testing against real-world SAM services confirm its effectiveness. ",

    "abstract": "Machine Translation has made impressive progress in recent years offering close to human-level performance on many languages, but studies have primarily focused on high-resource languages with broad online presence and resources. With the help of growing Large Language Models, more and more low-resource languages achieve better results through the presence of other languages. However, studies have shown that not all low-resource languages can benefit from multilingual systems, especially those with insufficient training and evaluation data. In this paper, we revisit state-of-the-art Neural Machine Translation techniques to develop automatic translation systems between German and Bavarian. We investigate conditions of low-resource languages such as data scarcity and parameter sensitivity and focus on refined solutions that combat low-resource difficulties and creative solutions such as harnessing language similarity. Our experiment entails applying Back-translation and Transfer Learning to automatically generate more training data and achieve higher translation performance. We demonstrate noisiness in the data and present our approach to carry out text preprocessing extensively. Evaluation was conducted using combined metrics: BLEU, chrF and TER. Statistical significance results with Bonferroni correction show surprisingly high baseline systems, and that Back-translation leads to significant improvement. Furthermore, we present a qualitative analysis of translation errors and system limitations. ",

The challenge of encouraging mobile edge devices to participate zealously in FL model training procedures, while mitigating the privacy leakage risks during wireless transmission, remains comparatively unexplored so far. In this paper, we propose a novel approach, named QI-DPFL (Quality-Aware and Incentive-Boosted Federated Learning with Differential Privacy), to address the aforementioned intractable issue. To select clients with high-quality datasets, we first propose a quality-aware client selection mechanism based on the Earth Mover's Distance (EMD) metric. Furthermore, to attract high-quality data contributors, we design an incentive-boosted mechanism that constructs the interactions between the central server and the selected clients as a two-stage Stackelberg game, where the central server designs the time-dependent reward to minimize its cost by considering the trade-off between accuracy loss and total reward allocated, and each selected client decides the privacy budget to maximize its utility. The Nash Equilibrium of the Stackelberg game is derived to find the optimal solution in each global iteration. The extensive experimental results on different real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed FL framework, by realizing the goal of privacy protection and incentive compatibility.

In recent years, Graph Neural Network (GNN) based solutions have achieved state-of-the-art performance.

Moreover, these methods statically initialize node embedding before training, which, in turn, limits the ability to learn from message texts and relations simultaneously. In this paper, we approach social event detection from a new perspective based on Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs), and present RPLM_SED (Relational prompt-based Pre-trained Language Models for Social Event Detection). We first propose a new pairwise message modeling strategy to construct social messages into message pairs with multi-relational sequences. Secondly, a new multi-relational prompt-based pairwise message learning mechanism is proposed to learn more comprehensive message representation from message pairs with multi-relational prompts using PLMs. Thirdly, we design a new clustering constraint to optimize the encoding process by enhancing intra-cluster compactness and inter-cluster dispersion, making the message representation more distinguishable. We evaluate the RPLM_SED on three real-world datasets, demonstrating that the RPLM_SED model achieves state-of-the-art performance in offline, online, low-resource, and long-tail distribution scenarios for social event detection tasks.

    "abstract": "Adversarial attacks induce misclassification by introducing subtle perturbations. Recently, diffusion models are applied to the image classifiers to improve adversarial robustness through adversarial training or by purifying adversarial noise. However, diffusion-based adversarial training often encounters convergence challenges and high computational expenses. Additionally, diffusion-based purification inevitably causes data shift and is deemed susceptible to stronger adaptive attacks. To tackle these issues, we propose the Truth Maximization Diffusion Classifier (TMDC), a generative Bayesian classifier that builds upon pre-trained diffusion models and the Bayesian theorem. Unlike data-driven classifiers, TMDC, guided by Bayesian principles, utilizes the conditional likelihood from diffusion models to determine the class probabilities of input images, thereby insulating against the influences of data shift and the limitations of adversarial training. Moreover, to enhance TMDC's resilience against more potent adversarial attacks, we propose an optimization strategy for diffusion classifiers. This strategy involves post-training the diffusion model on perturbed datasets with ground-truth labels as conditions, guiding the diffusion model to learn the data distribution and maximizing the likelihood under the ground-truth labels. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the CIFAR10 dataset against heavy white-box attacks and strong adaptive attacks. Specifically, TMDC achieves robust accuracies of 82.81% against $l_{\\infty}$ norm-bounded perturbations and 86.05% against $l_{2}$ norm-bounded perturbations, respectively, with $\\epsilon=0.05$. ",

Researchers have dedicated efforts to evaluate robustness in diverse perturbation conditions for image recognition tasks. Robustness assessment encompasses two main techniques: robustness verification/ certification for deliberate adversarial attacks and robustness testing for random data corruptions. In this survey, we present a detailed examination of both adversarial robustness (AR) and corruption robustness (CR) in neural network assessment. Analyzing current research papers and standards, we provide an extensive overview of robustness assessment in image recognition. Three essential aspects are analyzed: concepts, metrics, and assessment methods. We investigate the perturbation metrics and range representations used to measure the degree of perturbations on images, as well as the robustness metrics specifically for the robustness conditions of classification models.

It is found that the performance achieved by convolutional neural network classifiers is heavily influenced by the type of input representation, even across formats with equivalent information. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that the phase component of the Doppler-time representation contains rich information useful for classification and that unwrapping the phase in the temporal dimension can improve the results compared to a magnitude-only solution, improving accuracy from 0.920 to 0.938 on the tested human activity dataset.

We propose a two-stage CE method based on a delay-Doppler (DD) training frame, consisting of a dual chirp converted from time domain and a higher power pilot. The first stage employs a DD domain embedded pilot CE to estimate the aliased delays (due to modulo operation) and Doppler shifts, followed by identifying all the underspread paths not coinciding with any overspread path. The second stage utilizes time domain dual chirp correlation to estimate the actual delays and Doppler shifts of the remaining paths. This stage also resolves ambiguity in estimating delays and Doppler shifts for paths sharing same aliased delay. Furthermore, we present a modified low-complexity maximum ratio combining (MRC) detection algorithm for OTFS in overspread channels.

Although DNN-based face forgery detection models have achieved good performance, they are vulnerable to latest generative methods that have less forgery traces and adversarial attacks. This limitation of generalization and robustness hinders the credibility of detection results and requires more explanations. In this work, we provide counterfactual explanations for face forgery detection from an artifact removal perspective. Specifically, we first invert the forgery images into the StyleGAN latent space, and then adversarially optimize their latent representations with the discrimination supervision from the target detection model. We verify the effectiveness of the proposed explanations from two aspects: (1) Counterfactual Trace Visualization: the enhanced forgery images are useful to reveal artifacts by visually contrasting the original images and two different visualization methods; (2) Transferable Adversarial Attacks: the adversarial forgery images generated by attacking the detection model are able to mislead other detection models, implying the removed artifacts are general. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves over 90% attack success rate and superior attack transferability. Compared with naive adversarial noise methods, our method adopts both generative and discriminative model priors, and optimize the latent representations in a synthesis-by-analysis way, which forces the search of counterfactual explanations on the natural face manifold. Thus, more general counterfactual traces can be found and better adversarial attack transferability can be achieved. ",

    "abstract": "The abstraction of dynamical systems is a powerful tool that enables the design of feedback controllers using a correct-by-design framework. We investigate a novel scheme to obtain data-driven abstractions of discrete-time stochastic processes in terms of richer discrete stochastic models, whose actions lead to nondeterministic transitions over the space of probability measures. The data-driven component of the proposed methodology lies in the fact that we only assume samples from an unknown probability distribution. We also rely on the model of the underlying dynamics to build our abstraction through backward reachability computations. The nondeterminism in the probability space is captured by a collection of Markov Processes, and we identify how this model can improve upon existing abstraction techniques in terms of satisfying temporal properties, such as safety or reach-avoid. The connection between the discrete and the underlying dynamics is made formal through the use of the scenario approach theory. Numerical experiments illustrate the advantages and main limitations of the proposed techniques with respect to existing approaches. ",

Learning domain-independent visual representation is critical for enabling the trained DRL agent with the ability to generalize to unseen scenes and objects. In this letter, a target-directed attention network (TDANet) is proposed to learn the end-to-end object-goal visual navigation policy with zero-shot ability. TDANet features a novel target attention (TA) module that learns both the spatial and semantic relationships among objects to help TDANet focus on the most relevant observed objects to the target. With the Siamese architecture (SA) design, TDANet distinguishes the difference between the current and target states and generates the domain-independent visual representation. To evaluate the navigation performance of TDANet, extensive experiments are conducted in the AI2-THOR embodied AI environment. The simulation results demonstrate a strong generalization ability of TDANet to unseen scenes and target objects, with higher navigation success rate (SR) and success weighted by length (SPL) than other state-of-the-art models.

We argue that this is not the case and that performance scores from the past on the PMB are inflated by non-optimal data splits and test sets that are too easy. In response, we introduce several changes. First, instead of the prior random split, we propose a more systematic splitting approach to improve the reliability of the standard test data. Second, except for the standard test set, we also propose two challenge sets: one with longer texts including discourse structure, and one that addresses compositional generalization. We evaluate five neural models for semantic parsing and meaning-to-text generation. Our results show that model performance declines (in some cases dramatically) on the challenge sets, revealing the limitations of neural models when confronting such challenges. ",

First, existing sampling methods demand a pre-processing buffer, causing substantial space complexity. Moreover, the power-law distribution of graph vertex degrees introduces workload imbalance issues, rendering DGRW embarrassed to parallelize. In this paper, we propose FlowWalker, a GPU-based dynamic graph random walk framework. FlowWalker implements an efficient parallel sampling method to fully exploit the GPU parallelism and reduce space complexity. Moreover, it employs a sampler-centric paradigm alongside a dynamic scheduling strategy to handle the huge amounts of walking queries. FlowWalker stands as a memory-efficient framework that requires no auxiliary data structures in GPU global memory. We examine the performance of FlowWalker extensively on ten datasets, and experiment results show that FlowWalker achieves up to 752.2x, 72.1x, and 16.4x speedup compared with existing CPU, GPU, and FPGA random walk frameworks, respectively. Case study shows that FlowWalker diminishes random walk time from 35% to 3% in a pipeline of ByteDance friend recommendation GNN training. ",

It optimizes the local evaluation of bilinear forms through various techniques including tabulation, relocation of loop invariants, and inter-element vectorization - implemented as transformations of an abstract syntax tree. A key contribution is the development, analysis, and generation of efficient loop patterns that leverage the local structure of the underlying tetrahedral grid. These significantly enhance cache locality and arithmetic intensity, mitigating bandwidth-pressure associated with compute-sparse, low-order operators. The paper demonstrates the generator's capabilities through a comprehensive educational cycle of performance analysis, bottleneck identification, and emission of dedicated optimizations. For three differential operators ($-\\Delta$, $-\\nabla \\cdot (k(\\mathbf{x})\\, \\nabla\\,)$, $\\alpha(\\mathbf{x})\\, \\mathbf{curl}\\ \\mathbf{curl} + \\beta(\\mathbf{x}) $), we determine the set of most effective optimizations. Applied by the generator, they result in speed-ups of up to 58$\\times$ compared to reference implementations. Detailed node-level performance analysis yields matrix-free operators with a throughput of 1.3 to 2.1 GDoF/s, achieving up to 62% peak performance on a 36-core Intel Ice Lake socket. Finally, the solution of the curl-curl problem with more than a trillion ($ 10^{12}$) degrees of freedom on 21504 processes in less than 50 seconds demonstrates the generated operators' performance and extreme-scalability as part of a full multigrid solver.

This approach leverages graphon estimation, which models the generative mechanism of networks sequences. Computational results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed augmentation framework in improving the performance of graph classification models. Additionally, using a non-Euclidean distance, specifically the Gromow-Wasserstein distance, results in better approximations of the graphon. This framework also provides a means to validate different graphon estimation approaches, particularly in real-world scenarios where the true graphon is unknown. ",

One common way to evaluate the model response is to rank the candidate answers based on the log probability of the first token prediction. An alternative way is to examine the text output. Prior work has shown that first token probabilities lack robustness to changes in MCQ phrasing, and that first token probabilities do not match text answers for instruction-tuned models. Therefore, in this paper, we investigate the robustness of text answers. We show that the text answers are more robust to question perturbations than the first token probabilities, when the first token answers mismatch the text answers. The difference in robustness increases as the mismatch rate becomes greater. As the mismatch reaches over 50\\%, the text answer is more robust to option order changes than the debiased first token probabilities using state-of-the-art debiasing methods such as PriDe. Our findings provide further evidence for the benefits of text answer evaluation over first token probability evaluation. ",

The performance of the velocity estimation that is represented by Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRB) depends on the length of the offloading bit sequence and the UAV's location. Thus, we jointly optimize the task size for offloading and the UAV's location to minimize the overall computation latency and the CRB of the mean square error for velocity estimation subject to the UAV's budget. The problem is non-convex, and we propose a genetic algorithm to solve it. Simulation results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. ",

Utilizing higher-dimensional data, such as 2D or 3D, incorporates global features, improving the stability of local picking.

Addressing this, we propose a novel approach using deep graph learning called DGL-FB, constructing a large graph to efficiently extract information. In this graph, each seismic trace is represented as a node, connected by edges that reflect similarities. To manage the size of the graph, we develop a subgraph sampling technique to streamline model training and inference. Our proposed framework, DGL-FB, leverages deep graph learning for FB picking. It encodes subgraphs into global features using a deep graph encoder. Subsequently, the encoded global features are combined with local node signals and fed into a ResUNet-based 1D segmentation network for FB detection. Field survey evaluations of DGL-FB show superior accuracy and stability compared to a 2D U-Net-based benchmark method. ",

    "abstract": "Recently, Pareto Set Learning (PSL) has been proposed for learning the entire Pareto set using a neural network. PSL employs preference vectors to scalarize multiple objectives, facilitating the learning of mappings from preference vectors to specific Pareto optimal solutions. Previous PSL methods have shown their effectiveness in solving artificial multi-objective optimization problems (MOPs) with uniform preference vector sampling. The quality of the learned Pareto set is influenced by the sampling strategy of the preference vector, and the sampling of the preference vector needs to be decided based on the Pareto front shape. However, a fixed preference sampling strategy cannot simultaneously adapt the Pareto front of multiple MOPs. To address this limitation, this paper proposes an Evolutionary Preference Sampling (EPS) strategy to efficiently sample preference vectors. Inspired by evolutionary algorithms, we consider preference sampling as an evolutionary process to generate preference vectors for neural network training. We integrate the EPS strategy into five advanced PSL methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed method has a faster convergence speed than baseline algorithms on 7 testing problems.

In this paper, we proposed a vehicle selection scheme based on DRL in VEC. In this scheme, vehicle s mobility, channel conditions with temporal variations, computational resources with temporal variations, different data amount, transmission channel status of vehicles as well as Byzantine attacks were taken into account.Simulation results show that the proposed scheme effectively improves the safety and accuracy of the global model.

Previous methods have achieved satisfactory performance in scenarios that address physical attacks and digital attacks, respectively. However, few methods are considered to integrate a model that simultaneously addresses both physical and digital attacks, implying the necessity to develop and maintain multiple models. To jointly detect physical and digital attacks within a single model, we propose an innovative approach that can adapt to any network architecture. Our approach mainly contains two types of data augmentation, which we call Simulated Physical Spoofing Clues augmentation (SPSC) and Simulated Digital Spoofing Clues augmentation (SDSC). SPSC and SDSC augment live samples into simulated attack samples by simulating spoofing clues of physical and digital attacks, respectively, which significantly improve the capability of the model to detect \"unseen\" attack types.

    "abstract": "Deepfakes have recently raised significant trust issues and security concerns among the public. Compared to CNN face forgery detectors, ViT-based methods take advantage of the expressivity of transformers, achieving superior detection performance. However, these approaches still exhibit the following limitations: (1). Fully fine-tuning ViT-based models from ImageNet weights demands substantial computational and storage resources; (2). ViT-based methods struggle to capture local forgery clues, leading to model bias and limited generalizability. To tackle these challenges, this work introduces Mixture-of-Experts modules for Face Forgery Detection (MoE-FFD), a generalized yet parameter-efficient ViT-based approach. MoE-FFD only updates lightweight Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and Adapter layers while keeping the ViT backbone frozen, thereby achieving parameter-efficient training. Moreover, MoE-FFD leverages the expressivity of transformers and local priors of CNNs to simultaneously extract global and local forgery clues. Additionally, novel MoE modules are designed to scale the model's capacity and select optimal forgery experts, further enhancing forgery detection performance. The proposed MoE learning scheme can be seamlessly adapted to various transformer backbones in a plug-and-play manner. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art face forgery detection performance with reduced parameter overhead.

The models are trained on 2 million videos collected from public datasets and are evaluated on downstream image and video tasks. Our results show that learning by predicting video features leads to versatile visual representations that perform well on both motion and appearance-based tasks, without adaption of the model's parameters; e.g., using a frozen backbone. Our largest model, a ViT-H/16 trained only on videos, obtains 81.9% on Kinetics-400, 72.2% on Something-Something-v2, and 77.9% on ImageNet1K. ",

While Transformer-based models excel at capturing long-range dependencies, they face limitations in noise sensitivity, computational efficiency, and overfitting with smaller datasets. In response, we introduce a novel Time Series Lightweight Adaptive Network (TSLANet), as a universal convolutional model for diverse time series tasks. Specifically, we propose an Adaptive Spectral Block, harnessing Fourier analysis to enhance feature representation and to capture both long-term and short-term interactions while mitigating noise via adaptive thresholding. Additionally, we introduce an Interactive Convolution Block and leverage self-supervised learning to refine the capacity of TSLANet for decoding complex temporal patterns and improve its robustness on different datasets. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that TSLANet outperforms state-of-the-art models in various tasks spanning classification, forecasting, and anomaly detection, showcasing its resilience and adaptability across a spectrum of noise levels and data sizes.

Despite its significance, this issue has received limited theoretical exploration. Through a comprehensive geometric analysis, we identify that the traditional method of Reference Point (RP) selection fundamentally contributes to this challenge. In response, we introduce an innovative RP selection strategy, the Weight Vector-Guided and Gaussian-Hybrid method, designed to overcome the local optima issue. This approach employs a novel RP type that aligns with weight vector directions and integrates a Gaussian distribution to combine three distinct RP categories. Our research comprises two main experimental components: an ablation study involving 14 algorithms within the MOEADs framework, spanning from 2014 to 2022, to validate our theoretical framework, and a series of empirical tests to evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed method against both traditional and cutting-edge alternatives.

Evaluations on real-world datasets and production workload traces show that SSJF reduces average job completion times by 30.5-39.6% and increases throughput by 2.2-3.6x compared to FCFS schedulers, across no batching, dynamic batching, and continuous batching settings.

Despite DAC's empirical success, the original AIL objective is on-policy and DAC's ad-hoc application of off-policy training does not guarantee successful imitation (Kostrikov et al., 2019; 2020). Follow-up work such as ValueDICE (Kostrikov et al., 2020) tackles this issue by deriving a fully off-policy AIL objective. Instead in this work, we develop a novel and principled AIL algorithm via the framework of boosting. Like boosting, our new algorithm, AILBoost, maintains an ensemble of properly weighted weak learners (i.e., policies) and trains a discriminator that witnesses the maximum discrepancy between the distributions of the ensemble and the expert policy. We maintain a weighted replay buffer to represent the state-action distribution induced by the ensemble, allowing us to train discriminators using the entire data collected so far. In the weighted replay buffer, the contribution of the data from older policies are properly discounted with the weight computed based on the boosting framework. Empirically, we evaluate our algorithm on both controller state-based and pixel-based environments from the DeepMind Control Suite. AILBoost outperforms DAC on both types of environments, demonstrating the benefit of properly weighting replay buffer data for off-policy training. On state-based environments, DAC outperforms ValueDICE and IQ-Learn (Gary et al., 2021), achieving competitive performance with as little as one expert trajectory. ",

    "abstract": "To make sense of their surroundings, intelligent systems must transform complex sensory inputs to structured codes that are reduced to task-relevant information such as object category. Biological agents achieve this in a largely autonomous manner, presumably via self-\\allowbreak super-\\allowbreak vised learning. Whereas previous attempts to model the underlying mechanisms were largely discriminative in nature, there is ample evidence that the brain employs a generative model of the world. Here, we propose that eye movements, in combination with the focused nature of primate vision, constitute a generative, self-supervised task of predicting and revealing visual information. We construct a proof-of-principle model starting from the framework of masked image modeling (MIM), a common approach in deep representation learning. To do so, we analyze how core components of MIM such as masking technique and data augmentation influence the formation of category-specific representations. This allows us not only to better understand the principles behind MIM, but to then reassemble a MIM more in line with the focused nature of biological perception. From a theoretical angle, we find that MIM disentangles neurons in latent space, a property that has been suggested to structure visual representations in primates, without explicit regulation. Together with previous findings of invariance learning, this highlights an interesting connection of MIM to latent regularization approaches for self-supervised learning.

    "abstract": "Weakly supervised video anomaly detection (WSVAD) is a challenging task. Generating fine-grained pseudo-labels based on weak-label and then self-training a classifier is currently a promising solution. However, since the existing methods use only RGB visual modality and the utilization of category text information is neglected, thus limiting the generation of more accurate pseudo-labels and affecting the performance of self-training. Inspired by the manual labeling process based on the event description, in this paper, we propose a novel pseudo-label generation and self-training framework based on Text Prompt with Normality Guidance (TPWNG) for WSVAD. Our idea is to transfer the rich language-visual knowledge of the contrastive language-image pre-training (CLIP) model for aligning the video event description text and corresponding video frames to generate pseudo-labels. Specifically, We first fine-tune the CLIP for domain adaptation by designing two ranking losses and a distributional inconsistency loss. Further, we propose a learnable text prompt mechanism with the assist of a normality visual prompt to further improve the matching accuracy of video event description text and video frames. Then, we design a pseudo-label generation module based on the normality guidance to infer reliable frame-level pseudo-labels. Finally, we introduce a temporal context self-adaptive learning module to learn the temporal dependencies of different video events more flexibly and accurately.

Although yielding impressive results, the impact of the language prior, particularly in terms of generalization and robustness, remains unexplored. In this paper, we address this gap by quantifying the impact of this prior and introduce methods to benchmark its effectiveness across various settings. We generate \"low-level\" sentences that convey object-centric, three-dimensional spatial relationships, incorporate them as additional language priors and evaluate their downstream impact on depth estimation. Our key finding is that current language-guided depth estimators perform optimally only with scene-level descriptions and counter-intuitively fare worse with low level descriptions. Despite leveraging additional data, these methods are not robust to directed adversarial attacks and decline in performance with an increase in distribution shift. Finally, to provide a foundation for future research, we identify points of failures and offer insights to better understand these shortcomings.

    "abstract": "Software vulnerabilities are a challenge in cybersecurity. Manual security patches are often difficult and slow to be deployed, while new vulnerabilities are created. Binary code vulnerability detection is less studied and more complex compared to source code, and this has important practical implications. Deep learning has become an efficient and powerful tool in the security domain, where it provides end-to-end and accurate prediction. Modern deep learning approaches learn the program semantics through sequence and graph neural networks, using various intermediate representation of programs, such as abstract syntax trees (AST) or control flow graphs (CFG). Due to the complex nature of program execution, the output of an execution depends on the many program states and inputs. Also, a CFG generated from static analysis can be an overestimation of the true program flow. Moreover, the size of programs often does not allow a graph neural network with fixed layers to aggregate global information. To address these issues, we propose DeepEXE, an agent-based implicit neural network that mimics the execution path of a program. We use reinforcement learning to enhance the branching decision at every program state transition and create a dynamic environment to learn the dependency between a vulnerability and certain program states. An implicitly defined neural network enables nearly infinite state transitions until convergence, which captures the structural information at a higher level. The experiments are conducted on two semi-synthetic and two real-world datasets. We show that DeepEXE is an accurate and efficient method and outperforms the state-of-the-art vulnerability detection methods. ",

    "abstract": "Open-vocabulary object detection (OVOD) aims at localizing and recognizing visual objects from novel classes unseen at the training time. Whereas, empirical studies reveal that advanced detectors generally assign lower scores to those novel instances, which are inadvertently suppressed during inference by commonly adopted greedy strategies like Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS), leading to sub-optimal detection performance for novel classes. This paper systematically investigates this problem with the commonly-adopted two-stage OVOD paradigm. Specifically, in the region-proposal stage, proposals that contain novel instances showcase lower objectness scores, since they are treated as background proposals during the training phase. Meanwhile, in the object-classification stage, novel objects share lower region-text similarities (i.e., classification scores) due to the biased visual-language alignment by seen training samples. To alleviate this problem, this paper introduces two advanced measures to adjust confidence scores and conserve erroneously dismissed objects: (1) a class-agnostic localization quality estimate via overlap degree of region/object proposals, and (2) a text-guided visual similarity estimate with proxy prototypes for novel classes. Integrated with adjusting techniques specifically designed for the region-proposal and object-classification stages, this paper derives the aggregated confidence estimate for the open-vocabulary object detection paradigm (AggDet). Our AggDet is a generic and training-free post-processing scheme, which consistently bolsters open-vocabulary detectors across model scales and architecture designs. For instance, AggDet receives 3.3% and 1.5% gains on OV-COCO and OV-LVIS benchmarks respectively, without any training cost. ",

To alleviate the fronthaul overhead and enable real-time network operation, we propose a distributed scalable machine learning algorithm. In particular, at each BS, we deploy a convolutional neural network (CNN) for antenna selection and a graph neural network (GNN) for precoding design. Different from conventional centralized solutions that require a large amount of CSI and signaling exchange among the BSs, the proposed distributed machine learning algorithm takes only locally estimated CSI as input. With well-trained learning models, it is shown that the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms the distributed baseline schemes and achieves a sum spectral efficiency comparable to its centralized counterpart.

    "abstract": "Few-shot classification with foundation models (e.g., CLIP, DINOv2, PaLM-2) enables users to build an accurate classifier with a few labeled training samples (called support samples) for a classification task. However, an attacker could perform data poisoning attacks by manipulating some support samples such that the classifier makes the attacker-desired, arbitrary prediction for a testing input. Empirical defenses cannot provide formal robustness guarantees, leading to a cat-and-mouse game between the attacker and defender. Existing certified defenses are designed for traditional supervised learning, resulting in sub-optimal performance when extended to few-shot classification. In our work, we propose FCert, the first certified defense against data poisoning attacks to few-shot classification. We show our FCert provably predicts the same label for a testing input under arbitrary data poisoning attacks when the total number of poisoned support samples is bounded. We perform extensive experiments on benchmark few-shot classification datasets with foundation models released by OpenAI, Meta, and Google in both vision and text domains. Our experimental results show our FCert: 1) maintains classification accuracy without attacks, 2) outperforms existing state-of-the-art certified defenses for data poisoning attacks, and 3) is efficient and general.

    "abstract": "Quantitative systems pharmacology (QSP) is widely used to assess drug effects and toxicity before the drug goes to clinical trial. However, significant manual distillation of the literature is needed in order to construct a QSP model. Parameters may need to be fit, and simplifying assumptions of the model need to be made. In this work, we apply Universal Physics-Informed Neural Networks (UPINNs) to learn unknown components of various differential equations that model chemotherapy pharmacodynamics. We learn three commonly employed chemotherapeutic drug actions (log-kill, Norton-Simon, and E_max) from synthetic data. Then, we use the UPINN method to fit the parameters for several synthetic datasets simultaneously. Finally, we learn the net proliferation rate in a model of doxorubicin (a chemotherapeutic) pharmacodynamics. As these are only toy examples, we highlight the usefulness of UPINNs in learning unknown terms in pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic models. ",

    "abstract": "The diagnosis and prognosis of cancer are typically based on multi-modal clinical data, including histology images and genomic data, due to the complex pathogenesis and high heterogeneity. Despite the advancements in digital pathology and high-throughput genome sequencing, establishing effective multi-modal fusion models for survival prediction and revealing the potential association between histopathology and transcriptomics remains challenging. In this paper, we propose Pathology-Genome Heterogeneous Graph (PGHG) that integrates whole slide images (WSI) and bulk RNA-Seq expression data with heterogeneous graph neural network for cancer survival analysis. The PGHG consists of biological knowledge-guided representation learning network and pathology-genome heterogeneous graph. The representation learning network utilizes the biological prior knowledge of intra-modal and inter-modal data associations to guide the feature extraction. The node features of each modality are updated through attention-based graph learning strategy. Unimodal features and bi-modal fused features are extracted via attention pooling module and then used for survival prediction. We evaluate the model on low-grade gliomas, glioblastoma, and kidney renal papillary cell carcinoma datasets from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University (FAHZU). Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms both unimodal and other multi-modal fusion models. For demonstrating the model interpretability, we also visualize the attention heatmap of pathological images and utilize integrated gradient algorithm to identify important tissue structure, biological pathways and key genes.

    "abstract": "Breast cancer is a relatively common cancer among gynecological cancers. Its diagnosis often relies on the pathology of cells in the lesion. The pathological diagnosis of breast cancer not only requires professionals and time, but also sometimes involves subjective judgment. To address the challenges of dependence on pathologists expertise and the time-consuming nature of achieving accurate breast pathological image classification, this paper introduces an approach utilizing convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for the rapid categorization of pathological images, aiming to enhance the efficiency of breast pathological image detection. And the approach enables the rapid and automatic classification of pathological images into benign and malignant groups. The methodology involves utilizing a convolutional neural network (CNN) model leveraging the Inceptionv3 architecture and transfer learning algorithm for extracting features from pathological images. Utilizing a neural network with fully connected layers and employing the SoftMax function for image classification. Additionally, the concept of image partitioning is introduced to handle high-resolution images. To achieve the ultimate classification outcome, the classification probabilities of each image block are aggregated using three algorithms: summation, product, and maximum. Experimental validation was conducted on the BreaKHis public dataset, resulting in accuracy rates surpassing 0.92 across all four magnification coefficients (40X, 100X, 200X, and 400X). It demonstrates that the proposed method effectively enhances the accuracy in classifying pathological images of breast cancer. ",

We define the repelling and the opposing dynamics on graphons and we show that their initial value problem's solutions exist and are unique. We then show that the graphon dynamics well approximate the dynamics on large graphs that converge to a graphon. This result applies to large random graphs that are sampled according to a graphon.

    "abstract": "Cell segmentation is essential in biomedical research for analyzing cellular morphology and behavior. Deep learning methods, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs), have revolutionized cell segmentation by extracting intricate features from images. However, the robustness of these methods under microscope optical aberrations remains a critical challenge. This study comprehensively evaluates the performance of cell instance segmentation models under simulated aberration conditions using the DynamicNuclearNet (DNN) and LIVECell datasets. Aberrations, including Astigmatism, Coma, Spherical, and Trefoil, were simulated using Zernike polynomial equations. Various segmentation models, such as Mask R-CNN with different network heads (FPN, C3) and backbones (ResNet, VGG19, SwinS), were trained and tested under aberrated conditions. Results indicate that FPN combined with SwinS demonstrates superior robustness in handling simple cell images affected by minor aberrations. Conversely, Cellpose2.0 proves effective for complex cell images under similar conditions. Our findings provide insights into selecting appropriate segmentation models based on cell morphology and aberration severity, enhancing the reliability of cell segmentation in biomedical applications. Further research is warranted to validate these methods with diverse aberration types and emerging segmentation models. Overall, this research aims to guide researchers in effectively utilizing cell segmentation models in the presence of minor optical aberrations. ",

    "abstract": "Neural networks extract features from data using stochastic gradient descent (SGD). In particular, higher-order input cumulants (HOCs) are crucial for their performance. However, extracting information from the $p$th cumulant of $d$-dimensional inputs is computationally hard: the number of samples required to recover a single direction from an order-$p$ tensor (tensor PCA) using online SGD grows as $d^{p-1}$, which is prohibitive for high-dimensional inputs. This result raises the question of how neural networks extract relevant directions from the HOCs of their inputs efficiently. Here, we show that correlations between latent variables along the directions encoded in different input cumulants speed up learning from higher-order correlations. We show this effect analytically by deriving nearly sharp thresholds for the number of samples required by a single neuron to weakly-recover these directions using online SGD from a random start in high dimensions. Our analytical results are confirmed in simulations of two-layer neural networks and unveil a new mechanism for hierarchical learning in neural networks. ",
