    "abstract": "The agricultural sector plays an essential role in the economic growth of a country. Specifically, in an Indian context, it is the critical source of livelihood for millions of people living in rural areas. Plant Disease is one of the significant factors affecting the agricultural sector. Plants get infected with diseases for various reasons, including synthetic fertilizers, archaic practices, environmental conditions, etc., which impact the farm yield and subsequently hinder the economy. To address this issue, researchers have explored many applications based on AI and Machine Learning techniques to detect plant diseases. This research survey provides a comprehensive understanding of common plant leaf diseases, evaluates traditional and deep learning techniques for disease detection, and summarizes available datasets. It also explores Explainable AI (XAI) to enhance the interpretability of deep learning models' decisions for end-users. By consolidating this knowledge, the survey offers valuable insights to researchers, practitioners, and stakeholders in the agricultural sector, fostering the development of efficient and transparent solutions for combating plant diseases and promoting sustainable agricultural practices.

    "abstract": "Biometrics involves using unique human traits, both physical and behavioral, for the digital identification of individuals to provide access to systems, devices, or information. Within the field of computer science, it acts as a method for identifying and verifying individuals and controlling access. While the conventional method for personal authentication involves passwords, the vulnerability arises when passwords are compromised, allowing unauthorized access to sensitive actions. Biometric authentication presents a viable answer to this problem and is the most secure and user-friendly authentication method. Today, fingerprints, iris and retina patterns, facial recognition, hand shapes, palm prints, and voice recognition are frequently used forms of biometrics. Despite the diverse nature of these biometric identifiers, the core objective remains consistent ensuring security, recognizing authorized users, and rejecting impostors. Hence, it is crucial to determine accurately whether the characteristics belong to the rightful person. For systems to be effective and widely accepted, the error rate in recognition and verification must approach zero. It is acknowledged that current biometric techniques, while advanced, are not infallible and require continuous improvement. A more refined classifier is deemed necessary to classify patterns accurately. Artificial Neural Networks, which simulate the human brain's operations, present themselves as a promising approach. The survey presented herein explores various biometric techniques based on neural networks, emphasizing the ongoing quest for enhanced accuracy and reliability. It concludes that The utilization of neural networks along with biometric features not only enhances accuracy but also contributes to overall better security. ",

    "abstract": "Drones, also known as unmanned air vehicles (UAVs), have revolutionised various industries, from farming to national security. (Wexler., Lesley. 2016) However, their broad use has revealed a severe weakness in cybersecurity. (Jean-Paul Yaacoub 2020) The urgent necessity to defend UAV networks from new cyber threats is explored in-depth in this research, making it a crucial subject for both technological development and national security. The two essential areas of our study are assault simulation and threat analysis in cybersecurity. This work demonstrates how easy it is to hack a drone mid-flight using only a Raspberry Pi3 and open-source online tools. This work illustrates the ability to penetrate a DJI drone currently used by the mercenary soldiers in the Ukraine war. (Greg Myre March, 2023) This research examines strategies used to attack UAV networks, such as the de-authentic attack and the man-in-the-middle attack. This work investigates the weaknesses in these networks' sophisticated attack simulations with a Raspberry PI 3 and the Alpha network adaptor from Amazon, showing that basic tools are needed to perform cyberattacks on drones. This research proposes creative solutions and preventative methods for protecting UAV operations and highlights the seriousness of the problem. As drones become more prevalent daily, maintaining their security becomes crucial.

Secret-sharing scheme has evolved as a most successful cryptographic technique that allows a secret to be divided or distributed among a group of participants in such a way that only a subset of those participants can reconstruct the original secret. This provides a safe level of security and redundancy, ensuring that no single individual possesses the complete secret.

    "abstract": "This paper examines the evolving landscape of machine learning (ML) and its profound impact across various sectors, with a special focus on the emerging field of Privacy-preserving Machine Learning (PPML). As ML applications become increasingly integral to industries like telecommunications, financial technology, and surveillance, they raise significant privacy concerns, necessitating the development of PPML strategies. The paper highlights the unique challenges in safeguarding privacy within ML frameworks, which stem from the diverse capabilities of potential adversaries, including their ability to infer sensitive information from model outputs or training data. We delve into the spectrum of threat models that characterize adversarial intentions, ranging from membership and attribute inference to data reconstruction. The paper emphasizes the importance of maintaining the confidentiality and integrity of training data, outlining current research efforts that focus on refining training data to minimize privacy-sensitive information and enhancing data processing techniques to uphold privacy. Through a comprehensive analysis of privacy leakage risks and countermeasures in both centralized and collaborative learning settings, this paper aims to provide a thorough understanding of effective strategies for protecting ML training data against privacy intrusions. It explores the balance between data privacy and model utility, shedding light on privacy-preserving techniques that leverage cryptographic methods, Differential Privacy, and Trusted Execution Environments. The discussion extends to the application of these techniques in sensitive domains, underscoring the critical role of PPML in ensuring the privacy and security of ML systems. ",

    "abstract": "Intrusion detection systems (IDS) for the Internet of Things (IoT) systems can use AI-based models to ensure secure communications. IoT systems tend to have many connected devices producing massive amounts of data with high dimensionality, which requires complex models. Complex models have notorious problems such as overfitting, low interpretability, and high computational complexity. Adding model complexity penalty (i.e., regularization) can ease overfitting, but it barely helps interpretability and computational efficiency. Feature engineering can solve these issues; hence, it has become critical for IDS in large-scale IoT systems to reduce the size and dimensionality of data, resulting in less complex models with excellent performance, smaller data storage, and fast detection. This paper proposes a new feature engineering method called LEMDA (Light feature Engineering based on the Mean Decrease in Accuracy). LEMDA applies exponential decay and an optional sensitivity factor to select and create the most informative features. The proposed method has been evaluated and compared to other feature engineering methods using three IoT datasets and four AI/ML models. The results show that LEMDA improves the F1 score performance of all the IDS models by an average of 34% and reduces the average training and detection times in most cases. ",

    "abstract": "While recently Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable successes, they are vulnerable to certain jailbreaking attacks that lead to generation of inappropriate or harmful content. Manual red-teaming requires finding adversarial prompts that cause such jailbreaking, e.g. by appending a suffix to a given instruction, which is inefficient and time-consuming. On the other hand, automatic adversarial prompt generation often leads to semantically meaningless attacks that can easily be detected by perplexity-based filters, may require gradient information from the TargetLLM, or do not scale well due to time-consuming discrete optimization processes over the token space. In this paper, we present a novel method that uses another LLM, called the AdvPrompter, to generate human-readable adversarial prompts in seconds, $\\sim800\\times$ faster than existing optimization-based approaches. We train the AdvPrompter using a novel algorithm that does not require access to the gradients of the TargetLLM. This process alternates between two steps: (1) generating high-quality target adversarial suffixes by optimizing the AdvPrompter predictions, and (2) low-rank fine-tuning of the AdvPrompter with the generated adversarial suffixes. The trained AdvPrompter generates suffixes that veil the input instruction without changing its meaning, such that the TargetLLM is lured to give a harmful response. Experimental results on popular open source TargetLLMs show state-of-the-art results on the AdvBench dataset, that also transfer to closed-source black-box LLM APIs. Further, we demonstrate that by fine-tuning on a synthetic dataset generated by AdvPrompter, LLMs can be made more robust against jailbreaking attacks while maintaining performance, i.e. high MMLU scores.

This research addresses a gap where traditionally, network-generated knowledge has been limited to applications in downstream symbolic analysis or enhancing network transparency. By integrating a novel autoencoder design with the Vector Symbolic Architecture (VSA), we have introduced auxiliary tasks that support end-to-end training. Our approach eschews traditional dependencies on ontologies or word embedding models, mining concepts from neural networks and directly aligning them with human knowledge. Experiments show that our method consistently captures network-generated concepts that align closely with human knowledge and can even uncover new, useful concepts not previously identified by humans. This plug-and-play strategy not only enhances the interpretability of neural networks but also facilitates the integration of symbolic logical reasoning within these systems. ",

Besides, for many tasks it is known that these models are over-parametrized: neoteric works have broadly focused on reducing the width of these networks, rather than their depth. In this paper, we aim to reduce the depth of over-parametrized deep neural networks: we propose an eNtropy-basEd Pruning as a nEural Network depTH's rEducer (NEPENTHE) to alleviate deep neural networks' computational burden. Based on our theoretical finding, NEPENTHE focuses on un-structurally pruning connections in layers with low entropy to remove them entirely. We validate our approach on popular architectures such as MobileNet and Swin-T, showing that when encountering an over-parametrization regime, it can effectively linearize some layers (hence reducing the model's depth) with little to no performance loss.

In both cases we leverage the dynamics of the spacecraft, described by Ordinary Differential Equations which incorporate a neural network on their right-hand side (Neural ODEs). Since the neural dynamics is differentiable, the ODEs sensitivities to the network parameters can be computed using the variational equations, thereby allowing to update the G&CNET parameters based on the observed dynamics. We start with a straightforward regression task, training the G&CNETs on datasets of optimal trajectories using behavioural cloning. These networks are then refined using the Neural ODE sensitivities by minimizing the error between the final states and the target states. We demonstrate that for the orbital transfer, the final error to the target can be reduced by 99% on a single trajectory and by 70% on a batch of 500 trajectories. For the landing problem the reduction in error is around 98-99% (position) and 40-44% (velocity). This step significantly enhances the accuracy of G&CNETs, which instills greater confidence in their reliability for operational use.

As such we propose a novel method, Diversity Enhancing Conditional General Adversarial Network (DE-CGAN) for oversampling these underrepresented examples.

Through empirical experiments we show that a classification model trained using a diversity enhanced training set outperforms traditional data augmentation techniques and existing benchmark results. This work shows that increasing the diversity of a training dataset can improve classification model performance.

The learning sparse gating network selects a set of experts for each token to be processed; however, this may lead to differences in the number of tokens processed by each expert over several successive iterations, i.e., the expert load fluctuations, which reduces computational parallelization and resource utilization. To this end, we traced and analyzed loads of each expert in the training iterations for several large language models in this work, and defined the transient state with \"obvious load fluctuation\" and the stable state with \"temporal locality\". Moreover, given the characteristics of these two states and the computational overhead, we deployed three classical prediction algorithms that achieve accurate expert load prediction results. For the GPT3 350M model, the average error rates for predicting the expert load proportion over the next 1,000 and 2,000 steps are approximately 1.3% and 1.8%, respectively. This work can provide valuable guidance for expert placement or resource allocation for MoE model training.

A key factor in the successful application of these methods is a large enough training sample size, which is not always available. In these scenarios, synthetic data generation techniques are usually applied to augment the dataset. Data augmentation is typically applied before fitting a model. However, these approaches create a single augmented dataset, potentially limiting their effectiveness. This work introduces OnDAT (On-the-fly Data Augmentation for Time series) to address this issue by applying data augmentation during training and validation. Contrary to traditional methods that create a single, static augmented dataset beforehand, OnDAT performs augmentation on-the-fly. By generating a new augmented dataset on each iteration, the model is exposed to a constantly changing augmented data variations. We hypothesize this process enables a better exploration of the data space, which reduces the potential for overfitting and improves forecasting performance. We validated the proposed approach using a state-of-the-art deep learning forecasting method and 8 benchmark datasets containing a total of 75797 time series. The experiments suggest that OnDAT leads to better forecasting performance than a strategy that applies data augmentation before training as well as a strategy that does not involve data augmentation.

Our objective is to minimize the average delay in the system due to APs' limited service capacity and unreliable wireless channels between APs and users. This problem can be formulated as a restless multi-armed bandits problem with fairness constraint (RMAB-F). Since finding the optimal policy for RMAB-F is intractable, existing learning algorithms are computationally expensive and not suitable for practical dynamic dense mmWave networks. In this paper, we propose a structured reinforcement learning (RL) solution for mmDPT by exploiting the inherent structure encoded in RMAB-F. To achieve this, we first design a low-complexity and provably asymptotically optimal index policy for RMAB-F. Then, we leverage this structure information to develop a structured RL algorithm called mmDPT-TS, which provably achieves an \\tilde{O}(\\sqrt{T}) Bayesian regret. More importantly, mmDPT-TS is computation-efficient and thus amenable to practical implementation, as it fully exploits the structure of index policy for making decisions. Extensive emulation based on data collected in realistic mmWave networks demonstrate significant gains of mmDPT-TS over existing approaches. ",

    "abstract": "We introduce Constellation, a dataset of 13K images suitable for research on detection of objects in dense urban streetscapes observed from high-elevation cameras, collected for a variety of temporal conditions. The dataset addresses the need for curated data to explore problems in small object detection exemplified by the limited pixel footprint of pedestrians observed tens of meters from above. It enables the testing of object detection models for variations in lighting, building shadows, weather, and scene dynamics. We evaluate contemporary object detection architectures on the dataset, observing that state-of-the-art methods have lower performance in detecting small pedestrians compared to vehicles, corresponding to a 10% difference in average precision (AP). Using structurally similar datasets for pretraining the models results in an increase of 1.8% mean AP (mAP). We further find that incorporating domain-specific data augmentations helps improve model performance. Using pseudo-labeled data, obtained from inference outcomes of the best-performing models, improves the performance of the models. Finally, comparing the models trained using the data collected in two different time intervals, we find a performance drift in models due to the changes in intersection conditions over time. The best-performing model achieves a pedestrian AP of 92.0% with 11.5 ms inference time on NVIDIA A100 GPUs, and an mAP of 95.4%. ",

    "abstract": "Robustness to out-of-distribution (OOD) samples is crucial for safely deploying machine learning models in the open world. Recent works have focused on designing scoring functions to quantify OOD uncertainty. Setting appropriate thresholds for these scoring functions for OOD detection is challenging as OOD samples are often unavailable up front. Typically, thresholds are set to achieve a desired true positive rate (TPR), e.g., $95\\%$ TPR. However, this can lead to very high false positive rates (FPR), ranging from 60 to 96\\%, as observed in the Open-OOD benchmark. In safety-critical real-life applications, e.g., medical diagnosis, controlling the FPR is essential when dealing with various OOD samples dynamically. To address these challenges, we propose a mathematically grounded OOD detection framework that leverages expert feedback to \\emph{safely} update the threshold on the fly. We provide theoretical results showing that it is guaranteed to meet the FPR constraint at all times while minimizing the use of human feedback. Another key feature of our framework is that it can work with any scoring function for OOD uncertainty quantification. Empirical evaluation of our system on synthetic and benchmark OOD datasets shows that our method can maintain FPR at most $5\\%$ while maximizing TPR. ",

The research community often relies on a model's average performance across the test prompts of a benchmark to evaluate the model's performance.

We note that this is generally not the case; instead, we hold that the distribution of interest varies according to the specific use case. We find that (1) the correlation in model performance across test prompts is non-random, (2) accounting for correlations across test prompts can change model rankings on major benchmarks, (3) explanatory factors for these correlations include semantic similarity and common LLM failure points.

We evaluate the method using two publicly available knowledge graphs, Wikidata and CaLiGraph, and 7 large language models. Using the gpt-4-0125-preview large language model, the method's classification performance achieves a macro-averaged F1-score of 0.830 on data from Wikidata and 0.893 on data from CaLiGraph. Moreover, a manual analysis of the classification errors shows that 40.9% of errors were due to the knowledge graphs, with 16.0% due to missing relations and 24.9% due to incorrectly asserted relations. These results show how large language models can assist knowledge engineers in the process of knowledge graph refinement. The code and data are available on Github. ",

We give evidence for this conjecture by proving lower bounds against the local statistics hierarchy of hypothesis testing semidefinite programs. We then explore the consequences of this conjecture for the hardness of certifying bounds on numerous functions of random regular graphs, expanding on a direction initiated by Bandeira, Banks, Kunisky, Moore, and Wein (2021). Conditional on this conjecture, we show that no polynomial-time algorithm can certify tight bounds on the maximum cut of random 3- or 4-regular graphs, the maximum independent set of random 3- or 4-regular graphs, or the chromatic number of random 7-regular graphs. We show similar gaps asymptotically for large degree for the maximum independent set and for any degree for the minimum dominating set, finding that naive spectral and combinatorial bounds are optimal among all polynomial-time certificates. Likewise, for small-set vertex and edge expansion in the limit of very small sets, we show that the spectral bounds of Kahale (1995) are optimal among all polynomial-time certificates. ",

We show that this approach satisfied a number of theoretical properties. For real world data $P$ usually is unknown.

Traditional self-driving technologies, while advanced, typically do not translate directly to pedestrian applications due to their reliance on extensive sensor arrays and non-feasible computational frameworks. This highlights a significant gap in applying these solutions to human users since human navigation introduces unique challenges, including the unpredictable nature of human movement, limited processing capabilities of portable devices, and the need for directional responsiveness due to the limited perception range of humans. In this project, we introduce an image-only method that applies motion analysis using optical flow with ego-motion compensation to predict Motor Focus-where and how humans or machines focus their movement intentions. Meanwhile, this paper addresses the camera shaking issue in handheld and body-mounted devices which can severely degrade performance and accuracy, by applying a Gaussian aggregation to stabilize the predicted motor focus area and enhance the prediction accuracy of movement direction. This also provides a robust, real-time solution that adapts to the user's immediate environment. Furthermore, in the experiments part, we show the qualitative analysis of motor focus estimation between the conventional dense optical flow-based method and the proposed method. In quantitative tests, we show the performance of the proposed method on a collected small dataset that is specialized for motor focus estimation tasks. ",

DL frameworks, like other systems, are prone to code clones. Code clones refer to identical or highly similar source code fragments within the same project or even across different projects. Code cloning can have positive and negative implications for software development, influencing maintenance, readability, and bug propagation. In this paper, we aim to address the knowledge gap concerning the evolutionary dimension of code clones in DL frameworks and the extent of code reuse across these frameworks. We empirically analyze code clones in nine popular DL frameworks, i.e., TensorFlow, Paddle, PyTorch, Aesara, Ray, MXNet, Keras, Jax and BentoML, to investigate (1) the characteristics of the long-term code cloning evolution over releases in each framework, (2) the short-term, i.e., within-release, code cloning patterns and their influence on the long-term trends, and (3) the file-level code clones within the DL frameworks. Our findings reveal that DL frameworks adopt four distinct cloning trends and that these trends present some common and distinct characteristics. For instance, bug-fixing activities persistently happen in clones irrespective of the clone evolutionary trend but occur more in the \"Serpentine\" trend. Moreover, the within release level investigation demonstrates that short-term code cloning practices impact long-term cloning trends. The cross-framework code clone investigation reveals the presence of functional and architectural adaptation file-level cross-framework code clones across the nine studied frameworks. We provide insights that foster robust clone practices and collaborative maintenance in the development of DL frameworks. ",

Our method exploits the fact that a very small number of covering constraints is often sufficient for solving the integer model, allowing the corresponding rows to be generated on demand. To date, the most efficient exact algorithm for the $\\texttt{GBP}$, denoted here by $\\texttt{GDCA}$, is able to obtain optimal solutions for graphs with up to 14,000 vertices within two hours of execution.

However, like convolutional neural networks, SNNs are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. To tackle the challenge, we propose a biologically inspired methodology to enhance the robustness of SNNs, drawing insights from the visual masking effect and filtering theory. First, an end-to-end SNN-based image purification model is proposed to defend against adversarial attacks, including a noise extraction network and a non-blind denoising network. The former network extracts noise features from noisy images, while the latter component employs a residual U-Net structure to reconstruct high-quality noisy images and generate clean images. Simultaneously, a multi-level firing SNN based on Squeeze-and-Excitation Network is introduced to improve the robustness of the classifier. Crucially, the proposed image purification network serves as a pre-processing module, avoiding modifications to classifiers. Unlike adversarial training, our method is highly flexible and can be seamlessly integrated with other defense strategies. Experimental results on various datasets demonstrate that the proposed methodology outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in terms of defense effectiveness, training time, and resource consumption.

    "abstract": "We introduce the FRactional-Order graph Neural Dynamical network (FROND), a new continuous graph neural network (GNN) framework. Unlike traditional continuous GNNs that rely on integer-order differential equations, FROND employs the Caputo fractional derivative to leverage the non-local properties of fractional calculus. This approach enables the capture of long-term dependencies in feature updates, moving beyond the Markovian update mechanisms in conventional integer-order models and offering enhanced capabilities in graph representation learning. We offer an interpretation of the node feature updating process in FROND from a non-Markovian random walk perspective when the feature updating is particularly governed by a diffusion process. We demonstrate analytically that oversmoothing can be mitigated in this setting. Experimentally, we validate the FROND framework by comparing the fractional adaptations of various established integer-order continuous GNNs, demonstrating their consistently improved performance and underscoring the framework's potential as an effective extension to enhance traditional continuous GNNs.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we introduce PASGAL (Parallel And Scalable Graph Algorithm Library), a parallel graph library that scales to a variety of graph types, many processors, and large graph sizes. One special focus of PASGAL is the efficiency on \\textit{large-diameter graphs}, which is a common challenge for many existing parallel graph processing systems: many existing graph processing systems can be even slower than the standard sequential algorithm on large-diameter graphs due to the lack of parallelism. Such performance degeneration is caused by the high overhead in scheduling and synchronizing threads when traversing the graph in the breadth-first order. The core technique in PASGAL to achieve high parallelism is a technique called \\textit{vertical granularity control (VGC)} to hide synchronization overhead, as well as careful redesign of parallel graph algorithms and data structures. In our experiments, we compare PASGAL with state-of-the-art parallel implementations on BFS, SCC, BCC, and SSSP. PASGAL achieves competitive performance on small-diameter graphs compared to the parallel baselines, and is significantly faster on large-diameter graphs. ",

However, these languages usually have limited SV data for developing high-performing prediction models. Aims: We conduct an empirical study to evaluate the impact of SV data scarcity in emerging languages on the state-of-the-art SV prediction model and investigate potential solutions to enhance the performance. Method: We train and test the state-of-the-art model based on CodeBERT with and without data sampling techniques for function-level and line-level SV prediction in three low-resource languages - Kotlin, Swift, and Rust. We also assess the effectiveness of ChatGPT for low-resource SV prediction given its recent success in other domains. Results: Compared to the original work in C/C++ with large data, CodeBERT's performance of function-level and line-level SV prediction significantly declines in low-resource languages, signifying the negative impact of data scarcity. Regarding remediation, data sampling techniques fail to improve CodeBERT; whereas, ChatGPT showcases promising results, substantially enhancing predictive performance by up to 34.4% for the function level and up to 53.5% for the line level. Conclusion: We have highlighted the challenge and made the first promising step for low-resource SV prediction, paving the way for future research in this direction. ",

We call these inputs LM Babel and this work systematically studies the behavior of LLMs manipulated by these prompts. We find that the manipulation efficiency depends on the target text's length and perplexity, with the Babel prompts often located in lower loss minima compared to natural prompts. We further examine the structure of the Babel prompts and evaluate their robustness. Notably, we find that guiding the model to generate harmful texts is not more difficult than into generating benign texts, suggesting lack of alignment for out-of-distribution prompts. ",

Using medical images of the Open Knowledge-Based Planning Challenge dataset, we found that this model can be effectively harnessed to yield uncertainty estimates that inherited correlations with prediction errors upon completion of network training. This was achieved only after reformulating the original loss function for a stable implementation. We found that (i)epistemic uncertainty was highly correlated with prediction errors, with various association indices comparable or stronger than those for Monte-Carlo Dropout and Deep Ensemble methods, (ii)the median error varied with uncertainty threshold much more linearly for epistemic uncertainty in Deep Evidential Learning relative to these other two conventional frameworks, indicative of a more uniformly calibrated sensitivity to model errors, (iii)relative to epistemic uncertainty, aleatoric uncertainty demonstrated a more significant shift in its distribution in response to Gaussian noise added to CT intensity, compatible with its interpretation as reflecting data noise. Collectively, our results suggest that Deep Evidential Learning is a promising approach that can endow deep-learning models in radiotherapy dose prediction with statistical robustness. Towards enhancing its clinical relevance, we demonstrate how we can use such a model to construct the predicted Dose-Volume-Histograms' confidence intervals. ",

    "abstract": "The response time of a biosensor is a crucial metric in safety-critical applications such as medical diagnostics where an earlier diagnosis can markedly improve patient outcomes. However, the speed at which a biosensor reaches a final equilibrium state can be limited by poor mass transport and long molecular diffusion times that increase the time it takes target molecules to reach the active sensing region of a biosensor. While optimization of system and sensor design can promote molecules reaching the sensing element faster, a simpler and complementary approach for response time reduction that is widely applicable across all sensor platforms is to use time-series forecasting to predict the ultimate steady-state sensor response. In this work, we show that ensembles of long short-term memory (LSTM) networks can accurately predict equilibrium biosensor response from a small quantity of initial time-dependent biosensor measurements, allowing for significant reduction in response time by a mean and median factor of improvement of 18.6 and 5.1, respectively. The ensemble of models also provides simultaneous estimation of uncertainty, which is vital to provide confidence in the predictions and subsequent safety-related decisions that are made. This approach is demonstrated on real-time experimental data collected by exposing porous silicon biosensors to buffered protein solutions using a multi-channel fluidic cell that enables the automated measurement of 100 porous silicon biosensors in parallel. The dramatic improvement in sensor response time achieved using LSTM network ensembles and associated uncertainty quantification opens the door to trustworthy and faster responding biosensors, enabling more rapid medical diagnostics for improved patient outcomes and healthcare access, as well as quicker identification of toxins in food and the environment.

Targeting these two problems, we propose a novel approach, named ``MorphText\", to capture the regularity of texts by embedding deep morphology for arbitrary-shape text detection. Towards this end, two deep morphological modules are designed to regularize text segments and determine the linkage between them. First, a Deep Morphological Opening (DMOP) module is constructed to remove false text segment detections generated in the feature extraction process. Then, a Deep Morphological Closing (DMCL) module is proposed to allow text instances of various shapes to stretch their morphology along their most significant orientation while deriving their connections. Extensive experiments conducted on four challenging benchmark datasets (CTW1500, Total-Text, MSRA-TD500 and ICDAR2017) demonstrate that our proposed MorphText outperforms both top-down and bottom-up state-of-the-art arbitrary-shape scene text detection approaches.

    "abstract": "Feature selection aims to identify the optimal feature subset for enhancing downstream models. Effective feature selection can remove redundant features, save computational resources, accelerate the model learning process, and improve the model overall performance. However, existing works are often time-intensive to identify the effective feature subset within high-dimensional feature spaces. Meanwhile, these methods mainly utilize a single downstream task performance as the selection criterion, leading to the selected subsets that are not only redundant but also lack generalizability. To bridge these gaps, we reformulate feature selection through a neuro-symbolic lens and introduce a novel generative framework aimed at identifying short and effective feature subsets. More specifically, we found that feature ID tokens of the selected subset can be formulated as symbols to reflect the intricate correlations among features. Thus, in this framework, we first create a data collector to automatically collect numerous feature selection samples consisting of feature ID tokens, model performance, and the measurement of feature subset redundancy. Building on the collected data, an encoder-decoder-evaluator learning paradigm is developed to preserve the intelligence of feature selection into a continuous embedding space for efficient search. Within the learned embedding space, we leverage a multi-gradient search algorithm to find more robust and generalized embeddings with the objective of improving model performance and reducing feature subset redundancy. These embeddings are then utilized to reconstruct the feature ID tokens for executing the final feature selection. Ultimately, comprehensive experiments and case studies are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework. ",

Motivated by that, we propose a Multi-Scale Sub-Band Constant-Q Transform CQT (MS-SB-CQT) discriminator and a Multi-Scale Temporal-Compressed Continuous Wavelet Transform CWT (MS-TC-CWT) discriminator. Both CQT and CWT have a dynamic TF resolution for different frequency bands. In contrast, CQT has a better modeling ability in pitch information, and CWT has a better modeling ability in short-time transients. Experiments conducted on both speech and singing voices confirm the effectiveness of our proposed discriminators. Moreover, the STFT, CQT, and CWT-based discriminators can be used jointly for better performance.

However, these methods usually encounter the over-smoothing issue when dealing with missing data, as the graph neural network (GNN) modules are not explicitly designed for handling missing data. This paper proposes a novel framework, called Dual-Path Generative Adversarial Network (DPGAN), that can deal simultaneously with missing data and avoid over-smoothing problems. The crux of our work is that it admits both global and local representations of the input graph signal, which can capture the long-range dependencies. It is realized via our proposed generator, consisting of two key components, i.e., MLPUNet++ and GraphUNet++. Our generator is trained with a designated discriminator via an adversarial process. In particular, to avoid assessing the entire graph as did in the literature, our discriminator focuses on the local subgraph fidelity, thereby boosting the quality of the local imputation. The subgraph size is adjustable, allowing for control over the intensity of adversarial regularization. Comprehensive experiments across various benchmark datasets substantiate that DPGAN consistently rivals, if not outperforms, existing state-of-the-art imputation algorithms.

However, the existing methods for MCS detection mostly targets on single-frame detection, which just considers the static characteristics and ignores the temporal evolution in the life cycle of MCS. In this paper, we propose a novel encoder-decoder neural network for MCS detection(MCSDNet). MCSDNet has a simple architecture and is easy to expand. Different from the previous models, MCSDNet targets on multi-frames detection and leverages multi-scale spatiotemporal information for the detection of MCS regions in remote sensing imagery(RSI). As far as we know, it is the first work to utilize multi-scale spatiotemporal information to detect MCS regions. Firstly, we design a multi-scale spatiotemporal information module to extract multi-level semantic from different encoder levels, which makes our models can extract more detail spatiotemporal features. Secondly, a Spatiotemporal Mix Unit(STMU) is introduced to MCSDNet to capture both intra-frame features and inter-frame correlations, which is a scalable module and can be replaced by other spatiotemporal module, e.g., CNN, RNN, Transformer and our proposed Dual Spatiotemporal Attention(DSTA). This means that the future works about spatiotemporal modules can be easily integrated to our model.

In dynamic networks, we model twin nodes over a time-bounded interval, noted $(\\Delta,d)$-twins, as follows. A periodic undirected time-varying graph $\\mathcal G=(G_t)_{t\\in\\mathbb N}$ of period $p$ is an infinite sequence of static graphs where $G_t=G_{t+p}$ for every $t\\in\\mathbb N$. For $\\Delta$ and $d$ two integers, two distinct nodes $u$ and $v$ in $\\mathcal G$ are $(\\Delta,d)$-twins if, starting at some instant, the outside neighbourhoods of $u$ and $v$ has non-empty intersection and differ by at most $d$ elements for $\\Delta$ consecutive instants.

However, these frameworks' designs do not have sufficient consideration of the risk of external content, thereby allowing attackers to undermine the applications developed with these frameworks. In this paper, we reveal a new threat to LLM-powered applications, termed retrieval poisoning, where attackers can guide the application to yield malicious responses during the RAG process. Specifically, through the analysis of LLM application frameworks, attackers can craft documents visually indistinguishable from benign ones. Despite the documents providing correct information, once they are used as reference sources for RAG, the application is misled into generating incorrect responses. Our preliminary experiments indicate that attackers can mislead LLMs with an 88.33\\% success rate, and achieve a 66.67\\% success rate in the real-world application, demonstrating the potential impact of retrieval poisoning.

    "abstract": "Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) is a valuable and robust training methodology for contemporary Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), enabling unsupervised pretraining on a `pretext task' that does not require ground-truth labels/annotation. This allows efficient representation learning from massive amounts of unlabeled training data, which in turn leads to increased accuracy in a `downstream task' by exploiting supervised transfer learning. Despite the relatively straightforward conceptualization and applicability of SSL, it is not always feasible to collect and/or to utilize very large pretraining datasets, especially when it comes to real-world application settings. In particular, in cases of specialized and domain-specific application scenarios, it may not be achievable or practical to assemble a relevant image pretraining dataset in the order of millions of instances or it could be computationally infeasible to pretrain at this scale. This motivates an investigation on the effectiveness of common SSL pretext tasks, when the pretraining dataset is of relatively limited/constrained size. In this context, this work introduces a taxonomy of modern visual SSL methods, accompanied by detailed explanations and insights regarding the main categories of approaches, and, subsequently, conducts a thorough comparative experimental evaluation in the low-data regime, targeting to identify: a) what is learnt via low-data SSL pretraining, and b) how do different SSL categories behave in such training scenarios. Interestingly, for domain-specific downstream tasks, in-domain low-data SSL pretraining outperforms the common approach of large-scale pretraining on general datasets. Grounded on the obtained results, valuable insights are highlighted regarding the performance of each category of SSL methods, which in turn suggest straightforward future research directions in the field.

System 1, which is a quick, emotional, and intuitive process, which is subject to cognitive biases, and System 2, a slow, onerous, and deliberate process. NLP researchers often compare zero-shot prompting in LLMs to System 1 reasoning and chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting to System 2. In line with this interpretation, prior research has found that using CoT prompting in LLMs leads to reduced gender bias. We investigate the relationship between bias, CoT prompting, and dual process theory in LLMs directly. We compare zero-shot, CoT, and a variety of dual process theory-based prompting strategies on two bias datasets spanning nine different social bias categories. We also use human and machine personas to determine whether the effects of dual process theory in LLMs are based on modeling human cognition or inherent to the system. We find that a human persona, System 2, and CoT prompting all tend to reduce social biases in LLMs, though the best combination of features depends on the exact model and bias category -- resulting in up to a 13 percent drop in stereotypical judgments by an LLM.

These autonomous navigation systems require a wireless communication network, and of late are deep learning based. In critical scenarios such as border protection or disaster response, ensuring the secure navigation of autonomous UAVs is paramount. But, these autonomous UAVs are susceptible to adversarial attacks through the communication network or the deep learning models - eavesdropping / man-in-the-middle / membership inference / reconstruction. To address this susceptibility, we propose an innovative approach that combines Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) for secure autonomous UAV navigation. This end-to-end secure framework is designed for real-time video feeds captured by UAV cameras and utilizes FHE to perform inference on encrypted input images. While FHE allows computations on encrypted data, certain computational operators are yet to be implemented. Convolutional neural networks, fully connected neural networks, activation functions and OpenAI Gym Library are meticulously adapted to the FHE domain to enable encrypted data processing. We demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed approach through extensive experimentation.

Although the potential of RNNs for temporal data processing has been demonstrated, randomness of the network architecture often causes performance degradation. Self-organization mechanism using IP and SP can mitigate the degradation, therefore, we compile these functions in a spiking neuronal model. To implement the function of IP, a variable firing threshold is introduced to each excitatory neuron in the RNN that changes stepwise in accordance with its activity. We also define other thresholds for SP that synchronize with the firing threshold, which determine the direction of stepwise synaptic update that is executed on receiving a pre-synaptic spike. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our model through simulations of temporal data learning and anomaly detection with a spiking RNN using publicly available electrocardiograms. Considering hardware implementation, we employ discretized thresholds and synaptic weights and show that these parameters can be reduced to binary if the RNN architecture is appropriately designed. This contributes to minimization of the circuit of the neuronal system having IP and SP. ",

We observe that this issue is particularly magnified in vision transformers (ViTs), where post-pre-training and fine-tuning on new tasks can significantly degrade the model's original general abilities. For instance, a DINO ViT-Base/16 pre-trained on ImageNet-1k loses over 70% accuracy on ImageNet-1k after just 10 iterations of fine-tuning on CIFAR-100. Overcoming this stability-plasticity dilemma is crucial for enabling ViTs to continuously learn and adapt to new domains while preserving their initial knowledge. In this work, we study two new parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategies: (1)~Block Expansion, and (2) Low-rank adaptation (LoRA). Our experiments reveal that using either Block Expansion or LoRA on self-supervised pre-trained ViTs surpass fully fine-tuned ViTs in new domains while offering significantly greater parameter efficiency. Notably, we find that Block Expansion experiences only a minimal performance drop in the pre-training domain, thereby effectively mitigating catastrophic forgetting in pre-trained ViTs. ",

Distributed multi-antenna access points (APs) simultaneously serve communication users (UEs) and emit probing signals towards multiple specified zones for sensing. The APs can switch between communication and sensing modes, and adjust their transmit power based on the network settings and sensing and communication operations' requirements. By considering local partial zero-forcing and maximum-ratio-transmit precoding at the APs for communication and sensing, respectively, we first derive closed-form expressions for the spectral efficiency (SE) of the UEs and the mainlobe-to-average-sidelobe ratio (MASR) of the sensing zones. Then, a joint operation mode selection and power control design problem is formulated to maximize the SE fairness among the UEs, while ensuring specific levels of MASR for sensing zones. The complicated mixed-integer problem is relaxed and solved via successive convex approximation approach. We further propose a low-complexity design, where AP mode selection is designed through a greedy algorithm and then power control is designed based on this chosen mode. Our findings reveal that the proposed scheme can consistently ensure a sensing success rate of $100\\%$ for different network setups with a satisfactory fairness among all UEs. ",

In this paper, we propose a novel approach, dubbed Adversarial Reweighting with $\\alpha$-Power Maximization (ARPM), for PDA where the source domain contains private classes absent in target domain. In ARPM, we propose a novel adversarial reweighting model that adversarially learns to reweight source domain data to identify source-private class samples by assigning smaller weights to them, for mitigating potential negative transfer. Based on the adversarial reweighting, we train the transferable recognition model on the reweighted source distribution to be able to classify common class data. To reduce the prediction uncertainty of the recognition model on the target domain for PDA, we present an $\\alpha$-power maximization mechanism in ARPM, which enriches the family of losses for reducing the prediction uncertainty for PDA. Extensive experimental results on five PDA benchmarks, i.e., Office-31, Office-Home, VisDA-2017, ImageNet-Caltech, and DomainNet, show that our method is superior to recent PDA methods. Ablation studies also confirm the effectiveness of components in our approach. To theoretically analyze our method, we deduce an upper bound of target domain expected error for PDA, which is approximately minimized in our approach.

However, these algorithms lack generalizability in practical scenarios where the copied regions are not present in the training images, or the cloned regions are part of the background. Additionally, these algorithms utilize convolution operations to distinguish source and target regions, leading to unsatisfactory results when the target regions blend well with the background. To address these limitations, this study proposes a novel end-to-end CMFD framework that integrates the strengths of conventional and deep learning methods. Specifically, the study develops a deep cross-scale PatchMatch (PM) method that is customized for CMFD to locate copy-move regions. Unlike existing deep models, our approach utilizes features extracted from high-resolution scales to seek explicit and reliable point-to-point matching between source and target regions. Furthermore, we propose a novel pairwise rank learning framework to separate source and target regions. By leveraging the strong prior of point-to-point matches, the framework can identify subtle differences and effectively discriminate between source and target regions, even when the target regions blend well with the background. Our framework is fully differentiable and can be trained end-to-end.

    "title": "Towards Scalable Multi-Chip Wireless Networks with Near-Field Time  Reversal",
    "abstract": "The concept of Wireless Network-on-Chip (WNoC) has emerged as a potential solution to address the escalating communication demands of modern computing systems due to their low-latency, versatility, and reconfigurability. However, for WNoC to fulfill its potential, it is essential to establish multiple high-speed wireless links across chips. Unfortunately, the compact and enclosed nature of computing packages introduces significant challenges in the form of Co-Channel Interference (CCI) and Inter-Symbol Interference (ISI), which not only hinder the deployment of multiple spatial channels but also severely restrict the symbol rate of each individual channel. In this paper, we posit that Time Reversal (TR) could be effective in addressing both impairments in this static scenario thanks to its spatiotemporal focusing capabilities even in the near field. Through comprehensive full-wave simulations and bit error rate analysis in multiple scenarios and at multiple frequency bands, we provide evidence that TR can increase the symbol rate by an order of magnitude, enabling the deployment of multiple concurrent links and achieving aggregate speeds exceeding 100 Gb/s. Finally, we evaluate the impact of reducing the sampling rate of the TR filter on the achievable speeds, paving the way to practical TR-based wireless communications at the chip scale. ",

    "title": "A Novel Spike Transformer Network for Depth Estimation from Event  Cameras via Cross-modality Knowledge Distillation",
    "abstract": "Depth estimation is crucial for interpreting complex environments, especially in areas such as autonomous vehicle navigation and robotics. Nonetheless, obtaining accurate depth readings from event camera data remains a formidable challenge. Event cameras operate differently from traditional digital cameras, continuously capturing data and generating asynchronous binary spikes that encode time, location, and light intensity. Yet, the unique sampling mechanisms of event cameras render standard image based algorithms inadequate for processing spike data. This necessitates the development of innovative, spike-aware algorithms tailored for event cameras, a task compounded by the irregularity, continuity, noise, and spatial and temporal characteristics inherent in spiking data.Harnessing the strong generalization capabilities of transformer neural networks for spatiotemporal data, we propose a purely spike-driven spike transformer network for depth estimation from spiking camera data. To address performance limitations with Spiking Neural Networks (SNN), we introduce a novel single-stage cross-modality knowledge transfer framework leveraging knowledge from a large vision foundational model of artificial neural networks (ANN) (DINOv2) to enhance the performance of SNNs with limited data. Our experimental results on both synthetic and real datasets show substantial improvements over existing models, with notable gains in Absolute Relative and Square Relative errors (49% and 39.77% improvements over the benchmark model Spike-T, respectively). Besides accuracy, the proposed model also demonstrates reduced power consumptions, a critical factor for practical applications. ",

To understand if an RS-enabled DNN is effective in the sampled input domains, it is mandatory to sample data points within the operational design domain, acquire the point-wise certificate regarding robustness radius, and compare it with pre-defined acceptance criteria. Consequently, ensuring that a point-wise robustness certificate for any given data point is obtained relatively cost-effectively is crucial. This work demonstrates that reducing the number of samples by one or two orders of magnitude can still enable the computation of a slightly smaller robustness radius (commonly ~20% radius reduction) with the same confidence. We provide the mathematical foundation for explaining the phenomenon while experimentally showing promising results on the standard CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets. ",

Compared to prior human-related anomaly detection tasks which primarily focus on unusual events from videos, HAAD involves the learning of specific action labels to recognize semantically anomalous human behaviors. To address this task, we propose a normalizing flow (NF)-based detection framework where the sample likelihood is effectively leveraged to indicate anomalies. As action anomalies often occur in some specific body parts, in addition to the full-body action feature learning, we incorporate extra encoding streams into our framework for a finer modeling of body subsets. Our framework is thus multi-level to jointly discover global and local motion anomalies. Furthermore, to show awareness of the potentially jittery data during recording, we resort to discrete cosine transformation by converting the action samples from the temporal to the frequency domain to mitigate the issue of data instability. Extensive experimental results on two human action datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms the baselines formed by adapting state-of-the-art human activity AD approaches to our task of HAAD.

    "abstract": "Over the years, multimodal mobile sensing has been used extensively for inferences regarding health and well being, behavior, and context. However, a significant challenge hindering the widespread deployment of such models in real world scenarios is the issue of distribution shift. This is the phenomenon where the distribution of data in the training set differs from the distribution of data in the real world, the deployment environment. While extensively explored in computer vision and natural language processing, and while prior research in mobile sensing briefly addresses this concern, current work primarily focuses on models dealing with a single modality of data, such as audio or accelerometer readings, and consequently, there is little research on unsupervised domain adaptation when dealing with multimodal sensor data. To address this gap, we did extensive experiments with domain adversarial neural networks (DANN) showing that they can effectively handle distribution shifts in multimodal sensor data. Moreover, we proposed a novel improvement over DANN, called M3BAT, unsupervised domain adaptation for multimodal mobile sensing with multi-branch adversarial training, to account for the multimodality of sensor data during domain adaptation with multiple branches. Through extensive experiments conducted on two multimodal mobile sensing datasets, three inference tasks, and 14 source-target domain pairs, including both regression and classification, we demonstrate that our approach performs effectively on unseen domains. Compared to directly deploying a model trained in the source domain to the target domain, the model shows performance increases up to 12% AUC (area under the receiver operating characteristics curves) on classification tasks, and up to 0.13 MAE (mean absolute error) on regression tasks.

Our approach addresses this with a novel environmental representation, the Behavior-Oriented Situational Graph, where we extend on the classical situational graph by merging a perception-driven backbone with prior actionable knowledge via a situational affordance schema. Linking situations to robot behaviors facilitates both autonomous mission planning and situational understanding of the operator. Planning over the graph is easier and faster, since it directly incorporates actionable information, which is critical for online mission systems. Moreover, the representation allows the human operator to seamlessly transition between different levels of autonomy of the robot, from remote control to behavior execution to full autonomous exploration. We test the effectiveness of our approach in a real-world drug lab scenario at a Dutch police training facility using a mobile Spot robot and use the results to iterate on the system design. ",

In 5 case studies of empirical privacy defenses, we find that prior evaluations underestimate privacy leakage by an order of magnitude.

    "abstract": "Low-light remote sensing images generally feature high resolution and high spatial complexity, with continuously distributed surface features in space. This continuity in scenes leads to extensive long-range correlations in spatial domains within remote sensing images. Convolutional Neural Networks, which rely on local correlations for long-distance modeling, struggle to establish long-range correlations in such images. On the other hand, transformer-based methods that focus on global information face high computational complexities when processing high-resolution remote sensing images. From another perspective, Fourier transform can compute global information without introducing a large number of parameters, enabling the network to more efficiently capture the overall image structure and establish long-range correlations. Therefore, we propose a Dual-Domain Feature Fusion Network (DFFN) for low-light remote sensing image enhancement. Specifically, this challenging task of low-light enhancement is divided into two more manageable sub-tasks: the first phase learns amplitude information to restore image brightness, and the second phase learns phase information to refine details. To facilitate information exchange between the two phases, we designed an information fusion affine block that combines data from different phases and scales. Additionally, we have constructed two dark light remote sensing datasets to address the current lack of datasets in dark light remote sensing image enhancement. Extensive evaluations show that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods. The code is available at https://github.com/iijjlk/DFFN. ",

    "abstract": "Context: Code annotations have gained widespread popularity in programming languages, offering developers the ability to attach metadata to code elements to define custom behaviors. Many modern frameworks and APIs use annotations to keep integration less verbose and located nearer to the corresponding code element. Despite these advantages, practitioners' anecdotal evidence suggests that annotations might negatively affect code readability. Objective: To better understand this effect, this paper systematically investigates the relationship between code annotations and code readability. Method: In a survey with software developers (n=332), we present 15 pairs of Java code snippets with and without code annotations. These pairs were designed considering five categories of annotation used in real-world Java frameworks and APIs. Survey participants selected the code snippet they considered more readable for each pair and answered an open question about how annotations affect the code's readability. Results: Preferences were scattered for all categories of annotation usage, revealing no consensus among participants. The answers were spread even when segregated by participants' programming or annotation-related experience. Nevertheless, some participants showed a consistent preference in favor or against annotations across all categories, which may indicate a personal preference. Our qualitative analysis of the open-ended questions revealed that participants often praise annotation impacts on design, maintainability, and productivity but expressed contrasting views on understandability and code clarity. Conclusions: Software developers and API designers can consider our results when deciding whether to use annotations, equipped with the insight that developers express contrasting views of the annotations' impact on code readability.

Therefore, a process that mitigates false detections is crucial for both safety and accuracy. While uncertainty-based thresholding shows promise, previous works demonstrate an imperfect correlation between uncertainty and detection errors. This hinders ideal thresholding, prompting us to further investigate the correlation and associated cost with different types of uncertainty. We therefore propose a cost-sensitive framework for object detection tailored to user-defined budgets on the two types of errors, missing and false detections. We derive minimum thresholding requirements to prevent performance degradation and define metrics to assess the applicability of uncertainty for failure recognition. Furthermore, we automate and optimize the thresholding process to maximize the failure recognition rate w.r.t. the specified budget. Evaluation on three autonomous driving datasets demonstrates that our approach significantly enhances safety, particularly in challenging scenarios. Leveraging localization aleatoric uncertainty and softmax-based entropy only, our method boosts the failure recognition rate by 36-60\\% compared to conventional approaches.

We prove that a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) defined by the NNGP contains only functions that can be approximated by the architecture. To achieve a certain approximation error the required number of neurons in each layer is defined by the RKHS norm of the target function. Moreover, the approximation can be constructed from a supervised dataset by a random multi-layer representation of an input vector, together with training of the last layer's weights. For a 2-layer NN and a domain equal to an $n-1$-dimensional sphere in ${\\mathbb R}^n$, we compare the number of neurons required by Barron's theorem and by the multi-layer features construction. We show that if eigenvalues of the integral operator of the NNGP decay slower than $k^{-n-\\frac{2}{3}}$ where $k$ is an order of an eigenvalue, then our theorem guarantees a more succinct neural network approximation than Barron's theorem.

Contrastive learning has witnessed success in image and natural language data, thanks to the domain-specific augmentation techniques that are both intuitive and effective. Nonetheless, in tabular domain, the predominant augmentation technique for creating views is through corrupting tabular entries via swapping values, which is not as sound or effective. We propose a simple yet powerful improvement to this augmentation technique: corrupting tabular data conditioned on class identity. Specifically, when corrupting a specific tabular entry from an anchor row, instead of randomly sampling a value in the same feature column from the entire table uniformly, we only sample from rows that are identified to be within the same class as the anchor row. We assume the semi-supervised learning setting, and adopt the pseudo labeling technique for obtaining class identities over all table rows. We also explore the novel idea of selecting features to be corrupted based on feature correlation structures. Extensive experiments show that the proposed approach consistently outperforms the conventional corruption method for tabular data classification tasks.

    "abstract": "Graph neural networks (GNNs) have emerged as a powerful tool for analyzing and learning from complex data structured as graphs, demonstrating remarkable effectiveness in various applications, such as social network analysis, recommendation systems, and drug discovery. However, despite their impressive performance, the fairness problem has increasingly gained attention as a crucial aspect to consider. Existing research in graph learning focuses on either group fairness or individual fairness. However, since each concept provides unique insights into fairness from distinct perspectives, integrating them into a fair graph neural network system is crucial. To the best of our knowledge, no study has yet to comprehensively tackle both individual and group fairness simultaneously. In this paper, we propose a new concept of individual fairness within groups and a novel framework named Fairness for Group and Individual (FairGI), which considers both group fairness and individual fairness within groups in the context of graph learning. FairGI employs the similarity matrix of individuals to achieve individual fairness within groups, while leveraging adversarial learning to address group fairness in terms of both Equal Opportunity and Statistical Parity. The experimental results demonstrate that our approach not only outperforms other state-of-the-art models in terms of group fairness and individual fairness within groups, but also exhibits excellent performance in population-level individual fairness, while maintaining comparable prediction accuracy.

Common practices involve constructing variance-based cost volumes for geometry reconstruction and encoding 3D descriptors for decoding novel views. However, existing methods show limited generalization ability in challenging conditions due to inaccurate geometry, sub-optimal descriptors, and decoding strategies. We address these issues point by point. First, we find the variance-based cost volume exhibits failure patterns as the features of pixels corresponding to the same point can be inconsistent across different views due to occlusions or reflections. We introduce an Adaptive Cost Aggregation (ACA) approach to amplify the contribution of consistent pixel pairs and suppress inconsistent ones. Unlike previous methods that solely fuse 2D features into descriptors, our approach introduces a Spatial-View Aggregator (SVA) to incorporate 3D context into descriptors through spatial and inter-view interaction. When decoding the descriptors, we observe the two existing decoding strategies excel in different areas, which are complementary. A Consistency-Aware Fusion (CAF) strategy is proposed to leverage the advantages of both. We incorporate the above ACA, SVA, and CAF into a coarse-to-fine framework, termed Geometry-aware Reconstruction and Fusion-refined Rendering (GeFu).

To address these limitations, we propose an effective Siamese-based framework to encode the semantic changes occurring in the bi-temporal RS images. The main focus of our design is to introduce a change encoder that leverages local and global feature representations to capture both subtle and large change feature information from multi-scale features to precisely estimate the change regions.

There are several ways to measure the importance of the vertices, e.g., by counting the number of edges that start or end at each vertex, or by using the subgraph centrality of the vertices. It is more difficult to assess the importance of the edges. One approach is to consider the line graph associated with the given network and determine the importance of the vertices of the line graph, but this is fairly complicated except for small networks. This paper compares two approaches to estimate the importance of edges of medium-sized to large networks. One approach computes partial derivatives of the total communicability of the weights of the edges, where a partial derivative of large magnitude indicates that the corresponding edge may be important. Our second approach computes the Perron sensitivity of the edges. A high sensitivity signals that the edge may be important. The performance of these methods and some computational aspects are discussed. Applications of interest include to determine whether a network can be replaced by a network with fewer edges with about the same communicability. ",

    "abstract": "Molecular simulations have assumed a paramount role in the fields of chemistry, biology, and material sciences, being able to capture the intricate dynamic properties of systems. Within this realm, coarse-grained (CG) techniques have emerged as invaluable tools to sample large-scale systems and reach extended timescales by simplifying system representation. However, CG approaches come with a trade-off: they sacrifice atomistic details that might hold significant relevance in deciphering the investigated process. Therefore, a recommended approach is to identify key CG conformations and process them using backmapping methods, which retrieve atomistic coordinates. Currently, rule-based methods yield subpar geometries and rely on energy relaxation, resulting in less-than-optimal outcomes. Conversely, machine learning techniques offer higher accuracy but are either limited in transferability between systems or tied to specific CG mappings. In this work, we introduce HEroBM, a dynamic and scalable method that employs deep equivariant graph neural networks and a hierarchical approach to achieve high-resolution backmapping. HEroBM handles any type of CG mapping, offering a versatile and efficient protocol for reconstructing atomistic structures with high accuracy. Focused on local principles, HEroBM spans the entire chemical space and is transferable to systems of varying sizes. We illustrate the versatility of our framework through diverse biological systems, including a complex real-case scenario. Here, our end-to-end backmapping approach accurately generates the atomistic coordinates of a G protein-coupled receptor bound to an organic small molecule within a cholesterol/phospholipid bilayer.

In particular, we show how to account for additional uncertainty resulting from a training process based on cross-fitting. The primary advantage of Neyman's approach is that it can be applied to any ITR regardless of the properties of machine learning algorithms that are used to derive the ITR. We also show, somewhat surprisingly, that for certain metrics, it is more efficient to conduct this ex-post experimental evaluation of an ITR than to conduct an ex-ante experimental evaluation that randomly assigns some units to the ITR. Our analysis demonstrates that Neyman's repeated sampling framework is as relevant for causal inference today as it has been since its inception. ",

    "abstract": "Considering the high computational demands of most methods, using network communication models to simulate the brain is a more economical way. However, despite numerous brain network communication models, there is still insufficient evidence that they can effectively replicate the real activation patterns of the brain. Moreover, it remains unclear whether actual network structures are crucial in simulating intelligence. Addressing these issues, we propose a large scale network communication model based on simple rules and design criteria to assess the differences between network models and real situations. We conduct research on the biggest adult Drosophila connectome data set. Experimental results show significant activation in neurons that should respond to stimulus and slight activation in irrelevant ones, which we call quasi-real activation pattern. Besides, when we change the network structure, the quasi-activation patterns disappear. Interestingly, activation regions have shorter network distances to their input neurons, implying that the network structure (not spatial distance) is the core to form brain functionality. In addition, giving the input neurons a unilateral stimulus, we observe a bilateral response, which is consistent with reality. Then we find that both hemispheres have extremely similar statistical indicators. We also develop real-time 3D large spatial network visualization software to observe and document experimental phenomena, filling the software gap. This research reveals network models' power: it can reach the quasi-activation pattern even with simple propagation rules. Besides, it provides evidence that network structure matters in brain activity pattern generation. Future research could fully simulate brain behavior through network models, paving the way for artificial intelligence by developing new propagation rules and optimizing link weights. ",

Traditional models often struggle to dynamically adjust feature importance, resulting in suboptimal representation, particularly in tasks like semantic segmentation crucial for accurate structure delineation. Moreover, their static nature incurs high computational costs. To tackle these issues, we introduce Mamba-Ahnet, a novel integration of State Space Model (SSM) and Advanced Hierarchical Network (AHNet) within the MAMBA framework, specifically tailored for semantic segmentation in medical imaging.Mamba-Ahnet combines SSM's feature extraction and comprehension with AHNet's attention mechanisms and image reconstruction, aiming to enhance segmentation accuracy and robustness. By dissecting images into patches and refining feature comprehension through self-attention mechanisms, the approach significantly improves feature resolution. Integration of AHNet into the MAMBA framework further enhances segmentation performance by selectively amplifying informative regions and facilitating the learning of rich hierarchical representations. Evaluation on the Universal Lesion Segmentation dataset demonstrates superior performance compared to state-of-the-art techniques, with notable metrics such as a Dice similarity coefficient of approximately 98% and an Intersection over Union of about 83%. These results underscore the potential of our methodology to enhance diagnostic accuracy, treatment planning, and ultimately, patient outcomes in clinical practice.

    "title": "Similarity Equivariant Graph Neural Networks for Homogenization of  Metamaterials",
    "abstract": "Soft, porous mechanical metamaterials exhibit pattern transformations that may have important applications in soft robotics, sound reduction and biomedicine. To design these innovative materials, it is important to be able to simulate them accurately and quickly, in order to tune their mechanical properties. Since conventional simulations using the finite element method entail a high computational cost, in this article we aim to develop a machine learning-based approach that scales favorably to serve as a surrogate model. To ensure that the model is also able to handle various microstructures, including those not encountered during training, we include the microstructure as part of the network input. Therefore, we introduce a graph neural network that predicts global quantities (energy, stress stiffness) as well as the pattern transformations that occur (the kinematics). To make our model as accurate and data-efficient as possible, various symmetries are incorporated into the model. The starting point is an E(n)-equivariant graph neural network (which respects translation, rotation and reflection) that has periodic boundary conditions (i.e., it is in-/equivariant with respect to the choice of RVE), is scale in-/equivariant, can simulate large deformations, and can predict scalars, vectors as well as second and fourth order tensors (specifically energy, stress and stiffness). The incorporation of scale equivariance makes the model equivariant with respect to the similarities group, of which the Euclidean group E(n) is a subgroup. We show that this network is more accurate and data-efficient than graph neural networks with fewer symmetries. To create an efficient graph representation of the finite element discretization, we use only the internal geometrical hole boundaries from the finite element mesh to achieve a better speed-up and scaling with the mesh size.

    "title": "Quantum Adjoint Convolutional Layers for Effective Data Representation",
    "abstract": "Quantum Convolutional Layer (QCL) is considered as one of the core of Quantum Convolutional Neural Networks (QCNNs) due to its efficient data feature extraction capability. However, the current principle of QCL is not as mathematically understandable as Classical Convolutional Layer (CCL) due to its black-box structure. Moreover, classical data mapping in many QCLs is inefficient. To this end, firstly, the Quantum Adjoint Convolution Operation (QACO) consisting of a quantum amplitude encoding and its inverse is theoretically shown to be equivalent to the quantum normalization of the convolution operation based on the Frobenius inner product while achieving an efficient characterization of the data. Subsequently, QACO is extended into a Quantum Adjoint Convolutional Layer (QACL) by Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE) to compute all Frobenius inner products in parallel. At last, comparative simulation experiments are carried out on PennyLane and TensorFlow platforms, mainly for the two cases of kernel fixed and unfixed in QACL. The results demonstrate that QACL with the insight of special quantum properties for the same images, provides higher training accuracy in MNIST and Fashion MNIST classification experiments, but sacrifices the learning performance to some extent. Predictably, our research lays the foundation for the development of efficient and interpretable quantum convolutional networks and also advances the field of quantum machine vision. ",

    "abstract": "Deep learning algorithms provide a new paradigm to study high-dimensional dynamical behaviors, such as those in fusion plasma systems. Development of novel model reduction methods, coupled with detection of abnormal modes with plasma physics, opens a unique opportunity for building efficient models to identify plasma instabilities for real-time control. Our Fusion Transfer Learning (FTL) model demonstrates success in reconstructing nonlinear kink mode structures by learning from a limited amount of nonlinear simulation data. The knowledge transfer process leverages a pre-trained neural encoder-decoder network, initially trained on linear simulations, to effectively capture nonlinear dynamics. The low-dimensional embeddings extract the coherent structures of interest, while preserving the inherent dynamics of the complex system. Experimental results highlight FTL's capacity to capture transitional behaviors and dynamical features in plasma dynamics -- a task often challenging for conventional methods. The model developed in this study is generalizable and can be extended broadly through transfer learning to address various magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) modes. ",

    "abstract": "There is a growing interest in estimating heterogeneous treatment effects across individuals using their high-dimensional feature attributes. Achieving high performance in such high-dimensional heterogeneous treatment effect estimation is challenging because in this setup, it is usual that some features induce sample selection bias while others do not but are predictive of potential outcomes. To avoid losing such predictive feature information, existing methods learn separate feature representations using the inverse of probability weighting (IPW). However, due to the numerically unstable IPW weights, they suffer from estimation bias under a finite sample setup. To develop a numerically robust estimator via weighted representation learning, we propose a differentiable Pareto-smoothed weighting framework that replaces extreme weight values in an end-to-end fashion. Experimental results show that by effectively correcting the weight values, our method outperforms the existing ones, including traditional weighting schemes. ",
