    "abstract": "When applying the Transformer architecture to source code, designing a good self-attention mechanism is critical as it affects how node relationship is extracted from the Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs) of the source code. We present Code Structure Aware Transformer (CSA-Trans), which uses Code Structure Embedder (CSE) to generate specific PE for each node in AST. CSE generates node Positional Encoding (PE) using disentangled attention. To further extend the self-attention capability, we adopt Stochastic Block Model (SBM) attention. Our evaluation shows that our PE captures the relationships between AST nodes better than other graph-related PE techniques. We also show through quantitative and qualitative analysis that SBM attention is able to generate more node specific attention coefficients. We demonstrate that CSA-Trans outperforms 14 baselines in code summarization tasks for both Python and Java, while being 41.92% faster and 25.31% memory efficient in Java dataset compared to AST-Trans and SG-Trans respectively.

    "abstract": "Training an effective deep learning model to learn ocean processes involves careful choices of various hyperparameters. We leverage DeepHyper's advanced search algorithms for multiobjective optimization, streamlining the development of neural networks tailored for ocean modeling. The focus is on optimizing Fourier neural operators (FNOs), a data-driven model capable of simulating complex ocean behaviors. Selecting the correct model and tuning the hyperparameters are challenging tasks, requiring much effort to ensure model accuracy. DeepHyper allows efficient exploration of hyperparameters associated with data preprocessing, FNO architecture-related hyperparameters, and various model training strategies. We aim to obtain an optimal set of hyperparameters leading to the most performant model. Moreover, on top of the commonly used mean squared error for model training, we propose adopting the negative anomaly correlation coefficient as the additional loss term to improve model performance and investigate the potential trade-off between the two terms. The experimental results show that the optimal set of hyperparameters enhanced model performance in single timestepping forecasting and greatly exceeded the baseline configuration in the autoregressive rollout for long-horizon forecasting up to 30 days. Utilizing DeepHyper, we demonstrate an approach to enhance the use of FNOs in ocean dynamics forecasting, offering a scalable solution with improved precision. ",

    "abstract": "The process of training an artificial neural network involves iteratively adapting its parameters so as to minimize the error of the network's prediction, when confronted with a learning task. This iterative change can be naturally interpreted as a trajectory in network space -- a time series of networks -- and thus the training algorithm (e.g. gradient descent optimization of a suitable loss function) can be interpreted as a dynamical system in graph space. In order to illustrate this interpretation, here we study the dynamical properties of this process by analyzing through this lens the network trajectories of a shallow neural network, and its evolution through learning a simple classification task. We systematically consider different ranges of the learning rate and explore both the dynamical and orbital stability of the resulting network trajectories, finding hints of regular and chaotic behavior depending on the learning rate regime. Our findings are put in contrast to common wisdom on convergence properties of neural networks and dynamical systems theory.

    "abstract": "Adaptive machine learning (ML) aims to allow ML models to adapt to ever-changing environments with potential concept drift after model deployment. Traditionally, adaptive ML requires a new dataset to be manually labeled to tailor deployed models to altered data distributions. Recently, an interactive causality based self-labeling method was proposed to autonomously associate causally related data streams for domain adaptation, showing promising results compared to traditional feature similarity-based semi-supervised learning. Several unanswered research questions remain, including self-labeling's compatibility with multivariate causality and the quantitative analysis of the auxiliary models used in the self-labeling. The auxiliary models, the interaction time model (ITM) and the effect state detector (ESD), are vital to the success of self-labeling. This paper further develops the self-labeling framework and its theoretical foundations to address these research questions. A framework for the application of self-labeling to multivariate causal graphs is proposed using four basic causal relationships, and the impact of non-ideal ITM and ESD performance is analyzed. A simulated experiment is conducted based on a multivariate causal graph, validating the proposed theory. ",

Here we provide sufficient conditions so that asynchronous local rule applications conspire to produce well-determined events in the space-time unfolding of the graph, regardless of their application orders.

To address this challenge, we introduce the merge tree neural networks (MTNN), a learned neural network model designed for merge tree comparison. The MTNN enables rapid and high-quality similarity computation. We first demonstrate how graph neural networks (GNNs), which emerged as an effective encoder for graphs, can be trained to produce embeddings of merge trees in vector spaces that enable efficient similarity comparison. Next, we formulate the novel MTNN model that further improves the similarity comparisons by integrating the tree and node embeddings with a new topological attention mechanism. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our model on real-world data in different domains and examine our model's generalizability across various datasets. Our experimental analysis demonstrates our approach's superiority in accuracy and efficiency.

Existing jailbreaking defense methods have failed to address the fundamental issue that harmful knowledge resides within the model, leading to potential jailbreak risks for LLMs. In this paper, we propose a novel defense method called Eraser, which mainly includes three goals: unlearning harmful knowledge, retaining general knowledge, and maintaining safety alignment. The intuition is that if an LLM forgets the specific knowledge required to answer a harmful question, it will no longer have the ability to answer harmful questions. The training of Erase does not actually require the model's own harmful knowledge, and it can benefit from unlearning general answers related to harmful queries, which means it does not need assistance from the red team. The experimental results show that Eraser can significantly reduce the jailbreaking success rate for various attacks without compromising the general capabilities of the model. ",

The most successful approaches to date use metaheuristic algorithms to search through the space of solutions by applying low-level heuristics that randomly alter routes in a network. The design of these low-level heuristics has a major impact on the quality of the result. In this paper we use deep reinforcement learning with graph neural nets to learn low-level heuristics for an evolutionary algorithm, instead of designing them manually. These learned heuristics improve the algorithm's results on benchmark synthetic cities with 70 nodes or more, and obtain state-of-the-art results when optimizing operating costs. They also improve upon a simulation of the real transit network in the city of Laval, Canada, by as much as 54% and 18% on two key metrics, and offer cost savings of up to 12% over the city's existing transit network.

Consequently, embedding sensing into communication has gained considerable attention. In this work, we propose an alternative approach for optimizing integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) waveform for target detection by concurrently maximizing the power of the communication signal at an intended user and minimizing the multi-user and sensing interference. We formulate the problem as a non-disciplined convex programming (NDCP) optimization and we use a distribution-based approach for interference cancellation. Precisely, we establish the distribution of the communication signal and the multi-user communication interference received by the intended user, and thereafter, we establish that the sensing interference can be distributed as a centralized Chi-squared if the sensing covariance matrix is idempotent. We design such a matrix based on the symmetrical idempotent property. Additionally, we propose a disciplined convex programming (DCP) form of the problem, and using successive convex approximation (SCA), we show that the solutions can reach a stable waveform for efficient target detection. Furthermore, we compare the proposed waveform with state of the art radar-communication waveform designs and demonstrate its superior performance by computer simulations. ",

Numerical examples show that these networks are FLOP-efficient for sufficiently oscillatory integrands with an average FLOP gain of 1000 FLOPs. The network calculates oscillatory integrals better than traditional quadrature methods under the same computational budget or number of floating point operations. We find that feed-forward networks of 5 hidden layers are satisfactory for a relative accuracy of 0.001.

Furthermore, under certain additional conditions, the accurate algorithm can achieve a relative error bound of $O(u^2)$ in the presence of moderate overlaps in the inputs in faithful rounding. Consequently, in double-word multiplication and addition operations, we can safely omit the normalization step of double-word multiplication and replace the accurate addition algorithm with the sloppy one. Numerical experiments confirm that this approach nearly doubles the performance of double-word multiplication and addition operations, with negligible precision costs. Moreover, in directed rounding mode, the signs of the errors of the two algorithms are consistent with the rounding direction, even in the presence of input overlap. This allows us to avoid changing the rounding mode in interval arithmetic. We also prove that the relative error bound of the sloppy addition algorithm exceeds $3u^2$ if and only if the input meets the condition of Sterbenz's Lemma when rounding to nearest. These findings suggest that the two addition algorithms are more robust than previously believed. ",

The second problem is to optimize the computation of motifs by graph partitioning, which has not been focused by previous works. First, the formal definitions of the above two problems are introduced, and the semidefinite programming representations are also designed based on the analysis of the properties of the two problems. For the motif based partitioning problem, it is proved to be NP-complete even for the special case of $k=2$ and the motif is a triangle, and its inapproximability is also shown by proving that there are no efficient algorithms with finite approximation ratio.

    "title": "Deep Learning-Based Out-of-distribution Source Code Data Identification:  How Far We Have Gone?",
    "abstract": "Software vulnerabilities (SVs) have become a common, serious, and crucial concern to safety-critical security systems. That leads to significant progress in the use of AI-based methods for software vulnerability detection (SVD). In practice, although AI-based methods have been achieving promising performances in SVD and other domain applications (e.g., computer vision), they are well-known to fail in detecting the ground-truth label of input data (referred to as out-of-distribution, OOD, data) lying far away from the training data distribution (i.e., in-distribution, ID). This drawback leads to serious issues where the models fail to indicate when they are likely mistaken. To address this problem, OOD detectors (i.e., determining whether an input is ID or OOD) have been applied before feeding the input data to the downstream AI-based modules. While OOD detection has been widely designed for computer vision and medical diagnosis applications, automated AI-based techniques for OOD source code data detection have not yet been well-studied and explored. To this end, in this paper, we propose an innovative deep learning-based approach addressing the OOD source code data identification problem. Our method is derived from an information-theoretic perspective with the use of innovative cluster-contrastive learning to effectively learn and leverage source code characteristics, enhancing data representation learning for solving the problem. The rigorous and comprehensive experiments on real-world source code datasets show the effectiveness and advancement of our approach compared to state-of-the-art baselines by a wide margin. In short, on average, our method achieves a significantly higher performance from around 15.27%, 7.39%, and 4.93% on the FPR, AUROC, and AUPR measures, respectively, in comparison with the baselines.

We propose the first attempt to optimize the retrieval models that deliver a limited number of personal documents to large language models for the purpose of personalized generation. We develop two optimization algorithms that solicit feedback from the downstream personalized generation tasks for retrieval optimization--one based on reinforcement learning whose reward function is defined using any arbitrary metric for personalized generation and another based on knowledge distillation from the downstream LLM to the retrieval model. This paper also introduces a pre- and post-generation retriever selection model that decides what retriever to choose for each LLM input. Extensive experiments on diverse tasks from the language model personalization (LaMP) benchmark reveal statistically significant improvements in six out of seven datasets. ",

    "abstract": "Machine Learning (ML) has been demonstrated to improve productivity in many manufacturing applications. To host these ML applications, several software and Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) systems have been proposed for manufacturing applications to deploy ML applications and provide real-time intelligence. Recently, an interactive causality enabled self-labeling method has been proposed to advance adaptive ML applications in cyber-physical systems, especially manufacturing, by automatically adapting and personalizing ML models after deployment to counter data distribution shifts. The unique features of the self-labeling method require a novel software system to support dynamism at various levels. This paper proposes the AdaptIoT system, comprised of an end-to-end data streaming pipeline, ML service integration, and an automated self-labeling service. The self-labeling service consists of causal knowledge bases and automated full-cycle self-labeling workflows to adapt multiple ML models simultaneously. AdaptIoT employs a containerized microservice architecture to deliver a scalable and portable solution for small and medium-sized manufacturers. A field demonstration of a self-labeling adaptive ML application is conducted with a makerspace and shows reliable performance. ",

    "abstract": "Characterization of joint probability distribution for large networks of random variables remains a challenging task in data science. Probabilistic graph approximation with simple topologies has practically been resorted to; typically the tree topology makes joint probability computation much simpler and can be effective for statistical inference on insufficient data. However, to characterize network components where multiple variables cooperate closely to influence others, model topologies beyond a tree are needed, which unfortunately are infeasible to acquire. In particular, our previous work has related optimal approximation of Markov networks of tree-width k >=2 closely to the graph-theoretic problem of finding maximum spanning k-tree (MSkT), which is a provably intractable task. This paper investigates optimal approximation of Markov networks with k-tree topology that retains some designated underlying subgraph. Such a subgraph may encode certain background information that arises in scientific applications, for example, about a known significant pathway in gene networks or the indispensable backbone connectivity in the residue interaction graphs for a biomolecule 3D structure. In particular, it is proved that the \\beta-retaining MSkT problem, for a number of classes \\beta of graphs, admit O(n^{k+1})-time algorithms for every fixed k>= 1. These \\beta-retaining MSkT algorithms offer efficient solutions for approximation of Markov networks with k-tree topology in the situation where certain persistent information needs to be retained.

Researchers have observed a direct correlation between the performance of these models and their sizes. As a result, the sizes of these models have notably expanded in recent years, persuading researchers to adopt the term large language models (LLMs) to characterize the larger-sized PLMs. The increased size is accompanied by a distinct capability known as in-context learning (ICL), which represents a specialized form of prompting. This enables the utilization of LLMs for specific downstream tasks by presenting them with demonstration examples while keeping the model parameters frozen. Although interesting, privacy concerns have become a major obstacle in its widespread usage. Multiple studies have examined the privacy risks linked to ICL and prompting in general, and have devised techniques to alleviate these risks. Thus, there is a necessity to organize these mitigation techniques for the benefit of the community. This survey provides a systematic overview of the privacy protection methods employed during ICL and prompting in general. We review, analyze, and compare different methods under this paradigm. Furthermore, we provide a summary of the resources accessible for the development of these frameworks. Finally, we discuss the limitations of these frameworks and offer a detailed examination of the promising areas that necessitate further exploration. ",

Evolutionary algorithms are particularly effective in these scenarios, as they can easily adapt to uncertain and changing environments but often uncertainty and dynamic changes are studied in isolation. In this paper, we explore the use of 3-objective evolutionary algorithms for the chance constrained knapsack problem with dynamic constraints. In our setting, the weights of the items are stochastic and the knapsack's capacity changes over time. We introduce a 3-objective formulation that is able to deal with the stochastic and dynamic components at the same time and is independent of the confidence level required for the constraint. This new approach is then compared to the 2-objective formulation which is limited to a single confidence level. We evaluate the approach using two different multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs), namely the global simple evolutionary multi-objective optimizer (GSEMO) and the multi-objective evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition (MOEA/D), across various benchmark scenarios. Our analysis highlights the advantages of the 3-objective formulation over the 2-objective formulation in addressing the dynamic chance constrained knapsack problem. ",

    "abstract": "Distributed massive multiple-input multiple output (mMIMO) system for low earth orbit (LEO) satellite networks is introduced as a promising technique to provide broadband connectivity. Nevertheless, several challenges persist in implementing distributed mMIMO systems for LEO satellite networks. These challenges include providing scalable massive access implementation as the system complexity increases with network size. Another challenging issue is the asynchronous arrival of signals at the user terminals due to the different propagation delays among distributed antennas in space, which destroys the coherent transmission, and consequently degrades the system performance. In this paper, we propose a scalable distributed mMIMO system for LEO satellite networks based on dynamic user-centric clustering. Aiming to obtain scalable implementation, new algorithms for initial cooperative access, cluster selection, and cluster handover are provided. In addition, phase shift-aware precoding is implemented to compensate for the propagation delay phase shifts. The performance of the proposed user-centric distributed mMIMO is compared with two baseline configurations: the non-cooperative transmission systems, where each user connects to only a single satellite, and the full-cooperative distributed mMIMO systems, where all satellites contribute serving each user. The numerical results show the potential of the proposed distributed mMIMO system to enhance system spectral efficiency when compared to noncooperative transmission systems. Additionally, it demonstrates the ability to minimize the serving cluster size for each user, thereby reducing the overall system complexity in comparison to the full-cooperative distributed mMIMO systems.

Unlike object detection or semantic segmentation, which focus on identifying objects and outlining boundaries, faciallandmark detection aims to precisely locate and track critical facial features. However, deploying deep learning-based facial-landmark detection models on embedded systems with limited computational resources poses challenges due to the complexity of facial features, especially in dynamic settings. Additionally, ensuring robustness across diverse ethnicities and expressions presents further obstacles. Existing datasets often lack comprehensive representation of facial nuances, particularly within populations like those in Taiwan. This paper introduces a novel approach to address these challenges through the development of a knowledge distillation method. By transferring knowledge from larger models to smaller ones, we aim to create lightweight yet powerful deep learning models tailored specifically for facial-landmark detection tasks. Our goal is to design models capable of accurately locating facial landmarks under varying conditions, including diverse expressions, orientations, and lighting environments. The ultimate objective is to achieve high accuracy and real-time performance suitable for deployment on embedded systems.

Specifically, our approach transforms independent low-resolution representations in the coarse-grained continuous function space into refined representations with enriched spatiotemporal details in the fine-grained continuous function space. To achieve efficient and accurate MEMC, we design a Galerkin-type attention function to perform frame alignment and temporal interpolation. Due to the linear complexity of the Galerkin-type attention mechanism, our model avoids patch partitioning and offers global receptive fields, enabling precise estimation of large motions.

In this problem, the goal is to efficiently maintain an approximate maximum matching of a graph that is subject to edge insertions and deletions. Our focus is particularly on algorithms that maintain the edges of a $(1-\\epsilon)$-approximate maximum matching for an arbitrarily small constant $\\epsilon > 0$. Until recently, the fastest known algorithm for this problem required $\\Theta(n)$ time per update where $n$ is the number of vertices. This bound was slightly improved to $n/(\\log^* n)^{\\Omega(1)}$ by Assadi, Behnezhad, Khanna, and Li [STOC'23] and very recently to $n/2^{\\Omega(\\sqrt{\\log n})}$ by Liu [ArXiv'24]. Whether this can be improved to $n^{1-\\Omega(1)}$ remains a major open problem. In this paper, we present a new algorithm that maintains a $(1-\\epsilon)$-approximate maximum matching. The update-time of our algorithm is parametrized based on the density of a certain class of graphs that we call Ordered Ruzsa-Szemer\\'edi (ORS) graphs, a generalization of the well-known Ruzsa-Szemer\\'edi graphs. While determining the density of ORS (or RS) remains a hard problem in combinatorics, we prove that if the existing constructions of ORS graphs are optimal, then our algorithm runs in $n^{1/2+O(\\epsilon)}$ time for any fixed $\\epsilon > 0$ which would be significantly faster than existing near-linear in $n$ time algorithms. Our second main contribution is a better upper bound on density of both ORS and RS graphs with linear size matchings. The previous best upper bound was due to a proof of the triangle-removal lemma from more than a decade ago due to Fox [Annals of Mathematics '11]. ",

Such a process finds wide application in various fields, such as finance and healthcare. While the primary objective of AD is to yield high detection accuracy, the requirements of explainability and privacy are also paramount. The first ensures the transparency of the AD process, while the second guarantees that no sensitive information is leaked to untrusted parties. In this work, we exploit the trade-off of applying Explainable AI (XAI) through SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) and differential privacy (DP). We perform AD with different models and on various datasets, and we thoroughly evaluate the cost of privacy in terms of decreased accuracy and explainability. Our results show that the enforcement of privacy through DP has a significant impact on detection accuracy and explainability, which depends on both the dataset and the considered AD model. We further show that the visual interpretation of explanations is also influenced by the choice of the AD algorithm. ",

    "abstract": "In recent advancements in novel view synthesis, generalizable Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) based methods applied to human subjects have shown remarkable results in generating novel views from few images. However, this generalization ability cannot capture the underlying structural features of the skeleton shared across all instances. Building upon this, we introduce HFNeRF: a novel generalizable human feature NeRF aimed at generating human biomechanic features using a pre-trained image encoder. While previous human NeRF methods have shown promising results in the generation of photorealistic virtual avatars, such methods lack underlying human structure or biomechanic features such as skeleton or joint information that are crucial for downstream applications including Augmented Reality (AR)/Virtual Reality (VR). HFNeRF leverages 2D pre-trained foundation models toward learning human features in 3D using neural rendering, and then volume rendering towards generating 2D feature maps. We evaluate HFNeRF in the skeleton estimation task by predicting heatmaps as features. The proposed method is fully differentiable, allowing to successfully learn color, geometry, and human skeleton in a simultaneous manner. This paper presents preliminary results of HFNeRF, illustrating its potential in generating realistic virtual avatars with biomechanic features using NeRF. ",

    "abstract": "Estimating the rigid transformation with 6 degrees of freedom based on a putative 3D correspondence set is a crucial procedure in point cloud registration. Existing correspondence identification methods usually lead to large outlier ratios ($>$ 95 $\\%$ is common), underscoring the significance of robust registration methods. Many researchers turn to parameter search-based strategies (e.g., Branch-and-Bround) for robust registration. Although related methods show high robustness, their efficiency is limited to the high-dimensional search space. This paper proposes a heuristics-guided parameter search strategy to accelerate the search while maintaining high robustness. We first sample some correspondences (i.e., heuristics) and then just need to sequentially search the feasible regions that make each sample an inlier. Our strategy largely reduces the search space and can guarantee accuracy with only a few inlier samples, therefore enjoying an excellent trade-off between efficiency and robustness. Since directly parameterizing the 6-dimensional nonlinear feasible region for efficient search is intractable, we construct a three-stage decomposition pipeline to reparameterize the feasible region, resulting in three lower-dimensional sub-problems that are easily solvable via our strategy. Besides reducing the searching dimension, our decomposition enables the leverage of 1-dimensional interval stabbing at all three stages for searching acceleration. Moreover, we propose a valid sampling strategy to guarantee our sampling effectiveness, and a compatibility verification setup to further accelerate our search. Extensive experiments on both simulated and real-world datasets demonstrate that our approach exhibits comparable robustness with state-of-the-art methods while achieving a significant efficiency boost.

Despite its potential, traditional clustering methods in scRNA-seq data analysis often neglect the structural information embedded in gene expression profiles, crucial for understanding cellular correlations and dependencies. Existing strategies, including graph neural networks, face challenges in handling the inefficiency due to scRNA-seq data's intrinsic high-dimension and high-sparsity. Addressing these limitations, we introduce scCDCG (single-cell RNA-seq Clustering via Deep Cut-informed Graph), a novel framework designed for efficient and accurate clustering of scRNA-seq data that simultaneously utilizes intercellular high-order structural information. scCDCG comprises three main components: (i) A graph embedding module utilizing deep cut-informed techniques, which effectively captures intercellular high-order structural information, overcoming the over-smoothing and inefficiency issues prevalent in prior graph neural network methods. (ii) A self-supervised learning module guided by optimal transport, tailored to accommodate the unique complexities of scRNA-seq data, specifically its high-dimension and high-sparsity. (iii) An autoencoder-based feature learning module that simplifies model complexity through effective dimension reduction and feature extraction. Our extensive experiments on 6 datasets demonstrate scCDCG's superior performance and efficiency compared to 7 established models, underscoring scCDCG's potential as a transformative tool in scRNA-seq data analysis.

To address these issues, we propose YOLC (You Only Look Clusters), an efficient and effective framework that builds on an anchor-free object detector, CenterNet. To overcome the challenges posed by large-scale images and non-uniform object distribution, we introduce a Local Scale Module (LSM) that adaptively searches cluster regions for zooming in for accurate detection. Additionally, we modify the regression loss using Gaussian Wasserstein distance (GWD) to obtain high-quality bounding boxes. Deformable convolution and refinement methods are employed in the detection head to enhance the detection of small objects. We perform extensive experiments on two aerial image datasets, including Visdrone2019 and UAVDT, to demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our proposed approach. ",

    "abstract": "Open-vocabulary human-object interaction (HOI) detection, which is concerned with the problem of detecting novel HOIs guided by natural language, is crucial for understanding human-centric scenes. However, prior zero-shot HOI detectors often employ the same levels of feature maps to model HOIs with varying distances, leading to suboptimal performance in scenes containing human-object pairs with a wide range of distances. In addition, these detectors primarily rely on category names and overlook the rich contextual information that language can provide, which is essential for capturing open vocabulary concepts that are typically rare and not well-represented by category names alone. In this paper, we introduce a novel end-to-end open vocabulary HOI detection framework with conditional multi-level decoding and fine-grained semantic enhancement (CMD-SE), harnessing the potential of Visual-Language Models (VLMs). Specifically, we propose to model human-object pairs with different distances with different levels of feature maps by incorporating a soft constraint during the bipartite matching process. Furthermore, by leveraging large language models (LLMs) such as GPT models, we exploit their extensive world knowledge to generate descriptions of human body part states for various interactions. Then we integrate the generalizable and fine-grained semantics of human body parts to improve interaction recognition. Experimental results on two datasets, SWIG-HOI and HICO-DET, demonstrate that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art results in open vocabulary HOI detection.

Due to characteristics such as the ability to hover and carry cargo on-board, rotary-wing UAVs have been considered suitable platforms for carrying communications nodes, including Wi-Fi Access Points and cellular Base Stations. This gave rise to the concept of Flying Networks (FNs), now making part of the so-called Non-Terrestrial Networks (NTNs) defined in 3GPP. In scenarios where the deployment of terrestrial networks is not feasible, the use of FNs has emerged as a solution to provide wireless connectivity. However, the management of the communications resources in FNs imposes significant challenges, especially regarding the positioning of the UAVs so that the Quality of Service (QoS) offered to the Ground Users (GUs) and devices is maximized. Moreover, unlike terrestrial networks that are directly connected to the power grid, UAVs typically rely on on-board batteries that need to be recharged. In order to maximize the UAVs' flying time, the energy consumed by the UAVs needs to be minimized. When it comes to multi-UAV placement, most state-of-the-art solutions focus on maximizing the coverage area and assume that the UAVs keep hovering in a fixed position while serving GUs. Also, they do not address the energy-aware multi-UAV placement problem in networking scenarios where the GUs may have different QoS requirements and may not be uniformly distributed across the area of interest. In this work, we propose the Sustainable multi-UAV Performance-aware Placement (SUPPLY) algorithm. SUPPLY defines the energy and performance-aware positioning of multiple UAVs in an FN. To accomplish this, SUPPLY defines trajectories that minimize UAVs' energy consumption, while ensuring the targeted QoS levels. The obtained results show up to 25% energy consumption reduction with minimal impact on throughput and delay. ",

While there has been a growing focus on OOD detection in visual data, the field of textual OOD detection has received less attention. Only a few attempts have been made to directly apply general OOD detection methods to natural language processing (NLP) tasks, without adequately considering the characteristics of textual data. In this paper, we delve into textual OOD detection with Transformers. We first identify a key problem prevalent in existing OOD detection methods: the biased representation learned through the maximization of the conditional likelihood $p(y\\mid x)$ can potentially result in subpar performance. We then propose a novel variational inference framework for OOD detection (VI-OOD), which maximizes the likelihood of the joint distribution $p(x, y)$ instead of $p(y\\mid x)$. VI-OOD is tailored for textual OOD detection by efficiently exploiting the representations of pre-trained Transformers.

To reduce the amount of aforementioned manual work, defects within sewer pipes should be located and classified automatically. In the past, multiple works have attempted solving this problem using classical image processing, machine learning, or a combination of those. However, each provided solution only focus on detecting a limited set of defect/structure types, such as fissure, root, and/or connection. Furthermore, due to the use of hand-crafted features and small training datasets, generalization is also problematic. In order to overcome these deficits, a sizable dataset with 14.7 km of various sewer pipes were annotated by sewer maintenance experts in the scope of this work. On top of that, an object detector (EfficientDet-D0) was trained for automatic defect detection. From the result of several expermients, peculiar natures of defects in the context of object detection, which greatly effect annotation and training process, are found and discussed. At the end, the final detector was able to detect 83% of defects in the test set; out of the missing 17%, only 0.77% are very severe defects. This work provides an example of applying deep learning-based object detection into an important but quiet engineering field. It also gives some practical pointers on how to annotate peculiar \"object\", such as defects. ",

However, due to the participation of a large number of clients, it is often difficult to profile and verify each client, which leads to a security threat that malicious participants may hamper the accuracy of the trained model by conveying poisoned models during the training. Hence, the aggregation framework at the parameter server also needs to minimize the detrimental effects of these malicious clients. A plethora of attack and defence strategies have been analyzed in the literature. However, often the Byzantine problem is analyzed solely from the outlier detection perspective, being oblivious to the topology of neural networks (NNs). In the scope of this work, we argue that by extracting certain side information specific to the NN topology, one can design stronger attacks. Hence, inspired by the sparse neural networks, we introduce a hybrid sparse Byzantine attack that is composed of two parts: one exhibiting a sparse nature and attacking only certain NN locations with higher sensitivity, and the other being more silent but accumulating over time, where each ideally targets a different type of defence mechanism, and together they form a strong but imperceptible attack. Finally, we show through extensive simulations that the proposed hybrid Byzantine attack is effective against 8 different defence methods. ",

We address two types of OOD generalization, i.e., i) domain shift such as natural to sketch images, and ii) zero-shot capability to recognize the category that was not contained in the finetune data. Arguably, the diminished OOD generalization after finetuning stems from the excessively simplified finetuning target, which only provides the class information, such as ``a photo of a [CLASS]''. This is distinct from the process in that CLIP was pretrained, where there is abundant text supervision with rich semantic information. Therefore, we propose to compensate for the finetune process using auxiliary supervision with rich semantic information, which acts as anchors to preserve the OOD generalization. Specifically, two types of anchors are elaborated in our method, including i) text-compensated anchor which uses the images from the finetune set but enriches the text supervision from a pretrained captioner, ii) image-text-pair anchor which is retrieved from the dataset similar to pretraining data of CLIP according to the downstream task, associating with the original CLIP text with rich semantics. Those anchors are utilized as auxiliary semantic information to maintain the original feature space of CLIP, thereby preserving the OOD generalization capabilities. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves in-distribution performance akin to conventional finetuning while attaining new state-of-the-art results on domain shift and zero-shot learning benchmarks.

    "abstract": "Recent advances in Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have demonstrated promising results in 3D scene representations, including 3D human representations. However, these representations often lack crucial information on the underlying human pose and structure, which is crucial for AR/VR applications and games. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach, termed GHNeRF, designed to address these limitations by learning 2D/3D joint locations of human subjects with NeRF representation. GHNeRF uses a pre-trained 2D encoder streamlined to extract essential human features from 2D images, which are then incorporated into the NeRF framework in order to encode human biomechanic features. This allows our network to simultaneously learn biomechanic features, such as joint locations, along with human geometry and texture. To assess the effectiveness of our method, we conduct a comprehensive comparison with state-of-the-art human NeRF techniques and joint estimation algorithms. Our results show that GHNeRF can achieve state-of-the-art results in near real-time. ",

    "abstract": "Visual object tracking plays a critical role in visual-based autonomous systems, as it aims to estimate the position and size of the object of interest within a live video. Despite significant progress made in this field, state-of-the-art (SOTA) trackers often fail when faced with adversarial perturbations in the incoming frames. This can lead to significant robustness and security issues when these trackers are deployed in the real world. To achieve high accuracy on both clean and adversarial data, we propose building a spatial-temporal continuous representation using the semantic text guidance of the object of interest. This novel continuous representation enables us to reconstruct incoming frames to maintain semantic and appearance consistency with the object of interest and its clean counterparts. As a result, our proposed method successfully defends against different SOTA adversarial tracking attacks while maintaining high accuracy on clean data. In particular, our method significantly increases tracking accuracy under adversarial attacks with around 90% relative improvement on UAV123, which is even higher than the accuracy on clean data. ",

Instead of stacking multiple frames along the temporal dimension or recurrently propagating estimated features that will accumulate errors or cannot explore information from far-apart frames, we develop a memory-based feature propagation module that can establish reliable connections with features from far-apart frames and alleviate the influence of inaccurately estimated features. To extract better features from each frame for the above-mentioned feature propagation, we explore the features from large-pretrained visual models to guide the feature estimation of each frame so that the estimated features can model complex scenarios. In addition, we note that adjacent frames usually contain similar contents. To explore this property for better spatial and temporal feature utilization, we develop a local attention module to aggregate the features from adjacent frames in a spatial-temporal neighborhood. We formulate our memory-based feature propagation module, large-pretrained visual model guided feature estimation module, and local attention module into an end-to-end trainable network (named ColorMNet) and show that it performs favorably against state-of-the-art methods on both the benchmark datasets and real-world scenarios.

Collaborative perception has recently attracted a large research interest thanks to the ability to enhance the perception of autonomous vehicles via deep information fusion with intelligent roadside units (RSU), thus minimizing the impact of occlusion. While significant advancement has been made, the data-hungry nature of these methods creates a major hurdle for their real-world deployment, particularly due to the need for annotated RSU data. Manually annotating the vast amount of RSU data required for training is prohibitively expensive, given the sheer number of intersections and the effort involved in annotating point clouds. We address this challenge by devising a label-efficient object detection method for RSU based on unsupervised object discovery. Our paper introduces two new modules: one for object discovery based on a spatial-temporal aggregation of point clouds, and another for refinement. Furthermore, we demonstrate that fine-tuning on a small portion of annotated data allows our object discovery models to narrow the performance gap with, or even surpass, fully supervised models. Extensive experiments are carried out in simulated and real-world datasets to evaluate our method. ",

RFKD distils knowledge from a teacher model's logit layers and intermediate feature maps while leveraging mixed clean and noisy images to transfer robust patterns to the student model, improving its precision, generalisation, and anti-noise performance. To validate the proposed RFKD, a lightweight crack segmentation model, PoolingCrack Tiny (PCT), with only 0.5 M parameters, is also designed and used as the student to run the framework.

In this paper, we focus on NCA models used for texture synthesis, where the update rule is inspired by partial differential equations (PDEs) describing reaction-diffusion systems. To train the NCA model, the spatio-termporal domain is discretized, and Euler integration is used to numerically simulate the PDE. However, whether a trained NCA truly learns the continuous dynamic described by the corresponding PDE or merely overfits the discretization used in training remains an open question. We study NCA models at the limit where space-time discretization approaches continuity. We find that existing NCA models tend to overfit the training discretization, especially in the proximity of the initial condition, also called \"seed\". To address this, we propose a solution that utilizes uniform noise as the initial condition. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in preserving the consistency of NCA dynamics across a wide range of spatio-temporal granularities. Our improved NCA model enables two new test-time interactions by allowing continuous control over the speed of pattern formation and the scale of the synthesized patterns. We demonstrate this new NCA feature in our interactive online demo. Our work reveals that NCA models can learn continuous dynamics and opens new venues for NCA research from a dynamical systems' perspective. ",

Ensuring reliable and lowlatency communication between vehicles and their surrounding environment is of utmost importance for the success of these systems. This paper presents a novel approach to predict Quality of Service (QoS) in Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communications through nested cross-validation. Our methodology employs several machine learning (ML) methods to predict some QoS metrics, such as packet delivery ratio (PDR), and throughput, in NR-based V2X scenarios. In ML employment, nested cross-validation approach, unlike conventional cross-validation approach, prevents information leakage from parameter selection into hyperparameter selection, and this results in getting more robust results in terms of overfitting. The study utilizes real-world NR-V2X datasets to train and validate the proposed ML methods. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in accurately predicting QoS parameters, even in dynamic and challenging vehicular environments. In summary, our research contributes to the advancement of NR-based V2X communication systems by introducing employment of ML methods with a novel approach for QoS prediction. The combination of accurate predictions through nested cross-validation not only enhances the reliability of communication in connected vehicles' landscape but also has a supportive role for stakeholders to make informed decisions for the optimization and management of vehicular networks.

While adversarial training improves the robustness of the learned classifiers, the procedure is computationally expensive, sensitive to hyperparameters and may still leave the classifier vulnerable to other types of small perturbations. In this paper we analyze the adversarial robustness of the 1 Nearest Neighbor (1NN) classifier and compare its performance to adversarial training. We prove that under reasonable assumptions, the 1 NN classifier will be robust to {\\em any} small image perturbation of the training images and will give high adversarial accuracy on test images as the number of training examples goes to infinity. In experiments with 45 different binary image classification problems taken from CIFAR10, we find that 1NN outperform TRADES (a powerful adversarial training algorithm) in terms of average adversarial accuracy. In additional experiments with 69 pretrained robust models for CIFAR10, we find that 1NN outperforms almost all of them in terms of robustness to perturbations that are only slightly different from those seen during training. Taken together, our results suggest that modern adversarial training methods still fall short of the robustness of the simple 1NN classifier. our code can be found at https://github.com/amirhagai/On-Adversarial-Training-And-The-1-Nearest-Neighbor-Classifier ",

    "abstract": "Causality reveals fundamental principles behind data distributions in real-world scenarios, and the capability of large language models (LLMs) to understand causality directly impacts their efficacy across explaining outputs, adapting to new evidence, and generating counterfactuals. With the proliferation of LLMs, the evaluation of this capacity is increasingly garnering attention. However, the absence of a comprehensive benchmark has rendered existing evaluation studies being straightforward, undiversified, and homogeneous. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a comprehensive benchmark, namely CausalBench, to evaluate the causality understanding capabilities of LLMs. Originating from the causal research community, CausalBench encompasses three causal learning-related tasks, which facilitate a convenient comparison of LLMs' performance with classic causal learning algorithms. Meanwhile, causal networks of varying scales and densities are integrated in CausalBench, to explore the upper limits of LLMs' capabilities across task scenarios of varying difficulty. Notably, background knowledge and structured data are also incorporated into CausalBench to thoroughly unlock the underlying potential of LLMs for long-text comprehension and prior information utilization. Based on CausalBench, this paper evaluates nineteen leading LLMs and unveils insightful conclusions in diverse aspects. Firstly, we present the strengths and weaknesses of LLMs and quantitatively explore the upper limits of their capabilities across various scenarios. Meanwhile, we further discern the adaptability and abilities of LLMs to specific structural networks and complex chain of thought structures. Moreover, this paper quantitatively presents the differences across diverse information sources and uncovers the gap between LLMs' capabilities in causal understanding within textual contexts and numerical domains.

    "abstract": "Predicting the trajectories of road agents is essential for autonomous driving systems. The recent mainstream methods follow a static paradigm, which predicts the future trajectory by using a fixed duration of historical frames. These methods make the predictions independently even at adjacent time steps, which leads to potential instability and temporal inconsistency. As successive time steps have largely overlapping historical frames, their forecasting should have intrinsic correlation, such as overlapping predicted trajectories should be consistent, or be different but share the same motion goal depending on the road situation. Motivated by this, in this work, we introduce HPNet, a novel dynamic trajectory forecasting method. Aiming for stable and accurate trajectory forecasting, our method leverages not only historical frames including maps and agent states, but also historical predictions. Specifically, we newly design a Historical Prediction Attention module to automatically encode the dynamic relationship between successive predictions. Besides, it also extends the attention range beyond the currently visible window benefitting from the use of historical predictions. The proposed Historical Prediction Attention together with the Agent Attention and Mode Attention is further formulated as the Triple Factorized Attention module, serving as the core design of HPNet.Experiments on the Argoverse and INTERACTION datasets show that HPNet achieves state-of-the-art performance, and generates accurate and stable future trajectories.

For intra-dataset predictions, models consistently performed better when fine-tuned with third-party labels rather than with author labels. For cross-dataset predictions, most models failed to generalize well to the other datasets, implying that one type of dataset cannot represent all sorts of sarcasm with different styles and domains. Compared to the existing datasets, models fine-tuned on the new dataset we release in this work showed the highest generalizability to other datasets. With a manual inspection of the datasets and post-hoc analysis, we attributed the difficulty in generalization to the fact that sarcasm actually comes in different domains and styles.

    "abstract": "Arterial traffic interacts with freeway traffic, yet the two are controlled independently. Arterial traffic signals do not take into account freeway traffic and how ramps control ingress traffic and have no control over egress traffic from the freeway. This often results in long queues in either direction that block ramps and spill over to arterial streets or freeway lanes. In this paper, we propose an adaptive arterial traffic control strategy that combines traffic signal control (TSC) and dynamic speed offset (DSO) coordination using a Q-learning algorithm for a traffic network that involves a freeway segment and adjacent arterial streets. The TSC agent computes the signal cycle length and split based on observed intersection demands and adjacent freeway off-ramp queues. The DSO agent computes the relative offset and the recommended speeds of both ways between consecutive intersections based on their physical distance, intersection queues, and signal cycles. We evaluate the performance of the proposed arterial traffic control strategy using microscopic traffic simulations of an arterial corridor with seven intersections near the I-710 freeway. The proposed QL-based control significantly outperforms a fixed-time control and MAXBAND in terms of the travel time and the number of stops under low or moderate demands. In high-demand scenarios, the travel-time benefit provided by the QL-based control is reduced as it mitigates off-ramp and intersection queues, which is a necessary trade-off in our perspective. In addition, mutual benefit is obtained by implementing freeway and arterial traffic control simultaneously. ",

This concept of mode connectivity has played a crucial role in understanding important phenomena in deep learning. In this paper, we conduct a fine-grained analysis of this connectivity phenomenon. First, we demonstrate that in the overparameterized case, the connecting path can be as simple as a two-piece linear path, and the path length can be nearly equal to the Euclidean distance. This finding suggests that the landscape should be nearly convex in a certain sense. Second, we uncover a surprising star-shaped connectivity: For a finite number of typical minima, there exists a center on minima manifold that connects all of them simultaneously via linear paths. These results are provably valid for linear networks and two-layer ReLU networks under a teacher-student setup, and are empirically supported by models trained on MNIST and CIFAR-10. ",

    "abstract": "Neural Cellular Automata (NCA) models are trainable variations of traditional Cellular Automata (CA). Emergent motion in the patterns created by NCA has been successfully applied to synthesize dynamic textures. However, the conditions required for an NCA to display dynamic patterns remain unexplored. Here, we investigate the relationship between the NCA architecture and the emergent dynamics of the trained models. Specifically, we vary the number of channels in the cell state and the number of hidden neurons in the MultiLayer Perceptron (MLP), and draw a relationship between the combination of these two variables and the motion strength between successive frames. Our analysis reveals that the disparity and proportionality between these two variables have a strong correlation with the emergent dynamics in the NCA output. We thus propose a design principle for creating dynamic NCA. ",

    "abstract": "Predicting future events always comes with uncertainty, but traditional non-Bayesian methods cannot distinguish certain from uncertain predictions or explain the confidence in their predictions. In survival analysis, Bayesian methods applied to state-of-the-art solutions in the healthcare and biomedical field are still novel, and their implications have not been fully evaluated. In this paper, we study the benefits of modeling uncertainty in deep neural networks for survival analysis with a focus on prediction and calibration performance. For this, we present a Bayesian deep learning framework that consists of three Bayesian network architectures, which we train by optimizing the Cox partial likelihood and combining input-dependent aleatoric uncertainty with model-specific epistemic uncertainty. This enables us to provide uncertainty estimates as credible intervals when predicting the survival curve or as a probability density function over the predicted median survival times. For our empirical analyses, we evaluated our proposed method on four benchmark datasets and found that our method demonstrates prediction performance comparable to the state-of-the-art based on the concordance index and outperforms all other Cox-based approaches in terms of the mean absolute error. Our work explicitly compares the extent to which different Bayesian approximation techniques differ from each other and improves the prediction over traditional non-Bayesian alternatives. ",

In this study, we utilize SeasFire, a comprehensive global wildfire dataset with climate, vegetation, oceanic indices, and human-related variables, to enable seasonal wildfire forecasting with machine learning. For the predictive analysis, we train deep learning models with different architectures that capture the spatio-temporal context leading to wildfires. Our investigation focuses on assessing the effectiveness of these models in predicting the presence of burned areas at varying forecasting time horizons globally, extending up to six months into the future, and on how different spatial or/and temporal context affects the performance of the models. Our findings demonstrate the great potential of deep learning models in seasonal fire forecasting; longer input time-series leads to more robust predictions across varying forecasting horizons, while integrating spatial information to capture wildfire spatio-temporal dynamics boosts performance. Finally, our results hint that in order to enhance performance at longer forecasting horizons, a larger receptive field spatially needs to be considered. ",

We present Attentive Recurrent Neural Cellular Automata (AR-NCA), to effectively discover unknown local state transition rules by associating the temporal information between neighboring cells in a permutation-invariant manner. AR-NCA exhibits the superior generalizability across various system configurations (i.e., spatial distribution of states), data efficiency and robustness in extremely data-limited scenarios even in the presence of stochastic interactions, and scalability through spatial dimension-independent prediction.

Combinatorial optimization problems, which arise when considering an objective function related to a process of interest on discrete structures, are often challenging due to the rapid growth of the solution space. The trial-and-error paradigm of Reinforcement Learning has recently emerged as a promising alternative to traditional methods, such as exact algorithms and (meta)heuristics, for discovering better decision-making strategies in a variety of disciplines including chemistry, computer science, and statistics. Despite the fact that they arose in markedly different fields, these techniques share significant commonalities. Therefore, we set out to synthesize this work in a unifying perspective that we term Graph Reinforcement Learning, interpreting it as a constructive decision-making method for graph problems. After covering the relevant technical background, we review works along the dividing line of whether the goal is to optimize graph structure given a process of interest, or to optimize the outcome of the process itself under fixed graph structure. Finally, we discuss the common challenges facing the field and open research questions. In contrast with other surveys, the present work focuses on non-canonical graph problems for which performant algorithms are typically not known and Reinforcement Learning is able to provide efficient and effective solutions.

    "abstract": "Neural networks typically exhibit permutation symmetries which contribute to the non-convexity of the networks' loss landscapes, since linearly interpolating between two permuted versions of a trained network tends to encounter a high loss barrier. Recent work has argued that permutation symmetries are the only sources of non-convexity, meaning there are essentially no such barriers between trained networks if they are permuted appropriately. In this work, we refine these arguments into three distinct claims of increasing strength. We show that existing evidence only supports \"weak linear connectivity\"-that for each pair of networks belonging to a set of SGD solutions, there exist (multiple) permutations that linearly connect it with the other networks. In contrast, the claim \"strong linear connectivity\"-that for each network, there exists one permutation that simultaneously connects it with the other networks-is both intuitively and practically more desirable. This stronger claim would imply that the loss landscape is convex after accounting for permutation, and enable linear interpolation between three or more independently trained models without increased loss. In this work, we introduce an intermediate claim-that for certain sequences of networks, there exists one permutation that simultaneously aligns matching pairs of networks from these sequences. Specifically, we discover that a single permutation aligns sequences of iteratively trained as well as iteratively pruned networks, meaning that two networks exhibit low loss barriers at each step of their optimization and sparsification trajectories respectively. Finally, we provide the first evidence that strong linear connectivity may be possible under certain conditions, by showing that barriers decrease with increasing network width when interpolating among three networks.

Conventional studies in neuroscience on sex-specific lateralization are typically conducted on univariate statistical comparisons between male and female groups. However, these analyses often lack effective validation of group specificity. Here, we formulate modeling sex differences in lateralization of functional networks as a dual-classification problem, consisting of first-order classification for left vs. right functional networks and second-order classification for male vs. female models. To capture sex-specific patterns, we develop the Group-Specific Discriminant Analysis (GSDA) for first-order classification. The evaluation on two public neuroimaging datasets demonstrates the efficacy of GSDA in learning sex-specific models from functional networks, achieving a significant improvement in group specificity over baseline methods. The major sex differences are in the strength of lateralization and the interactions within and between lobes. The GSDA-based method is generic in nature and can be adapted to other group-specific analyses such as handedness-specific or disease-specific analyses. ",

Two recent works introduced a geometric framework to study neural networks making use of singular Riemannian metrics. In this paper we extend these results to convolutional, residual and recursive neural networks, studying also the case of non-differentiable activation functions, such as ReLU.

Learning a probability distribution of energy configuration or finding the ground states of a disordered, fully connected Ising model is essential for statistical mechanics and NP-hard problems. Despite tremendous efforts, a neural network architecture with the ability to high-accurately solve these fully connected and extremely intractable problems on larger systems is still lacking. Here we propose a variational autoregressive architecture with a message passing mechanism, which can effectively utilize the interactions between spin variables. The new network trained under an annealing framework outperforms existing methods in solving several prototypical Ising spin Hamiltonians, especially for larger spin systems at low temperatures. The advantages also come from the great mitigation of mode collapse during the training process of deep neural networks. Considering these extremely difficult problems to be solved, our method extends the current computational limits of unsupervised neural networks to solve combinatorial optimization problems. ",

We aim to address this by introducing Super-Resolution Generator (SuRGe), a fully-convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)-based architecture for SR. We show that distinct convolutional features obtained at increasing depths of a GAN generator can be optimally combined by a set of learnable convex weights to improve the quality of generated SR samples. In the process, we employ the Jensen-Shannon and the Gromov-Wasserstein losses respectively between the SR-HR and LR-SR pairs of distributions to further aid the generator of SuRGe to better exploit the available information in an attempt to improve SR. Moreover, we train the discriminator of SuRGe with the Wasserstein loss with gradient penalty, to primarily prevent mode collapse. The proposed SuRGe, as an end-to-end GAN workflow tailor-made for super-resolution, offers improved performance while maintaining low inference time. The efficacy of SuRGe is substantiated by its superior performance compared to 18 state-of-the-art contenders on 10 benchmark datasets. ",

    "abstract": "A connected graph, on four or more vertices, is matching covered if every edge is present in some perfect matching. An ear decomposition theorem (similar to the one for $2$-connected graphs) exists for bipartite matching covered graphs due to Hetyei. From the results and proofs of Lov\\'asz and Plummer, that rely on Hetyei's theorem, one may deduce that any minimal bipartite matching covered graph has at least $2(m-n+2)$ vertices of degree two (where minimal means that deleting any edge results in a graph that is not matching covered); such a graph is said to be extremal if it attains the stated lower bound. In this paper, we provide a complete characterization of the class of extremal minimal bipartite matching covered graphs. In particular, we prove that every such graph $G$ is obtained from two copies of a tree devoid of degree two vertices, say $T$ and $T'$, by adding edges -- each of which joins a leaf of $T$ with the corresponding leaf of $T'$. Apart from the aforementioned bound, there are four other bounds that appear in, or may be deduced from, the work of Lov\\'asz and Plummer. Each of these bounds leads to a notion of extremality. In this paper, we obtain a complete characterization of all of these extremal classes and also establish relationships between them. Two of our characterizations are in the same spirit as the one stated above. For the remaining two extremal classes, we reduce each of them to one of the already characterized extremal classes using standard matching theoretic operations. ",
