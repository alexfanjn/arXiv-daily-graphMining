    "abstract": "Optimizing deep neural networks is one of the main tasks in successful deep learning. Current state-of-the-art optimizers are adaptive gradient-based optimization methods such as Adam. Recently, there has been an increasing interest in formulating gradient-based optimizers in a probabilistic framework for better estimation of gradients and modeling uncertainties. Here, we propose to combine both approaches, resulting in the Variational Stochastic Gradient Descent (VSGD) optimizer. We model gradient updates as a probabilistic model and utilize stochastic variational inference (SVI) to derive an efficient and effective update rule. Further, we show how our VSGD method relates to other adaptive gradient-based optimizers like Adam. Lastly, we carry out experiments on two image classification datasets and four deep neural network architectures, where we show that VSGD outperforms Adam and SGD. ",

On top of that, printing and scanning the morphed images could obscure the artifacts generated during the morphing process, which makes morphed image detection even harder. In this work, we investigate the impact that printing and scanning has on morphing attacks through a series of heterogeneous tests. Our experiments show that we can increase the possibility of a false match by up to 5.64% for DiM and 16.00% for StyleGAN2 when providing an image that has been printed and scanned, regardless it is morphed or bona fide, to a Face Recognition (FR) system. Likewise, using Frechet Inception Distance (FID) metric, strictly print-scanned morph attacks performed on average 9.185% stronger than non-print-scanned digital morphs. ",

However, CNNs struggle with long-range dependencies, while transformers are burdened by quadratic computational complexity. Mamba-based models, with their superior long-range modeling and linear efficiency, have garnered substantial attention. This study pioneers the application of Mamba to multi-class unsupervised anomaly detection, presenting MambaAD, which consists of a pre-trained encoder and a Mamba decoder featuring Locality-Enhanced State Space (LSS) modules at multi-scales. The proposed LSS module, integrating parallel cascaded (Hybrid State Space) HSS blocks and multi-kernel convolutions operations, effectively captures both long-range and local information. The HSS block, utilizing (Hybrid Scanning) HS encoders, encodes feature maps into five scanning methods and eight directions, thereby strengthening global connections through the (State Space Model) SSM. The use of Hilbert scanning and eight directions significantly improves feature sequence modeling. Comprehensive experiments on six diverse anomaly detection datasets and seven metrics demonstrate SoTA performance, substantiating the method's effectiveness. ",

The advent of advanced large language models has captured significant interest, due to their ability to generate comprehensive and articulate responses across a wide range of knowledge domains. However, the system often falls short in accuracy and completeness when responding to domain-specific inquiries, particularly in areas like manufacturing service discovery. This research explores the potential of leveraging Knowledge Graphs in conjunction with ChatGPT to streamline the process for prospective clients in identifying small manufacturing enterprises. In this study, we propose a method that integrates bottom-up ontology with advanced machine learning models to develop a Manufacturing Service Knowledge Graph from an array of structured and unstructured data sources, including the digital footprints of small-scale manufacturers throughout North America. The Knowledge Graph and the learned graph embedding vectors are leveraged to tackle intricate queries within the digital supply chain network, responding with enhanced reliability and greater interpretability. The approach highlighted is scalable to millions of entities that can be distributed to form a global Manufacturing Service Knowledge Network Graph that can potentially interconnect multiple types of Knowledge Graphs that span industry sectors, geopolitical boundaries, and business domains. The dataset developed for this study, now publicly accessible, encompasses more than 13,000 manufacturers' weblinks, manufacturing services, certifications, and location entity types. ",

However, P4-INT as well as other existing frameworks for INT yield a substantial transmission overhead, which grows linearly with the number of hops and the number of telemetry values. To address this issue, we present a deterministic and a probabilistic technique for lightweight INT, termed as DLINT and PLINT,respectively. In particular, DLINT exercises per-flow aggregation by spreading the telemetry values across the packets of a flow. DLINT relies on switch coordination through the use of per-flow telemetry states, maintained within P4 switches. Furthermore, DLINT utilizes Bloom Filters (BF) in order to compress the state lookup tables within P4 switches. On the other hand, PLINT employs a probabilistic approach based on reservoir sampling. PLINT essentially empowers every INT node to insert telemetry values with equal probability within each packet. Our evaluation results corroborate that both proposed techniques alleviate the transmission overhead of P4-INT, while maintaining a high degree of monitoring accuracy. In addition, we perform a comparative evaluation between DLINT and PLINT. DLINT is more effective in conveying path traces to the telemetry server, whereas PLINT detects more promptly path updates exploiting its more efficient INT header space utilization ",

We propose employing an adapted Temporal Graph Networks to comprehensively represent social interaction dynamics while enabling its practical implementation. Our method incorporates temporal multi-modal behavioral data including gaze interaction, voice activity and environmental context. This representation of social interaction dynamics is trained as a link prediction problem using annotated gaze interaction data. The F1-score outperformed the baseline model by 37.0%. This improvement is consistent for a secondary task of next speaker prediction which achieves an improvement of 29.0%. Our contributions are two-fold, including a model to representing social interaction dynamics which can be used for many downstream human-robot interaction tasks like human state inference and next speaker prediction. More importantly, this is achieved using a more concise yet efficient message passing method, significantly reducing it from 768 to 14 elements, while outperforming the baseline model. ",

Relatedly, bias evaluation should surface not only egregious biases but also ones that are subtle and commonplace, such as a likelihood for talking about appearances with regard to women. We present FairPair, an evaluation framework for assessing differential treatment that occurs during ordinary usage. FairPair operates through counterfactual pairs, but crucially, the paired continuations are grounded in the same demographic group, which ensures equivalent comparison. Additionally, unlike prior work, our method factors in the inherent variability that comes from the generation process itself by measuring the sampling variability.

We exploit this disparity by performing an evolutionary search on five types of image augmentation techniques in the hopes of finding image augmentation specific loss functions. The best loss functions from each evolution were then taken and transferred to WideResNet-28-10 on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 across each of the five image augmentation techniques. The best from that were then taken and evaluated by fine-tuning EfficientNetV2Small on the CARS, Oxford-Flowers, and Caltech datasets across each of the five image augmentation techniques. Multiple loss functions were found that outperformed cross-entropy across multiple experiments. In the end, we found a single loss function, which we called the inverse bessel logarithm loss, that was able to outperform cross-entropy across the majority of experiments. ",

We find that, with the right action space, LLMs are capable of successfully generating policies for a variety of contact-rich and high-precision manipulation tasks, even under noisy conditions, such as perceptual errors or grasping inaccuracies. Specifically, we reparameterize the action space to include compliance with constraints on the interaction forces and stiffnesses involved in reaching a target pose. We validate this approach on subtasks derived from the Functional Manipulation Benchmark (FMB) and NIST Task Board Benchmarks. Exposing this action space alongside methods for estimating object poses improves policy generation with an LLM by greater than 3x and 4x when compared to non-compliant action spaces ",

We accomplish this by solving the log-density Fokker-Planck (FP) Equation numerically to compute the score \\textit{before} training. The pre-computed score is embedded into the image to encourage faster training under slice Wasserstein distance. Consequently, it also allows us to decrease the number of images we need to train the neural network to learn an accurate score.

This work proposes a DPAD method based on multi-modal disentangled traces (MMDT) without the above drawbacks. We first disentangle the recaptured traces by a self-supervised disentanglement and synthesis network to enhance the generalization capacity in document images with different contents and layouts. Then, unlike the existing DPAD approaches that rely only on data in the RGB domain, we propose to explicitly employ the disentangled recaptured traces as new modalities in the transformer backbone through adaptive multi-modal adapters to fuse RGB/trace features efficiently. Visualization of the disentangled traces confirms the effectiveness of the proposed method in different document contents. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of our MMDT method on representing forensic traces of recapturing distortion. ",

While early studies focused mainly on bounding a specific class of counterfactual objective functions using data, more recent work allows one to find optimal units exactly by reducing the causal objective to a classical objective on a meta-model, and then applying a variant of the classical Variable Elimination (VE) algorithm to the meta-model -- assuming a fully specified causal model is available. In practice, however, finding optimal units using this approach can be very expensive because the used VE algorithm must be exponential in the constrained treewidth of the meta-model, which is larger and denser than the original model. We address this computational challenge by introducing a new approach for unit selection that is not necessarily limited by the constrained treewidth. This is done through compiling the meta-model into a special class of tractable arithmetic circuits that allows the computation of optimal units in time linear in the circuit size. We finally present empirical results on random causal models that show order-of-magnitude speedups based on the proposed method for solving unit selection. ",

This reduces costs for the bank, as the list aggregates the bank's internal firm inventory per asset for all clients of long as well as short trades. However, this is somewhat problematic: (1) the bank's inventory is revealed; (2) trades of clients who contribute to the aggregated list, particularly those deemed large, are revealed to other clients. Clients conducting sizable trades with the bank and possessing a portion of the aggregated asset exceeding $50\\%$ are considered to be concentrated clients. This could potentially reveal a trading concentrated client's activity to their competitors, thus providing an unfair advantage over the market. Atlas-X Axe Obfuscation, powered by new differential private methods, enables a bank to obfuscate its published axe list on a daily basis while under continual observation, thus maintaining an acceptable inventory Profit and Loss (P&L) cost pertaining to the noisy obfuscated axe list while reducing the clients' trading activity leakage.

Scaling MC3D-Det training effectively accommodates varied camera parameters and urban landscapes, paving the way for the MC3D-Det foundation model. However, the multi-view fusion stage of the MC3D-Det method relies on the ill-posed monocular perception during training rather than surround refinement ability, leading to what we term \"surround refinement degradation\". To this end, our study presents a weak-to-strong eliciting framework aimed at enhancing surround refinement while maintaining robust monocular perception. Specifically, our framework employs weakly tuned experts trained on distinct subsets, and each is inherently biased toward specific camera configurations and scenarios. These biased experts can learn the perception of monocular degeneration, which can help the multi-view fusion stage to enhance surround refinement abilities. Moreover, a composite distillation strategy is proposed to integrate the universal knowledge of 2D foundation models and task-specific information. Finally, for MC3D-Det joint training, the elaborate dataset merge strategy is designed to solve the problem of inconsistent camera numbers and camera parameters. We set up a multiple dataset joint training benchmark for MC3D-Det and adequately evaluated existing methods.

This can be posed as a zero-sum game, where a Daemon constructs a world, and an adversarial Angel then places the Daemon into the world. This game incentivizes the Daemon to maximize the minimum utility over all people (i.e., to maximize egalitarian welfare). In some sense, this is the most extreme form of risk aversion or robustness, and we show that by weakening the Angel, milder robust objectives arise, which we argue are effective robust proxies for fair learning or allocation tasks. In particular, the utilitarian, Gini, and power-mean welfare concepts arise from special cases of the adversarial game, which has philosophical implications for the understanding of each of these concepts. We also motivate a new fairness concept that essentially fuses the nonlinearity of the power-mean with the piecewise nature of the Gini class. Then, exploiting the relationship between fairness and robustness, we show that these robust fairness concepts can all be efficiently optimized under mild conditions via standard maximin optimization techniques. Finally, we show that such methods apply in machine learning contexts, and moreover we show generalization bounds for robust fair machine learning tasks. ",

It has a broad range of applications in several fields, including autonomous driving, robotics and augmented reality. Monocular 3D detection is attractive as it requires only a single camera, however, it lacks the accuracy and robustness required for real world applications. High resolution LiDAR on the other hand, can be expensive and lead to interference problems in heavy traffic given their active transmissions. We propose a balanced approach that combines the advantages of monocular and point cloud-based 3D detection. Our method requires only a small number of 3D points, that can be obtained from a low-cost, low-resolution sensor. Specifically, we use only 512 points, which is just 1% of a full LiDAR frame in the KITTI dataset. Our method reconstructs a complete 3D point cloud from this limited 3D information combined with a single image. The reconstructed 3D point cloud and corresponding image can be used by any multi-modal off-the-shelf detector for 3D object detection. By using the proposed network architecture with an off-the-shelf multi-modal 3D detector, the accuracy of 3D detection improves by 20% compared to the state-of-the-art monocular detection methods and 6% to 9% compare to the baseline multi-modal methods on KITTI and JackRabbot datasets.

In response, approaches such as Federated Learning (FL) and Local Differential Privacy (LDP) have been proposed and attracted much attention over the past few years. However, they still share the common limitation of being vulnerable to poisoning attacks wherein adversaries compromising edge devices feed forged (a.k.a. poisoned) data to aggregation back-ends, undermining the integrity of FL/LDP results. In this work, we propose a system-level approach to remedy this issue based on a novel security notion of Proofs of Stateful Execution (PoSX) for IoT/embedded devices' software. To realize the PoSX concept, we design SLAPP: a System-Level Approach for Poisoning Prevention. SLAPP leverages commodity security features of embedded devices - in particular ARM TrustZoneM security extensions - to verifiably bind raw sensed data to their correct usage as part of FL/LDP edge device routines. As a consequence, it offers robust security guarantees against poisoning. Our evaluation, based on real-world prototypes featuring multiple cryptographic primitives and data collection schemes, showcases SLAPP's security and low overhead. ",

    "abstract": "We present the Bayesian Neural Radiance Field (NeRF), which explicitly quantifies uncertainty in geometric volume structures without the need for additional networks, making it adept for challenging observations and uncontrolled images. NeRF diverges from traditional geometric methods by offering an enriched scene representation, rendering color and density in 3D space from various viewpoints. However, NeRF encounters limitations in relaxing uncertainties by using geometric structure information, leading to inaccuracies in interpretation under insufficient real-world observations. Recent research efforts aimed at addressing this issue have primarily relied on empirical methods or auxiliary networks. To fundamentally address this issue, we propose a series of formulational extensions to NeRF. By introducing generalized approximations and defining density-related uncertainty, our method seamlessly extends to manage uncertainty not only for RGB but also for depth, without the need for additional networks or empirical assumptions. In experiments we show that our method significantly enhances performance on RGB and depth images in the comprehensive dataset, demonstrating the reliability of the Bayesian NeRF approach to quantifying uncertainty based on the geometric structure.

    "abstract": "Objective. Vaccination has engendered a spectrum of public opinions, with social media acting as a crucial platform for health-related discussions. The emergence of artificial intelligence technologies, such as large language models (LLMs), offers a novel opportunity to efficiently investigate public discourses. This research assesses the accuracy of ChatGPT, a widely used and freely available service built upon an LLM, for sentiment analysis to discern different stances toward Human Papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination. Methods. Messages related to HPV vaccination were collected from social media supporting different message formats: Facebook (long format) and Twitter (short format). A selection of 1,000 human-evaluated messages was input into the LLM, which generated multiple response instances containing its classification results. Accuracy was measured for each message as the level of concurrence between human and machine decisions, ranging between 0 and 1. Results. Average accuracy was notably high when 20 response instances were used to determine the machine decision of each message: .882 (SE = .021) and .750 (SE = .029) for anti- and pro-vaccination long-form; .773 (SE = .027) and .723 (SE = .029) for anti- and pro-vaccination short-form, respectively. Using only three or even one instance did not lead to a severe decrease in accuracy. However, for long-form messages, the language model exhibited significantly lower accuracy in categorizing pro-vaccination messages than anti-vaccination ones. Conclusions. ChatGPT shows potential in analyzing public opinions on HPV vaccination using social media content. However, understanding the characteristics and limitations of a language model within specific public health contexts remains imperative. ",

Current factuality probes, trained using humanannotated labels, exhibit limited transferability to out-of-distribution content, while online selfconsistency checking imposes extensive computation burden due to the necessity of generating multiple outputs. This paper proposes PINOSE, which trains a probing model on offline self-consistency checking results, thereby circumventing the need for human-annotated data and achieving transferability across diverse data distributions. As the consistency check process is offline, PINOSE reduces the computational burden of generating multiple responses by online consistency verification. Additionally, it examines various aspects of internal states prior to response decoding, contributing to more effective detection of factual inaccuracies. Experiment results on both factuality detection and question answering benchmarks show that PINOSE achieves surpassing results than existing factuality detection methods.

    "abstract": "A new knowledge-based and machine learning hybrid modeling approach, called conditional Gaussian neural stochastic differential equation (CGNSDE), is developed to facilitate modeling complex dynamical systems and implementing analytic formulae of the associated data assimilation (DA). In contrast to the standard neural network predictive models, the CGNSDE is designed to effectively tackle both forward prediction tasks and inverse state estimation problems. The CGNSDE starts by exploiting a systematic causal inference via information theory to build a simple knowledge-based nonlinear model that nevertheless captures as much explainable physics as possible. Then, neural networks are supplemented to the knowledge-based model in a specific way, which not only characterizes the remaining features that are challenging to model with simple forms but also advances the use of analytic formulae to efficiently compute the nonlinear DA solution. These analytic formulae are used as an additional computationally affordable loss to train the neural networks that directly improve the DA accuracy. This DA loss function promotes the CGNSDE to capture the interactions between state variables and thus advances its modeling skills. With the DA loss, the CGNSDE is more capable of estimating extreme events and quantifying the associated uncertainty. Furthermore, crucial physical properties in many complex systems, such as the translate-invariant local dependence of state variables, can significantly simplify the neural network structures and facilitate the CGNSDE to be applied to high-dimensional systems. Numerical experiments based on chaotic systems with intermittency and strong non-Gaussian features indicate that the CGNSDE outperforms knowledge-based regression models, and the DA loss further enhances the modeling skills of the CGNSDE.

Here, we adopted the Lyapunov-Floquet theory and the Master Stability Function approach in order to derive the synchronization conditions for a set of coupled nonlinear oscillators. We found that the positivity of the coupling constant is a necessary and sufficient condition for synchronizing linearly full-state coupled identical oscillators. Moreover, in the case of partial state coupling, the asymptotic convergence of volume in state space is ensured by a positive coupling constant. The numerical calculation of the Master Stability Function for a benchmark two-dimensional oscillator validates the synchronization corresponding to the positive coupling. The results are illustrated using numerical simulations and experimentation on benchmark oscillators. ",

Our experiments show that \"MonoSelfRecon\" trained in pure self-supervision outperforms current best self-supervised indoor depth estimation models and is comparable to 3DR models trained in fully supervision with depth annotations.

    "abstract": "Granularity and accuracy are two crucial factors for crime event prediction. Within fine-grained event classification, multiple criminal intents may alternately exhibit in preceding sequential events, and progress differently in next. Such intensive intent dynamics makes training models hard to capture unobserved intents, and thus leads to sub-optimal generalization performance, especially in the intertwining of numerous potential events. To capture comprehensive criminal intents, this paper proposes a fine-grained sequential crime prediction framework, CrimeAlarm, that equips with a novel mutual distillation strategy inspired by curriculum learning. During the early training phase, spot-shared criminal intents are captured through high-confidence sequence samples. In the later phase, spot-specific intents are gradually learned by increasing the contribution of low-confidence sequences. Meanwhile, the output probability distributions are reciprocally learned between prediction networks to model unobserved criminal intents. Extensive experiments show that CrimeAlarm outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of NDCG@5, with improvements of 4.51% for the NYC16 and 7.73% for the CHI18 in accuracy measures. ",

    "abstract": "Federated learning (FL) is a privacy-preserving distributed framework for collaborative model training on devices in edge networks. However, challenges arise due to vulnerability to adversarial examples (AEs) and the non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) nature of data distribution among devices, hindering the deployment of adversarially robust and accurate learning models at the edge. While adversarial training (AT) is commonly acknowledged as an effective defense strategy against adversarial attacks in centralized training, we shed light on the adverse effects of directly applying AT in FL that can severely compromise accuracy, especially in non-IID challenges. Given this limitation, this paper proposes FatCC, which incorporates local logit \\underline{C}alibration and global feature \\underline{C}ontrast into the vanilla federated adversarial training (\\underline{FAT}) process from both logit and feature perspectives. This approach can effectively enhance the federated system's robust accuracy (RA) and clean accuracy (CA). First, we propose logit calibration, where the logits are calibrated during local adversarial updates, thereby improving adversarial robustness. Second, FatCC introduces feature contrast, which involves a global alignment term that aligns each local representation with unbiased global features, thus further enhancing robustness and accuracy in federated adversarial environments. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate that FatCC achieves comparable or superior performance gains in both CA and RA compared to other baselines. ",

Additionally, we leverage a foundational model for image segmentation to extract language features on object-level entities, achieving clear segmentation boundaries and hierarchical semantic features.

Unfortunately, recent progress in visual perception seems insufficient to develop completely reliable 3D lane detection algorithms, which also hinders the development of vision-based fully autonomous self-driving cars, i.e., achieving level 5 autonomous driving, driving like human-controlled cars.

Symbolic AI techniques already facilitate critical thinking based on existing knowledge. Yet, their use in telecommunications is hindered by the high cost of mostly manual curation of this knowledge and high computational complexity of reasoning tasks. At the same time, there is a spurt of innovations in industries such as telecommunications due to Generative AI (GenAI) technologies, operating independently of human-curated knowledge.

    "abstract": "Recently, the area of adversarial attacks on image quality metrics has begun to be explored, whereas the area of defences remains under-researched. In this study, we aim to cover that case and check the transferability of adversarial purification defences from image classifiers to IQA methods. In this paper, we apply several widespread attacks on IQA models and examine the success of the defences against them. The purification methodologies covered different preprocessing techniques, including geometrical transformations, compression, denoising, and modern neural network-based methods. Also, we address the challenge of assessing the efficacy of a defensive methodology by proposing ways to estimate output visual quality and the success of neutralizing attacks. Defences were tested against attack on three IQA metrics -- Linearity, MetaIQA and SPAQ. The code for attacks and defences is available at: (link is hidden for a blind review). ",

While current morphing attack detection methods primarily focus on a single or a pair of images, V-MAD is based on video sequences, exploiting the video streams often acquired by face verification tools available, for instance, at airport gates. Through this study, we show for the first time the advantages that the availability of multiple probe frames can bring to the morphing attack detection task, especially in scenarios where the quality of probe images is varied and might be affected, for instance, by pose or illumination variations. Experimental results on a real operational database demonstrate that video sequences represent valuable information for increasing the robustness and performance of morphing attack detection systems.

    "abstract": "Modeling true world data-generating processes lies at the heart of empirical science. Structural Causal Models (SCMs) and their associated Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) provide an increasingly popular answer to such problems by defining the causal generative process that transforms random noise into observations. However, learning them from observational data poses an ill-posed and NP-hard inverse problem in general. In this work, we propose a new and equivalent formalism that do not require DAGs to describe them, viewed as fixed-point problems on the causally ordered variables, and show three important cases where they can be uniquely recovered given the topological ordering (TO). To the best of our knowledge, we obtain the most general recovery results when the TO is known. Based on our theoretical findings, we design a two-stage causal generative model that first infers the causal order from observations in a zero-shot manner, thus by-passing the search, and then learns the generative fixed-point SCM on the ordered variables. To infer TOs from observations, we propose to amortize the learning of TOs on generated datasets by sequentially predicting the leaves of graphs seen during training. To learn fixed-point SCMs, we design a transformer-based architecture that exploits a new attention mechanism enabling the modeling of causal structures, and show that this parameterization is consistent with our formalism. Finally, we conduct an extensive evaluation of each method individually, and show that when combined, our model outperforms various baselines on generated out-of-distribution problems. ",

    "abstract": "Forecasting human trajectories in traffic scenes is critical for safety within mixed or fully autonomous systems. Human future trajectories are driven by two major stimuli, social interactions, and stochastic goals. Thus, reliable forecasting needs to capture these two stimuli. Edge-based relation modeling represents social interactions using pairwise correlations from precise individual states. Nevertheless, edge-based relations can be vulnerable under perturbations. To alleviate these issues, we propose a region-based relation learning paradigm that models social interactions via region-wise dynamics of joint states, i.e., the changes in the density of crowds. In particular, region-wise agent joint information is encoded within convolutional feature grids. Social relations are modeled by relating the temporal changes of local joint information from a global perspective. We show that region-based relations are less susceptible to perturbations. In order to account for the stochastic individual goals, we exploit a conditional variational autoencoder to realize multi-goal estimation and diverse future prediction. Specifically, we perform variational inference via the latent distribution, which is conditioned on the correlation between input states and associated target goals. Sampling from the latent distribution enables the framework to reliably capture the stochastic behavior in test data. We integrate multi-goal estimation and region-based relation learning to model the two stimuli, social interactions, and stochastic goals, in a prediction framework. We evaluate our framework on the ETH-UCY dataset and Stanford Drone Dataset (SDD). We show that the diverse prediction better fits the ground truth when incorporating the relation module. Our framework outperforms the state-of-the-art models on SDD by $27.61\\%$/$18.20\\%$ of ADE/FDE metrics. ",

By collecting and analyzing NFTs-related tweet dataset, the motivations of retweeters, the information mechanisms behind emojis, and the networked-based diffusion dynamics is systematically investigated. Results indicate that Retweeting is fueled by Freemint and trading information, with the higher economic incentives as a major motivation and some potential organizational tendencies. The diffusion of NFT is primarily driven by a 'Ringed-layered' information mechanism involving individual promoters and speculators.

An important class of concept-based explainability methods is constructed with empirically defined concepts, indirectly defined through a set of positive and negative examples, as in the TCAV approach (Kim et al., 2018). While it is appealing to the user to avoid formal definitions of concepts and their operationalization, it can be challenging to establish relevant concept datasets. Here, we address this challenge using general knowledge graphs (such as, e.g., Wikidata or WordNet) for comprehensive concept definition and present a workflow for user-driven data collection in both text and image domains. The concepts derived from knowledge graphs are defined interactively, providing an opportunity for personalization and ensuring that the concepts reflect the user's intentions. We test the retrieved concept datasets on two concept-based explainability methods, namely concept activation vectors (CAVs) and concept activation regions (CARs) (Crabbe and van der Schaar, 2022). We show that CAVs and CARs based on these empirical concept datasets provide robust and accurate explanations. Importantly, we also find good alignment between the models' representations of concepts and the structure of knowledge graphs, i.e., human representations. This supports our conclusion that knowledge graph-based concepts are relevant for XAI. ",

Methodologically, we treat a (previous timestamp, user, next timestamp) triplet as a union translation vector and develop a neural-based fusion operation to fuse user preference and temporal influence. The superiority of TransTARec, which is confirmed by extensive experiments on real-world datasets, comes from not only the introduction of temporal influence but also the direct unification with user preference and sequential dynamics.

In this paper, we study the problem of out-of-distribution (OOD) detection in RL, which focuses on identifying situations at test time that RL agents have not encountered in their training environments. We first propose a clarification of terminology for OOD detection in RL, which aligns it with the literature from other machine learning domains. We then present new benchmark scenarios for OOD detection, which introduce anomalies with temporal autocorrelation into different components of the agent-environment loop. We argue that such scenarios have been understudied in the current literature, despite their relevance to real-world situations. Confirming our theoretical predictions, our experimental results suggest that state-of-the-art OOD detectors are not able to identify such anomalies. To address this problem, we propose a novel method for OOD detection, which we call DEXTER (Detection via Extraction of Time Series Representations). By treating environment observations as time series data, DEXTER extracts salient time series features, and then leverages an ensemble of isolation forest algorithms to detect anomalies. We find that DEXTER can reliably identify anomalies across benchmark scenarios, exhibiting superior performance compared to both state-of-the-art OOD detectors and high-dimensional changepoint detectors adopted from statistics.

However, in many domains, texts are interconnected (e.g., academic papers in a bibliographic graph are linked by citations and co-authorships) which form a (text-attributed) graph. The knowledge in such graphs is encoded not only in single texts/nodes but also in their associated connections. To facilitate the research of augmenting LLMs with graphs, we manually construct a Graph Reasoning Benchmark dataset called GRBench, containing 1,740 questions that can be answered with the knowledge from 10 domain graphs. Then, we propose a simple and effective framework called Graph Chain-of-thought (Graph-CoT) to augment LLMs with graphs by encouraging LLMs to reason on the graph iteratively. Each Graph-CoT iteration consists of three sub-steps: LLM reasoning, LLM-graph interaction, and graph execution. We conduct systematic experiments with three LLM backbones on GRBench, where Graph-CoT outperforms the baselines consistently. The code is available at https://github.com/PeterGriffinJin/Graph-CoT.

Despite their progress, existing text-to-vis models often heavily rely on lexical matching between words in the questions and tokens in data schemas. This overreliance on lexical matching may lead to a diminished level of model robustness against input variations. In this study, we thoroughly examine the robustness of current text-to-vis models, an area that has not previously been explored. In particular, we construct the first robustness dataset nvBench-Rob, which contains diverse lexical and phrasal variations based on the original text-to-vis benchmark nvBench. Then, we found that the performance of existing text-to-vis models on this new dataset dramatically drops, implying that these methods exhibit inadequate robustness overall. Finally, we propose a novel framework based on Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technique, named GRED, specifically designed to address input perturbations in these two variants. The framework consists of three parts: NLQ-Retrieval Generator, Visualization Query-Retrieval Retuner and Annotation-based Debugger, which are used to tackle the challenges posed by natural language variants, programming style differences and data schema variants, respectively. Extensive experimental evaluations show that, compared to the state-of-the-art model RGVisNet in the Text-to-Vis field, GRED performs better in terms of model robustness, with a 32% increase in accuracy on the proposed nvBench-Rob dataset.

Existing works have only analyzed MIA in a single \"what if\" interaction scenario between an adversary and the target ML model; thus, it does not discern the factors impacting the capabilities of an adversary in launching MIA in repeated interaction settings. Additionally, these works rely on assumptions about the adversary's knowledge of the target model's structure and, thus, do not guarantee the optimality of the predefined threshold required to distinguish the members from non-members. In this paper, we delve into the domain of explanation-based threshold attacks, where the adversary endeavors to carry out MIA attacks by leveraging the variance of explanations through iterative interactions with the system comprising of the target ML model and its corresponding explanation method. We model such interactions by employing a continuous-time stochastic signaling game framework. In our framework, an adversary plays a stopping game, interacting with the system (having imperfect information about the type of an adversary, i.e., honest or malicious) to obtain explanation variance information and computing an optimal threshold to determine the membership of a datapoint accurately. First, we propose a sound mathematical formulation to prove that such an optimal threshold exists, which can be used to launch MIA. Then, we characterize the conditions under which a unique Markov perfect equilibrium (or steady state) exists in this dynamic system. By means of a comprehensive set of simulations of the proposed game model, we assess different factors that can impact the capability of an adversary to launch MIA in such repeated interaction settings.

    "abstract": "Deep neural networks that achieve remarkable performance in image classification have previously been shown to be easily fooled by tiny transformations such as a one pixel translation of the input image. In order to address this problem, two approaches have been proposed in recent years. The first approach suggests using huge datasets together with data augmentation in the hope that a highly varied training set will teach the network to learn to be invariant. The second approach suggests using architectural modifications based on sampling theory to deal explicitly with image translations. In this paper, we show that these approaches still fall short in robustly handling 'natural' image translations that simulate a subtle change in camera orientation. Our findings reveal that a mere one-pixel translation can result in a significant change in the predicted image representation for approximately 40% of the test images in state-of-the-art models (e.g. open-CLIP trained on LAION-2B or DINO-v2) , while models that are explicitly constructed to be robust to cyclic translations can still be fooled with 1 pixel realistic (non-cyclic) translations 11% of the time. We present Robust Inference by Crop Selection: a simple method that can be proven to achieve any desired level of consistency, although with a modest tradeoff with the model's accuracy. Importantly, we demonstrate how employing this method reduces the ability to fool state-of-the-art models with a 1 pixel translation to less than 5% while suffering from only a 1% drop in classification accuracy. Additionally, we show that our method can be easy adjusted to deal with circular shifts as well. In such case we achieve 100% robustness to integer shifts with state-of-the-art accuracy, and with no need for any further training. ",

    "title": "Temperature Prediction for Stored Grain: A Multi-model Fusion Strategy  Based on Machine Learning",
    "abstract": "Temperature fluctuations significantly affect microorganism growth and pest activity in grain stacks. Thus, precise monitoring and forecasting of grain stack temperature are essential for maintaining the quality and safety of grain storage. This paper proposes a multi-model fusion approach to predict grain temperature using historical temperature data of stored grains and meteorological data from the region. Based on the proposed approaches, four distinct machine learning models, namely Adaboost, decision tree, extra trees, and random forest, are first developed. These models are then fine-tuned through parameter optimization to enhance their predictive capabilities. Subsequently, the optimized models are combined to form different ensemble models. In essence, the fusion process integrates the predictions of each individual model as new feature inputs into the prediction model. Furthermore, the study utilizes the random forest to identify the key factors influencing grain temperature, providing insights into the importance of different influencing factors. The experimental results demonstrate that the fusion models proposed in this paper have achieved higher prediction accuracy and robustness compared with the traditional prediction methods (i.e., single-model prediction). Additionally, the analysis of feature importance also offers empirical evidence for understanding the factors influencing grain temperature. ",

    "abstract": "Monocular depth estimation from a single image is an ill-posed problem for computer vision due to insufficient reliable cues as the prior knowledge. Besides the inter-frame supervision, namely stereo and adjacent frames, extensive prior information is available in the same frame. Reflections from specular surfaces, informative intra-frame priors, enable us to reformulate the ill-posed depth estimation task as a multi-view synthesis. This paper proposes the first self-supervision for deep-learning depth estimation on water scenes via intra-frame priors, known as reflection supervision and geometrical constraints. In the first stage, a water segmentation network is performed to separate the reflection components from the entire image. Next, we construct a self-supervised framework to predict the target appearance from reflections, perceived as other perspectives. The photometric re-projection error, incorporating SmoothL1 and a novel photometric adaptive SSIM, is formulated to optimize pose and depth estimation by aligning the transformed virtual depths and source ones. As a supplement, the water surface is determined from real and virtual camera positions, which complement the depth of the water area. Furthermore, to alleviate these laborious ground truth annotations, we introduce a large-scale water reflection scene (WRS) dataset rendered from Unreal Engine 4. Extensive experiments on the WRS dataset prove the feasibility of the proposed method compared to state-of-the-art depth estimation techniques. ",

    "abstract": "Being able to identify regions within or around proteins, to which ligands can potentially bind, is an essential step to develop new drugs. Binding site identification methods can now profit from the availability of large amounts of 3D structures in protein structure databases or from AlphaFold predictions. Current binding site identification methods heavily rely on graph neural networks (GNNs), usually designed to output E(3)-equivariant predictions. Such methods turned out to be very beneficial for physics-related tasks like binding energy or motion trajectory prediction. However, the performance of GNNs at binding site identification is still limited potentially due to the lack of dedicated nodes that model hidden geometric entities, such as binding pockets. In this work, we extend E(n)-Equivariant Graph Neural Networks (EGNNs) by adding virtual nodes and applying an extended message passing scheme. The virtual nodes in these graphs are dedicated quantities to learn representations of binding sites, which leads to improved predictive performance. In our experiments, we show that our proposed method VN-EGNN sets a new state-of-the-art at locating binding site centers on COACH420, HOLO4K and PDBbind2020. ",

Here we present UltraQuery, an inductive reasoning model that can zero-shot answer logical queries on any KG. The core idea of UltraQuery is to derive both projections and logical operations as vocabulary-independent functions which generalize to new entities and relations in any KG. With the projection operation initialized from a pre-trained inductive KG reasoning model, UltraQuery can solve CLQA on any KG even if it is only finetuned on a single dataset. Experimenting on 23 datasets, UltraQuery in the zero-shot inference mode shows competitive or better query answering performance than best available baselines and sets a new state of the art on 14 of them.

This paper presents clear empirical evidence through spectral analysis to elucidate the superiority of FNO over CNNs: FNO is significantly more capable of learning low-frequencies. This empirical evidence also unveils FNO's distinct low-frequency bias, which limits FNO's effectiveness in learning high-frequency information from PDE data. To tackle this challenge, we introduce SpecBoost, an ensemble learning framework that employs multiple FNOs to better capture high-frequency information. Specifically, a secondary FNO is utilized to learn the overlooked high-frequency information from the prediction residual of the initial FNO. Experiments demonstrate that SpecBoost noticeably enhances FNO's prediction accuracy on diverse PDE applications, achieving an up to 71% improvement. ",

    "abstract": "In recent years, advancements in neural network designs and the availability of large-scale labeled datasets have led to significant improvements in the accuracy of piano transcription models. However, most previous work focused on high-performance offline transcription, neglecting deliberate consideration of model size. The goal of this work is to implement real-time inference for piano transcription while ensuring both high performance and lightweight. To this end, we propose novel architectures for convolutional recurrent neural networks, redesigning an existing autoregressive piano transcription model. First, we extend the acoustic module by adding a frequency-conditioned FiLM layer to the CNN module to adapt the convolutional filters on the frequency axis. Second, we improve note-state sequence modeling by using a pitchwise LSTM that focuses on note-state transitions within a note. In addition, we augment the autoregressive connection with an enhanced recursive context. Using these components, we propose two types of models; one for high performance and the other for high compactness. Through extensive experiments, we show that the proposed models are comparable to state-of-the-art models in terms of note accuracy on the MAESTRO dataset. We also investigate the effective model size and real-time inference latency by gradually streamlining the architecture. Finally, we conduct cross-data evaluation on unseen piano datasets and in-depth analysis to elucidate the effect of the proposed components in the view of note length and pitch range. ",

Although classical edge detection algorithms perform reasonably well and are quite efficient, they become outright slower when it comes to large datasets with high-resolution images. Quantum computing promises to deliver a significant performance boost and breakthroughs in various sectors. Quantum Hadamard Edge Detection (QHED) algorithm, for example, works at constant time complexity, and thus detects edges much faster than any classical algorithm. However, the original QHED algorithm is designed for Quantum Probability Image Encoding (QPIE) and mainly works for binary images. This paper presents a novel protocol by combining the Flexible Representation of Quantum Images (FRQI) encoding and a modified QHED algorithm. An improved edge outline method has been proposed in this work resulting in a better object outline output and more accurate edge detection than the traditional QHED algorithm. ",

Sound field reconstruction can be hindered by experimental errors, limited spatial data, model mismatches, and long inference times, leading to potentially flawed and prolonged characterizations. Further, the complexity of managing inherent uncertainties often escalates computational demands or is neglected in models. Our approach seeks to balance accuracy and computational efficiency, while incorporating uncertainty estimates to tailor reconstructions to specific needs. By training a CINN with Monte Carlo simulations of random wave fields, our method reduces the dependency on extensive datasets and enables inference from sparse experimental data. The CINN proves versatile at reconstructing Room Impulse Responses (RIRs), by acting either as a likelihood model for maximum a posteriori estimation or as an approximate posterior distribution through amortized Bayesian inference. Compared to traditional Bayesian methods, the CINN achieves similar accuracy with greater efficiency and without requiring its adaptation to distinct sound field conditions. ",

Machine learning algorithms are frequently used to learn from local field observations to make spatial predictions by estimating the value of the variable of interest in places where it has not been measured. However, the application of machine learning strategies for spatial mapping involves additional challenges compared to \"non-spatial\" prediction tasks that often originate from spatial autocorrelation and from training data that are not independent and identically distributed. In the past few years, we developed a number of methods to support the application of machine learning for spatial data which involves the development of suitable cross-validation strategies for performance assessment and model selection, spatial feature selection, and methods to assess the area of applicability of the trained models. The intention of the CAST package is to support the application of machine learning strategies for predictive mapping by implementing such methods and making them available for easy integration into modelling workflows. Here we introduce the CAST package and its core functionalities. At the case study of mapping plant species richness, we will go through the different steps of the modelling workflow and show how CAST can be used to support more reliable spatial predictions. ",

It introduces a lightweight discretization method for line integrals based on a ray-driven neural field, enhancing the accuracy of the integral approximation during the discretization process. The basis materials are represented as continuous vector-valued implicit functions to establish a neural field parameterization model for the basis materials. The auto-differentiation framework of deep learning is then used to solve the implicit continuous function of the neural base-material fields. This method is not limited by the spatial resolution of reconstructed images, and the network has compact and regular properties. Experimental validation shows that our method performs exceptionally well in addressing the spectral CT reconstruction. Additionally, it fulfils the requirements for the generation of high-resolution reconstruction images. ",

In particular, using the probabilistic method, we prove that the size of a maximum $\\delta$-clique is approximately $\\frac{2\\log{n}}{\\log{\\frac{1}{\\delta}}}$ with high probability (whp).
