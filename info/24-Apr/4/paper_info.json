    "title": "Leveraging Machine Learning for Early Autism Detection via INDT-ASD  Indian Database",
    "abstract": "Machine learning (ML) has advanced quickly, particularly throughout the area of health care. The diagnosis of neurodevelopment problems using ML is a very important area of healthcare. Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is one of the developmental disorders that is growing the fastest globally. The clinical screening tests used to identify autistic symptoms are expensive and time-consuming. But now that ML has been advanced, it's feasible to identify autism early on. Previously, many different techniques have been used in investigations. Still, none of them have produced the anticipated outcomes when it comes to the capacity to predict autistic features utilizing a clinically validated Indian ASD database. Therefore, this study aimed to develop a simple, quick, and inexpensive technique for identifying ASD by using ML. Various machine learning classifiers, including Adaboost (AB), Gradient Boost (GB), Decision Tree (DT), Logistic Regression (LR), Random Forest (RF), Gaussian Naive Bayes (GNB), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Support Vector Machine (SVM), were used to develop the autism prediction model. The proposed method was tested with records from the AIIMS Modified INDT-ASD (AMI) database, which were collected through an application developed by AIIMS in Delhi, India. Feature engineering has been applied to make the proposed solution easier than already available solutions. Using the proposed model, we succeeded in predicting ASD using a minimized set of 20 questions rather than the 28 questions presented in AMI with promising accuracy. In a comparative evaluation, SVM emerged as the superior model among others, with 100 $\\pm$ 0.05\\% accuracy, higher recall by 5.34\\%, and improved accuracy by 2.22\\%-6.67\\% over RF. We have also introduced a web-based solution supporting both Hindi and English. ",

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in automatic code generation using large language model (LLM) agent have brought us closer to the future of automated software development. However, existing single-agent approaches face limitations in generating and improving large-scale, complex codebases due to constraints in context length. To tackle this challenge, we propose Self-Organized multi-Agent framework (SoA), a novel multi-agent framework that enables the scalable and efficient generation and optimization of large-scale code. In SoA, self-organized agents operate independently to generate and modify code components while seamlessly collaborating to construct the overall codebase. A key feature of our framework is the automatic multiplication of agents based on problem complexity, allowing for dynamic scalability. This enables the overall code volume to be increased indefinitely according to the number of agents, while the amount of code managed by each agent remains constant. We evaluate SoA on the HumanEval benchmark and demonstrate that, compared to a single-agent system, each agent in SoA handles significantly less code, yet the overall generated code is substantially greater. Moreover, SoA surpasses the powerful single-agent baseline by 5% in terms of Pass@1 accuracy. ",

    "abstract": "The emergence of Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) has greatly impacted 3D scene modeling and novel-view synthesis. As a kind of visual media for 3D scene representation, compression with high rate-distortion performance is an eternal target. Motivated by advances in neural compression and neural field representation, we propose NeRFCodec, an end-to-end NeRF compression framework that integrates non-linear transform, quantization, and entropy coding for memory-efficient scene representation. Since training a non-linear transform directly on a large scale of NeRF feature planes is impractical, we discover that pre-trained neural 2D image codec can be utilized for compressing the features when adding content-specific parameters. Specifically, we reuse neural 2D image codec but modify its encoder and decoder heads, while keeping the other parts of the pre-trained decoder frozen. This allows us to train the full pipeline via supervision of rendering loss and entropy loss, yielding the rate-distortion balance by updating the content-specific parameters. At test time, the bitstreams containing latent code, feature decoder head, and other side information are transmitted for communication. Experimental results demonstrate our method outperforms existing NeRF compression methods, enabling high-quality novel view synthesis with a memory budget of 0.5 MB. ",

    "abstract": "Trajectory prediction is fundamental in computer vision and autonomous driving, particularly for understanding pedestrian behavior and enabling proactive decision-making. Existing approaches in this field often assume precise and complete observational data, neglecting the challenges associated with out-of-view objects and the noise inherent in sensor data due to limited camera range, physical obstructions, and the absence of ground truth for denoised sensor data. Such oversights are critical safety concerns, as they can result in missing essential, non-visible objects. To bridge this gap, we present a novel method for out-of-sight trajectory prediction that leverages a vision-positioning technique. Our approach denoises noisy sensor observations in an unsupervised manner and precisely maps sensor-based trajectories of out-of-sight objects into visual trajectories. This method has demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in out-of-sight noisy sensor trajectory denoising and prediction on the Vi-Fi and JRDB datasets. By enhancing trajectory prediction accuracy and addressing the challenges of out-of-sight objects, our work significantly contributes to improving the safety and reliability of autonomous driving in complex environments. Our work represents the first initiative towards Out-Of-Sight Trajectory prediction (OOSTraj), setting a new benchmark for future research.

    "title": "\"Against the Void\": An Interview and Survey Study on How Rust Developers  Use Unsafe Code",
    "abstract": "The Rust programming language is an increasingly popular choice for systems programming, since it can statically guarantee memory safety without automatic garbage collection. Rust provides its safety guarantees by restricting aliasing and mutability, but many key design patterns, such as cyclic aliasing and multi-language interoperation, must bypass these restrictions. Rust's $\\texttt{unsafe}$ keyword enables features that developers can use to implement these patterns, and the Rust ecosystem includes useful tools for validating whether $\\texttt{unsafe}$ code is used correctly. However, it is unclear if these tools are adequate for all use cases. To understand developers' needs, we conducted a mixed-methods study consisting of semi-structured interviews followed by a survey. We interviewed 19 Rust developers and surveyed 160 developers$\\unicode{x2013}$all of whom engaged with $\\texttt{unsafe}$ code. We found that 77% of survey respondents and a majority of interview participants were motivated to use $\\texttt{unsafe}$ code because they were unaware of a safe alternative. Developers typically followed best-practices such as minimizing and localizing their use of $\\texttt{unsafe}$ code, but only 23% were always certain that their encapsulations were sound. Limited tooling support for inline assembly and foreign function calls prevented developers from validating $\\texttt{unsafe}$ code, and differences between Rust and other languages made foreign functions difficult to encapsulate. Verification tools were underused, and developers rarely audited their dependencies. Our results indicate a pressing need for production-ready tools that can validate the most frequently used $\\texttt{unsafe}$ features. ",

    "abstract": "Friction is one of the cruxes of hydrodynamic modeling; flood conditions are highly sensitive to the Friction Factors (FFs) used to calculate momentum losses. However, empirical FFs are challenging to measure because they require laboratory experiments. Flood models often rely on surrogate observations (such as land use) to estimate FFs, introducing uncertainty. This research presents a laboratory-trained Deep Neural Network (DNN), trained using flume experiments with data augmentation techniques, to measure Manning's n based on Point Cloud data. The DNN was deployed on real-world lidar Point Clouds to directly measure Manning's n under regulatory and extreme storm events, showing improved prediction capabilities in both 1D and 2D hydrodynamic models. For 1D models, the lidar values decreased differences with regulatory models for in-channel water depth when compared to land cover values. For 1D/2D coupled models, the lidar values produced better agreement with flood extents measured from airborne imagery, while better matching flood insurance claim data for Hurricane Harvey. In both 1D and 1D/2D coupled models, lidar resulted in better agreement with validation gauges. For these reasons, the lidar measurements of Manning's n were found to improve both regulatory models and forecasts for extreme storm events, while simultaneously providing a pathway to standardize the measurement of FFs. Changing FFs significantly affected fluvial and pluvial flood models, while surge flooding was generally unaffected. Downstream flow conditions were found to change the importance of FFs to fluvial models, advancing the literature of friction in flood models. This research introduces a reliable, repeatable, and readily-accessible avenue to measure high-resolution FFs based on 3D point clouds, improving flood prediction, and removing uncertainty from hydrodynamic modeling.

    "abstract": "3D pose transfer that aims to transfer the desired pose to a target mesh is one of the most challenging 3D generation tasks. Previous attempts rely on well-defined parametric human models or skeletal joints as driving pose sources. However, to obtain those clean pose sources, cumbersome but necessary pre-processing pipelines are inevitable, hindering implementations of the real-time applications. This work is driven by the intuition that the robustness of the model can be enhanced by introducing adversarial samples into the training, leading to a more invulnerable model to the noisy inputs, which even can be further extended to directly handling the real-world data like raw point clouds/scans without intermediate processing. Furthermore, we propose a novel 3D pose Masked Autoencoder (3D-PoseMAE), a customized MAE that effectively learns 3D extrinsic presentations (i.e., pose). 3D-PoseMAE facilitates learning from the aspect of extrinsic attributes by simultaneously generating adversarial samples that perturb the model and learning the arbitrary raw noisy poses via a multi-scale masking strategy. Both qualitative and quantitative studies show that the transferred meshes given by our network result in much better quality. Besides, we demonstrate the strong generalizability of our method on various poses, different domains, and even raw scans. Experimental results also show meaningful insights that the intermediate adversarial samples generated in the training can successfully attack the existing pose transfer models. ",

QUANTISENC is designed hierarchically using a bottom-up methodology with multiple neurons in each layer and multiple layers in each core. The number of layers and neurons per layer can be configured via software in a top-down methodology to generate the hardware for a target spiking neural network (SNN) model. QUANTISENC uses leaky integrate and fire neurons (LIF) and current-based excitatory and inhibitory synapses (CUBA). The nonlinear dynamics of a neuron can be configured at run-time via programming its internal control registers. Each neuron performs signed fixed-point arithmetic with user-defined quantization and decimal precision. QUANTISENC supports all-to-all, one-to-one, and Gaussian connections between layers. Its hardware-software interface is integrated with a PyTorch-based SNN simulator. This integration allows to define and train an SNN model in PyTorch and evaluate the hardware performance (e.g., area, power, latency, and throughput) through FPGA prototyping and ASIC design. The hardware-software interface also takes advantage of the layer-based architecture and distributed memory organization of QUANTISENC to enable pipelining by overlapping computations on streaming data. Overall, the proposed software-defined hardware design methodology offers flexibility similar to that of high-level synthesis (HLS), but provides better hardware performance with zero hardware development effort. We evaluate QUANTISENC using three spiking datasets and show its superior performance against state-of the-art designs. ",

To make up for such deficiency, this paper develops a Retrieval-Augmented Transformer (RAT), aiming to acquire fine-grained feature interactions within and across samples. By retrieving similar samples, we construct augmented input for each target sample. We then build Transformer layers with cascaded attention to capture both intra- and cross-sample feature interactions, facilitating comprehensive reasoning for improved CTR prediction while retaining efficiency.

    "abstract": "Despite demonstrating emergent reasoning abilities, Large Language Models (LLMS) often lose track of complex, multi-step reasoning. Existing studies show that providing guidance via decomposing the original question into multiple subproblems elicits more robustness in LLM reasoning -- a decomposer generates the subproblems, and a solver solves each of these subproblems. However, these techniques fail to accommodate coordination between the decomposer and the solver modules (either in a single model or different specialized ones) -- the decomposer does not keep track of the ability of the solver to follow the decomposed reasoning. In this paper, we propose LM2 to address these challenges. LM2 modularizes the decomposition, solution, and verification into three different language models. The decomposer module identifies the key concepts necessary to solve the problem and generates step-by-step subquestions according to the reasoning requirement. The solver model generates the solution to the subproblems that are then checked by the verifier module; depending upon the feedback from the verifier, the reasoning context is constructed using the subproblems and the solutions. These models are trained to coordinate using policy learning. Exhaustive experimentation suggests the superiority of LM2 over existing methods on in- and out-domain reasoning problems, outperforming the best baselines by $8.1\\%$ on MATH, $7.71\\%$ on JEEBench, and $9.7\\%$ on MedQA problems (code available at https://github.com/LCS2-IIITD/Language_Model_Multiplex).

Among other features, it takes a stream of edges as input, instead of loading the entire graph in memory, for partitioning. We also propose a novel streaming partitioning algorithm named SPRING for distributed GNN training. We verify the correctness and effectiveness of CATGNN with SPRING on 16 open datasets. In particular, we demonstrate that CATGNN can handle the largest publicly available dataset with limited memory, which would have been infeasible without increasing the memory space. SPRING also outperforms state-of-the-art partitioning algorithms significantly, with a 50% reduction in replication factor on average. ",

    "abstract": "Accurate bearing load monitoring is essential for their Prognostics and Health Management (PHM), enabling damage assessment, wear prediction, and proactive maintenance. While bearing sensors are typically placed on the bearing housing, direct load monitoring requires sensors inside the bearing itself. Recently introduced sensor rollers enable direct bearing load monitoring but are constrained by their battery life. Data-driven virtual sensors can learn from sensor roller data collected during a batterys lifetime to map operating conditions to bearing loads. Although spatially distributed bearing sensors offer insights into load distribution (e.g., correlating temperature with load), traditional machine learning algorithms struggle to fully exploit these spatial-temporal dependencies. To address this gap, we introduce a graph-based virtual sensor that leverages Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to analyze spatial-temporal dependencies among sensor signals, mapping existing measurements (temperature, vibration) to bearing loads. Since temperature and vibration signals exhibit vastly different dynamics, we propose Heterogeneous Temporal Graph Neural Networks (HTGNN), which explicitly models these signal types and their interactions for effective load prediction.

    "abstract": "Social sorting, the alignment of social identities, affiliations, and/or preferences with partisan groups, can increase in-party attachment and decrease out-party tolerance. We propose that self-presentation afforded by social media profiles fosters subjective social sorting by shaping perceptions of alignments between non-political and political identifiers. Unlike previous work, we evaluate social sorting of naturally occurring, public-facing identifiers in social media profiles selected using a bottom-up approach. Using a sample of 50 million X users collected five times between 2016 and 2018, we identify users who define themselves politically and generate networks representing simultaneous co-occurrence of identifiers in profiles. We then systematically measure the alignment of non-political identifiers along political dimensions, revealing alignments that reinforce existing associations, reveal unexpected relationships, and reflect online and offline events. We find that while most identifiers bridge political divides, social sorting of identifiers along political lines is occurring to some degree in X profiles. Our results have implications for understanding the role of social media in facilitating (the perception of) polarization and polarization mitigation strategies such as bridging interventions and algorithms.

    "abstract": "One of the pivotal security threats for the embedded computing systems is malicious software a.k.a malware. With efficiency and efficacy, Machine Learning (ML) has been widely adopted for malware detection in recent times. Despite being efficient, the existing techniques require a tremendous number of benign and malware samples for training and modeling an efficient malware detector. Furthermore, such constraints limit the detection of emerging malware samples due to the lack of sufficient malware samples required for efficient training. To address such concerns, we introduce a code-aware data generation technique that generates multiple mutated samples of the limitedly seen malware by the devices. Loss minimization ensures that the generated samples closely mimic the limitedly seen malware and mitigate the impractical samples. Such developed malware is further incorporated into the training set to formulate the model that can efficiently detect the emerging malware despite having limited exposure. The experimental results demonstrates that the proposed technique achieves an accuracy of 90% in detecting limitedly seen malware, which is approximately 3x more than the accuracy attained by state-of-the-art techniques.

Existing defense mechanisms often assume that only one type of trigger is adopted by the attacker, while defending against multiple simultaneous and independent trigger types necessitates general defense frameworks and is relatively unexplored. In this paper, we propose Nested Product of Experts(NPoE) defense framework, which involves a mixture of experts (MoE) as a trigger-only ensemble within the PoE defense framework to simultaneously defend against multiple trigger types. During NPoE training, the main model is trained in an ensemble with a mixture of smaller expert models that learn the features of backdoor triggers. At inference time, only the main model is used. Experimental results on sentiment analysis, hate speech detection, and question classification tasks demonstrate that NPoE effectively defends against a variety of triggers both separately and in trigger mixtures. Due to the versatility of the MoE structure in NPoE, this framework can be further expanded to defend against other attack settings ",

On the other hand, there have been automatic NoC synthesis methods for SoCs to optimize for application-specific communication and objectives such as resource usage or power. Unfortunately, these techniques do not lend themselves to the general-purpose context, where directly applying these previous NoC synthesis techniques in the general-purpose context yields poor results, even worse than expert-designed networks. We design and develop an automatic network design methodology - NetSmith - to design networks for general-purpose, shared memory multicores that comprehensively outperform expert-designed networks. We employ NetSmith in the context of interposer networks for chiplet-based systems where there has been significant recent work on network topology design (e.g., Kite, Butter Donut, Double Butterfly). NetSmith generated topologies are capable of achieving significantly higher throughput (50% to 75% higher) while also reducing average hop count by 8% to 13.5%) than previous expert-designed and synthesized networks. Full system simulations using PARSEC benchmarks demonstrate that the improved network performance translates to improved application performance with up to 11% mean speedup over previous NoI topologies.

We develop a new probabilistic method for C2MS prediction, FraGNNet, that can efficiently and accurately predict high-resolution spectra.

As a case study, we used the API code examples from the Joda-Time Java library. We had participants perform code comprehension and reuse tasks on variants of the example with different lengths and degrees of linearity. Findings: Participants demonstrated faster reaction times when exposed to linear code examples. However, no substantial differences in correctness or subjective ratings were observed.

A two-tier transformer architecture is chosen to encode morphological information at the inputs. At the target-side output, a multi-task multi-label training scheme coupled with a beam search-based decoder are found to improve machine translation performance. An attention augmentation scheme to the transformer model is proposed in a generic form to allow integration of pre-trained language models and also facilitate modeling of word order relationships between the source and target languages. Several data augmentation techniques are evaluated and shown to increase translation performance in low-resource settings. We evaluate our proposed solution on Kinyarwanda - English translation using public-domain parallel text. Our final models achieve competitive performance in relation to large multi-lingual models.

    "abstract": "Recent researches have shown that Large Language Models (LLMs) are susceptible to a security threat known as Backdoor Attack. The backdoored model will behave well in normal cases but exhibit malicious behaviours on inputs inserted with a specific backdoor trigger. Current backdoor studies on LLMs predominantly focus on instruction-tuned LLMs, while neglecting another realistic scenario where LLMs are fine-tuned on multi-turn conversational data to be chat models. Chat models are extensively adopted across various real-world scenarios, thus the security of chat models deserves increasing attention. Unfortunately, we point out that the flexible multi-turn interaction format instead increases the flexibility of trigger designs and amplifies the vulnerability of chat models to backdoor attacks. In this work, we reveal and achieve a novel backdoor attacking method on chat models by distributing multiple trigger scenarios across user inputs in different rounds, and making the backdoor be triggered only when all trigger scenarios have appeared in the historical conversations. Experimental results demonstrate that our method can achieve high attack success rates (e.g., over 90% ASR on Vicuna-7B) while successfully maintaining the normal capabilities of chat models on providing helpful responses to benign user requests. Also, the backdoor can not be easily removed by the downstream re-alignment, highlighting the importance of continued research and attention to the security concerns of chat models.

Given an input challenge, the PUF circuit should produce an unpredictable response for use in situations such as root-of-trust applications and other hardware-level cybersecurity applications. PUFs are typically subcircuits present within integrated circuits (ICs), and while conventional IC PUFs are well-understood, several implementations have proven vulnerable to malicious exploits, including those perpetrated by machine learning (ML)-based attacks. Such attacks can be difficult to prevent because they are often designed to work even when relatively few challenge-response pairs are known in advance. Hence the need for both more resilient PUF designs and analysis of ML-attack susceptibility. Previous work has developed a PUF for photonic integrated circuits (PICs). A PIC PUF not only produces unpredictable responses given manufacturing-introduced tolerances, but is also less prone to electromagnetic radiation eavesdropping attacks than a purely electronic IC PUF. In this work, we analyze the resilience of the proposed photonic PUF when subjected to ML-based attacks. Specifically, we describe a computational PUF model for producing the large datasets required for training ML attacks; we analyze the quality of the model; and we discuss the modeled PUF's susceptibility to ML-based attacks. We find that the modeled PUF generates distributions that resemble uniform white noise, explaining the exhibited resilience to neural-network-based attacks designed to exploit latent relationships between challenges and responses. Preliminary analysis suggests that the PUF exhibits similar resilience to generative adversarial networks, and continued development will show whether more-sophisticated ML approaches better compromise the PUF and -- if so -- how design modifications might improve resilience.

Previous deep learning-based image dehazing methods have failed to achieve satisfactory dehazing effects on both synthetic datasets and real-world datasets, exhibiting poor generalization. Moreover, single-stage networks often result in many regions with artifacts and color distortion in output images. To address these issues, this paper proposes a two-stage image dehazing network called TSNet, mainly consisting of the multi-scale fusion module (MSFM) and the adaptive learning module (ALM). Specifically, MSFM and ALM enhance the generalization of TSNet. The MSFM can obtain large receptive fields at multiple scales and integrate features at different frequencies to reduce the differences between inputs and learning objectives. The ALM can actively learn of regions of interest in images and restore texture details more effectively. Additionally, TSNet is designed as a two-stage network, where the first-stage network performs image dehazing, and the second-stage network is employed to improve issues such as artifacts and color distortion present in the results of the first-stage network. We also change the learning objective from ground truth images to opposite fog maps, which improves the learning efficiency of TSNet. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TSNet exhibits superior dehazing performance on both synthetic and real-world datasets compared to previous state-of-the-art methods. ",

A case study is presented featuring a vehicle classification application using acoustic and seismic sensing. The work is motivated by the success of foundation models in the areas of natural language processing and computer vision, leading to generalizations of the FM concept to other domains as well, where significant amounts of unlabeled data exist that can be used for self-supervised pre-training. One such domain is IoT applications. Foundation models for selected sensing modalities in the IoT domain can be pre-trained in an environment-agnostic fashion using available unlabeled sensor data and then fine-tuned to the deployment at hand using a small amount of labeled data. The paper shows that the pre-training/fine-tuning approach improves the robustness of downstream inference and facilitates adaptation to different environmental conditions. More specifically, we present a case study in a real-world setting to evaluate a simple (vibration-based) FM-like model, called FOCAL, demonstrating its superior robustness and adaptation, compared to conventional supervised deep neural networks (DNNs). We also demonstrate its superior convergence over supervised solutions. Our findings highlight the advantages of vibration-based FMs (and FM-inspired selfsupervised models in general) in terms of inference robustness, runtime efficiency, and model adaptation (via fine-tuning) in resource-limited IoT settings.

In this paper, we aim to perform membership inference on visual self-supervised models in a more realistic setting: self-supervised training method and details are unknown for an adversary when attacking as he usually faces a black-box system in practice. In this setting, considering that self-supervised model could be trained by completely different self-supervised paradigms, e.g., masked image modeling and contrastive learning, with complex training details, we propose a unified membership inference method called PartCrop. It is motivated by the shared part-aware capability among models and stronger part response on the training data. Specifically, PartCrop crops parts of objects in an image to query responses with the image in representation space. We conduct extensive attacks on self-supervised models with different training protocols and structures using three widely used image datasets. The results verify the effectiveness and generalization of PartCrop. Moreover, to defend against PartCrop, we evaluate two common approaches, i.e., early stop and differential privacy, and propose a tailored method called shrinking crop scale range.

In the past researchers have used instruments such as code-explain and found that the extent of cognitive depth reached in these tasks correlated well with code writing ability. However, the need for manual marking and personalized interviews used for identifying cognitive difficulties limited the study to a small group of stragglers. To extend this work to larger groups, we have devised several question types with varying cognitive demands collectively called Algorithmic Reasoning Tasks (ARTs), which do not require manual marking. These tasks require levels of reasoning which can define a learning trajectory. This paper describes these instruments and the machine learning models used for validating them. We have used the data collected in an introductory programming course in the penultimate week of the semester which required attempting ART type instruments and code writing. Our preliminary research suggests ART type instruments can be combined with specific machine learning models to act as an effective learning trajectory and early prediction of code-writing skills. ",

    "abstract": "Real-time navigation in a priori unknown environment remains a challenging task, especially when an unexpected (unmodeled) disturbance occurs. In this paper, we propose the framework Safe Returning Fast and Safe Tracking (SR-F) that merges concepts from 1) Robust Control Lyapunov-Value Functions (R-CLVF), and 2) the Fast and Safe Tracking (FaSTrack) framework. The SR-F computes an R-CLVF offline between a model of the true system and a simplified planning model. Online, a planning algorithm is used to generate a trajectory in the simplified planning space, and the R-CLVF is used to provide a tracking controller that exponentially stabilizes to the planning model. When an unexpected disturbance occurs, the proposed SR-F algorithm provides a means for the true system to recover to the planning model. We take advantage of this mechanism to induce an artificial disturbance by ``jumping'' the planning model in open environments, forcing faster navigation. Therefore, this algorithm can both reject unexpected true disturbances and accelerate navigation speed. We validate our framework using a 10D quadrotor system and show that SR-F is empirically 20\\% faster than the original FaSTrack while maintaining safety. ",

    "abstract": "State-of-the-art neural rankers pre-trained on large task-specific training data such as MS-MARCO, have been shown to exhibit strong performance on various ranking tasks without domain adaptation, also called zero-shot. However, zero-shot neural ranking may be sub-optimal, as it does not take advantage of the target domain information. Unfortunately, acquiring sufficiently large and high quality target training data to improve a modern neural ranker can be costly and time-consuming. To address this problem, we propose a new approach to unsupervised domain adaptation for ranking, DUQGen, which addresses a critical gap in prior literature, namely how to automatically generate both effective and diverse synthetic training data to fine tune a modern neural ranker for a new domain. Specifically, DUQGen produces a more effective representation of the target domain by identifying clusters of similar documents; and generates a more diverse training dataset by probabilistic sampling over the resulting document clusters. Our extensive experiments, over the standard BEIR collection, demonstrate that DUQGen consistently outperforms all zero-shot baselines and substantially outperforms the SOTA baselines on 16 out of 18 datasets, for an average of 4% relative improvement across all datasets. We complement our results with a thorough analysis for more in-depth understanding of the proposed method's performance and to identify promising areas for further improvements. ",

To address this, we introduce a novel framework that explicitly aligns words between English and eight low-resource languages, utilizing off-the-shelf word alignment models. This framework incorporates three primary training objectives: aligned word prediction and word translation ranking, along with the widely used translation ranking. We evaluate our approach through experiments on the bitext retrieval task, which demonstrate substantial improvements on sentence embeddings in low-resource languages.

We design our dataset according to the K-12 curriculum. This enables the direct comparison of the social understanding of large language models to humans, more specifically, elementary students. While prior work generates nearly random accuracy on our benchmark, recent large language models such as GPT3.5-Turbo and LLaMA2-Chat are able to improve the performance significantly, only slightly below human performance. We then propose a multi-agent framework based on large language models to improve the models' ability to understand social norms. This method further improves large language models to be on par with humans. Given the increasing adoption of large language models in real-world applications, our finding is particularly important and presents a unique direction for future improvements. ",

By conducting error analysis on standard multigrid applied to a discrete Helmholtz equation, we devise a strategy to handle errors with different frequencies separately. For error components with frequencies distant from the wavenumber, we perform simple smoothing based on local operations at different levels to eliminate them. On the other hand, to address error components with frequencies near the wavenumber, we utilize another multigrid V-cycle to solve an advection-diffusion-reaction (ADR) equation at a coarse scale. The resulting solver, named Wave-ADR-NS, involves parameters learned through unsupervised training. Numerical results demonstrate that Wave-ADR-NS effectively resolves heterogeneous 2D Helmholtz equation with wavenumber up to 2000. Comparative experiments against classical multigrid preconditioners and existing deep learning-based multigrid preconditioners reveals the superior performance of Wave-ADR-NS. ",

However, the simple combination of memory data and new-task samples can still result in substantial forgetting of previously acquired knowledge, which may occur due to the potential overlap between the feature distribution of new data and the previously learned embedding space. Moreover, the model suffers from overfitting on the few memory samples rather than effectively remembering learned patterns. To address the challenges of forgetting and overfitting, we propose a novel method based on embedding space separation and compaction. Our method alleviates forgetting of previously learned tasks by forcing the feature distribution of new data away from the previous embedding space. It also mitigates overfitting by a memory calibration mechanism that encourages memory data to be close to its prototype to enhance intra-class compactness. In addition, the learnable parameters of the new task are initialized by drawing upon acquired knowledge from the previously learned task to facilitate forward knowledge transfer. With extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our method can significantly outperform previous state-of-the-art approaches. ",

Novel approaches from machine learning to solve differential equations could provide a more generic way to find coarse level models for parallel-in-time algorithms. This paper demonstrates that a physics-informed Fourier Neural Operator (PINO) is an effective coarse model for the parallelization in time of the two-asset Black-Scholes equation using Parareal. We demonstrate that PINO-Parareal converges as fast as a bespoke numerical coarse model and that, in combination with spatial parallelization by domain decomposition, it provides better overall speedup than both purely spatial parallelization and space-time parallelizaton with a numerical coarse propagator.

However, previous 3D scene graph generation methods utilize a fully supervised learning manner and require a large amount of entity-level annotation data of objects and relations, which is extremely resource-consuming and tedious to obtain. To tackle this problem, we propose 3D-VLAP, a weakly-supervised 3D scene graph generation method via Visual-Linguistic Assisted Pseudo-labeling. Specifically, our 3D-VLAP exploits the superior ability of current large-scale visual-linguistic models to align the semantics between texts and 2D images, as well as the naturally existing correspondences between 2D images and 3D point clouds, and thus implicitly constructs correspondences between texts and 3D point clouds. First, we establish the positional correspondence from 3D point clouds to 2D images via camera intrinsic and extrinsic parameters, thereby achieving alignment of 3D point clouds and 2D images. Subsequently, a large-scale cross-modal visual-linguistic model is employed to indirectly align 3D instances with the textual category labels of objects by matching 2D images with object category labels. The pseudo labels for objects and relations are then produced for 3D-VLAP model training by calculating the similarity between visual embeddings and textual category embeddings of objects and relations encoded by the visual-linguistic model, respectively. Ultimately, we design an edge self-attention based graph neural network to generate scene graphs of 3D point cloud scenes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our 3D-VLAP achieves comparable results with current advanced fully supervised methods, meanwhile significantly alleviating the pressure of data annotation. ",

By transformations, the semi-infinite constraints caused by the imperfect CSI are converted into more tractable forms for facilitating a computationally efficient unsupervised deep learning algorithm. In addition, to further reduce the computational complexity, a computationally effective unsupervised deep learning algorithm is proposed to implement robust joint AP clustering and beamforming design with imperfect CSI in cell-free systems.

    "abstract": "With the enhanced performance of large models on natural language processing tasks, potential moral and ethical issues of large models arise. There exist malicious attackers who induce large models to jailbreak and generate information containing illegal, privacy-invasive information through techniques such as prompt engineering. As a result, large models counter malicious attackers' attacks using techniques such as safety alignment. However, the strong defense mechanism of the large model through rejection replies is easily identified by attackers and used to strengthen attackers' capabilities. In this paper, we propose a multi-agent attacker-disguiser game approach to achieve a weak defense mechanism that allows the large model to both safely reply to the attacker and hide the defense intent. First, we construct a multi-agent framework to simulate attack and defense scenarios, playing different roles to be responsible for attack, disguise, safety evaluation, and disguise evaluation tasks. After that, we design attack and disguise game algorithms to optimize the game strategies of the attacker and the disguiser and use the curriculum learning process to strengthen the capabilities of the agents. The experiments verify that the method in this paper is more effective in strengthening the model's ability to disguise the defense intent compared with other methods. Moreover, our approach can adapt any black-box large model to assist the model in defense and does not suffer from model version iterations. ",

This work aims to simplify deep learning-based spatio-temporal relationship models and introduce interpretability into features for data association. Specifically, a lightweight single-layer transformer encoder is utilized to model spatio-temporal relationships. To make features more interpretative, two contrastive regularization losses based on representation alignment are proposed, derived from spatio-temporal consistency rules. By applying weighted summation to affinity matrices, the aligned features can seamlessly integrate into the data association stage of the original tracking workflow. Experimental results showcase that our model enhances the majority of existing tracking networks' performance without excessive complexity, with minimal increase in training overhead and nearly negligible computational and storage costs.

First, the background in complex scenes shows a large variance among different views. Second, the current inference pattern, $i.e.$, a pixel only relies on an individual camera ray, fails to capture contextual information. To solve these problems, we propose to enlarge the ray perception field and build up the sample points interactions. In this paper, we design a novel inference pattern that encourages a single camera ray possessing more contextual information, and models the relationship among sample points on each camera ray. To hold contextual information,a camera ray in our proposed method can render a patch of pixels simultaneously. Moreover, we replace the MLP in neural radiance field models with distance-aware convolutions to enhance the feature propagation among sample points from the same camera ray. To summarize, as a torchlight, a ray in our proposed method achieves rendering a patch of image. Thus, we call the proposed method, Torch-NeRF.

    "abstract": "Rigorous evaluation of the causal effects of semantic features on language model predictions can be hard to achieve for natural language reasoning problems. However, this is such a desirable form of analysis from both an interpretability and model evaluation perspective, that it is valuable to investigate specific patterns of reasoning with enough structure and regularity to identify and quantify systematic reasoning failures in widely-used models. In this vein, we pick a portion of the NLI task for which an explicit causal diagram can be systematically constructed: the case where across two sentences (the premise and hypothesis), two related words/terms occur in a shared context. In this work, we apply causal effect estimation strategies to measure the effect of context interventions (whose effect on the entailment label is mediated by the semantic monotonicity characteristic) and interventions on the inserted word-pair (whose effect on the entailment label is mediated by the relation between these words). Extending related work on causal analysis of NLP models in different settings, we perform an extensive interventional study on the NLI task to investigate robustness to irrelevant changes and sensitivity to impactful changes of Transformers. The results strongly bolster the fact that similar benchmark accuracy scores may be observed for models that exhibit very different behaviour. Moreover, our methodology reinforces previously suspected biases from a causal perspective, including biases in favour of upward-monotone contexts and ignoring the effects of negation markers. ",

In response, we introduce 3DStyleGLIP, a novel framework specifically designed for text-driven, part-tailored 3D stylization. Given a 3D mesh and a text prompt, 3DStyleGLIP leverages the vision-language embedding space of the Grounded Language-Image Pre-training (GLIP) model to localize the individual parts of the 3D mesh and modify their colors and local geometries to align them with the desired styles specified in the text prompt. 3DStyleGLIP is effectively trained for 3D stylization tasks through a part-level style loss working in GLIP's embedding space, supplemented by two complementary learning techniques. Extensive experimental validation confirms that our method achieves significant part-wise stylization capabilities, demonstrating promising potential in advancing the field of 3D stylization. ",

To this end, they manipulate their instructions for the LLM by inserting separators or rephrasing them systematically until they reach their goal. Our approach is different. It inserts words from the model vocabulary. We find these words using an optimization procedure and embeddings from another LLM (attacker LLM). We prove our approach by goal hijacking two popular open-source LLMs from the Llama2 and the Flan-T5 families, respectively. We present two main findings. First, our approach creates inconspicuous instructions and therefore it is hard to detect. For many attack cases, we find that even a single word insertion is sufficient.

    "abstract": "Recently, deep learning (DL) has been emerging as a promising approach for channel estimation and signal detection in wireless communications. The majority of the existing studies investigating the use of DL techniques in this domain focus on analysing channel impulse responses that are generated from only one channel distribution such as additive white Gaussian channel noise and Rayleigh channels. In practice, to cope with the dynamic nature of the wireless channel, DL methods must be re-trained on newly non-aged collected data which is costly, inefficient, and impractical. To tackle this challenge, this paper proposes a novel universal deep neural network (Uni-DNN) that can achieve high detection performance in various wireless environments without retraining the model. In particular, our proposed Uni-DNN model consists of a wireless channel classifier and a signal detector which are constructed by using DNNs. The wireless channel classifier enables the signal detector to generalise and perform optimally for multiple wireless channel distributions. In addition, to further improve the signal detection performance of the proposed model, convolutional neural network is employed. Extensive simulations using the orthogonal frequency division multiplexing scheme demonstrate that the bit error rate performance of our proposed solution can outperform conventional DL-based approaches as well as least square and minimum mean square error channel estimators in practical low pilot density scenarios.

We introduce different types of non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) in few-shot learning, addressing the data scarcity issue in medical image classification. Extensive empirical studies are conducted in terms of validating the effectiveness of NMF, especially its supervised variants (e.g., discriminative NMF, and supervised and constrained NMF with sparseness), and the comparison with principal component analysis (PCA), i.e., the collaborative representation-based dimensionality reduction technique derived from eigenvectors. With 14 different datasets covering 11 distinct illness categories, thorough experimental results and comparison with related techniques demonstrate that NMF is a competitive alternative to PCA for few-shot learning in medical imaging, and the supervised NMF algorithms are more discriminative in the subspace with greater effectiveness. Furthermore, we show that the part-based representation of NMF, especially its supervised variants, is dramatically impactful in detecting lesion areas in medical imaging with limited samples. ",

They significantly undermine the ability of high-performance neural networks by forcing misclassifications. These attacks introduce minute and structured perturbations or alterations in the test samples, imperceptible to human annotators in general, but trained neural networks and other models are sensitive to it. Historically, adversarial attacks have been first identified and studied in the domain of image processing. In this paper, we study adversarial examples in the field of natural language processing, specifically text classification tasks. We investigate the reasons for adversarial vulnerability, particularly in relation to the inherent dimensionality of the model. Our key finding is that there is a very strong correlation between the embedding dimensionality of the adversarial samples and their effectiveness on models tuned with input samples with same embedding dimension. We utilize this sensitivity to design an adversarial defense mechanism. We use ensemble models of varying inherent dimensionality to thwart the attacks. This is tested on multiple datasets for its efficacy in providing robustness. We also study the problem of measuring adversarial perturbation using different distance metrics. For all of the aforementioned studies, we have run tests on multiple models with varying dimensionality and used a word-vector level adversarial attack to substantiate the findings. ",

Models based on convolutional neural networks are limited in their ability to model global features of remote sensing images due to local convolution operations. Transformer based models, despite their global modeling capabilities, face computational challenges with large VHR images due to their quadratic complexity. The common practice of cropping large images into smaller patches leads to a significant loss of contextual information. To address these issues, we propose the Remote Sensing Mamba (RSM) for dense prediction tasks in VHR remote sensing. RSM is designed to model global features of remote sensing images with linear complexity, enabling it to process large VHR images effectively. It employs an omnidirectional selective scan module to globally model the images in multiple directions, capturing large spatial features from various directions. Experiments on semantic segmentation and change detection tasks across various objects demonstrate the effectiveness of RSM. With simple model architecture and training approach, RSM achieves state-of-the-art performance on the dense prediction tasks of VHR remote sensing.

We evaluate the impact of injecting information about disambiguated words into a model targeting misogyny detection. In particular, we explore two different approaches for injection: concatenation of pejorative information and substitution of ambiguous words with univocal terms. Our experimental results, both on our corpus and on two popular benchmarks on Italian tweets, show that both approaches lead to a major classification improvement, indicating that word sense disambiguation is a promising preliminary step for misogyny detection.

Graph transformation is a model for dynamic systems with a large variety of applications. We introduce a novel method of the graph transformation model construction, combining generative and dynamical viewpoints to give a fully automated data-driven model inference method. The method takes the input dynamical properties, given as a \"snapshot\" of the dynamics encoded by explicit transitions, and constructs a compatible model. The obtained model is guaranteed to be minimal, thus framing the approach as model compression (from a set of transitions into a set of rules). The compression is permissive to a lossy case, where the constructed model is allowed to exhibit behavior outside of the input transitions, thus suggesting a completion of the input dynamics. The task of graph transformation model inference is naturally highly challenging due to the combinatorics involved. We tackle the exponential explosion by proposing a heuristically minimal translation of the task into a well-established problem, set cover, for which highly optimized solutions exist. We further showcase how our results relate to Kolmogorov complexity expressed in terms of graph transformation. ",

Our approach addresses the trade-off between obfuscation and utility in data protection, quantified through logarithmic loss, also known as self-information loss. This research provides a foundational exploration into the integration of information-theoretic privacy principles with representation learning, focusing specifically on the face recognition systems. We particularly highlight the adaptability of our framework with recent advancements in face recognition networks, such as AdaFace and ArcFace. In addition, we introduce the Generative Privacy Funnel ($\\mathsf{GenPF}$) model, a paradigm that extends beyond the traditional scope of the PF model, referred to as the Discriminative Privacy Funnel ($\\mathsf{DisPF}$). This $\\mathsf{GenPF}$ model brings new perspectives on data generation methods with estimation-theoretic and information-theoretic privacy guarantees. Complementing these developments, we also present the deep variational PF (DVPF) model. This model proposes a tractable variational bound for measuring information leakage, enhancing the understanding of privacy preservation challenges in deep representation learning. The DVPF model, associated with both $\\mathsf{DisPF}$ and $\\mathsf{GenPF}$ models, sheds light on connections with various generative models such as Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), and Diffusion models.

Previous LiDAR NVS methods employ a simple shift from image NVS methods while ignoring the dynamic nature and the large-scale reconstruction problem of LiDAR point clouds. In light of this, we propose LiDAR4D, a differentiable LiDAR-only framework for novel space-time LiDAR view synthesis. In consideration of the sparsity and large-scale characteristics, we design a 4D hybrid representation combined with multi-planar and grid features to achieve effective reconstruction in a coarse-to-fine manner. Furthermore, we introduce geometric constraints derived from point clouds to improve temporal consistency. For the realistic synthesis of LiDAR point clouds, we incorporate the global optimization of ray-drop probability to preserve cross-region patterns. Extensive experiments on KITTI-360 and NuScenes datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method in accomplishing geometry-aware and time-consistent dynamic reconstruction.

    "title": "Closing the Implementation Gap in MC: Fully Chemical Synchronization and  Detection for Cellular Receivers",
    "abstract": "In the context of the Internet of Bio-Nano Things (IoBNT), nano-devices are envisioned to perform complex tasks collaboratively, i.e., by communicating with each other. One candidate for the implementation of such devices are engineered cells due to their inherent biocompatibility. However, because each engineered cell has only little computational capabilities, transmitter and receiver (RX) functionalities can afford only limited complexity. In this paper, we propose a simple, yet modular, architecture for a cellular RX that is capable of processing a stream of observed symbols using chemical reaction networks. Furthermore, we propose two specific detector implementations for the RX. The first detector is based on a machine learning model that is trained offline, i.e., before the cellular RX is deployed. The second detector utilizes pilot symbol-based training and is therefore able to continuously adapt to changing channel conditions online, i.e., after deployment. To coordinate the different chemical processing steps involved in symbol detection, the proposed cellular RX leverages an internal chemical timer. Furthermore, the RX is synchronized with the transmitter via external, i.e., extracellular, signals. Finally, the proposed architecture is validated using theoretical analysis and stochastic simulations. The presented results confirm the feasibility of both proposed implementations and reveal that the proposed online learning-based RX is able to perform reliable detection even in initially unknown or slowly changing channels. By its modular design and exclusively chemical implementation, the proposed RX contributes towards the realization of versatile and biocompatible nano-scale communication networks for IoBNT applications narrowing the existing implementation gap in cellular molecular communication (MC).

Existing implicit discretizations of that differentiator are shown to exhibit either unbounded bias errors or, surprisingly, discretization chattering despite the use of the implicit discretization. A new, proper implicit discretization that exhibits neither of these two detrimental effects is proposed by computing the differentiator's outputs as appropriately designed linear combinations of its state variables. A numerical differentiator implementation is discussed and closed-form stability conditions for arbitrary differentiation orders are given. The influence of bounded measurement noise and numerical approximation errors is formally analyzed. Numerical simulations confirm the obtained results. ",

However, modeling the uncertainty of the dynamics typically results in intractable belief dynamics, making data-efficient planning under uncertainty difficult. This article focuses on the problem of efficiently generating robust open-loop pushing plans. First, we investigate how the belief over object configurations propagates through quasi-static contact dynamics. We exploit the simplified dynamics to predict the variance of the object configuration without sampling from a perturbation distribution. In a sampling-based trajectory optimization algorithm, the gain of the variance is constrained in order to enforce robustness of the plan. Second, we propose an informed trajectory sampling mechanism for drawing robot trajectories that are likely to make contact with the object. This sampling mechanism is shown to significantly improve chances of finding robust solutions, especially when making-and-breaking contacts is required. We demonstrate that the proposed approach is able to synthesize bi-manual pushing trajectories, resulting in successful long-horizon pushing maneuvers without exteroceptive feedback such as vision or tactile feedback.

In recent years, inspired by self-supervised learning, contrastive Heterogeneous Graphs Neural Networks (HGNNs) have shown great potential by utilizing data augmentation and discriminators for downstream tasks. However, data augmentation is still limited due to the discrete and abstract nature of graphs. To tackle the above limitations, we propose a novel \\textit{Generative-Contrastive Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network (GC-HGNN)}. Specifically, we first propose a heterogeneous graph generative learning enhanced contrastive paradigm. This paradigm includes: 1) A contrastive view augmentation strategy by using masked autoencoder. 2) Position-aware and semantics-aware positive sample sampling strategy for generate hard negative samples. 3) A hierarchical contrastive learning strategy for capturing local and global information. Furthermore, the hierarchical contrastive learning and sampling strategies aim to constitute an enhanced discriminator under the generative-contrastive perspective. Finally, we compare our model with seventeen baselines on eight real-world datasets. Our model outperforms the latest contrastive and generative baselines on node classification and link prediction tasks. To reproduce our work, we have open-sourced our code at https://github.com/xxx.

    "abstract": "Machine learning based phishing website detectors (ML-PWD) are a critical part of today's anti-phishing solutions in operation. Unfortunately, ML-PWD are prone to adversarial evasions, evidenced by both academic studies and analyses of real-world adversarial phishing webpages. However, existing works mostly focused on assessing adversarial phishing webpages against ML-PWD, while neglecting a crucial aspect: investigating whether they can deceive the actual target of phishing -- the end users. In this paper, we fill this gap by conducting two user studies (n=470) to examine how human users perceive adversarial phishing webpages, spanning both synthetically crafted ones (which we create by evading a state-of-the-art ML-PWD) as well as real adversarial webpages (taken from the wild Web) that bypassed a production-grade ML-PWD. Our findings confirm that adversarial phishing is a threat to both users and ML-PWD, since most adversarial phishing webpages have comparable effectiveness on users w.r.t. unperturbed ones. However, not all adversarial perturbations are equally effective. For example, those with added typos are significantly more noticeable to users, who tend to overlook perturbations of higher visual magnitude (such as replacing the background). We also show that users' self-reported frequency of visiting a brand's website has a statistically negative correlation with their phishing detection accuracy, which is likely caused by overconfidence.

Modern neural networks have outstanding ability in modeling complex time series. Self-supervised models in particular tackle unsupervised TSAD by transforming the input via various augmentations to create pseudo anomalies for training. However, their performance is sensitive to the choice of augmentation, which is hard to choose in practice, while there exists no effort in the literature on data augmentation tuning for TSAD without labels. Our work aims to fill this gap. We introduce TSAP for TSA \"on autoPilot\", which can (self-)tune augmentation hyperparameters end-to-end. It stands on two key components: a differentiable augmentation architecture and an unsupervised validation loss to effectively assess the alignment between augmentation type and anomaly type. Case studies show TSAP's ability to effectively select the (discrete) augmentation type and associated (continuous) hyperparameters. In turn, it outperforms established baselines, including SOTA self-supervised models, on diverse TSAD tasks exhibiting different anomaly types. ",

However, recent advances have rapidly expanded this to include the approximation of multiple operators using foundation models equipped with millions or billions of trainable parameters, leading to the research of multi-operator learning (MOL). In this paper, we present a novel distributed training approach aimed at enabling a single neural operator with significantly fewer parameters to effectively tackle multi-operator learning challenges, all without incurring additional average costs. Our method is applicable to various Chen-Chen-type neural operators, such as Deep Operator Neural Networks (DON). The core idea is to independently learn the output basis functions for each operator using its dedicated data, while simultaneously centralizing the learning of the input function encoding shared by all operators using the entire dataset. Through a systematic study of five numerical examples, we compare the accuracy and cost of training a single neural operator for each operator independently versus training a MOL model using our proposed method. Our results demonstrate enhanced efficiency and satisfactory accuracy. Moreover, our approach illustrates that some operators with limited data can be more effectively constructed with the aid of data from analogous operators through MOL learning. This highlights another MOL's potential to bolster operator learning. ",

This simple, intuitive methodology allows autoregressive (AR) transformers to learn visual distributions fast and generalize well: VAR, for the first time, makes AR models surpass diffusion transformers in image generation. On ImageNet 256x256 benchmark, VAR significantly improve AR baseline by improving Frechet inception distance (FID) from 18.65 to 1.80, inception score (IS) from 80.4 to 356.4, with around 20x faster inference speed. It is also empirically verified that VAR outperforms the Diffusion Transformer (DiT) in multiple dimensions including image quality, inference speed, data efficiency, and scalability. Scaling up VAR models exhibits clear power-law scaling laws similar to those observed in LLMs, with linear correlation coefficients near -0.998 as solid evidence. VAR further showcases zero-shot generalization ability in downstream tasks including image in-painting, out-painting, and editing. These results suggest VAR has initially emulated the two important properties of LLMs: Scaling Laws and zero-shot task generalization.

The best results for the blood test samples obtained from San Raphael Hospital, which include two classes of individuals, those with COVID-19 and those with non-COVID diseases, were achieved through the use of the Ensemble method (a combination of a neural network and two machines learning methods). The results showed that this approach for COVID-19 diagnosis is cost-effective and provides results in a shorter amount of time than other methods. The proposed model achieved an accuracy of 94.09% on the dataset used. Secondly, the radiographic images were divided into four classes: normal, viral pneumonia, ground glass opacity, and COVID-19 infection. These were used for segmentation and classification. The lung lobes were extracted from the images and then categorized into specific classes. We achieved an accuracy of 91.1% on the image dataset. Generally, this study highlights the potential of AI in detecting and managing COVID-19 and underscores the importance of continued research and development in this field. ",

    "abstract": "Vestibular schwannomas (VS) are benign tumors that are generally managed by active surveillance with MRI examination. To further assist clinical decision-making and avoid overtreatment, an accurate prediction of tumor growth based on longitudinal imaging is highly desirable. In this paper, we introduce DeepGrowth, a deep learning method that incorporates neural fields and recurrent neural networks for prospective tumor growth prediction. In the proposed method, each tumor is represented as a signed distance function (SDF) conditioned on a low-dimensional latent code. Unlike previous studies that perform tumor shape prediction directly in the image space, we predict the latent codes instead and then reconstruct future shapes from it. To deal with irregular time intervals, we introduce a time-conditioned recurrent module based on a ConvLSTM and a novel temporal encoding strategy, which enables the proposed model to output varying tumor shapes over time. The experiments on an in-house longitudinal VS dataset showed that the proposed model significantly improved the performance ($\\ge 1.6\\%$ Dice score and $\\ge0.20$ mm 95\\% Hausdorff distance), in particular for top 20\\% tumors that grow or shrink the most ($\\ge 4.6\\%$ Dice score and $\\ge 0.73$ mm 95\\% Hausdorff distance).

    "abstract": "With the emergence of neural audio codecs, which encode multiple streams of discrete tokens from audio, large language models have recently gained attention as a promising approach for zero-shot Text-to-Speech (TTS) synthesis. Despite the ongoing rush towards scaling paradigms, audio tokenization ironically amplifies the scalability challenge, stemming from its long sequence length and the complexity of modelling the multiple sequences. To mitigate these issues, we present CLaM-TTS that employs a probabilistic residual vector quantization to (1) achieve superior compression in the token length, and (2) allow a language model to generate multiple tokens at once, thereby eliminating the need for cascaded modeling to handle the number of token streams. Our experimental results demonstrate that CLaM-TTS is better than or comparable to state-of-the-art neural codec-based TTS models regarding naturalness, intelligibility, speaker similarity, and inference speed. In addition, we examine the impact of the pretraining extent of the language models and their text tokenization strategies on performances. ",

    "abstract": "Far-from equilibrium molecular templating networks, like those that maintain the populations of RNA and protein molecules in the cell, are key biological motifs. These networks share the general property that assembled products are produced and degraded via complex pathways controlled by catalysts, including molecular templates. Although it has been suggested that the information propagated from templates to products sets a lower bound on the thermodynamic cost of these networks, this bound has not been explored rigorously to date. We show that, for an arbitrarily catalytic reaction network in steady state, the specificity with which a single product can dominate the ensemble is upper bounded, and the entropy of the product ensemble lower bounded, by a function of $\\Delta G$, the difference between the maximal and minimal free-energy changes along pathways to assembly. These simple bounds are particularly restrictive for systems with a smaller number of possible products $M$. Remarkably, however, although $\\Delta G$ constrains the information propagated to the product distribution, the systems that saturate the bound operate in a pseudo-equilibrium fashion, and there is no minimal entropy production rate for maintaining this non-equilibrium distribution. Moreover, for large systems, a vanishingly small subset of the possible products can dominate the product ensemble even for small values of $\\Delta G/\\ln M$. ",
