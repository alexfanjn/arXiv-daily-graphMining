    "title": "Leave No One Behind: Online Self-Supervised Self-Distillation for  Sequential Recommendation",
    "abstract": "Sequential recommendation methods play a pivotal role in modern recommendation systems. A key challenge lies in accurately modeling user preferences in the face of data sparsity. To tackle this challenge, recent methods leverage contrastive learning (CL) to derive self-supervision signals by maximizing the mutual information of two augmented views of the original user behavior sequence. Despite their effectiveness, CL-based methods encounter a limitation in fully exploiting self-supervision signals for users with limited behavior data, as users with extensive behaviors naturally offer more information. To address this problem, we introduce a novel learning paradigm, named Online Self-Supervised Self-distillation for Sequential Recommendation ($S^4$Rec), effectively bridging the gap between self-supervised learning and self-distillation methods. Specifically, we employ online clustering to proficiently group users by their distinct latent intents. Additionally, an adversarial learning strategy is utilized to ensure that the clustering procedure is not affected by the behavior length factor. Subsequently, we employ self-distillation to facilitate the transfer of knowledge from users with extensive behaviors (teachers) to users with limited behaviors (students). Experiments conducted on four real-world datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed method\\footnote{Code is available at https://github.com/xjaw/S4Rec ",

    "abstract": "Current large language models (LLMs) provide a strong foundation for large-scale user-oriented natural language tasks. A large number of users can easily inject adversarial text or instructions through the user interface, thus causing LLMs model security challenges. Although there is currently a large amount of research on prompt injection attacks, most of these black-box attacks use heuristic strategies. It is unclear how these heuristic strategies relate to the success rate of attacks and thus effectively improve model robustness. To solve this problem, we redefine the goal of the attack: to maximize the KL divergence between the conditional probabilities of the clean text and the adversarial text. Furthermore, we prove that maximizing the KL divergence is equivalent to maximizing the Mahalanobis distance between the embedded representation $x$ and $x'$ of the clean text and the adversarial text when the conditional probability is a Gaussian distribution and gives a quantitative relationship on $x$ and $x'$. Then we designed a simple and effective goal-guided generative prompt injection strategy (G2PIA) to find an injection text that satisfies specific constraints to achieve the optimal attack effect approximately. It is particularly noteworthy that our attack method is a query-free black-box attack method with low computational cost. Experimental results on seven LLM models and four datasets show the effectiveness of our attack method. ",

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being developed and applied, but their widespread use faces challenges. These include aligning LLMs' responses with human values to prevent harmful outputs, which is addressed through safety training methods. Even so, bad actors and malicious users have succeeded in attempts to manipulate the LLMs to generate misaligned responses for harmful questions such as methods to create a bomb in school labs, recipes for harmful drugs, and ways to evade privacy rights. Another challenge is the multilingual capabilities of LLMs, which enable the model to understand and respond in multiple languages. Consequently, attackers exploit the unbalanced pre-training datasets of LLMs in different languages and the comparatively lower model performance in low-resource languages than high-resource ones. As a result, attackers use a low-resource languages to intentionally manipulate the model to create harmful responses. Many of the similar attack vectors have been patched by model providers, making the LLMs more robust against language-based manipulation. In this paper, we introduce a new black-box attack vector called the \\emph{Sandwich attack}: a multi-language mixture attack, which manipulates state-of-the-art LLMs into generating harmful and misaligned responses. Our experiments with five different models, namely Google's Bard, Gemini Pro, LLaMA-2-70-B-Chat, GPT-3.5-Turbo, GPT-4, and Claude-3-OPUS, show that this attack vector can be used by adversaries to generate harmful responses and elicit misaligned responses from these models. By detailing both the mechanism and impact of the Sandwich attack, this paper aims to guide future research and development towards more secure and resilient LLMs, ensuring they serve the public good while minimizing potential for misuse.

    "abstract": "From a process development perspective, diamond growth via chemical vapor deposition has made significant strides. However, challenges persist in achieving high quality and large-area material production. These difficulties include controlling conditions to maintain uniform growth rates for the entire growth surface. As growth progresses, various factors or defect states emerge, altering the uniform conditions. These changes affect the growth rate and result in the formation of crystalline defects at the microscale. However, there is a distinct lack of methods to identify these defect states and their geometry using images taken during the growth process. This paper details seminal work on defect segmentation pipeline using in-situ optical images to identify features that indicate defective states that are visible at the macroscale. Using a semantic segmentation approach as applied in our previous work, these defect states and corresponding derivative features are isolated and classified by their pixel masks. Using an annotation focused human-in-the-loop software architecture to produce training datasets, with modules for selective data labeling using active learning, data augmentations, and model-assisted labeling, our approach achieves effective annotation accuracy and drastically reduces the time and cost of labeling by orders of magnitude. On the model development front, we found that deep learning-based algorithms are the most efficient. They can accurately learn complex representations from feature-rich datasets. Our best-performing model, based on the YOLOV3 and DeeplabV3plus architectures, achieved excellent accuracy for specific features of interest. Specifically, it reached 93.35% accuracy for center defects, 92.83% for polycrystalline defects, and 91.98% for edge defects. ",

The class of plants considered is that of linear time-invariant (LTI) systems interconnected with an uncertainty, including nonlinearities treated as an uncertainty for convenience of analysis. The uncertainty of the plant and the nonlinearities of the neural network are both described using integral quadratic constraints (IQCs). First, a dissipativity condition is derived for uncertain LTI systems. Second, this condition is used to construct a linear matrix inequality (LMI) which can be used to synthesize neural network controllers. Finally, this convex condition is used in a projection-based training method to synthesize neural network controllers with dissipativity guarantees.

Through a large-scale correlation analysis framework, we study shift invariance of CNNs by inspecting existing downsampling operators in terms of their maximum-sampling bias (MSB), and find that MSB is negatively correlated with shift invariance. Based on this crucial insight, we propose a learnable pooling operator called Translation Invariant Polyphase Sampling (TIPS) and two regularizations on the intermediate feature maps of TIPS to reduce MSB and learn translation-invariant representations. TIPS can be integrated into any CNN and can be trained end-to-end with marginal computational overhead. Our experiments demonstrate that TIPS results in consistent performance gains in terms of accuracy, shift consistency, and shift fidelity on multiple benchmarks for image classification and semantic segmentation compared to previous methods and also leads to improvements in adversarial and distributional robustness.

However, ensuring user input privacy and secure inference execution is essential. One of the approaches to protect data privacy and integrity is to use Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) by enabling execution of programs in secure hardware enclave. Using TEEs can introduce significant performance overhead due to the additional layers of encryption, decryption, security and integrity checks. This can lead to slower inference times compared to running on unprotected hardware. In our work, we enhance the runtime performance of ML models by introducing layer partitioning technique and offloading computations to GPU. The technique comprises two distinct partitions: one executed within the TEE, and the other carried out using a GPU accelerator. Layer partitioning exposes intermediate feature maps in the clear which can lead to reconstruction attacks to recover the input. We conduct experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in protecting against input reconstruction attacks developed using trained conditional Generative Adversarial Network(c-GAN).

Existing methods rely on tedious multiple encoder-decoder streams and stages to gradually complete the global localization and local refinement.

Specifically, DCB treats the terminals that are unable to establish efficient direct connections with the low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites as distributed antennas, forming a virtual antenna array to enhance the terminal-to-satellite uplink achievable rates and durations. However, such systems need multiple trade-off policies that variously balance the terminal-satellite uplink achievable rate, energy consumption of terminals, and satellite switching frequency to satisfy the scenario requirement changes. Thus, we perform a multi-objective optimization analysis and formulate a long-term optimization problem. To address availability in different terminal cluster scales, we reformulate this problem into an action space-reduced and universal multi-objective Markov decision process. Then, we propose an evolutionary multi-objective deep reinforcement learning algorithm to obtain the desirable policies, in which the low-value actions are masked to speed up the training process. As such, the applicability of a one-time trained model can cover more changing terminal-satellite uplink scenarios. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm outmatches various baselines, and draw some useful insights. Specifically, it is found that DCB enables terminals that cannot reach the uplink achievable threshold to achieve efficient direct uplink transmission, which thus reveals that DCB is an effective solution for enabling direct ground-space communications. Moreover, it reveals that the proposed algorithm achieves multiple policies favoring different objectives and achieving near-optimal uplink achievable rates with low switching frequency. ",

However, these two goals are conflicting in nature, and it is challenging to achieve them simultaneously. In this work, we formulate a novel tangled key-value sequence early classification problem, where a tangled key-value sequence is a mixture of several concurrent key-value sequences with different keys. The goal is to classify each individual key-value sequence sharing a same key both accurately and early. To address this problem, we propose a novel method, i.e., Key-Value sequence Early Co-classification (KVEC), which leverages both inner- and inter-correlations of items in a tangled key-value sequence through key correlation and value correlation to learn a better sequence representation. Meanwhile, a time-aware halting policy decides when to stop the ongoing key-value sequence and classify it based on current sequence representation. Experiments on both real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines significantly. KVEC improves the prediction accuracy by up to $4.7 - 17.5\\%$ under the same prediction earliness condition, and improves the harmonic mean of accuracy and earliness by up to $3.7 - 14.0\\%$. ",

    "abstract": "Network intrusion detection systems (NIDS) play a pivotal role in safeguarding critical digital infrastructures against cyber threats. Machine learning-based detection models applied in NIDS are prevalent today. However, the effectiveness of these machine learning-based models is often limited by the evolving and sophisticated nature of intrusion techniques as well as the lack of diverse and updated training samples. In this research, a novel approach for enhancing the performance of an NIDS through the integration of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) is proposed. By harnessing the power of GANs in generating synthetic network traffic data that closely mimics real-world network behavior, we address a key challenge associated with NIDS training datasets, which is the data scarcity. Three distinct GAN models (Vanilla GAN, Wasserstein GAN and Conditional Tabular GAN) are implemented in this work to generate authentic network traffic patterns specifically tailored to represent the anomalous activity. We demonstrate how this synthetic data resampling technique can significantly improve the performance of the NIDS model for detecting such activity. By conducting comprehensive experiments using the CIC-IDS2017 benchmark dataset, augmented with GAN-generated data, we offer empirical evidence that shows the effectiveness of our proposed approach. Our findings show that the integration of GANs into NIDS can lead to enhancements in intrusion detection performance for attacks with limited training data, making it a promising avenue for bolstering the cybersecurity posture of organizations in an increasingly interconnected and vulnerable digital landscape.

We should try to restrict public trash cans as much as possible. This research focuses on automating the penalization of litterbugs, addressing the persistent problem of littering in public places. Traditional approaches relying on manual intervention and witness reporting suffer from delays, inaccuracies, and anonymity issues. To overcome these challenges, this paper proposes a fully automated system that utilizes surveillance cameras and advanced computer vision algorithms for litter detection, object tracking, and face recognition. The system accurately identifies and tracks individuals engaged in littering activities, attaches their identities through face recognition, and enables efficient enforcement of anti-littering policies. By reducing reliance on manual intervention, minimizing human error, and providing prompt identification, the proposed system offers significant advantages in addressing littering incidents. The primary contribution of this research lies in the implementation of the proposed system, leveraging advanced technologies to enhance surveillance operations and automate the penalization of litterbugs.

These models achieved excellent representation capabilities by designing structure-based pre-training tasks for code. However, how to enhance the absorption of structural knowledge when fine-tuning CodePTMs still remains a significant challenge. To fill this gap, in this paper, we present Structure-aware Fine-tuning (SAT), a novel structure-enhanced and plug-and-play fine-tuning method for CodePTMs. We first propose a structure loss to quantify the difference between the information learned by CodePTMs and the knowledge extracted from code structure. Specifically, we use the attention scores extracted from Transformer layer as the learned structural information, and the shortest path length between leaves in abstract syntax trees as the structural knowledge. Subsequently, multi-task learning is introduced to improve the performance of fine-tuning. Experiments conducted on four pre-trained models and two generation tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method as a plug-and-play solution.

The existing works often treat a fairness requirement, represented as a collection of sensitive attributes, as a hyper-parameter, and pursue extreme fairness by completely removing information of sensitive attributes from the learned fair embedding, which suffer from two challenges: huge training cost incurred by the explosion of attribute combinations, and the suboptimal trade-off between fairness and accuracy. In this paper, we propose a novel Adaptive Fair Representation Learning (AFRL) model, which achieves a real personalized fairness due to its advantage of training only one model to adaptively serve different fairness requirements during inference phase. Particularly, AFRL treats fairness requirements as inputs and can learn an attribute-specific embedding for each attribute from the unfair user embedding, which endows AFRL with the adaptability during inference phase to determine the non-sensitive attributes under the guidance of the user's unique fairness requirement. To achieve a better trade-off between fairness and accuracy in recommendations, AFRL conducts a novel Information Alignment to exactly preserve discriminative information of non-sensitive attributes and incorporate a debiased collaborative embedding into the fair embedding to capture attribute-independent collaborative signals, without loss of fairness. Finally, the extensive experiments conducted on real datasets together with the sound theoretical analysis demonstrate the superiority of AFRL. ",

To address these issues, we propose PillarTrack, a pillar-based 3D single object tracking framework. Firstly, we transform sparse point clouds into dense pillars to preserve the local and global geometrics. Secondly, we introduce a Pyramid-type Encoding Pillar Feature Encoder (PE-PFE) design to help the feature representation of each pillar.

High costs associated with the creation of such formal process models motivated many different fields of research aimed at automated generation of process models from readily available data. These include process mining on event logs, and generating business process models from natural language texts. Research in the latter field is regularly faced with the problem of limited data availability, hindering both evaluation and development of new techniques, especially learning-based ones. To overcome this data scarcity issue, in this paper we investigate the application of data augmentation for natural language text data. Data augmentation methods are well established in machine learning for creating new, synthetic data without human assistance. We find that many of these methods are applicable to the task of business process information extraction, improving the accuracy of extraction. Our study shows, that data augmentation is an important component in enabling machine learning methods for the task of business process model generation from natural language text, where currently mostly rule-based systems are still state of the art. Simple data augmentation techniques improved the $F_1$ score of mention extraction by 2.9 percentage points, and the $F_1$ of relation extraction by $4.5$. To better understand how data augmentation alters human annotated texts, we analyze the resulting text, visualizing and discussing the properties of augmented textual data.

To address this challenge, we introduce a novel self-supervised learning (SSL) strategy. Our approach leverages both object patterns and contextual cues to produce robust features. It begins with the formulation of an object-exchanging strategy, where pairs of objects with comparable sizes are exchanged across different scenes, effectively disentangling the strong contextual dependencies. Subsequently, we introduce a context-aware feature learning strategy, which encodes object patterns without relying on their specific context by aggregating object features across various scenes. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method over existing SSL techniques, further showing its better robustness to environmental changes.

This model, partially validated using experimental polarisation curves, provides a comprehensive description of cell internal states while maintaining a low computational burden. Additionally, a new physical quantity, named the limit liquid water saturation coefficient ($s_{lim}$), is introduced in the overvoltage calculation equation. This quantity replaces the limit current density coefficient ($i_{lim}$) and establishes a connection between the voltage drop at high current densities, the amount of liquid water present in the catalyst layers of the cell, and the operating conditions. At high current densities, a significant amount of liquid water is generated, which limits the accessibility of reactants to certain triple point zones within the catalyst layers by covering them. This, in turn, increases overpotential. It has also been observed that $s_{lim}$ is influenced, at minimum, by the gas pressure imposed by the operator. ",

However, as supply chain networks expand in size and complexity, traditional supply chain planning methods (e.g., those found in heuristic rule-based and operations research-based systems) tend to become locally optimal or lack computational scalability, resulting in substantial imbalances between supply and demand across nodes in the network. This paper introduces a novel Generative AI technique, which we call Generative Probabilistic Planning (GPP). GPP generates dynamic supply action plans that are globally optimized across all network nodes over the time horizon for changing objectives like maximizing profits or service levels, factoring in time-varying probabilistic demand, lead time, and production conditions. GPP leverages attention-based graph neural networks (GNN), offline deep reinforcement learning (Offline RL), and policy simulations to train generative policy models and create optimal plans through probabilistic simulations, effectively accounting for various uncertainties. Our experiments using historical data from a global consumer goods company with complex supply chain networks demonstrate that GPP accomplishes objective-adaptable, probabilistically resilient, and dynamic planning for supply chain networks, leading to significant improvements in performance and profitability for enterprises.

Our validation on two datasets (SIAT-DB1 and SIAT-DB2) and comparison with two existing methods, Informer and Spikformer, demonstrate that SSAE achieves significant power consumption savings of 39.1% and 37.5% respectively over them in terms of inference costs. Furthermore, SAFE-Net surpasses Informer and Spikformer in recognition accuracy on both datasets.

Consequently, how to enhance the code generation capabilities of small and medium-scale code LLMs without significantly increasing training costs is an appealing challenge.

Current mainstream efforts mainly center around innovative model network architectures, with the aim of enabling the network to implicitly acquire knowledge from diverse scenarios. However, the uncertainty of implicit learning in networks arises from the absence of explicit modeling, leading to not only difficulty in training but also incomplete user representation and suboptimal performance. Furthermore, through causal graph analysis, we have discovered that the scenario itself directly influences click behavior, yet existing approaches directly incorporate data from other scenarios during the training of the current scenario, leading to prediction biases when they directly utilize click behaviors from other scenarios to train models. To address these problems, we propose the Multi-Scenario Causal-driven Adaptive Network M-scan).

However, in scenarios where only a limited number of handwritten samples are available, particularly in the form of word images, there is a significant scope for improvement. In this paper, we propose a writer identification system based on an attention-driven Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The system is trained utilizing image segments, known as fragments, extracted from word images, employing a pyramid-based strategy. This methodology enables the system to capture a comprehensive representation of the data, encompassing both fine-grained details and coarse features across various levels of abstraction. These extracted fragments serve as the training data for the convolutional network, enabling it to learn a more robust representation compared to traditional convolution-based networks trained on word images. Additionally, the paper explores the integration of an attention mechanism to enhance the representational power of the learned features. The efficacy of the proposed algorithm is evaluated on three benchmark databases, demonstrating its proficiency in writer identification tasks, particularly in scenarios with limited access to handwriting data.

This raises an interesting question: \\textit{How can language models be employed to make the anomaly maps more explainable?} To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to leverage a language model for unsupervised anomaly detection, for which we construct a dataset with different questions and answers. Additionally, we present a novel multi-image visual question answering framework tailored for anomaly detection, incorporating diverse feature fusion strategies to enhance visual knowledge extraction. Our experiments reveal that the framework, augmented by our new Knowledge Q-Former module, adeptly answers questions on the anomaly detection dataset.

PROWL can be easily adapted to detect OOD objects in any operational design domain by specifying a list of known classes from this domain.

    "abstract": "The advent of morphing attacks has posed significant security concerns for automated Face Recognition systems, raising the pressing need for robust and effective Morphing Attack Detection (MAD) methods able to effectively address this issue. In this paper, we focus on Differential MAD (D-MAD), where a trusted live capture, usually representing the criminal, is compared with the document image to classify it as morphed or bona fide. We show these approaches based on identity features are effective when the morphed image and the live one are sufficiently diverse; unfortunately, the effectiveness is significantly reduced when the same approaches are applied to look-alike subjects or in all those cases when the similarity between the two compared images is high (e.g. comparison between the morphed image and the accomplice). Therefore, in this paper, we propose ACIdA, a modular D-MAD system, consisting of a module for the attempt type classification, and two modules for the identity and artifacts analysis on input images. Successfully addressing this task would allow broadening the D-MAD applications including, for instance, the document enrollment stage, which currently relies entirely on human evaluation, thus limiting the possibility of releasing ID documents with manipulated images, as well as the automated gates to detect both accomplices and criminals. An extensive cross-dataset experimental evaluation conducted on the introduced scenario shows that ACIdA achieves state-of-the-art results, outperforming literature competitors, while maintaining good performance in traditional D-MAD benchmarks.

ODA incorporates KG reasoning abilities via global observation that enhances reasoning capabilities through a cyclical paradigm of observation, action, and reflection. Confronting the exponential explosion of knowledge during observation, we innovatively design a recursive observation mechanism. Subsequently, we integrate the observed knowledge into the action and reflection modules.

Despite recent advancements in deep neural network (DNN)-based object detectors, their susceptibility to detection errors, particularly in the less-explored realm of 3D object detection, remains a significant concern. State-of-the-art integrity monitoring (also known as introspection) mechanisms in 2D object detection mainly utilise the activation patterns in the final layer of the DNN-based detector's backbone. However, that may not sufficiently address the complexities and sparsity of data in 3D object detection. To this end, we conduct, in this article, an extensive investigation into the effects of activation patterns extracted from various layers of the backbone network for introspecting the operation of 3D object detectors. Through a comparative analysis using Kitti and NuScenes datasets with PointPillars and CenterPoint detectors, we demonstrate that using earlier layers' activation patterns enhances the error detection performance of the integrity monitoring system, yet increases computational complexity. To address the real-time operation requirements in ADS, we also introduce a novel introspection method that combines activation patterns from multiple layers of the detector's backbone and report its performance.

To address these issues, we regard the remote heart rate measurement as the process of analyzing the spatiotemporal characteristics of the optical flow signal in the video. We apply chaos theory to computer vision tasks for the first time, thus designing a brain-inspired framework. Firstly, using an artificial primary visual cortex model to extract the skin in the videos, and then calculate heart rate by time-frequency analysis on all pixels. Our method achieves Robust Skin Tracking for Heart Rate measurement, called HR-RST. The experimental results show that HR-RST overcomes the difficulty of environmental influences and effectively tracks the subject movement. Moreover, the method could extend to other body parts. Consequently, the method can be applied to special patients and effectively protect individual privacy, offering an innovative solution. ",

Flows traversing NFs may need to be migrated to balance load, conserve energy, etc. When NFs are stateful, the information stored on the NF per flow must be migrated before the flows are migrated, to avoid problems of consistency. We examine what it means to correctly migrate flows from a stateful NF instance. We define the property of Weak-O, where only the state information required for packets to be correctly forwarded is migrated first, while the remaining states are eventually migrated. Weak-O can be preserved without buffering or dropping packets, unlike existing algorithms. We propose an algorithm that preserves Weak-O and prove its correctness. Even though this may cause packet re-ordering, we experimentally demonstrate that the goodputs with and without migration are comparable when the old and new paths have the same delays and bandwidths, or when the new path has larger bandwidth or at most 5 times longer delays, thus making this practical, contrary to what was thought before. We also prove that no criterion stronger than Weak-O can be preserved in a flow migration system that requires no buffering or dropping of packets and eventually synchronizes its states. ",

The reason is that the 3D point cloud can capture the entire surface of manufacturing parts, unlike the previous practices that focus on some key product characteristics. However, achieving accurate 3D anomaly detection is challenging, due to the complex surfaces of manufacturing parts and the difficulty of collecting sufficient anomaly samples. To address these challenges, we propose a novel untrained anomaly detection method based on 3D point cloud data for complex manufacturing parts, which can achieve accurate anomaly detection in a single sample without training data. In the proposed framework, we transform an input sample into two sets of profiles along different directions. Based on one set of the profiles, a novel segmentation module is devised to segment the complex surface into multiple basic and simple components. In each component, another set of profiles, which have the nature of similar shapes, can be modeled as a low-rank matrix. Thus, accurate 3D anomaly detection can be achieved by using Robust Principal Component Analysis (RPCA) on these low-rank matrices. Extensive numerical experiments on different types of parts show that our method achieves promising results compared with the benchmark methods. ",

However, at the beginning of the roll-out, low market penetration rates are expected. This paper proposes and evaluates an application layer multi-hop Collective Perception Service (CPS) for vehicular ad-hoc networks. The goal is to improve the environmental awareness ratio in scenarios with low CPS market penetration. In such scenarios, the CPS service without forwarding enabled struggles to achieve complete awareness. A decentralized application layer forwarding algorithm is presented that shares perceived object information across multiple hops while maintaining a low age of information. The proposed approach is compared against standard CPS with no forwarding and CPS with geographically-scoped (GBC) multi-hop forwarding. Simulations according to standards of the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) demonstrate that the application layer forwarding achieves near 100% awareness at 10% penetration rate versus 92% for standard CPS. The awareness improvement comes with moderate channel load, unlike GBC forwarding which quickly saturates the channel. The median age of information remains below 80 ms for the proposed scheme, enabling real-time CPS operation. Our application layer multi-hop approach effectively improves environmental awareness during initial CPS deployment while aligning with latency and channel load requirements. ",

To address this issue, we propose a photometric stereo network called a RMAFF-PSN that uses residual multiscale attentional feature fusion to handle the ``difficult'' regions of the object. Unlike previous approaches that only use stacked convolutional layers to extract deep features from the input image, our method integrates feature information from different resolution stages and scales of the image. This approach preserves more physical information, such as texture and geometry of the object in complex regions, through shallow-deep stage feature extraction, double branching enhancement, and attention optimization. To test the network structure under real-world conditions, we propose a new real dataset called Simple PS data, which contains multiple objects with varying structures and materials. Experimental results on a publicly available benchmark dataset demonstrate that our method outperforms most existing calibrated photometric stereo methods for the same number of input images, especially in the case of highly non-convex object structures. Our method also obtains good results under sparse lighting conditions. ",

In the present study, we introduce a novel framework designed to articulate object detection as a denoising diffusion process, which operates on perturbed bounding boxes of annotated entities. This framework, termed ConsistencyDet, leverages an innovative denoising concept known as the Consistency Model. The hallmark of this model is its self-consistency feature, which empowers the model to map distorted information from any temporal stage back to its pristine state, thereby realizing a ``one-step denoising'' mechanism. Such an attribute markedly elevates the operational efficiency of the model, setting it apart from the conventional Diffusion Model. Throughout the training phase, ConsistencyDet initiates the diffusion sequence with noise-infused boxes derived from the ground-truth annotations and conditions the model to perform the denoising task. Subsequently, in the inference stage, the model employs a denoising sampling strategy that commences with bounding boxes randomly sampled from a normal distribution. Through iterative refinement, the model transforms an assortment of arbitrarily generated boxes into the definitive detections. Comprehensive evaluations employing standard benchmarks, such as MS-COCO and LVIS, corroborate that ConsistencyDet surpasses other leading-edge detectors in performance metrics. ",

The degree sequence of a network is a significant characteristic, and altering network degree correlation through degree-preserving rewiring poses an interesting problem. In this paper, we define the problem of maximizing network degree correlation through a finite number of rewirings and use the assortativity coefficient to measure it. We analyze the changes in assortativity coefficient under degree-preserving rewiring and establish its relationship with the s-metric. Under our assumptions, we prove the problem to be monotonic and submodular, leading to the proposal of the GA method to enhance network degree correlation. By formulating an integer programming model, we demonstrate that the GA method can effectively approximate the optimal solution and validate its superiority over other baseline methods through experiments on three types of real-world networks. Additionally, we introduce three heuristic rewiring strategies, EDA, TA and PEA, and demonstrate their applicability to different types of networks. Furthermore, we extend our investigation to explore the impact of these rewiring strategies on several spectral robustness metrics based on the adjacency matrix. Finally, we examine the robustness of various centrality metrics in the network while enhancing network degree correlation using the GA method. ",

    "abstract": "Scene graph generation (SGG) aims to understand the visual objects and their semantic relationships from one given image. Until now, lots of SGG datasets with the eyelevel view are released but the SGG dataset with the overhead view is scarcely studied. By contrast to the object occlusion problem in the eyelevel view, which impedes the SGG, the overhead view provides a new perspective that helps to promote the SGG by providing a clear perception of the spatial relationships of objects in the ground scene. To fill in the gap of the overhead view dataset, this paper constructs and releases an aerial image urban scene graph generation (AUG) dataset. Images from the AUG dataset are captured with the low-attitude overhead view. In the AUG dataset, 25,594 objects, 16,970 relationships, and 27,175 attributes are manually annotated. To avoid the local context being overwhelmed in the complex aerial urban scene, this paper proposes one new locality-preserving graph convolutional network (LPG). Different from the traditional graph convolutional network, which has the natural advantage of capturing the global context for SGG, the convolutional layer in the LPG integrates the non-destructive initial features of the objects with dynamically updated neighborhood information to preserve the local context under the premise of mining the global context. To address the problem that there exists an extra-large number of potential object relationship pairs but only a small part of them is meaningful in AUG, we propose the adaptive bounding box scaling factor for potential relationship detection (ABS-PRD) to intelligently prune the meaningless relationship pairs. Extensive experiments on the AUG dataset show that our LPG can significantly outperform the state-of-the-art methods and the effectiveness of the proposed locality-preserving strategy. ",

    "title": "VIFNet: An End-to-end Visible-Infrared Fusion Network for Image Dehazing",
    "abstract": "Image dehazing poses significant challenges in environmental perception. Recent research mainly focus on deep learning-based methods with single modality, while they may result in severe information loss especially in dense-haze scenarios. The infrared image exhibits robustness to the haze, however, existing methods have primarily treated the infrared modality as auxiliary information, failing to fully explore its rich information in dehazing. To address this challenge, the key insight of this study is to design a visible-infrared fusion network for image dehazing. In particular, we propose a multi-scale Deep Structure Feature Extraction (DSFE) module, which incorporates the Channel-Pixel Attention Block (CPAB) to restore more spatial and marginal information within the deep structural features. Additionally, we introduce an inconsistency weighted fusion strategy to merge the two modalities by leveraging the more reliable information. To validate this, we construct a visible-infrared multimodal dataset called AirSim-VID based on the AirSim simulation platform. Extensive experiments performed on challenging real and simulated image datasets demonstrate that VIFNet can outperform many state-of-the-art competing methods.

This study presents a voice-assisted real-time traffic sign recognition system which is capable of assisting drivers. This system functions under two subsystems. Initially, the detection and recognition of the traffic signs are carried out using a trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). After recognizing the specific traffic sign, it is narrated to the driver as a voice message using a text-to-speech engine. An efficient CNN model for a benchmark dataset is developed for real-time detection and recognition using Deep Learning techniques. The advantage of this system is that even if the driver misses a traffic sign, or does not look at the traffic sign, or is unable to comprehend the sign, the system detects it and narrates it to the driver. A system of this type is also important in the development of autonomous vehicles. ",

For example, pre-polling information often skews voters towards candidates who may not be their top choice, but who they believe would be a worthwhile recipient of their vote. In this work, we aim to understand the role of external information in voting outcomes. We study this by analyzing (1) the probability that voting outcomes align with external information, and (2) the effect of external information on the total utility across voters, or social welfare. In practice, voting mechanisms elicit coarse information about voter utilities, such as ordinal preferences, which initially prevents us from directly analyzing the effect of informational externalities with standard voting mechanisms. To overcome this, we present an intermediary mechanism for learning how preferences change with external information which does not require eliciting full cardinal preferences. With this tool in hand, we find that voting mechanisms are generally more likely to select the alternative most favored by the external information, and when external information reflects the population's true preferences, social welfare increases in expectation.

    "abstract": "Blind-spot networks (BSN) have been prevalent network architectures in self-supervised image denoising (SSID). Existing BSNs are mostly conducted with convolution layers. Although transformers offer potential solutions to the limitations of convolutions and have demonstrated success in various image restoration tasks, their attention mechanisms may violate the blind-spot requirement, thus restricting their applicability in SSID. In this paper, we present a transformer-based blind-spot network (TBSN) by analyzing and redesigning the transformer operators that meet the blind-spot requirement. Specifically, TBSN follows the architectural principles of dilated BSNs, and incorporates spatial as well as channel self-attention layers to enhance the network capability. For spatial self-attention, an elaborate mask is applied to the attention matrix to restrict its receptive field, thus mimicking the dilated convolution. For channel self-attention, we observe that it may leak the blind-spot information when the channel number is greater than spatial size in the deep layers of multi-scale architectures. To eliminate this effect, we divide the channel into several groups and perform channel attention separately. Furthermore, we introduce a knowledge distillation strategy that distills TBSN into smaller denoisers to improve computational efficiency while maintaining performance. Extensive experiments on real-world image denoising datasets show that TBSN largely extends the receptive field and exhibits favorable performance against state-of-the-art SSID methods.

The miracle of Voevodsky's univalence principle is that it ensures, for essentially any naturally occurring structure in mathematics, that this the resultant notion of identification is equivalent to the type of isomorphisms in the category of such structures. Characterisations of this kind are not automatic and must be established one-by-one; to this end, several authors have employed reflexive graphs and displayed reflexive graphs to organise the characterisation of identity types. We contribute reflexive graph lenses, a new family of intermediate abstractions lying between families of reflexive graphs and displayed reflexive graphs that simplifies the characterisation of identity types for complex structures. Every reflexive graph lens gives rise to a (more complicated) displayed reflexive graph, and our experience suggests that many naturally occurring displayed reflexive graphs arise in this way. Evidence for the utility of reflexive graph lenses is given by means of several case studies, including the theory of reflexive graphs itself as well as that of polynomial type operators. Finally, we exhibit an equivalence between the type of reflexive graph fibrations and the type of univalent reflexive graph lenses. ",

    "abstract": "Public transport systems are expected to reduce pollution and contribute to sustainable development. However, disruptions in public transport such as delays may negatively affect mobility choices. To quantify delays, aggregated data from vehicle locations systems are frequently used. However, delays observed at individual stops are caused inter alia by fluctuations in running times and propagation of delays occurring in other locations. Hence, in this work, we propose both the method detecting significant delays and reference architecture, relying on stream processing engines, in which the method is implemented. The method can complement the calculation of delays defined as deviation from schedules. This provides both online rather than batch identification of significant and repetitive delays, and resilience to the limited quality of location data. The method we propose can be used with different change detectors, such as ADWIN, applied to location data stream shuffled to individual edges of a transport graph. It can detect in an online manner at which edges statistically significant delays are observed and at which edges delays arise and are reduced. Detections can be used to model mobility choices and quantify the impact of repetitive rather than random disruptions on feasible trips with multimodal trip modelling engines. The evaluation performed with the public transport data of over 2000 vehicles confirms the merits of the method and reveals that a limited-size subgraph of a transport system graph causes statistically significant delays ",

    "abstract": "Contrastive Learning (CL) has attracted enormous attention due to its remarkable capability in unsupervised representation learning. However, recent works have revealed the vulnerability of CL to backdoor attacks: the feature extractor could be misled to embed backdoored data close to an attack target class, thus fooling the downstream predictor to misclassify it as the target. Existing attacks usually adopt a fixed trigger pattern and poison the training set with trigger-injected data, hoping for the feature extractor to learn the association between trigger and target class. However, we find that such fixed trigger design fails to effectively associate trigger-injected data with target class in the embedding space due to special CL mechanisms, leading to a limited attack success rate (ASR). This phenomenon motivates us to find a better backdoor trigger design tailored for CL framework. In this paper, we propose a bi-level optimization approach to achieve this goal, where the inner optimization simulates the CL dynamics of a surrogate victim, and the outer optimization enforces the backdoor trigger to stay close to the target throughout the surrogate CL procedure. Extensive experiments show that our attack can achieve a higher attack success rate (e.g., $99\\%$ ASR on ImageNet-100) with a very low poisoning rate ($1\\%$). Besides, our attack can effectively evade existing state-of-the-art defenses. Code is available at: https://github.com/SWY666/SSL-backdoor-BLTO. ",

    "abstract": "Since its inception, Rowhammer exploits have rapidly evolved into increasingly sophisticated threats not only compromising data integrity but also the control flow integrity of victim processes. Nevertheless, it remains a challenge for an attacker to identify vulnerable targets (i.e., Rowhammer gadgets), understand the outcome of the attempted fault, and formulate an attack that yields useful results. In this paper, we present a new type of Rowhammer gadget, called a LeapFrog gadget, which, when present in the victim code, allows an adversary to subvert code execution to bypass a critical piece of code (e.g., authentication check logic, encryption rounds, padding in security protocols). The Leapfrog gadget manifests when the victim code stores the Program Counter (PC) value in the user or kernel stack (e.g., a return address during a function call) which, when tampered with, re-positions the return address to a location that bypasses a security-critical code pattern. This research also presents a systematic process to identify Leapfrog gadgets. This methodology enables the automated detection of susceptible targets and the determination of optimal attack parameters. We first showcase this new attack vector through a practical demonstration on a TLS handshake client/server scenario, successfully inducing an instruction skip in a client application. We then demonstrate the attack on real-world code found in the wild, implementing an attack on OpenSSL. Our findings extend the impact of Rowhammer attacks on control flow and contribute to the development of more robust defenses against these increasingly sophisticated threats. ",

Here, we propose a context-aware video anomaly detection algorithm, Trinity, specifically targeted to these scenarios. Trinity is especially well-suited to crowded scenes in which individuals cannot be easily tracked, and anomalies are due to speed, direction, or absence of group motion. Trinity is a contrastive learning framework that aims to learn alignments between context, appearance, and motion, and uses alignment quality to classify videos as normal or anomalous.

In this paper, we aim to solve a real-time anomaly detection problem. Given time-series measurement values coming from a fixed set of sensors on the grid, can we identify anomalies in the network topology or measurement data? Existing methods, primarily optimization-based, mostly use only a single snapshot of the measurement values and do not scale well with the network size. Recent data-driven ML techniques have shown promise by using a combination of current and historical data for anomaly detection but generally do not consider physical attributes like the impact of topology or load/generation changes on sensor measurements and thus cannot accommodate regular context-variability in the historical data. To address this gap, we propose a novel context-aware anomaly detection algorithm, GridCAL, that considers the effect of regular topology and load/generation changes. This algorithm converts the real-time power flow measurements to context-agnostic values, which allows us to analyze measurement coming from different grid contexts in an aggregate fashion, enabling us to derive a unified statistical model that becomes the basis of anomaly detection. Through numerical simulations on networks up to 2383 nodes, we show that our approach is accurate, outperforming state-of-the-art approaches, and is computationally efficient. ",

We contribute a novel framework, named Quality-Optimized Incremental Task Allocation Graph Search (Q-ITAGS), to solve such problems. Q-ITAGS builds upon our prior work in trait-based coordination and offers a flexible interleaved framework that i) explicitly models and optimizes the effect of collective capabilities on task performance via learnable trait-quality maps, and ii) respects both resource constraints and spatio-temporal constraints, including a user-specified time budget (i.e., maximum makespan). In addition to algorithmic contributions, we derive theoretical suboptimality bounds in terms of task performance that varies as a function of a single hyperparameter. Our detailed experiments involving a simulated emergency response task and a real-world video game dataset reveal that i) Q-ITAGS results in superior team performance compared to a state-of-the-art method, while also respecting complex spatio-temporal and resource constraints, ii) Q-ITAGS efficiently learns trait-quality maps to enable effective trade-off between task performance and resource constraints, and iii) Q-ITAGS' suboptimality bounds consistently hold in practice.

AmpleGCG achieves near 100\\% attack success rate (ASR) on two aligned LLMs (Llama-2-7B-chat and Vicuna-7B), surpassing two strongest attack baselines.

    "abstract": "Elastic full-waveform inversion (EFWI) is a process used to estimate subsurface properties by fitting seismic data while satisfying wave propagation physics. The problem is formulated as a least-squares data fitting minimization problem with two sets of constraints: Partial-differential equation (PDE) constraints governing elastic wave propagation and physical model constraints implementing prior information. The alternating direction method of multipliers is used to solve the problem, resulting in an iterative algorithm with well-conditioned subproblems. Although wavefield reconstruction is the most challenging part of the iteration, sparse linear algebra techniques can be used for moderate-sized problems and frequency domain formulations. The Hessian matrix is blocky with diagonal blocks, making model updates fast. Gradient ascent is used to update Lagrange multipliers by summing PDE violations. Various numerical examples are used to investigate algorithmic components, including model parameterizations, physical model constraints, the role of the Hessian matrix in suppressing interparameter cross-talk, computational efficiency with the source sketching method, and the effect of noise and near-surface effects.

    "abstract": "Large Language Models for understanding and generating code (code LLMs) have witnessed tremendous progress in recent years. With the rapid development of code LLMs, many popular evaluation benchmarks, such as HumanEval, DS-1000, and MBPP, have emerged to measure the performance of code LLMs with a particular focus on code generation tasks. However, they are insufficient to cover the full range of expected capabilities of code LLMs, which span beyond code generation to answering diverse coding-related questions. To fill this gap, we propose InfiCoder-Eval, a large-scale freeform question-answering (QA) benchmark for code, comprising 234 carefully selected high-quality Stack Overflow questions that span across 15 programming languages. To evaluate the response correctness, InfiCoder-Eval supports four types of model-free metrics and domain experts carefully choose and concretize the criterion for each question. We conduct a systematic evaluation for more than 80 code LLMs on InfiCoder-Eval, leading to a series of insightful findings. Furthermore, our detailed analyses showcase possible directions for further improvement of code LLMs. InfiCoder-Eval is fully open source at https://infi-coder.github.io/inficoder-eval/ and continuously maintaining and expanding to foster more scientific and systematic practices for evaluating code LLMs. ",

Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), known as their temporal dynamics and low-power characteristic, offer an efficient solution for temporal processing in DGRL task. However, owing to the spike-based information encoding mechanism of SNNs, existing DGRL methods employed SNNs face limitations in their representational capacity. Given this issue, we propose a novel framework named Spike-induced Graph Neural Network (SiGNN) for learning enhanced spatialtemporal representations on dynamic graphs. In detail, a harmonious integration of SNNs and GNNs is achieved through an innovative Temporal Activation (TA) mechanism. Benefiting from the TA mechanism, SiGNN not only effectively exploits the temporal dynamics of SNNs but also adeptly circumvents the representational constraints imposed by the binary nature of spikes. Furthermore, leveraging the inherent adaptability of SNNs, we explore an in-depth analysis of the evolutionary patterns within dynamic graphs across multiple time granularities. This approach facilitates the acquisition of a multiscale temporal node representation.Extensive experiments on various real-world dynamic graph datasets demonstrate the superior performance of SiGNN in the node classification task.

Current methods mainly focus on the reviewer's perspective, including finding a capable reviewer, predicting comment quality, and recommending/generating review comments. Our intuition is that satisfying review necessity requests can increase their visibility, which in turn is a prerequisite for better review responses. To this end, we propose a unified framework called UniPCR to complete developer-based request quality assurance (i.e., predicting request necessity and recommending tags subtask) under a Masked Language Model (MLM). Specifically, we reformulate both subtasks via 1) text prompt tuning, which converts two subtasks into MLM by constructing prompt templates using hard prompt; 2) code prefix tuning, which optimizes a small segment of generated continuous vectors as the prefix of the code representation using soft prompt. Experimental results on the Public Code Review dataset for the time span 2011-2022 demonstrate that our UniPCR framework adapts to the two subtasks and outperforms comparable accuracy-based results with state-of-the-art methods for request quality assurance. These conclusions highlight the effectiveness of our unified framework from the developer's perspective in public code review. ",

    "abstract": "Learning-based neural network (NN) control policies have shown impressive empirical performance in a wide range of tasks in robotics and control. However, formal (Lyapunov) stability guarantees over the region-of-attraction (ROA) for NN controllers with nonlinear dynamical systems are challenging to obtain, and most existing approaches rely on expensive solvers such as sums-of-squares (SOS), mixed-integer programming (MIP), or satisfiability modulo theories (SMT). In this paper, we demonstrate a new framework for learning NN controllers together with Lyapunov certificates using fast empirical falsification and strategic regularizations. We propose a novel formulation that defines a larger verifiable region-of-attraction (ROA) than shown in the literature, and refines the conventional restrictive constraints on Lyapunov derivatives to focus only on certifiable ROAs. The Lyapunov condition is rigorously verified post-hoc using branch-and-bound with scalable linear bound propagation-based NN verification techniques. The approach is efficient and flexible, and the full training and verification procedure is accelerated on GPUs without relying on expensive solvers for SOS, MIP, nor SMT. The flexibility and efficiency of our framework allow us to demonstrate Lyapunov-stable output feedback control with synthesized NN-based controllers and NN-based observers with formal stability guarantees, for the first time in literature.

To address this gap, in this study we created a machine learning-based method for the ex-post assessment of community risk and resilience and their interplay based on features related to the coupled human-infrastructure systems performance. Utilizing feature groups related to population protective actions, infrastructure/building performance features, and recovery features, we examined the risk and resilience performance of communities in the context of the 2017 Hurricane Harvey in Harris County, Texas. These features related to the coupled human-infrastructure systems performance were processed using the K-means clustering method to classify census block groups into four distinct clusters then, based on feature analysis, these clusters were labeled and designated into four quadrants of risk-resilience archetypes. Finally, we analyzed the disparities in risk-resilience status of spatial areas across different clusters as well as different income groups. The findings unveil the risk-resilience status of spatial areas shaped by their coupled human-infrastructure systems performance and their interactions. The results also inform about features that contribute to high resilience in high-risk areas. For example, the results indicate that in high-risk areas, evacuation rates contributed to a greater resilience, while in low-risk areas, preparedness contributed to greater resilience. ",

    "abstract": "Anomaly detection tools and methods enable key analytical capabilities in modern cyberphysical and sensor-based systems. Despite the fast-paced development in deep learning architectures for anomaly detection, model optimization for a given dataset is a cumbersome and time-consuming process. Neuroevolution could be an effective and efficient solution to this problem, as a fully automated search method for learning optimal neural networks, supporting both gradient and non-gradient fine tuning. However, existing frameworks incorporating neuroevolution lack of support for new layers and architectures and are typically limited to convolutional and LSTM layers. In this paper we propose AD-NEv++, a three-stage neuroevolution-based method that synergically combines subspace evolution, model evolution, and fine-tuning. Our method overcomes the limitations of existing approaches by optimizing the mutation operator in the neuroevolution process, while supporting a wide spectrum of neural layers, including attention, dense, and graph convolutional layers. Our extensive experimental evaluation was conducted with widely adopted multivariate anomaly detection benchmark datasets, and showed that the models generated by AD-NEv++ outperform well-known deep learning architectures and neuroevolution-based approaches for anomaly detection. Moreover, results show that AD-NEv++ can improve and outperform the state-of-the-art GNN (Graph Neural Networks) model architecture in all anomaly detection benchmarks. ",

    "abstract": "Dataset distillation aims to compress information from a large-scale original dataset to a new compact dataset while striving to preserve the utmost degree of the original data informational essence. Previous studies have predominantly concentrated on aligning the intermediate statistics between the original and distilled data, such as weight trajectory, features, gradient, BatchNorm, etc. In this work, we consider addressing this task through the new lens of model informativeness in the compression stage on the original dataset pretraining. We observe that with the prior state-of-the-art SRe$^2$L, as model sizes increase, it becomes increasingly challenging for supervised pretrained models to recover learned information during data synthesis, as the channel-wise mean and variance inside the model are flatting and less informative. We further notice that larger variances in BN statistics from self-supervised models enable larger loss signals to update the recovered data by gradients, enjoying more informativeness during synthesis. Building on this observation, we introduce SC-DD, a simple yet effective Self-supervised Compression framework for Dataset Distillation that facilitates diverse information compression and recovery compared to traditional supervised learning schemes, further reaps the potential of large pretrained models with enhanced capabilities. Extensive experiments are conducted on CIFAR-100, Tiny-ImageNet and ImageNet-1K datasets to demonstrate the superiority of our proposed approach. The proposed SC-DD outperforms all previous state-of-the-art supervised dataset distillation methods when employing larger models, such as SRe$^2$L, MTT, TESLA, DC, CAFE, etc., by large margins under the same recovery and post-training budgets.

Despite their successes in some tasks, like zero-shot image recognition, they also perform surprisingly poor on other tasks, like attribute detection. Previous work has attributed these challenges to the modality gap, a separation of image and text in the shared representation space, and a bias towards objects over other factors, such as attributes. In this work we investigate both phenomena. We find that only a few embedding dimensions drive the modality gap. Further, we propose a measure for object bias and find that object bias does not lead to worse performance on other concepts, such as attributes. But what leads to the emergence of the modality gap and object bias? To answer this question we carefully designed an experimental setting which allows us to control the amount of shared information between the modalities. This revealed that the driving factor behind both, the modality gap and the object bias, is the information imbalance between images and captions. ",

In this paper, we tackle the challenge of open-set bias detection in text-to-image generative models presenting OpenBias, a new pipeline that identifies and quantifies the severity of biases agnostically, without access to any precompiled set. OpenBias has three stages. In the first phase, we leverage a Large Language Model (LLM) to propose biases given a set of captions. Secondly, the target generative model produces images using the same set of captions. Lastly, a Vision Question Answering model recognizes the presence and extent of the previously proposed biases. We study the behavior of Stable Diffusion 1.5, 2, and XL emphasizing new biases, never investigated before. Via quantitative experiments, we demonstrate that OpenBias agrees with current closed-set bias detection methods and human judgement. ",

In response, we develop the portfolio temporal graph network recommender PfoTGNRec, which can handle time-varying collaborative signals and incorporates diversification-enhancing contrastive learning.

By proving that the precoder set satisfying the per-BS power constraints forms a Riemannian submanifold of a linear product manifold, we transform the constrained precoder design problem in Euclidean space to an unconstrained one on the Riemannian submanifold. Riemannian ingredients, including orthogonal projection, Riemannian gradient, retraction and vector transport, of the problem on the Riemannian submanifold are further derived, with which the Riemannian conjugate gradient (RCG) design method is proposed for solving the unconstrained problem. The proposed method avoids the inverses of large dimensional matrices, which is beneficial in practice. The complexity analyses show the high computational efficiency of RCG precoder design. Simulation results demonstrate the numerical superiority of the proposed precoder design and the high efficiency of the UCN mMIMO system. ",

    "abstract": "Optical Diffraction Neural Networks (DNNs), a subset of Optical Neural Networks (ONNs), show promise in mirroring the prowess of electronic networks. This study introduces the Hybrid Diffraction Neural Network (HDNN), a novel architecture that incorporates matrix multiplication into DNNs, synergizing the benefits of conventional ONNs with those of DNNs to surmount the modulation limitations inherent in optical diffraction neural networks. Utilizing a singular phase modulation layer and an amplitude modulation layer, the trained neural network demonstrated remarkable accuracies of 96.39% and 89% in digit recognition tasks in simulation and experiment, respectively. Additionally, we develop the Binning Design (BD) method, which effectively mitigates the constraints imposed by sampling intervals on diffraction units, substantially streamlining experimental procedures. Furthermore, we propose an on-chip HDNN that not only employs a beam-splitting phase modulation layer for enhanced integration level but also significantly relaxes device fabrication requirements, replacing metasurfaces with relief surfaces designed by 1-bit quantization. Besides, we conceptualized an all-optical HDNN-assisted lesion detection network, achieving detection outcomes that were 100% aligned with simulation predictions. This work not only advances the performance of DNNs but also streamlines the path towards industrial optical neural network production. ",

    "abstract": "In this study, the performance of existing U-shaped neural network architectures was enhanced for medical image segmentation by adding Transformer. Although Transformer architectures are powerful at extracting global information, its ability to capture local information is limited due to its high complexity. To address this challenge, we proposed a new lightweight U-shaped cascade fusion network (LUCF-Net) for medical image segmentation. It utilized an asymmetrical structural design and incorporated both local and global modules to enhance its capacity for local and global modeling. Additionally, a multi-layer cascade fusion decoding network was designed to further bolster the network's information fusion capabilities. Validation results achieved on multi-organ datasets in CT format, cardiac segmentation datasets in MRI format, and dermatology datasets in image format demonstrated that the proposed model outperformed other state-of-the-art methods in handling local-global information, achieving an improvement of 1.54% in Dice coefficient and 2.6 mm in Hausdorff distance on multi-organ segmentation. Furthermore, as a network that combines Convolutional Neural Network and Transformer architectures, it achieves competitive segmentation performance with only 6.93 million parameters and 6.6 gigabytes of floating point operations, without the need of pre-training. In summary, the proposed method demonstrated enhanced performance while retaining a simpler model design compared to other Transformer-based segmentation networks. ",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a novel method of smoke removal from the laparoscopic images. Due to the heterogeneous nature of surgical smoke, a two-stage network is proposed to estimate the smoke distribution and reconstruct a clear, smoke-free surgical scene. The utilization of the lightness channel plays a pivotal role in providing vital information pertaining to smoke density. The reconstruction of smoke-free image is guided by a hybrid embedding, which combines the estimated smoke mask with the initial image. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method boasts a Peak Signal to Noise Ratio that is $2.79\\%$ higher than the state-of-the-art methods, while also exhibits a remarkable $38.2\\%$ reduction in run-time. Overall, the proposed method offers comparable or even superior performance in terms of both smoke removal quality and computational efficiency when compared to existing state-of-the-art methods.

Thus, in imbalanced classification problems, these metrics favour classifiers which ignore the minority class. To alleviate this issue we introduce robust modifications of the F-score and the MCC for which, even in strongly imbalanced settings, the TPR is bounded away from $0$. We numerically illustrate the behaviour of the various performance metrics in simulations as well as on a credit default data set. We also discuss connections to the ROC and precision-recall curves and give recommendations on how to combine their usage with performance metrics. ",

    "abstract": "The receiver design for multi-input multi-output (MIMO) ultra-reliable and low-latency communication (URLLC) systems can be a tough task due to the use of short channel codes and few pilot symbols. Consequently, error propagation can occur in traditional turbo receivers, leading to performance degradation. Moreover, the processing delay induced by information exchange between different modules may also be undesirable for URLLC. To address the issues, we advocate to perform joint channel estimation, detection, and decoding (JCDD) for MIMO URLLC systems encoded by short low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes. Specifically, we develop two novel JCDD problem formulations based on the maximum a posteriori (MAP) criterion for Gaussian MIMO channels and sparse mmWave MIMO channels, respectively, which integrate the pilots, the bit-to-symbol mapping, the LDPC code constraints, as well as the channel statistical information. Both the challenging large-scale non-convex problems are then solved based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithms, where closed-form solutions are achieved in each ADMM iteration. Furthermore, two JCDD neural networks, called JCDDNet-G and JCDDNet-S, are built by unfolding the derived ADMM algorithms and introducing trainable parameters. It is interesting to find via simulations that the proposed trainable JCDD receivers can outperform the turbo receivers with affordable computational complexities. ",

    "title": "Beyond recognizing well-covered graphs",
    "abstract": "We prove a number of results related to the computational complexity of recognizing well-covered graphs. Let $k$ and $s$ be positive integers and let $G$ be a graph. Then $G$ is said - $\\mathbf{W_k}$ if for any $k$ pairwise disjoint independent vertex sets $A_1, \\dots, A_k$ in $G$, there exist $k$ pairwise disjoint maximum independent sets $S_1, \\dots,S_k$ in $G$ such that $A_i \\subseteq S_i$ for $i \\in [k]$. - $\\mathbf{E_s}$ if every independent set in $G$ of size at most $s$ is contained in a maximum independent set in $G$. Chv\\'atal and Slater (1993) and Sankaranarayana and Stewart (1992) famously showed that recognizing $\\mathbf{W_1}$ graphs or, equivalently, well-covered graphs is coNP-complete. We extend this result by showing that recognizing $\\mathbf{W_{k+1}}$ graphs in either $\\mathbf{W_k}$ or $\\mathbf{E_s}$ graphs is coNP-complete. This answers a question of Levit and Tankus (2023) and strengthens a theorem of Feghali and Marin (2024). We also show that recognizing $\\mathbf{E_{s+1}}$ graphs is $\\Theta_2^p$-complete even in $\\mathbf{E_s}$ graphs, where $\\Theta_2^p = \\text{P}^{\\text{NP}[\\log]}$ is the class of problems solvable in polynomial time using a logarithmic number of calls to a SAT oracle. This strengthens a theorem of Berg\\'e, Busson, Feghali and Watrigant (2023). We also obtain the complete picture of the complexity of recognizing chordal $\\mathbf{W_k}$ and $\\mathbf{E_s}$ graphs which, in particular, simplifies and generalizes a result of Dettlaff, Henning and Topp (2023).

While this method is known to asymptotically achieve the optimal rate for a wide range of problems, there have been no non-asymptotic results matching these optimal rates outside of a select few, typically linear, model classes. By leveraging modern tools from learning with dependent data, we provide the first rate-optimal non-asymptotic analysis of this method for our more general setting of nonlinearly parametrized model classes. Moreover, we show that our results can be applied to a particular class of identifiable AutoRegressive Moving Average (ARMA) models, resulting in the first optimal non-asymptotic rates for identification of ARMA models.
