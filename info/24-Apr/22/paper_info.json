    "title": "A Big Data Analytics System for Predicting Suicidal Ideation in  Real-Time Based on Social Media Streaming Data",
    "abstract": "Online social media platforms have recently become integral to our society and daily routines. Every day, users worldwide spend a couple of hours on such platforms, expressing their sentiments and emotional state and contacting each other. Analyzing such huge amounts of data from these platforms can provide a clear insight into public sentiments and help detect their mental status. The early identification of these health condition risks may assist in preventing or reducing the number of suicide ideation and potentially saving people's lives. The traditional techniques have become ineffective in processing such streams and large-scale datasets. Therefore, the paper proposed a new methodology based on a big data architecture to predict suicidal ideation from social media content. The proposed approach provides a practical analysis of social media data in two phases: batch processing and real-time streaming prediction. The batch dataset was collected from the Reddit forum and used for model building and training, while streaming big data was extracted using Twitter streaming API and used for real-time prediction. After the raw data was preprocessed, the extracted features were fed to multiple Apache Spark ML classifiers: NB, LR, LinearSVC, DT, RF, and MLP. We conducted various experiments using various feature-extraction techniques with different testing scenarios. The experimental results of the batch processing phase showed that the features extracted of (Unigram + Bigram) + CV-IDF with MLP classifier provided high performance for classifying suicidal ideation, with an accuracy of 93.47%, and then applied for real-time streaming prediction phase.

As such, enhancing buildings' BER levels is expected to directly contribute to the reduction of carbon emissions and promote climate improvement. Nonetheless, the BER assessment process is vulnerable to missing and inaccurate measurements. In this study, we introduce \\texttt{CLEAR}, a data-driven approach designed to scrutinize the inconsistencies in BER assessments through self-supervised contrastive learning.

To bridge the gap of learning accurate representations with efficient and flexible mechanisms, we introduce Efflex, a comprehensive pipeline for transformative graph modeling and representation learning of the large-volume spatio-temporal trajectories. Efflex pioneers the incorporation of a multi-scale k-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm with feature fusion for graph construction, marking a leap in dimensionality reduction techniques by preserving essential data features. Moreover, the groundbreaking graph construction mechanism and the high-performance lightweight GCN increase embedding extraction speed by up to 36 times faster.

    "abstract": "What has an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) learned after being successfully trained to solve a task - the set of training items or the relations between them? This question is difficult to answer for modern applied ANNs because of their enormous size and complexity. Therefore, here we consider a low-dimensional network and a simple task, i.e., the network has to reproduce a set of training items identically. We construct the family of solutions analytically and use standard learning algorithms to obtain numerical solutions. These numerical solutions differ depending on the optimization algorithm and the weight initialization and are shown to be particular members of the family of analytical solutions. In this simple setting, we observe that the general structure of the network weights represents the training set's symmetry group, i.e., the relations between training items. As a consequence, linear networks generalize, i.e., reproduce items that were not part of the training set but are consistent with the symmetry of the training set. In contrast, non-linear networks tend to learn individual training items and show associative memory. At the same time, their ability to generalize is limited. A higher degree of generalization is obtained for networks whose activation function contains a linear regime, such as tanh. Our results suggest ANN's ability to generalize - instead of learning items - could be improved by generating a sufficiently big set of elementary operations to represent relations and strongly depends on the applied non-linearity.

    "abstract": "Hardware-aware Neural Architecture Search approaches (HW-NAS) automate the design of deep learning architectures, tailored specifically to a given target hardware platform. Yet, these techniques demand substantial computational resources, primarily due to the expensive process of assessing the performance of identified architectures. To alleviate this problem, a recent direction in the literature has employed representation similarity metric for efficiently evaluating architecture performance. Nonetheless, since it is inherently a single objective method, it requires multiple runs to identify the optimal architecture set satisfying the diverse hardware cost constraints, thereby increasing the search cost. Furthermore, simply converting the single objective into a multi-objective approach results in an under-explored architectural search space. In this study, we propose a Multi-Objective method to address the HW-NAS problem, called MO-HDNAS, to identify the trade-off set of architectures in a single run with low computational cost. This is achieved by optimizing three objectives: maximizing the representation similarity metric, minimizing hardware cost, and maximizing the hardware cost diversity. The third objective, i.e. hardware cost diversity, is used to facilitate a better exploration of the architecture search space. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method in efficiently addressing the HW-NAS problem across six edge devices for the image classification task. ",

    "abstract": "The pattern of state changes in a biomedical time series can be related to health or disease. This work presents a principled approach for selecting a changepoint detection algorithm for a specific task, such as disease classification. Eight key algorithms were compared, and the performance of each algorithm was evaluated as a function of temporal tolerance, noise, and abnormal conduction (ectopy) on realistic artificial cardiovascular time series data. All algorithms were applied to real data (cardiac time series of 22 patients with REM-behavior disorder (RBD) and 15 healthy controls) using the parameters selected on artificial data. Finally, features were derived from the detected changepoints to classify RBD patients from healthy controls using a K-Nearest Neighbors approach. On artificial data, Modified Bayesian Changepoint Detection algorithm provided superior positive predictive value for state change identification while Recursive Mean Difference Maximization (RMDM) achieved the highest true positive rate. For the classification task, features derived from the RMDM algorithm provided the highest leave one out cross validated accuracy of 0.89 and true positive rate of 0.87. Automatically detected changepoints provide useful information about subject's physiological state which cannot be directly observed. However, the choice of change point detection algorithm depends on the nature of the underlying data and the downstream application, such as a classification task. This work represents the first time change point detection algorithms have been compared in a meaningful way and utilized in a classification task, which demonstrates the effect of changepoint algorithm choice on application performance.

However, it remains unclear what factors contribute to the learning of a language-neutral representation, and whether the learned language-neutral representation suffices to facilitate cross-lingual transfer. We propose a synthetic task, Multilingual Othello (mOthello), as a testbed to delve into these two questions. We find that: (1) models trained with naive multilingual pretraining fail to learn a language-neutral representation across all input languages; (2) the introduction of \"anchor tokens\" (i.e., lexical items that are identical across languages) helps cross-lingual representation alignment; and (3) the learning of a language-neutral representation alone is not sufficient to facilitate cross-lingual transfer. Based on our findings, we propose a novel approach - multilingual pretraining with unified output space - that both induces the learning of language-neutral representation and facilitates cross-lingual transfer.

    "abstract": "Large-scale geolocation telematics data acquired from connected vehicles has the potential to significantly enhance mobility infrastructures and operational systems within smart cities. To effectively utilize this data, it is essential to accurately match the geolocation data to the road segments. However, this matching is often not trivial due to the low sampling rate and errors exacerbated by multipath effects in urban environments. Traditionally, statistical modeling techniques such as Hidden-Markov models incorporating domain knowledge into the matching process have been extensively used for map-matching tasks. However, rule-based map-matching tasks are noise-sensitive and inefficient in processing large-scale trajectory data. Deep learning techniques directly learn the relationship between observed data and road networks from the data, often without the need for hand-crafted rules or domain knowledge. This renders them an efficient approach for map-matching large-scale datasets and makes them more robust to the noise. This paper introduces a sequence-to-sequence deep-learning model, specifically the transformer-based encoder-decoder model, to perform as a surrogate for map-matching algorithms. The encoder-decoder architecture initially encodes the series of noisy GPS points into a representation that automatically captures autoregressive behavior and spatial correlations between GPS points. Subsequently, the decoder associates data points with the road network features and thus transforms these representations into a sequence of road segments. The model is trained and evaluated using GPS traces collected in Manhattan, New York. Achieving an accuracy of 76%, transformer-based encoder-decoder models extensively employed in natural language processing presented a promising performance for translating noisy GPS data to the navigated routes in urban road networks.

However, the process of editing textures often involves laborious and repetitive manual adjustments of textons, which are the small, recurring local patterns that define textures. In this work, we introduce a fully unsupervised approach for representing textures using a compositional neural model that captures individual textons. We represent each texton as a 2D Gaussian function whose spatial support approximates its shape, and an associated feature that encodes its detailed appearance. By modeling a texture as a discrete composition of Gaussian textons, the representation offers both expressiveness and ease of editing. Textures can be edited by modifying the compositional Gaussians within the latent space, and new textures can be efficiently synthesized by feeding the modified Gaussians through a generator network in a feed-forward manner. This approach enables a wide range of applications, including transferring appearance from an image texture to another image, diversifying textures, texture interpolation, revealing/modifying texture variations, edit propagation, texture animation, and direct texton manipulation. The proposed approach contributes to advancing texture analysis, modeling, and editing techniques, and opens up new possibilities for creating visually appealing images with controllable textures. ",

    "abstract": "Deep learning (DL) models have revolutionized numerous domains, yet optimizing them for computational efficiency remains a challenging endeavor. Development of new DL models typically involves two parties: the model developers and performance optimizers. The collaboration between the parties often necessitates the model developers exposing the model architecture and computational graph to the optimizers. However, this exposure is undesirable since the model architecture is an important intellectual property, and its innovations require significant investments and expertise. During the exchange, the model is also vulnerable to adversarial attacks via model stealing. This paper presents Proteus, a novel mechanism that enables model optimization by an independent party while preserving the confidentiality of the model architecture. Proteus obfuscates the protected model by partitioning its computational graph into subgraphs and concealing each subgraph within a large pool of generated realistic subgraphs that cannot be easily distinguished from the original. We evaluate Proteus on a range of DNNs, demonstrating its efficacy in preserving confidentiality without compromising performance optimization opportunities. Proteus effectively hides the model as one alternative among up to $10^{32}$ possible model architectures, and is resilient against attacks with a learning-based adversary. We also demonstrate that heuristic based and manual approaches are ineffective in identifying the protected model. To our knowledge, Proteus is the first work that tackles the challenge of model confidentiality during performance optimization. Proteus will be open-sourced for direct use and experimentation, with easy integration with compilers such as ONNXRuntime. ",

    "abstract": "The widespread adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) poses several challenges to power distribution networks and smart grid infrastructure due to the possibility of significantly increasing electricity demands, especially during peak hours. Furthermore, when EVs participate in demand-side management programs, charging expenses can be reduced by using optimal charging control policies that fully utilize real-time pricing schemes. However, devising optimal charging methods and control strategies for EVs is challenging due to various stochastic and uncertain environmental factors. Currently, most EV charging controllers operate based on a centralized model. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach for distributed and cooperative charging strategy using a Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) framework. Our method is built upon the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) algorithm for a group of EVs in a residential community, where all EVs are connected to a shared transformer. This method, referred to as CTDE-DDPG, adopts a Centralized Training Decentralized Execution (CTDE) approach to establish cooperation between agents during the training phase, while ensuring a distributed and privacy-preserving operation during execution. We theoretically examine the performance of centralized and decentralized critics for the DDPG-based MARL implementation and demonstrate their trade-offs. Furthermore, we numerically explore the efficiency, scalability, and performance of centralized and decentralized critics. Our theoretical and numerical results indicate that, despite higher policy gradient variances and training complexity, the CTDE-DDPG framework significantly improves charging efficiency by reducing total variation by approximately %36 and charging cost by around %9.1 on average...

    "title": "TrACT: A Training Dynamics Aware Contrastive Learning Framework for  Long-tail Trajectory Prediction",
    "abstract": "As a safety critical task, autonomous driving requires accurate predictions of road users' future trajectories for safe motion planning, particularly under challenging conditions. Yet, many recent deep learning methods suffer from a degraded performance on the challenging scenarios, mainly because these scenarios appear less frequently in the training data. To address such a long-tail issue, existing methods force challenging scenarios closer together in the feature space during training to trigger information sharing among them for more robust learning. These methods, however, primarily rely on the motion patterns to characterize scenarios, omitting more informative contextual information, such as interactions and scene layout. We argue that exploiting such information not only improves prediction accuracy but also scene compliance of the generated trajectories. In this paper, we propose to incorporate richer training dynamics information into a prototypical contrastive learning framework. More specifically, we propose a two-stage process. First, we generate rich contextual features using a baseline encoder-decoder framework. These features are split into clusters based on the model's output errors, using the training dynamics information, and a prototype is computed within each cluster. Second, we retrain the model using the prototypes in a contrastive learning framework. We conduct empirical evaluations of our approach using two large-scale naturalistic datasets and show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance by improving accuracy and scene compliance on the long-tail samples. Furthermore, we perform experiments on a subset of the clusters to highlight the additional benefit of our approach in reducing training bias. ",

    "abstract": "While graph neural networks (GNNs) have become the de-facto standard for graph-based node classification, they impose a strong assumption on the availability of sufficient labeled samples. This assumption restricts the classification performance of prevailing GNNs on many real-world applications suffering from low-data regimes. Specifically, features extracted from scarce labeled nodes could not provide sufficient supervision for the unlabeled samples, leading to severe over-fitting. In this work, we point out that leveraging subgraphs to capture long-range dependencies can augment the representation of a node with homophily properties, thus alleviating the low-data regime. However, prior works leveraging subgraphs fail to capture the long-range dependencies among nodes. To this end, we present a novel self-supervised learning framework, called multi-view subgraph neural networks (Muse), for handling long-range dependencies. In particular, we propose an information theory-based identification mechanism to identify two types of subgraphs from the views of input space and latent space, respectively. The former is to capture the local structure of the graph, while the latter captures the long-range dependencies among nodes. By fusing these two views of subgraphs, the learned representations can preserve the topological properties of the graph at large, including the local structure and long-range dependencies, thus maximizing their expressiveness for downstream node classification tasks. Experimental results show that Muse outperforms the alternative methods on node classification tasks with limited labeled data. ",

    "abstract": "Recent geospatial machine learning studies have shown that the results of model evaluation via cross-validation (CV) are strongly affected by the dissimilarity between the sample data and the prediction locations. In this paper, we propose a method to quantify such a dissimilarity in the interval 0 to 100%, and from the perspective of the data feature space. The proposed method is based on adversarial validation, which is an approach that can check whether sample data and prediction locations can be separated with a binary classifier. To study the effectiveness and generality of our method, we tested it on a series of experiments based on both synthetic and real datasets and with gradually increasing dissimilarities. Results show that the proposed method can successfully quantify dissimilarity across the entire range of values. Next to this, we studied how dissimilarity affects CV evaluations by comparing the results of random CV and of two spatial CV methods, namely block and spatial+ CV. Our results showed that CV evaluations follow similar patterns in all datasets and predictions: when dissimilarity is low (usually lower than 30%), random CV provides the most accurate evaluation results. As dissimilarity increases, spatial CV methods, especially spatial+ CV, become more and more accurate and even outperforming random CV. When dissimilarity is high (>=90%), no CV method provides accurate evaluations. These results show the importance of considering feature space dissimilarity when working with geospatial machine learning predictions, and can help researchers and practitioners to select more suitable CV methods for evaluating their predictions.

By considering the state of the knowledge graph as environment states defining actions as operations for integrating contexts and using a reward function to gauge the improvement in knowledge graph quality post-integration, this method aims to automatically develop strategies for optimal context integration. Our DQN model utilizes networks as function approximators, continually updating Q values to estimate the action value function, thus enabling effective integration of intricate and dynamic context information. Initial experimental findings show that our RL method outperforms techniques in achieving precise context integration across various standard knowledge graph datasets, highlighting the potential and effectiveness of reinforcement learning in enhancing and managing knowledge graphs.

Within intelligent warehousing environments, AGV is required to safely and rapidly plan an optimal path in complex and dynamic environments. Most research has studied deep reinforcement learning to address this challenge. However, in the environments with sparse extrinsic rewards, these algorithms often converge slowly, learn inefficiently or fail to reach the target. Random Network Distillation (RND), as an exploration enhancement, can effectively improve the performance of proximal policy optimization, especially enhancing the additional intrinsic rewards of the AGV agent which is in sparse reward environments. Moreover, most of the current research continues to use 2D grid mazes as experimental environments. These environments have insufficient complexity and limited action sets. To solve this limitation, we present simulation environments of AGV path planning with continuous actions and positions for AGVs, so that it can be close to realistic physical scenarios. Based on our experiments and comprehensive analysis of the proposed method, the results demonstrate that our proposed method enables AGV to more rapidly complete path planning tasks with continuous actions in our environments.

The novel greedy EDM FDE method implements a new fault detection test statistic and fault exclusion strategy that drastically simplifies the complexity of the algorithm over previous work. To validate the novel greedy EDM FDE algorithm, we created a simulated dataset using receiver locations from around the globe. The simulated dataset allows us to verify our results on 2,601 different satellite geometries. Additionally, we tested the greedy EDM FDE algorithm using a real-world dataset from seven different android phones. Across both the simulated and real-world datasets, the Python implementation of the greedy EDM FDE algorithm is shown to be computed an order of magnitude more rapidly than a comparable greedy residual FDE method while obtaining similar fault exclusion accuracy. We provide discussion on the comparative time complexities of greedy EDM FDE, greedy residual FDE, and solution separation. We also explain potential modifications to greedy residual FDE that can be added to alter performance characteristics. ",

    "abstract": "Advanced biological intelligence learns efficiently from an information-rich stream of stimulus information, even when feedback on behaviour quality is sparse or absent. Such learning exploits implicit assumptions about task domains. We refer to such learning as Domain-Adapted Learning (DAL). In contrast, AI learning algorithms rely on explicit externally provided measures of behaviour quality to acquire fit behaviour. This imposes an information bottleneck that precludes learning from diverse non-reward stimulus information, limiting learning efficiency. We consider the question of how biological evolution circumvents this bottleneck to produce DAL. We propose that species first evolve the ability to learn from reward signals, providing inefficient (bottlenecked) but broad adaptivity. From there, integration of non-reward information into the learning process can proceed via gradual accumulation of biases induced by such information on specific task domains. This scenario provides a biologically plausible pathway towards bottleneck-free, domain-adapted learning. Focusing on the second phase of this scenario, we set up a population of NNs with reward-driven learning modelled as Reinforcement Learning (A2C), and allow evolution to improve learning efficiency by integrating non-reward information into the learning process using a neuromodulatory update mechanism. On a navigation task in continuous 2D space, evolved DAL agents show a 300-fold increase in learning speed compared to pure RL agents. Evolution is found to eliminate reliance on reward information altogether, allowing DAL agents to learn from non-reward information exclusively, using local neuromodulation-based connection weight updates only.

Furthermore, to overcome the generalization issue for varying VNR sizes, we propose a meta-RL-based training method with a curriculum scheduling strategy, facilitating specialized policy training for each VNR size.

Previously, researchers ensured the imperceptibility of their altered data points by restricting perturbations via $\\ell_p$ norms. However, recent publications claim that creating natural-looking adversarial examples without such restrictions is also possible. With much more freedom to instill malicious information into data, these unrestricted adversarial examples can potentially overcome traditional defense strategies as they are not constrained by the limitations or patterns these defenses typically recognize and mitigate. This allows attackers to operate outside of expected threat models. However, surveying existing image-based methods, we noticed a need for more human evaluations of the proposed image modifications. Based on existing human-assessment frameworks for image generation quality, we propose SCOOTER - an evaluation framework for unrestricted image-based attacks. It provides researchers with guidelines for conducting statistically significant human experiments, standardized questions, and a ready-to-use implementation.

The implicit and varied forms of expression in internet language complicate accurate and rapid identification of suicidal intent on social media, thus creating challenges for timely intervention efforts. The development of deep learning models for suicide risk detection is a promising solution, but there is a notable lack of relevant datasets, especially in the Chinese context. To address this gap, this study presents a Chinese social media dataset designed for fine-grained suicide risk classification, focusing on indicators such as expressions of suicide intent, methods of suicide, and urgency of timing. Seven pre-trained models were evaluated in two tasks: high and low suicide risk, and fine-grained suicide risk classification on a level of 0 to 10. In our experiments, deep learning models show good performance in distinguishing between high and low suicide risk, with the best model achieving an F1 score of 88.39%. However, the results for fine-grained suicide risk classification were still unsatisfactory, with an weighted F1 score of 50.89%. To address the issues of data imbalance and limited dataset size, we investigated both traditional and advanced, large language model based data augmentation techniques, demonstrating that data augmentation can enhance model performance by up to 4.65% points in F1-score. Notably, the Chinese MentalBERT model, which was pre-trained on psychological domain data, shows superior performance in both tasks. This study provides valuable insights for automatic identification of suicidal individuals, facilitating timely psychological intervention on social media platforms.

    "abstract": "Facial biometrics are an essential components of smartphones to ensure reliable and trustworthy authentication. However, face biometric systems are vulnerable to Presentation Attacks (PAs), and the availability of more sophisticated presentation attack instruments such as 3D silicone face masks will allow attackers to deceive face recognition systems easily. In this work, we propose a novel Presentation Attack Detection (PAD) algorithm based on 3D point clouds captured using the frontal camera of a smartphone to detect presentation attacks. The proposed PAD algorithm, VoxAtnNet, processes 3D point clouds to obtain voxelization to preserve the spatial structure. Then, the voxelized 3D samples were trained using the novel convolutional attention network to detect PAs on the smartphone. Extensive experiments were carried out on the newly constructed 3D face point cloud dataset comprising bona fide and two different 3D PAIs (3D silicone face mask and wrap photo mask), resulting in 3480 samples. The performance of the proposed method was compared with existing methods to benchmark the detection performance using three different evaluation protocols. The experimental results demonstrate the improved performance of the proposed method in detecting both known and unknown face presentation attacks. ",

    "abstract": "Learning effective representations for Chinese characters presents unique challenges, primarily due to the vast number of characters and their continuous growth, which requires models to handle an expanding category space. Additionally, the inherent sparsity of character usage complicates the generalization of learned representations. Prior research has explored radical-based sequences to overcome these issues, achieving progress in recognizing unseen characters. However, these approaches fail to fully exploit the inherent tree structure of such sequences. To address these limitations and leverage established data properties, we propose Formation Tree-CLIP (FT-CLIP). This model utilizes formation trees to represent characters and incorporates a dedicated tree encoder, significantly improving performance in both seen and unseen character recognition tasks. We further introduce masking for to both character images and tree nodes, enabling efficient and effective training. This approach accelerates training significantly (by a factor of 2 or more) while enhancing accuracy. Extensive experiments show that processing characters through formation trees aligns better with their inherent properties than direct sequential methods, significantly enhancing the generality and usability of the representations.

However, closer inspection of the symbolic meaning representations they produce reveals significant weaknesses: sometimes they tend to merely copy character sequences from the source text to form symbolic concepts, defaulting to the most frequent word sense based in the training distribution. By leveraging the hierarchical structure of a lexical ontology, we introduce a novel compositional symbolic representation for concepts based on their position in the taxonomical hierarchy. This representation provides richer semantic information and enhances interpretability. We introduce a neural \"taxonomical\" semantic parser to utilize this new representation system of predicates, and compare it with a standard neural semantic parser trained on the traditional meaning representation format, employing a novel challenge set and evaluation metric for evaluation. Our experimental findings demonstrate that the taxonomical model, trained on much richer and complex meaning representations, is slightly subordinate in performance to the traditional model using the standard metrics for evaluation, but outperforms it when dealing with out-of-vocabulary concepts. This finding is encouraging for research in computational semantics that aims to combine data-driven distributional meanings with knowledge-based symbolic representations. ",

    "abstract": "Crack detection has become an indispensable, interesting yet challenging task in the computer vision community. Specially, pavement cracks have a highly complex spatial structure, a low contrasting background and a weak spatial continuity, posing a significant challenge to an effective crack detection method. In this paper, we address these problems from a view that utilizes contexts of the cracks and propose an end-to-end deep learning method to model the context information flow. To precisely localize crack from an image, it is critical to effectively extract and aggregate multi-granularity context, including the fine-grained local context around the cracks (in spatial-level) and the coarse-grained semantics (in segment-level). Concretely, in Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), low-level features extracted by the shallow layers represent the local information, while the deep layers extract the semantic features. Additionally, a second main insight in this work is that the semantic context should be an guidance to local context feature. By the above insights, the proposed method we first apply the dilated convolution as the backbone feature extractor to model local context, then we build a context guidance module to leverage semantic context to guide local feature extraction at multiple stages. To handle label alignment between stages, we apply the Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) strategy to align the high-level feature to the low-level ones in the stage-wise context flow. In addition, compared with these public crack datasets, to our best knowledge, we release the largest, most complex and most challenging Bitumen Pavement Crack (BPC) dataset. The experimental results on the three crack datasets demonstrate that the proposed method performs well and outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods. ",

GAL{\\AE}XI implements the high-order Discontinuous Galerkin Spectral Element Method (DGSEM) using shock capturing with a finite-volume subcell approach to ensure the stability of the high-order scheme near shocks. This work provides details on the general code design, the parallelization strategy, and the implementation approach for the compute kernels with a focus on the element local mappings between volume and surface data due to the unstructured mesh. GAL{\\AE}XI exhibits excellent strong scaling properties up to 1024 GPUs if each GPU is assigned a minimum of one million degrees of freedom degrees of freedom. To verify its implementation, a convergence study is performed that recovers the theoretical order of convergence of the implemented numerical schemes. Moreover, the solver is validated using both the incompressible and compressible formulation of the Taylor-Green-Vortex at a Mach number of 0.1 and 1.25, respectively. A mesh convergence study shows that the results converge to the high-fidelity reference solution and that the results match the original CPU implementation. Finally, GAL{\\AE}XI is applied to a large-scale wall-resolved large eddy simulation of a linear cascade of the NASA Rotor 37. Here, the supersonic region and shocks at the leading edge are captured accurately and robustly by the implemented shock-capturing approach. It is demonstrated that GAL{\\AE}XI requires less than half of the energy to carry out this simulation in comparison to the reference CPU implementation. This renders GAL{\\AE}XI as a potent tool for accurate and efficient simulations of compressible flows in the realm of exascale computing and the associated new HPC architectures. ",

However,recent studies have shown that GCNs are vulnerable to a novel threat known as backdoor attacks. However, all existing backdoor attacks in the graph domain require modifying the training samples to accomplish the backdoor injection, which may not be practical in many realistic scenarios where adversaries have no access to modify the training samples and may leads to the backdoor attack being detected easily. In order to explore the backdoor vulnerability of GCNs and create a more practical and stealthy backdoor attack method, this paper proposes a clean-graph backdoor attack against GCNs (CBAG) in the node classification task,which only poisons the training labels without any modification to the training samples, revealing that GCNs have this security vulnerability. Specifically, CBAG designs a new trigger exploration method to find important feature dimensions as the trigger patterns to improve the attack performance. By poisoning the training labels, a hidden backdoor is injected into the GCNs model. Experimental results show that our clean graph backdoor can achieve 99% attack success rate while maintaining the functionality of the GCNs model on benign samples. ",

The framework detects and tracks all types of traffic agents in bird's-eye-view videos of traffic cameras mounted at an intersection. By conceptualizing the intersection as a patch-based graph, it is shown that the framework learns and models the normal behaviour of traffic agents without costly manual labeling. Furthermore, uTRAND allows to formulate simple rules to classify anomalous trajectories in a way suited for human interpretation.

Within the NS-IoT system, all nodes are organized into groups, and multiple MAFs are deployed to monitor each group of nodes. We also propose a dormancy monitor mechanism to mitigate the monitoring energy consumption by placing the MAFs, which is monitoring non-failure devices, in a dormant state. We propose a reinforcement learning based PPO algorithm to guide the dynamic dormancy of MAFs. Simulation results demonstrate that our dynamic dormancy strategy maximizes energy conservation, while proposed algorithm outperforms alternatives in terms of efficiency and stability. ",

Besides, existing methods use the textual responses as communication media, ignoring the rich information in the inner representations of neural networks. Therefore, we propose a training-free ensemble framework DEEPEN, averaging the probability distributions outputted by different LLMs. A key challenge in this paradigm is the vocabulary discrepancy between heterogeneous LLMs, which hinders the operation of probability distribution averaging. To address this challenge, DEEPEN maps the probability distribution of each model from the probability space to a universe relative space based on the relative representation theory, and performs aggregation. Then, the result of aggregation is mapped back to the probability space of one LLM via a search-based inverse transformation to determine the generated token. We conduct experiments on the ensemble of various LLMs of 6B to 70B. Experimental results show that DEEPEN achieves consistent improvements across six popular benchmarks involving subject examination, reasoning and knowledge-QA, proving the effectiveness of our approach.

We applied this method to the fully convolutional network (FCN) and experimentally compared its prediction accuracy on the cityscapes dataset. The Mean IoU of the proposed target model with the He normal initialization is 18.7% higher than that of FCN with the He normal initialization. In addition, those of the modified models of the target model are significantly higher than that of FCN with the He normal initialization. The accuracy and loss curves during the training showed that these are resulting from the improvement of the generalization ability. All of these results provide strong evidence that the proposed method is significantly effective in improving the prediction accuracy of FCN. The proposed method has the following features: it is comparatively simple, whereas the effect on improving the generalization ability and prediction accuracy of FCN is significant; the increase in the number of parameters by using it is very small, and that in the computation time is substantially large. In principle, the proposed method can be applied to other semantic segmentation methods. For semantic segmentation, at present, there is no effective way to improve the prediction accuracy of existing methods. None have published a method which is the same as or similar to our method and none have used such a method in practice. Therefore, we believe that our method is useful in practice and worthy of being widely known and used. ",

In this work, we prove near-tight runtime guarantees for these three algorithms on the four most common benchmark problems OneMinMax, CountingOnesCountingZeros, LeadingOnesTrailingZeros, and OneJumpZeroJump, and this for arbitrary numbers of objectives. Our bounds depend only linearly on the Pareto front size, showing that these MOEAs on these benchmarks cope much better with many objectives than what previous works suggested. Our bounds are tight apart from small polynomial factors in the number of objectives and length of bitstrings. This is the first time that such tight bounds are proven for many-objective uses of these MOEAs.

Hence, fine-tuning representation rank presents a challenging and crucial optimization problem. To address this issue, we find a guiding principle for adaptive control of the representation rank. We employ the Bellman equation as a theoretical foundation and derive an upper bound on the cosine similarity of consecutive state-action pairs representations of value networks. We then leverage this upper bound to propose a novel regularizer, namely BEllman Equation-based automatic rank Regularizer (BEER). This regularizer adaptively regularizes the representation rank, thus improving the DRL agent's performance. We first validate the effectiveness of automatic control of rank on illustrative experiments. Then, we scale up BEER to complex continuous control tasks by combining it with the deterministic policy gradient method. Among 12 challenging DeepMind control tasks, BEER outperforms the baselines by a large margin. Besides, BEER demonstrates significant advantages in Q-value approximation.

    "abstract": "While computer modeling and simulation are crucial for understanding scientometrics, their practical use in literature remains somewhat limited. In this study, we establish a joint coauthorship and citation network using preferential attachment. As papers get published, we update the coauthorship network based on each paper's author list, representing the collaborative team behind it. This team is formed considering the number of collaborations each author has, and we introduce new authors at a fixed probability, expanding the coauthorship network. Simultaneously, as each paper cites a specific number of references, we add an equivalent number of citations to the citation network upon publication. The likelihood of a paper being cited depends on its existing citations, fitness value, and age. Then we calculate the journal impact factor and h-index, using them as examples of scientific impact indicators. After thorough validation, we conduct case studies to analyze the impact of different parameters on the journal impact factor and h-index. The findings reveal that increasing the reference number N or reducing the paper's lifetime {\\theta} significantly boosts the journal impact factor and average h-index. On the other hand, enlarging the team size m without introducing new authors or decreasing the probability of newcomers p notably increases the average h-index. In conclusion, it is evident that various parameters influence scientific impact indicators, and their interpretation can be manipulated by authors. Thus, exploring the impact of these parameters and continually refining scientific impact indicators are essential. The modeling and simulation method serves as a powerful tool in this ongoing process, and the model can be easily extended to include other scientific impact indicators and scenarios. ",

The traditional approach necessitates well-calibrated cameras, which confines variation of camera configuration, as the algorithm relies on intrinsic and extrinsic calibration. In this paper, we propose a learning-based ego-lane inference by directly estimating the ego-lane index from a single image. To enhance robust performance, our model incorporates the two-head structure inferring ego-lane in two perspectives simultaneously. Furthermore, we utilize an attention mechanism guided by vanishing point-and-line to adapt to changes in viewpoint without requiring accurate calibration. The high adaptability of our model was validated in diverse environments, devices, and camera mounting points and orientations. ",

    "abstract": "In the domain of 3D scene representation, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a pivotal technology. However, its application to large-scale, high-resolution scenes (exceeding 4k$\\times$4k pixels) is hindered by the excessive computational requirements for managing a large number of Gaussians. Addressing this, we introduce 'EfficientGS', an advanced approach that optimizes 3DGS for high-resolution, large-scale scenes. We analyze the densification process in 3DGS and identify areas of Gaussian over-proliferation. We propose a selective strategy, limiting Gaussian increase to key primitives, thereby enhancing the representational efficiency. Additionally, we develop a pruning mechanism to remove redundant Gaussians, those that are merely auxiliary to adjacent ones. For further enhancement, we integrate a sparse order increment for Spherical Harmonics (SH), designed to alleviate storage constraints and reduce training overhead. Our empirical evaluations, conducted on a range of datasets including extensive 4K+ aerial images, demonstrate that 'EfficientGS' not only expedites training and rendering times but also achieves this with a model size approximately tenfold smaller than conventional 3DGS while maintaining high rendering fidelity.

This paper introduces a novel defensive framework focused on the strategic elimination of adversarial users within a federated model. We detect those anomalies in the aggregation phase of the Federated Algorithm, by integrating metadata gathered by the local training instances with Differential Privacy techniques, to ensure that no data leakage is possible. To our knowledge, this is the first proposal in the field of FL that leverages metadata other than the model's gradients in order to ensure honesty in the reported local models. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of our methods, significantly mitigating the risk of data poisoning while maintaining user privacy and model performance. Our findings suggest that this new user elimination approach serves us with a great balance between privacy and utility, thus contributing to the arsenal of arguments in favor of the safe adoption of FL in safe domains, both in academic setting and in the industry.

Sentimental factors are critical in interactive commenting, and lack of research so far. Thus, in this paper, we propose a Sentiment-oriented Transformer-based Variational Autoencoder (So-TVAE) network which consists of a sentiment-oriented diversity encoder module and a batch attention module, to achieve diverse video commenting with multiple sentiments and multiple semantics. Specifically, our sentiment-oriented diversity encoder elegantly combines VAE and random mask mechanism to achieve semantic diversity under sentiment guidance, which is then fused with cross-modal features to generate live video comments. Furthermore, a batch attention module is also proposed in this paper to alleviate the problem of missing sentimental samples, caused by the data imbalance, which is common in live videos as the popularity of videos varies. Extensive experiments on Livebot and VideoIC datasets demonstrate that the proposed So-TVAE outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in terms of the quality and diversity of generated comments.

    "abstract": "It is generally believed that downlink cell-free networks perform best under centralized implementations where the local channel state information (CSI) acquired by the access-points (AP) is forwarded to one or more central processing units (CPU) for the computation of the joint precoders based on global CSI. However, mostly due to limited fronthaul capabilities, this procedure incurs some delay that may lead to partially outdated precoding decisions and hence performance degradation. In some scenarios, this may even lead to worse performance than distributed implementations where the precoders are locally computed by the APs based on partial yet timely local CSI. To address this issue, this study considers the problem of robust precoding design merging the benefits of timely local CSI and delayed global CSI. As main result, we provide a novel distributed precoding design based on the recently proposed team minimum mean-square error method. As a byproduct, we also obtain novel insights related to the AP-CPU functional split problem. Our main conclusion, corroborated by simulations, is that the opportunity of performing some local precoding computations at the APs should not be neglected, even in centralized implementations. ",

By integrating Z-GT2-FS with the \\(\\alpha\\)-plane representation, we show that the design flexibility of GT2-FLS is increased as it takes away the dependency of the secondary membership function from the primary membership function. After detailing the construction of Z-GT2-FLSs, we provide solutions to challenges while learning from high-dimensional data: the curse of dimensionality, and integrating Deep Learning (DL) optimizers. We develop a DL framework for learning dual-focused Z-GT2-FLSs with high performances. Our study includes statistical analyses, highlighting that the Z-GT2-FLS not only exhibits high-precision performance but also produces HQ-PIs in comparison to its GT2 and IT2 fuzzy counterparts which have more learnable parameters.

Additionally, we introduce a framework to learn the enhanced IT2-FLS with a dual focus, aiming for high precision and PI generation.

This leads to enhance spectrum utilization performance while minimizing the unmet system capacity, meeting quality of service (QoS) requirements and overall system optimization. In turn, a wide range of applications and services in various domains can be supported. However, allocating resources in a multi-constellation system with heterogeneous satellite links and highly dynamic user traffic demand pose challenges in ensuring sufficient and fair resource distribution. To mitigate these complexities and minimize the overhead, there is a growing shift towards utilizing artificial intelligence (AI) for its ability to handle such problems effectively. This calls for the development of an intelligent decision-making controller using AI to efficiently manage resources in this complex environment. In this context, real-world open datasets play a pivotal role in the development of AI models addressing radio control optimization problems. As a matter of fact, acquiring suitable datasets can be arduous. Therefore, this paper identifies pertinent real-world open datasets representing realistic traffic pattern, network performances and demand for fixed and dynamic user terminals, enabling a variety of uses cases. The aim of gathering and publishing the information of these datasets are to inspire and assist the research community in crafting the advance resource management solutions.

In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective fully end-to-end framework named Future Instance Prediction Transformer(FipTR), which views the task as BEV instance segmentation and prediction for future frames. We propose to adopt instance queries representing specific traffic participants to directly estimate the corresponding future occupied masks, and thus get rid of complex post-processing procedures. Besides, we devise a flow-aware BEV predictor for future BEV feature prediction composed of a flow-aware deformable attention that takes backward flow guiding the offset sampling. A novel future instance matching strategy is also proposed to further improve the temporal coherence. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of FipTR and its effectiveness under different temporal BEV encoders. ",

    "abstract": "As the Windows OS stands out as one of the most targeted systems, the PowerShell language has become a key tool for malicious actors and cybersecurity professionals (e.g., for penetration testing). This work explores an uncharted domain in AI code generation by automatically generating offensive PowerShell code from natural language descriptions using Neural Machine Translation (NMT). For training and evaluation purposes, we propose two novel datasets with PowerShell code samples, one with manually curated descriptions in natural language and another code-only dataset for reinforcing the training. We present an extensive evaluation of state-of-the-art NMT models and analyze the generated code both statically and dynamically. Results indicate that tuning NMT using our dataset is effective at generating offensive PowerShell code. Comparative analysis against the most widely used LLM service ChatGPT reveals the specialized strengths of our fine-tuned models. ",

    "abstract": "Vision-Large-Language-models(VLMs) have great application prospects in autonomous driving. Despite the ability of VLMs to comprehend and make decisions in complex scenarios, their integration into safety-critical autonomous driving systems poses serious security risks. In this paper, we propose BadVLMDriver, the first backdoor attack against VLMs for autonomous driving that can be launched in practice using physical objects. Unlike existing backdoor attacks against VLMs that rely on digital modifications, BadVLMDriver uses common physical items, such as a red balloon, to induce unsafe actions like sudden acceleration, highlighting a significant real-world threat to autonomous vehicle safety. To execute BadVLMDriver, we develop an automated pipeline utilizing natural language instructions to generate backdoor training samples with embedded malicious behaviors. This approach allows for flexible trigger and behavior selection, enhancing the stealth and practicality of the attack in diverse scenarios. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate BadVLMDriver for two representative VLMs, five different trigger objects, and two types of malicious backdoor behaviors. BadVLMDriver achieves a 92% attack success rate in inducing a sudden acceleration when coming across a pedestrian holding a red balloon. Thus, BadVLMDriver not only demonstrates a critical security risk but also emphasizes the urgent need for developing robust defense mechanisms to protect against such vulnerabilities in autonomous driving technologies.

    "abstract": "We revisit the classic broadcast problem, wherein we have $k$ messages, each composed of $O(\\log{n})$ bits, distributed arbitrarily across a network. The objective is to broadcast these messages to all nodes in the network. In the distributed CONGEST model, a textbook algorithm solves this problem in $O(D+k)$ rounds, where $D$ is the diameter of the graph. While the $O(D)$ term in the round complexity is unavoidable$\\unicode{x2014}$given that $\\Omega(D)$ rounds are necessary to solve broadcast in any graph$\\unicode{x2014}$it remains unclear whether the $O(k)$ term is needed in all graphs. In cases where the minimum cut size is one, simply transmitting messages from one side of the cut to the other would require $\\Omega(k)$ rounds. However, if the size of the minimum cut is larger, it may be possible to develop faster algorithms. This motivates the exploration of the broadcast problem in networks with high edge connectivity. In this work, we present a simple randomized distributed algorithm for performing $k$-message broadcast in $O(((n+k)/\\lambda)\\log n)$ rounds in any $n$-node simple graph with edge connectivity $\\lambda$. When $k = \\Omega(n)$, our algorithm is universally optimal, up to an $O(\\log n)$ factor, as its complexity nearly matches an information-theoretic $\\Omega(k/\\lambda)$ lower bound that applies to all graphs, even when the network topology is known to the algorithm. The setting $k = \\Omega(n)$ is particularly interesting because several fundamental problems can be reduced to broadcasting $\\Omega(n)$ messages. Our broadcast algorithm finds several applications in distributed computing, enabling $O(1)$-approximation for all distances and $(1+\\epsilon)$-approximation for all cut sizes in $\\tilde{O}(n/\\lambda)$ rounds.

In this ABM approach, agents represent the components of a system, where interactions within a system shape intra-dependency of a system and interactions among systems shape interdependencies. To study household resilience subject to a hurricane, a library of agents has been created including electric power network, transportation network, wind/flooding hazards, and household agents. The ABM is applied over the household and infrastructure data from a community (Zip code 33147) in Miami-Dade County, Florida. Interdependencies between the two networks are modeled in two ways, (i) representing the role of transportation in fuel delivery to power plants and restoration teams' access, (ii) impact of power outage on transportation network components. Restoring traffic signals quickly is crucial as their outage can slow down traffic and increase the chance of crashes. We simulate three restoration strategies: component based, distance based, and traffic lights based restoration. The model is validated against Hurricane Irma data, showing consistent behavior with varying hazard intensities. Scenario analyses explore the impact of restoration strategies, road accessibility, and wind speed intensities on power restoration. Results demonstrate that a traffic lights based restoration strategy efficiently prioritizes signal recovery without delaying household power restoration time. Restoration of power services will be faster if restoration teams do not need to wait due to inaccessible roads and fuel transportation to power plants is not delayed. ",

However, the classification of scrap materials poses a significant challenge, requiring advancements in automation technology. Additionally, building trust among human operators is a major obstacle. Traditional approaches often fail to quantify uncertainty and lack clarity in model decision-making, which complicates acceptance. In this article, we describe how conformal prediction can be employed to quantify uncertainty and add robustness in scrap classification. We have adapted the Split Conformal Prediction technique to seamlessly integrate with state-of-the-art computer vision models, such as the Vision Transformer (ViT), Swin Transformer, and ResNet-50, while also incorporating Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) methods. We evaluate the approach using a comprehensive dataset of 8147 images spanning nine ferrous scrap classes. The application of the Split Conformal Prediction method allowed for the quantification of each model's uncertainties, which enhanced the understanding of predictions and increased the reliability of the results. Specifically, the Swin Transformer model demonstrated more reliable outcomes than the others, as evidenced by its smaller average size of prediction sets and achieving an average classification accuracy exceeding 95%. Furthermore, the Score-CAM method proved highly effective in clarifying visual features, significantly enhancing the explainability of the classification decisions. ",

    "abstract": "Model calibration aims to align confidence with prediction correctness. The Cross-Entropy CE) loss is widely used for calibrator training, which enforces the model to increase confidence on the ground truth class. However, we find the CE loss has intrinsic limitations. For example, for a narrow misclassification, a calibrator trained by the CE loss often produces high confidence on the wrongly predicted class (e.g., a test sample is wrongly classified and its softmax score on the ground truth class is around 0.4), which is undesirable. In this paper, we propose a new post-hoc calibration objective derived from the aim of calibration. Intuitively, the proposed objective function asks that the calibrator decrease model confidence on wrongly predicted samples and increase confidence on correctly predicted samples. Because a sample itself has insufficient ability to indicate correctness, we use its transformed versions (e.g., rotated, greyscaled and color-jittered) during calibrator training. Trained on an in-distribution validation set and tested with isolated, individual test samples, our method achieves competitive calibration performance on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution test sets compared with the state of the art. Further, our analysis points out the difference between our method and commonly used objectives such as CE loss and mean square error loss, where the latters sometimes deviates from the calibration aim.

    "abstract": "Enabling Large Language Models (LLMs) to interact with 3D environments is challenging. Existing approaches extract point clouds either from ground truth (GT) geometry or 3D scenes reconstructed by auxiliary models. Text-image aligned 2D features from CLIP are then lifted to point clouds, which serve as inputs for LLMs. However, this solution lacks the establishment of 3D point-to-point connections, leading to a deficiency of spatial structure information. Concurrently, the absence of integration and unification between the geometric and semantic representations of the scene culminates in a diminished level of 3D scene understanding. In this paper, we demonstrate the importance of having a unified scene representation and reconstruction framework, which is essential for LLMs in 3D scenes. Specifically, we introduce Uni3DR^2 extracts 3D geometric and semantic aware representation features via the frozen pre-trained 2D foundation models (e.g., CLIP and SAM) and a multi-scale aggregate 3D decoder. Our learned 3D representations not only contribute to the reconstruction process but also provide valuable knowledge for LLMs. Experimental results validate that our Uni3DR^2 yields convincing gains over the baseline on the 3D reconstruction dataset ScanNet (increasing F-Score by +1.8\\%). When applied to LLMs, our Uni3DR^2-LLM exhibits superior performance over the baseline on the 3D vision-language understanding dataset ScanQA (increasing BLEU-1 by +4.0\\% and +4.2\\% on the val set and test set, respectively).

    "abstract": "This study explored the application of portable X-ray fluorescence (PXRF) spectrometry and soil image analysis to rapidly assess soil fertility, focusing on critical parameters such as available B, organic carbon (OC), available Mn, available S, and the sulfur availability index (SAI). Analyzing 1,133 soil samples from various agro-climatic zones in Eastern India, the research combined color and texture features from microscopic soil images, PXRF data, and auxiliary soil variables (AVs) using a Random Forest model. Results indicated that integrating image features (IFs) with auxiliary variables (AVs) significantly enhanced prediction accuracy for available B (R^2 = 0.80) and OC (R^2 = 0.88). A data fusion approach, incorporating IFs, AVs, and PXRF data, further improved predictions for available Mn and SAI with R^2 values of 0.72 and 0.70, respectively. The study demonstrated how these integrated technologies have the potential to provide quick and affordable options for soil testing, opening up access to more sophisticated prediction models and a better comprehension of the fertility and health of the soil. Future research should focus on the application of deep learning models on a larger dataset of soil images, developed using soils from a broader range of agro-climatic zones under field condition. ",

As such, it is crucial that high quality models are developed to assist in overcoming these obstacles. In this work, we take an entirely data driven approach to learn such a model. In particular, we use historical data from the DIII-D tokamak to train a deep recurrent network that is able to predict the full time evolution of plasma discharges (or \"shots\"). Following this, we investigate how different training and inference procedures affect the quality and calibration of the shot predictions. ",

    "abstract": "Simulation-based methods for making statistical inference have evolved dramatically over the past 50 years, keeping pace with technological advancements. The field is undergoing a new revolution as it embraces the representational capacity of neural networks, optimisation libraries, and graphics processing units for learning complex mappings between data and inferential targets. The resulting tools are amortised, in the sense that they allow inference to be made quickly through fast feedforward operations. In this article we review recent progress made in the context of point estimation, approximate Bayesian inference, the automatic construction of summary statistics, and likelihood approximation. The review also covers available software, and includes a simple illustration to showcase the wide array of tools available for amortised inference and the benefits they offer over state-of-the-art Markov chain Monte Carlo methods. The article concludes with an overview of relevant topics and an outlook on future research directions. ",

    "abstract": "Quantum key distribution (QKD) and quantum message encryption protocols promise a secure way to distribute information while detecting eavesdropping. However, current protocols may suffer from significantly reduced eavesdropping protection when only a subset of qubits are observed by an attacker. In this paper, we present two quantum cryptographic protocols leveraging the quantum Fourier transform (QFT) and show their higher effectiveness even when an attacker measures only a subset of the transmitted qubits. The foremost of these protocols is a novel QKD method that leverages this effectiveness of the QFT while being more practical than previously proposed QFT-based protocols, most notably by not relying on quantum memory. We additionally show how existing quantum encryption methods can be augmented with a QFT-based approach to improve eavesdropping detection. Finally, we provide equations to analyze different QFT-based detection schemes within these protocols so that protocol designers can make custom schemes for their purpose. ",

In this work, we propose a quantum convolutional neural network (QCNN) for multi-class classification of classical data. The model is implemented using PennyLane. The optimization process is conducted by minimizing the cross-entropy loss through parameterized quantum circuit optimization. The QCNN is tested on the MNIST dataset with 4, 6, 8 and 10 classes. The results show that with 4 classes, the performance is slightly lower compared to the classical CNN, while with a higher number of classes, the QCNN outperforms the classical neural network. ",

    "abstract": "Conventional diffusion models typically relies on a fixed forward process, which implicitly defines complex marginal distributions over latent variables. This can often complicate the reverse process' task in learning generative trajectories, and results in costly inference for diffusion models. To address these limitations, we introduce Neural Flow Diffusion Models (NFDM), a novel framework that enhances diffusion models by supporting a broader range of forward processes beyond the fixed linear Gaussian. We also propose a novel parameterization technique for learning the forward process. Our framework provides an end-to-end, simulation-free optimization objective, effectively minimizing a variational upper bound on the negative log-likelihood. Experimental results demonstrate NFDM's strong performance, evidenced by state-of-the-art likelihood estimation. Furthermore, we investigate NFDM's capacity for learning generative dynamics with specific characteristics, such as deterministic straight lines trajectories. This exploration underscores NFDM's versatility and its potential for a wide range of applications. ",

    "abstract": "Despite the advancement of deep learning-based computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) methods for pneumonia from adult chest x-ray (CXR) images, the performance of CAD methods applied to pediatric images remains suboptimal, mainly due to the lack of large-scale annotated pediatric imaging datasets. Establishing a proper framework to leverage existing adult large-scale CXR datasets can thus enhance pediatric pneumonia detection performance. In this paper, we propose a three-branch parallel path learning-based framework that utilizes both adult and pediatric datasets to improve the performance of deep learning models on pediatric test datasets. The paths are trained with pediatric only, adult only, and both types of CXRs, respectively. Our proposed framework utilizes the multi-positive contrastive loss to cluster the classwise embeddings and the embedding similarity loss among these three parallel paths to make the classwise embeddings as close as possible to reduce the effect of domain shift. Experimental evaluations on open-access adult and pediatric CXR datasets show that the proposed method achieves a superior AUROC score of 0.8464 compared to 0.8348 obtained using the conventional approach of join training on both datasets. The proposed approach thus paves the way for generalized CAD models that are effective for both adult and pediatric age groups. ",
