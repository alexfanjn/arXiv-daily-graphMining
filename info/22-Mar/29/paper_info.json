    "title": "A Stitch in Time Saves Nine: A Train-Time Regularizing Loss for Improved  Neural Network Calibration",
    "abstract": "Deep Neural Networks ( DNN s) are known to make overconfident mistakes, which makes their use problematic in safety-critical applications. State-of-the-art ( SOTA ) calibration techniques improve on the confidence of predicted labels alone and leave the confidence of non-max classes (e.g. top-2, top-5) uncalibrated. Such calibration is not suitable for label refinement using post-processing. Further, most SOTA techniques learn a few hyper-parameters post-hoc, leaving out the scope for image, or pixel specific calibration. This makes them unsuitable for calibration under domain shift, or for dense prediction tasks like semantic segmentation. In this paper, we argue for intervening at the train time itself, so as to directly produce calibrated DNN models. We propose a novel auxiliary loss function: Multi-class Difference in Confidence and Accuracy ( MDCA ), to achieve the same MDCA can be used in conjunction with other application/task-specific loss functions. We show that training with MDCA leads to better-calibrated models in terms of Expected Calibration Error ( ECE ), and Static Calibration Error ( SCE ) on image classification, and segmentation tasks. We report ECE ( SCE ) score of 0.72 (1.60) on the CIFAR 100 dataset, in comparison to 1.90 (1.71) by the SOTA. Under domain shift, a ResNet-18 model trained on PACS dataset using MDCA gives an average ECE ( SCE ) score of 19.7 (9.7) across all domains, compared to 24.2 (11.8) by the SOTA. For the segmentation task, we report a 2X reduction in calibration error on PASCAL - VOC dataset in comparison to Focal Loss. Finally, MDCA training improves calibration even on imbalanced data, and for natural language classification tasks. We have released the code here: code is available at https://github.com/mdca-loss ",

However, not all of the training data are equally useful to the model. Curriculum training aims to present the data to the NMT models in a meaningful order. In this work, we introduce a two-stage curriculum training framework for NMT where we fine-tune a base NMT model on subsets of data, selected by both deterministic scoring using pre-trained methods and online scoring that considers prediction scores of the emerging NMT model. Through comprehensive experiments on six language pairs comprising low- and high-resource languages from WMT'21, we have shown that our curriculum strategies consistently demonstrate better quality (up to +2.2 BLEU improvement) and faster convergence (approximately 50% fewer updates).

    "abstract": "Unsupervised semantic segmentation requires assigning a label to every pixel without any human annotations. Despite recent advances in self-supervised representation learning for individual images, unsupervised semantic segmentation with pixel-level representations is still a challenging task and remains underexplored. In this work, we propose a self-supervised pixel representation learning method for semantic segmentation by using visual concepts (i.e., groups of pixels with semantic meanings, such as parts, objects, and scenes) extracted from images. To guide self-supervised learning, we leverage three types of relationships between pixels and concepts, including the relationships between pixels and local concepts, local and global concepts, as well as the co-occurrence of concepts. We evaluate the learned pixel embeddings and visual concepts on three datasets, including PASCAL VOC 2012, COCO 2017, and DAVIS 2017. Our results show that the proposed method gains consistent and substantial improvements over recent unsupervised semantic segmentation approaches, and also demonstrate that visual concepts can reveal insights into image datasets.

    "abstract": "Repair operators are often used for constraint handling in constrained combinatorial optimization. We investigate the (1+1) EA equipped with a tailored jump-and-repair operation that can be used to probabilistically repair infeasible offspring in graph problems. Instead of evolving candidate solutions to the entire graph, we expand the genotype to allow the (1+1) EA to develop in parallel a feasible solution together with a growing subset of the instance (an induced subgraph). With this approach, we prove that the EA is able to probabilistically simulate an iterative compression process used in classical fixed-parameter algorithmics to obtain a randomized FPT performance guarantee on three NP-hard graph problems. For $k$-VertexCover, we prove that the (1+1) EA using focused jump-and-repair can find a $k$-cover (if one exists) in $O(2^k n^2\\log n)$ iterations in expectation. This leads to an exponential (in $k$) improvement over the best-known parameterized bound for evolutionary algorithms on VertexCover. For the $k$-FeedbackVertexSet problem in tournaments, we prove that the EA finds a feasible feedback set in $O(2^kk!n^2\\log n)$ iterations in expectation, and for OddCycleTransversal, we prove the optimization time for the EA is $O(3^k k m n^2\\log n)$. For the latter two problems, this constitutes the first parameterized result for any evolutionary algorithm. We discuss how to generalize the framework to other parameterized graph problems closed under induced subgraphs and report experimental results that illustrate the behavior of the algorithm on a concrete instance class.

Recently, hypernetwork-based approaches have been studied in the context of continuous and finetune-free iFSD with limited success. We take a closer look at important design choices of such methods, leading to several key improvements and resulting in a more accurate and flexible framework, which we call Sylph. In particular, we demonstrate the effectiveness of decoupling object classification from localization by leveraging a base detector that is pretrained for class-agnostic localization on large-scale dataset. Contrary to what previous results have suggested, we show that with a carefully designed class-conditional hypernetwork, finetune-free iFSD can be highly effective, especially when a large number of base categories with abundant data are available for meta-training, almost approaching alternatives that undergo test-time-training. This result is even more significant considering its many practical advantages: (1) incrementally learning new classes in sequence without additional training, (2) detecting both novel and seen classes in a single pass, and (3) no forgetting of previously seen classes. We benchmark our model on both COCO and LVIS, reporting as high as $17\\%$ AP on the long-tail rare classes on LVIS, indicating the promise of hypernetwork-based iFSD. ",

    "abstract": "Within clinical, biomedical, and translational science, an increasing number of projects are adopting graphs for knowledge representation. Graph-based data models elucidate the interconnectedness between core biomedical concepts, enable data structures to be easily updated, and support intuitive queries, visualizations, and inference algorithms. However, knowledge discovery across these \"knowledge graphs\" (KGs) has remained difficult. Data set heterogeneity and complexity; the proliferation of ad hoc data formats; poor compliance with guidelines on findability, accessibility, interoperability, and reusability; and, in particular, the lack of a universally-accepted, open-access model for standardization across biomedical KGs has left the task of reconciling data sources to downstream consumers. Biolink Model is an open source data model that can be used to formalize the relationships between data structures in translational science. It incorporates object-oriented classification and graph-oriented features. The core of the model is a set of hierarchical, interconnected classes (or categories) and relationships between them (or predicates), representing biomedical entities such as gene, disease, chemical, anatomical structure, and phenotype. The model provides class and edge attributes and associations that guide how entities should relate to one another. Here, we highlight the need for a standardized data model for KGs, describe Biolink Model, and compare it with other models. We demonstrate the utility of Biolink Model in various initiatives, including the Biomedical Data Translator Consortium and the Monarch Initiative, and show how it has supported easier integration and interoperability of biomedical KGs, bringing together knowledge from multiple sources and helping to realize the goals of translational science.

Such require basic understanding and sufficient trust by the users. This motivated the research field of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI), i.e. finding methods for opening the \"black-boxes\" DNNs represent. For the computer vision domain in specific, practical assessment of DNNs requires a globally valid association of human interpretable concepts with internals of the model. The research field of concept (embedding) analysis (CA) tackles this problem: CA aims to find global, assessable associations of humanly interpretable semantic concepts (e.g., eye, bearded) with internal representations of a DNN. This work establishes a general definition of CA and a taxonomy for CA methods, uniting several ideas from literature. That allows to easily position and compare CA approaches. Guided by the defined notions, the current state-of-the-art research regarding CA methods and interesting applications are reviewed. More than thirty relevant methods are discussed, compared, and categorized. Finally, for practitioners, a survey of fifteen datasets is provided that have been used for supervised concept analysis. Open challenges and research directions are pointed out at the end. ",

They either operate on $k$-order tensors or consider all $k$-node subgraphs, implying an exponential dependence on $k$ in memory requirements, and do not adapt to the sparsity of the graph. By introducing new heuristics for the graph isomorphism problem, we devise a class of universal, permutation-equivariant graph networks, which, unlike previous architectures, offer a fine-grained control between expressivity and scalability and adapt to the sparsity of the graph. These architectures lead to vastly reduced computation times compared to standard higher-order graph networks in the supervised node- and graph-level classification and regression regime while significantly improving over standard graph neural network and graph kernel architectures in terms of predictive performance.

We observe that changes in these features are associated with factors such as Covid-19 restrictions and population size. In general, events in early 2020 (when initial Covid-19 restrictions were implemented) induced more intense changes in network features, whereas later events had a less notable impact in network features.

    "abstract": "In view of the performance limitations of fully-decoupled designs for neural architectures and accelerators, hardware-software co-design has been emerging to fully reap the benefits of flexible design spaces and optimize neural network performance. Nonetheless, such co-design also enlarges the total search space to practically infinity and presents substantial challenges. While the prior studies have been focusing on improving the search efficiency (e.g., via reinforcement learning), they commonly rely on co-searches over the entire architecture-accelerator design space. In this paper, we propose a \\emph{semi}-decoupled approach to reduce the size of the total design space by orders of magnitude, yet without losing optimality. We first perform neural architecture search to obtain a small set of optimal architectures for one accelerator candidate. Importantly, this is also the set of (close-to-)optimal architectures for other accelerator designs based on the property that neural architectures' ranking orders in terms of inference latency and energy consumption on different accelerator designs are highly similar. Then, instead of considering all the possible architectures, we optimize the accelerator design only in combination with this small set of architectures, thus significantly reducing the total search cost. We validate our approach by conducting experiments on various architecture spaces for accelerator designs with different dataflows. Our results highlight that we can obtain the optimal design by only navigating over the reduced search space. The source code of this work is at \\url{https://github.com/Ren-Research/CoDesign}. ",

In the cyber domain, long range detection requires the analysis of significant network traffic from a variety of observatories and outposts.

GraphBLAS is ideally suited for both constructing and analyzing anonymized hypersparse traffic matrices. The performance of GraphBLAS on an Accolade Technologies edge network device is demonstrated on a near worse case traffic scenario using a continuous stream of CAIDA Telescope darknet packets. The performance for varying numbers of traffic buffers, threads, and processor cores is explored. Anonymized hypersparse traffic matrices can be constructed at a rate of over 50,000,000 packets per second; exceeding a typical 400 Gigabit network link. This performance demonstrates that anonymized hypersparse traffic matrices are readily computable on edge network devices with minimal compute resources and can be a viable data product for such devices.

Two datasets of homogenized elasticity tensors of lattice materials are presented as examples, where it is desired to obtain models that map unit cell geometric and material parameters to their homogenized stiffness. Fitting a model to SPD data does not guarantee the model's predictions will remain SPD. Existing Cholsesky factorization and Eigendecomposition schemes are abstracted in this work as transformation layers which enforce the SPD condition. These layers can be included in many popular machine learning models to enforce SPD behavior. This work investigates the effects that different positivity functions have on the layers and how their inclusion affects model accuracy. Commonly used models are considered, including polynomials, radial basis functions, and neural networks. Ultimately it is shown that a single SPD layer improves the model's average prediction accuracy. ",

In this paper, we reveal and address the disadvantages of the conventional query-driven HOI detectors from the two aspects. For the association, previous two-branch methods suffer from complex and costly post-matching, while single-branch methods ignore the features distinction in different tasks. We propose Guided-Embedding Network~(GEN) to attain a two-branch pipeline without post-matching. In GEN, we design an instance decoder to detect humans and objects with two independent query sets and a position Guided Embedding~(p-GE) to mark the human and object in the same position as a pair. Besides, we design an interaction decoder to classify interactions, where the interaction queries are made of instance Guided Embeddings (i-GE) generated from the outputs of each instance decoder layer. For the interaction understanding, previous methods suffer from long-tailed distribution and zero-shot discovery. This paper proposes a Visual-Linguistic Knowledge Transfer (VLKT) training strategy to enhance interaction understanding by transferring knowledge from a visual-linguistic pre-trained model CLIP. In specific, we extract text embeddings for all labels with CLIP to initialize the classifier and adopt a mimic loss to minimize the visual feature distance between GEN and CLIP. As a result, GEN-VLKT outperforms the state of the art by large margins on multiple datasets, e.g., +5.05 mAP on HICO-Det. The source codes are available at https://github.com/YueLiao/gen-vlkt. ",

However, the tuning of gains for quadrotor flight controllers can be laborious, and accurately stable control of trajectories can be difficult to maintain under exogenous disturbances and uncertain system parameters. This paper introduces a novel robust and adaptive control synthesis methodology for a quadrotor robot's attitude and altitude stabilization. The developed method is based on the fuzzy reinforcement learning and Strictly Negative Imaginary (SNI) property. The first stage of our control approach is to transform a nonlinear quadrotor system into an equivalent Negative-Imaginary (NI) linear model by means of the feedback linearization (FL) technique. The second phase is to design a control scheme that adapts online the Strictly Negative Imaginary (SNI) controller gains via fuzzy Q-learning, inspired by biological learning. The proposed controller does not require any prior training. The performance of the designed controller is compared with that of a fixed-gain SNI controller, a fuzzy-SNI controller, and a conventional PID controller in a series of numerical simulations. Furthermore, the stability of the proposed controller and the adaptive laws are proofed using the NI theorem. ",

    "abstract": "Embedding methods have demonstrated robust performance on the task of link prediction in knowledge graphs, by mostly encoding entity relationships. Recent methods propose to enhance the loss function with a literal-aware term. In this paper, we propose KGA: a knowledge graph augmentation method that incorporates literals in an embedding model without modifying its loss function. KGA discretizes quantity and year values into bins, and chains these bins both horizontally, modeling neighboring values, and vertically, modeling multiple levels of granularity. KGA is scalable and can be used as a pre-processing step for any existing knowledge graph embedding model. Experiments on legacy benchmarks and a new large benchmark, DWD, show that augmenting the knowledge graph with quantities and years is beneficial for predicting both entities and numbers, as KGA outperforms the vanilla models and other relevant baselines. Our ablation studies confirm that both quantities and years contribute to KGA's performance, and that its performance depends on the discretization and binning settings. We make the code, models, and the DWD benchmark publicly available to facilitate reproducibility and future research. ",

    "abstract": "Due to the potentially severe consequences of coordinated cyber-physical attacks (CCPA), the design of defenses has gained significant attention. A popular approach is to eliminate the existence of attacks by either securing existing sensors or deploying secured PMUs. In this work, we improve this approach by lowering the defense target from eliminating attacks to preventing outages and reducing the required number of PMUs. To this end, we formulate the problem of PMU Placement for Outage Prevention (PPOP) under DC power flow model as a tri-level non-linear optimization problem and transform it into a bi-level mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) problem. Then, we propose an alternating optimization framework to solve PPOP by iteratively adding constraints, for which we develop two constraint generation algorithms. In addition, for large-scale grids, we propose a polynomial-time heuristic algorithm to obtain suboptimal solutions. Next, we extend our solution to achieve the defense goal under AC power flow model. Finally, we evaluate our algorithm on IEEE 30-bus, 57-bus, 118-bus, and 300-bus systems, which demonstrates the potential of the proposed approach in greatly reducing the required number of PMUs. ",

    "abstract": "Nowadays, airport detection in remote sensing images has attracted considerable attention due to its strategic role in civilian and military scopes. In particular, uncrewed and operated aerial vehicles must immediately detect safe areas to land in emergencies. The previous schemes suffered from various aspects, including complicated backgrounds, scales, and shapes of the airport. Meanwhile, the rapid action and accuracy of the method are confronted with significant concerns. Hence, this study proposes an effective scheme by extending YOLOV3 and ShearLet transform. In this way, MobileNet and ResNet18, with fewer layers and parameters retrained on a similar dataset, are parallelly trained as base networks. According to airport geometrical characteristics, the ShearLet filters with different scales and directions are considered in the first convolution layers of ResNet18 as a visual attention mechanism. Besides, the major extended in YOLOV3 concerns the detection Sub-Networks with novel structures which boost object expression ability and training efficiency. In addition, novel augmentation and negative mining strategies are presented to significantly increase the localization phase's performance. The experimental results on the DIOR dataset reveal that the framework reliably detects different types of airports in a varied area and acquires robust results in complex scenes compared to traditional YOLOV3 and state-of-the-art schemes.

However, although various DL-based methods have been introduced, most of them only focus on the transformations of network structure, neglecting the importance of other influential factors including data augmentation. Obviously, DL-based models require a large amount of training data in order to estimate parameters well and achieve high performances, which leads to the early efforts to increase the training data through data augmentation in computer vision and speech domains. In this paper, we seek to figure out that various data augmentation strategies can improve the performance of sequential recommender systems, especially when the training dataset is not large enough. To this end, we propose a simple set of data augmentation strategies, all of which transform original item sequences in the way of direct corruption and describe how data augmentation changes the performance. Extensive experiments on the latest DL-based model show that applying data augmentation can help the model generalize better, and it can be significantly effective to boost model performances especially when the amount of training data is small. Furthermore, it is shown that our proposed strategies can improve performances to a better or competitive level to existing strategies suggested in the prior works. ",

We hereby proposed contrastive functional connectivity graph learning for population-based fMRI classification. Representations on the functional connectivity graphs are \"repelled\" for heterogeneous patient pairs meanwhile homogeneous pairs \"attract\" each other.

    "abstract": "Facial expression recognition (FER) is still one challenging research due to the small inter-class discrepancy in the facial expression data. In view of the significance of facial crucial regions for FER, many existing researches utilize the prior information from some annotated crucial points to improve the performance of FER. However, it is complicated and time-consuming to manually annotate facial crucial points, especially for vast wild expression images. Based on this, a local non-local joint network is proposed to adaptively light up the facial crucial regions in feature learning of FER in this paper. In the proposed method, two parts are constructed based on facial local and non-local information respectively, where an ensemble of multiple local networks are proposed to extract local features corresponding to multiple facial local regions and a non-local attention network is addressed to explore the significance of each local region. Especially, the attention weights obtained by the non-local network is fed into the local part to achieve the interactive feedback between the facial global and local information. Interestingly, the non-local weights corresponding to local regions are gradually updated and higher weights are given to more crucial regions. Moreover, U-Net is employed to extract the integrated features of deep semantic information and low hierarchical detail information of expression images. Finally, experimental results illustrate that the proposed method achieves more competitive performance compared with several state-of-the art methods on five benchmark datasets. Noticeably, the analyses of the non-local weights corresponding to local regions demonstrate that the proposed method can automatically enhance some crucial regions in the process of feature learning without any facial landmark information.

Recent studies however show that neural networks (both shallow and deep) may be easily fooled by certain imperceptibly perturbed input samples called adversarial examples. Such security vulnerability has resulted in a large body of research in recent years because real-world threats could be introduced due to vast applications of neural networks. To address the robustness issue to adversarial examples particularly in pattern recognition, robust adversarial training has become one mainstream. Various ideas, methods, and applications have boomed in the field. Yet, a deep understanding of adversarial training including characteristics, interpretations, theories, and connections among different models has still remained elusive. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey trying to offer a systematic and structured investigation on robust adversarial training in pattern recognition. We start with fundamentals including definition, notations, and properties of adversarial examples. We then introduce a unified theoretical framework for defending against adversarial samples - robust adversarial training with visualizations and interpretations on why adversarial training can lead to model robustness. Connections will be also established between adversarial training and other traditional learning theories. After that, we summarize, review, and discuss various methodologies with adversarial attack and defense/training algorithms in a structured way. Finally, we present analysis, outlook, and remarks of adversarial training. ",

    "abstract": "Deep Implicit Function (DIF) has gained popularity as an efficient 3D shape representation. To capture geometry details, current methods usually learn DIF using local latent codes, which discretize the space into a regular 3D grid (or octree) and store local codes in grid points (or octree nodes). Given a query point, the local feature is computed by interpolating its neighboring local codes with their positions. However, the local codes are constrained at discrete and regular positions like grid points, which makes the code positions difficult to be optimized and limits their representation ability. To solve this problem, we propose to learn DIF with Dynamic Code Cloud, named DCC-DIF. Our method explicitly associates local codes with learnable position vectors, and the position vectors are continuous and can be dynamically optimized, which improves the representation ability. In addition, we propose a novel code position loss to optimize the code positions, which heuristically guides more local codes to be distributed around complex geometric details. In contrast to previous methods, our DCC-DIF represents 3D shapes more efficiently with a small amount of local codes, and improves the reconstruction quality. Experiments demonstrate that DCC-DIF achieves better performance over previous methods. Code and data are available at https://github.com/lity20/DCCDIF. ",

    "abstract": "Vehicular edge computing (VEC) is emerging as a promising architecture of vehicular networks (VNs) by deploying the cloud computing resources at the edge of the VNs. This work aims to optimize resource allocation and task offloading in VEC networks. Specifically, we formulate a game theoretical resource allocation and task offloading problem (GTRATOP) that aims to maximize the system performance by jointly considering the incentive for cooperation, competition among vehicles, heterogeneity between VEC servers and vehicles, and inherent dynamic of VNs. Since the formulated GTRATOP is NP-hard, we propose an adaptive approach for resource allocation and task offloading in VEC networks by incorporating bargaining game and matching game, which is called BARGAIN-MATCH. First, for resource allocation, a bargaining game-based incentive is proposed to stimulate the vehicles and VEC servers to negotiate the optimal resource allocation and pricing decisions. Second, for task offloading, a many-to-one matching scheme is proposed to decide the optimal offloading strategies. Third, the dynamic and time-varying features are considered to adapt the strategies of BARGAIN-MATCH to the real-time VEC networks. Moreover, the BARGAIN-MATCH is proved to be stable and weak Pareto optimal. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed BARGAIN-MATCH achieves superior system performance and efficiency compared to other methods, especially when the system workload is heavy. ",

In this work, we focus on exploiting the high-precision and non-differentiable physics simulator to incorporate dynamical constraints in motion capture. Our key-idea is to use real physical supervisions to train a target pose distribution prior for sampling-based motion control to capture physically plausible human motion. To obtain accurate reference motion with terrain interactions for the sampling, we first introduce an interaction constraint based on SDF (Signed Distance Field) to enforce appropriate ground contact modeling. We then design a novel two-branch decoder to avoid stochastic error from pseudo ground-truth and train a distribution prior with the non-differentiable physics simulator. Finally, we regress the sampling distribution from the current state of the physical character with the trained prior and sample satisfied target poses to track the estimated reference motion. Qualitative and quantitative results show that we can obtain physically plausible human motion with complex terrain interactions, human shape variations, and diverse behaviors.

However, previous studies have focused only on a single aspect of crime, ignoring the complex interplay between the various characteristics, which must be considered in an analysis to understand the dynamics underlying criminal activities. In this study, we examined 12 features that have been identified as correlates of crime rates using state-level statistics from the USA. We found that the correlates of misdemeanors and felonies differ. The number of misdemeanors is strongly associated with the police precinct, whereas felony rates are strongly correlated with gun possession and happiness.

MH-Aug produces a sequence of augmented graphs from the target distribution enables flexible control of the strength and diversity of augmentation. Since the direct sampling from the complex target distribution is challenging, we adopt the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm to obtain the augmented samples.

Previous methods usually take the common aid from auto-encoders to establish the self-supervision by reconstructing the input itself. However, the existing self-reconstruction based auto-encoders merely focus on the global shapes, and ignore the hierarchical context between the local and global geometries, which is a crucial supervision for 3D representation learning. To resolve this issue, we present a novel self-supervised point cloud representation learning framework, named 3D Occlusion Auto-Encoder (3D-OAE). Our key idea is to randomly occlude some local patches of the input point cloud and establish the supervision via recovering the occluded patches using the remaining visible ones. Specifically, we design an encoder for learning the features of visible local patches, and a decoder for leveraging these features to predict the occluded patches. In contrast with previous methods, our 3D-OAE can remove a large proportion of patches and predict them only with a small number of visible patches, which enable us to significantly accelerate training and yield a nontrivial self-supervisory performance. The trained encoder can be further transferred to various downstream tasks.

However, applying FL in practice is challenging due to the local devices' heterogeneous energy, wireless channel conditions, and non-independently and identically distributed (non-IID) data distributions. To cope with these issues, this paper proposes a novel learning framework by integrating FL and width-adjustable slimmable neural networks (SNN). Integrating FL with SNNs is challenging due to time-varing channel conditions and data distributions. In addition, existing multi-width SNN training algorithms are sensitive to the data distributions across devices, which makes SNN ill-suited for FL. Motivated by this, we propose a communication and energy-efficient SNN-based FL (named SlimFL) that jointly utilizes superposition coding (SC) for global model aggregation and superposition training (ST) for updating local models. By applying SC, SlimFL exchanges the superposition of multiple width configurations decoded as many times as possible for a given communication throughput. Leveraging ST, SlimFL aligns the forward propagation of different width configurations while avoiding inter-width interference during backpropagation. We formally prove the convergence of SlimFL. The result reveals that SlimFL is not only communication-efficient but also deals with the non-IID data distributions and poor channel conditions, which is also corroborated by data-intensive simulations.

Firstly, a method of maximizing sum rate (Max-SR) is proposed to jointly optimize the PA factors of user U1, user U2 and relay station (RS). To further improve the sum rate performance, two high-performance schemes, namely maximizing minimum sum rate (Max-Min-SR) and maximizing sum rate with rate constraint (Max-SR-RC), are presented. Simulation results show that the proposed three methods outperform the equal power allocation (EPA) method in terms of sum rate performance. In particular, the highest performance gain achieved by Max-SR-RC method is up to 45.2% over EPA. Furthermore, it is verified that the total power and random shadow variable X{\\sigma} have a substantial impact on the sum rate performance. ",

    "abstract": "The behavior of no-regret learning algorithms is well understood in two-player min-max (i.e, zero-sum) games. In this paper, we investigate the behavior of no-regret learning in min-max games with dependent strategy sets, where the strategy of the first player constrains the behavior of the second. Such games are best understood as sequential, i.e., min-max Stackelberg, games. We consider two settings, one in which only the first player chooses their actions using a no-regret algorithm while the second player best responds, and one in which both players use no-regret algorithms. For the former case, we show that no-regret dynamics converge to a Stackelberg equilibrium. For the latter case, we introduce a new type of regret, which we call Lagrangian regret, and show that if both players minimize their Lagrangian regrets, then play converges to a Stackelberg equilibrium. We then observe that online mirror descent (OMD) dynamics in these two settings correspond respectively to a known nested (i.e., sequential) gradient descent-ascent (GDA) algorithm and a new simultaneous GDA-like algorithm, thereby establishing convergence of these algorithms to Stackelberg equilibrium. Finally, we analyze the robustness of OMD dynamics to perturbations by investigating online min-max Stackelberg games. We prove that OMD dynamics are robust for a large class of online min-max games with independent strategy sets. In the dependent case, we demonstrate the robustness of OMD dynamics experimentally by simulating them in online Fisher markets, a canonical example of a min-max Stackelberg game with dependent strategy sets.

Low cost, simple accessibility via social platforms, and a plethora of low-budget online news sources are some of the factors that contribute to the spread of false news. Most of the existing fake news detection algorithms are solely focused on the news content only but engaged users prior posts or social activities provide a wealth of information about their views on news and have significant ability to improve fake news identification. Graph Neural Networks are a form of deep learning approach that conducts prediction on graph-described data. Social media platforms are followed graph structure in their representation, Graph Neural Network are special types of neural networks that could be usually applied to graphs, making it much easier to execute edge, node, and graph-level prediction. Therefore, in this paper, we present a comparative analysis among some commonly used machine learning algorithms and Graph Neural Networks for detecting the spread of false news on social media platforms. In this study, we take the UPFD dataset and implement several existing machine learning algorithms on text data only. Besides this, we create different GNN layers for fusing graph-structured news propagation data and the text data as the node feature in our GNN models.

    "abstract": "The robustness of deep neural networks has received significant interest recently, especially when being deployed in safety-critical systems, as it is important to analyze how sensitive the model output is under input perturbations. While most previous works focused on the local robustness property around an input sample, the studies of the global robustness property, which bounds the maximum output change under perturbations over the entire input space, are still lacking. In this work, we formulate the global robustness certification for neural networks with ReLU activation functions as a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) problem, and present an efficient approach to address it. Our approach includes a novel interleaving twin-network encoding scheme, where two copies of the neural network are encoded side-by-side with extra interleaving dependencies added between them, and an over-approximation algorithm leveraging relaxation and refinement techniques to reduce complexity. Experiments demonstrate the timing efficiency of our work when compared with previous global robustness certification methods and the tightness of our over-approximation. A case study of closed-loop control safety verification is conducted, and demonstrates the importance and practicality of our approach for certifying the global robustness of neural networks in safety-critical systems.

    "abstract": "It has been well recognized that neural network based image classifiers are easily fooled by images with tiny perturbations crafted by an adversary. There has been a vast volume of research to generate and defend such adversarial attacks. However, the following problem is left unexplored: How to reverse-engineer adversarial perturbations from an adversarial image? This leads to a new adversarial learning paradigm--Reverse Engineering of Deceptions (RED). If successful, RED allows us to estimate adversarial perturbations and recover the original images. However, carefully crafted, tiny adversarial perturbations are difficult to recover by optimizing a unilateral RED objective. For example, the pure image denoising method may overfit to minimizing the reconstruction error but hardly preserve the classification properties of the true adversarial perturbations. To tackle this challenge, we formalize the RED problem and identify a set of principles crucial to the RED approach design. Particularly, we find that prediction alignment and proper data augmentation (in terms of spatial transformations) are two criteria to achieve a generalizable RED approach. By integrating these RED principles with image denoising, we propose a new Class-Discriminative Denoising based RED framework, termed CDD-RED. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of CDD-RED under different evaluation metrics (ranging from the pixel-level, prediction-level to the attribution-level alignment) and a variety of attack generation methods (e.g., FGSM, PGD, CW, AutoAttack, and adaptive attacks).

In this paper, we investigate a multi-user communication system assisted by cooperative IRS devices with the capability of energy harvesting. Aiming to maximize the long-term average achievable system rate, an optimization problem is formulated by jointly designing the transmit beamforming at the base station (BS) and discrete phase shift beamforming at the IRSs, with the constraints on transmit power, user data rate requirement and IRS energy buffer size. Considering time-varying channels and stochastic arrivals of energy harvested by the IRSs, we first formulate the problem as a Markov decision process (MDP) and then develop a novel multi-agent Q-mix (MAQ) framework with two layers to decouple the optimization parameters. The higher layer is for optimizing phase shift resolutions, and the lower one is for phase shift beamforming and power allocation. Since the phase shift optimization is an integer programming problem with a large-scale action space, we improve MAQ by incorporating the Wolpertinger method, namely, MAQ-WP algorithm to achieve a sub-optimality with reduced dimensions of action space. In addition, as MAQ-WP is still of high complexity to achieve good performance, we propose a policy gradient-based MAQ algorithm, namely, MAQ-PG, by mapping the discrete phase shift actions into a continuous space at the cost of a slight performance loss. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed MAQ-WP and MAQ-PG algorithms can converge faster and achieve data rate improvements of 10.7% and 8.8% over the conventional multi-agent DDPG, respectively.

Because the gradients calculated according to the losses of the noisy samples cause the optimization process to go in the wrong direction. In this paper, as an alternative to SGD, we recommend using samples with loss less than a threshold value determined during the optimization process, instead of using all samples in the mini-batch. Our proposed method, Adaptive-k, aims to exclude label noise samples from the optimization process and make the process robust. On noisy datasets, we found that using a threshold-based approach, such as Adaptive-k, produces better results than using all samples or a fixed number of low-loss samples in the mini-batch. Based on our theoretical analysis and experimental results, we show that the Adaptive-k method is closest to the performance of the oracle, in which noisy samples are entirely removed from the dataset. Adaptive-k is a simple but effective method. It does not require prior knowledge of the noise ratio of the dataset, does not require additional model training, and does not increase training time significantly.

Massive amounts of data will be collected by various mobile and fixed terminals that will need to be processed in order to extract knowledge from the data. Traditionally, a centralized approach is taken for processing the collected data using large data centers connected to a core network. However, due to the scale of the Internet-connected things, transporting raw data all the way to the core network is costly in terms of the power consumption, delay, and privacy. This has compelled researchers to propose different decentralized computing paradigms such as fog computing to process collected data at the network edge close to the terminals and users. In this paper, we study, in a Passive Optical Network (PON)-based collaborative-fog computing system, the impact of the heterogeneity of the fog units capacity and energy-efficiency on the overall energy-efficiency of the fog system. We optimized the virtual machine (VM) placement in this fog system with three fog cells and formulated the problem as a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) optimization model with the objective of minimizing the networking and processing power consumption of the fog system. The results indicate that in our proposed architecture, the processing power consumption is the crucial element to achieve energy efficient VMs placement. ",

Importantly, we interpret the prediction accuracy results with respect to the inherent variability of modal splits and travelers' aggregate responsiveness to changes in travel time. By visualizing model parameters, we conclude that the subset of segments found important for predictive accuracy changes from hour-to-hour and include segments that are topologically central and/or highly congested.

However, it is still non-trivial to generalize these object detectors to the novel long-tailed object classes, which has only few labeled training samples. To this end, the Few-Shot Object Detection (FSOD) has been topical recently, as it mimics the humans' ability of learning to learn, and intelligently transfers the learnt generic object knowledge from the common heavy-tailed, to the novel long-tailed object classes. Especially, the research in this emerging field has been flourish in the recent years with various benchmarks, backbones, and methodologies proposed. To review these FSOD works, there are several insightful FSOD survey articles that systematically study and compare them as the groups of fine-tuning/transfer learning, and meta-learning methods. In contrast, we compare these FSOD algorithms from the new perspective and taxonomy of their contributions, i.e., data-oriented, model-oriented, and algorithm oriented ones. Thus, an empirical study and comparison has been conducted on the recent achievements of FSOD. Furthermore, we also analyze the technical challenges, the merits and demerits of these methods, and envision the future directions of FSOD. Specifically, we give an overview of FSOD, including the problem definition, common datasets, and evaluation protocols. A new taxonomy is then proposed based on the role of prior knowledge during object detection of novel classes. Following this taxonomy, we provide a systematic review of the advances in FSOD.

Recent research on Real-ISR has achieved significant progress by modeling the image degradation space; however, these methods largely rely on heavy backbone networks and they are inflexible to handle images of different degradation levels. In this paper, we propose an efficient and effective degradation-adaptive super-resolution (DASR) network, whose parameters are adaptively specified by estimating the degradation of each input image. Specifically, a tiny regression network is employed to predict the degradation parameters of the input image, while several convolutional experts with the same topology are jointly optimized to specify the network parameters via a non-linear mixture of experts. The joint optimization of multiple experts and the degradation-adaptive pipeline significantly extend the model capacity to handle degradations of various levels, while the inference remains efficient since only one adaptively specified network is used for super-resolving the input image. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed DASR is not only much more effective than existing methods on handling real-world images with different degradation levels but also efficient for easy deployment.

Our comprehensive set of over 500 experiments, which encompasses 7 video datasets, 9 self-supervised methods and 6 video understanding tasks, reveals that current benchmarks in video self-supervised learning are not a good indicator of generalization along these sensitivity factors. Further, we find that self-supervised methods considerably lag behind vanilla supervised pre-training, especially when domain shift is large and the amount of available downstream samples are low. From our analysis we distill the SEVERE-benchmark, a subset of our experiments, and discuss its implication for evaluating the generalizability of representations obtained by existing and future self-supervised video learning methods.

The mainstream is to leverage statistical models to model the dependence between data and labels, intending to learn representations independent of domain. Nevertheless, the statistical models are superficial descriptions of reality since they are only required to model dependence instead of the intrinsic causal mechanism. When the dependence changes with the target distribution, the statistic models may fail to generalize. In this regard, we introduce a general structural causal model to formalize the DG problem. Specifically, we assume that each input is constructed from a mix of causal factors (whose relationship with the label is invariant across domains) and non-causal factors (category-independent), and only the former cause the classification judgments. Our goal is to extract the causal factors from inputs and then reconstruct the invariant causal mechanisms. However, the theoretical idea is far from practical of DG since the required causal/non-causal factors are unobserved. We highlight that ideal causal factors should meet three basic properties: separated from the non-causal ones, jointly independent, and causally sufficient for the classification. Based on that, we propose a Causality Inspired Representation Learning (CIRL) algorithm that enforces the representations to satisfy the above properties and then uses them to simulate the causal factors, which yields improved generalization ability. Extensive experimental results on several widely used datasets verify the effectiveness of our approach. ",

Previous works have shown compelling comprehensive results by building hierarchical structures for visual scenes (e.g., scene graphs) and natural languages (e.g., dependency trees), individually. However, how to construct a joint vision-language (VL) structure has barely been investigated. More challenging but worthwhile, we introduce a new task that targets on inducing such a joint VL structure in an unsupervised manner. Our goal is to bridge the visual scene graphs and linguistic dependency trees seamlessly. Due to the lack of VL structural data, we start by building a new dataset VLParse. Rather than using labor-intensive labeling from scratch, we propose an automatic alignment procedure to produce coarse structures followed by human refinement to produce high-quality ones.

    "abstract": "Online social networks are ubiquitous and user-friendly. Nevertheless, it is vital to detect and moderate offensive content to maintain decency and empathy. However, mining social media texts is a complex task since users don't adhere to any fixed patterns. Comments can be written in any combination of languages and many of them may be low-resource. In this paper, we present our system for the LT-EDI shared task on detecting homophobia and transphobia in social media comments. We experiment with a number of monolingual and multilingual transformer based models such as mBERT along with a data augmentation technique for tackling class imbalance. Such pretrained large models have recently shown tremendous success on a variety of benchmark tasks in natural language processing. We observe their performance on a carefully annotated, real life dataset of YouTube comments in English as well as Tamil. Our submission achieved ranks $9$, $6$ and $3$ with a macro-averaged F1-score of $0.42$, $0.64$ and $0.58$ in the English, Tamil and Tamil-English subtasks respectively.

    "abstract": "Abstract syntax trees (ASTs) play a crucial role in source code representation. However, due to the large number of nodes in an AST and the typically deep AST hierarchy, it is challenging to learn the hierarchical structure of an AST effectively. In this paper, we propose HELoC, a hierarchical contrastive learning model for source code representation. To effectively learn the AST hierarchy, we use contrastive learning to allow the network to predict the AST node level and learn the hierarchical relationships between nodes in a self-supervised manner, which makes the representation vectors of nodes with greater differences in AST levels farther apart in the embedding space. By using such vectors, the structural similarities between code snippets can be measured more precisely. In the learning process, a novel GNN (called Residual Self-attention Graph Neural Network, RSGNN) is designed, which enables HELoC to focus on embedding the local structure of an AST while capturing its overall structure. HELoC is self-supervised and can be applied to many source code related downstream tasks such as code classification, code clone detection, and code clustering after pre-training. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that HELoC outperforms the state-of-the-art source code representation models. ",

    "abstract": "We introduce a novel formulation for guided super-resolution. Its core is a differentiable optimisation layer that operates on a learned affinity graph. The learned graph potentials make it possible to leverage rich contextual information from the guide image, while the explicit graph optimisation within the architecture guarantees rigorous fidelity of the high-resolution target to the low-resolution source. With the decision to employ the source as a constraint rather than only as an input to the prediction, our method differs from state-of-the-art deep architectures for guided super-resolution, which produce targets that, when downsampled, will only approximately reproduce the source. This is not only theoretically appealing, but also produces crisper, more natural-looking images. A key property of our method is that, although the graph connectivity is restricted to the pixel lattice, the associated edge potentials are learned with a deep feature extractor and can encode rich context information over large receptive fields. By taking advantage of the sparse graph connectivity, it becomes possible to propagate gradients through the optimisation layer and learn the edge potentials from data. We extensively evaluate our method on several datasets, and consistently outperform recent baselines in terms of quantitative reconstruction errors, while also delivering visually sharper outputs. Moreover, we demonstrate that our method generalises particularly well to new datasets not seen during training. ",

It is common practice for today's data holders to merge their datasets and train models collaboratively, which yet poses a threat to data privacy.

However, data representations face the threat of model inversion attacks. In this article, we formally define the collaborative learning scenario, and quantify data utility and privacy. Then we present ARS, a collaborative learning framework wherein users share representations of data to train models, and add imperceptible adversarial noise to data representations against reconstruction or attribute extraction attacks. By evaluating ARS in different contexts, we demonstrate that our mechanism is effective against model inversion attacks, and achieves a balance between privacy and utility. The ARS framework has wide applicability. First, ARS is valid for various data types, not limited to images. Second, data representations shared by users can be utilized in different tasks. Third, the framework can be easily extended to the vertical data partitioning scenario. ",

    "abstract": "In light of the growing number of user privacy violations in centralized social networks, the need to define effective platforms for decentralized online social networks (DOSNs) is deeply felt. Interesting solutions have been proposed in the past, which own the necessary mechanisms to allow users keeping control over their personal information and setting the rules to regulate the access of other users. Unfortunately, the effectiveness of this type of solutions is severely reduced by the fact that different user communities with a shared interest could be disconnected/separated from each other. This translates into a reduced ability in effectively spreading data of common interest towards all interested users, as it currently happens in centralized social networks. In order to overcome the cited limitation, this paper proposes a disruptive approach, which exploits the availability of a new class of Internet of Things (IoT) devices with autonomous social behaviors and cognitive abilities. Such devices can be leveraged as friendship intermediaries between devices' owners who are connected to a DOSN platform and share the same interest. We will demonstrate that clear advantages can be achieved in terms of increased percentage of Interested Reachable Nodes (a specific measure of Delivery Ratio) in distributed social networks among humans, when enhanced with so called Mediator Objects adhering to the well-known social IoT (SIoT) paradigm.

We show that for fully-connected neural networks when the network is pruned randomly at the initialization, as the width of each layer grows to infinity, the empirical NTK of the pruned neural network converges to that of the original (unpruned) network with some extra scaling factor. Further, if we apply some appropriate scaling after pruning at the initialization, the empirical NTK of the pruned network converges to the exact NTK of the original network, and we provide a non-asymptotic bound on the approximation error in terms of pruning probability. Moreover, when we apply our result to an unpruned network (i.e., we set the probability of pruning a given weight to be zero), our analysis is optimal up to a logarithmic factor in width compared with the result in \\cite{arora2019exact}. We conduct experiments to validate our theoretical results. We further test our theory by evaluating random pruning across different architectures via image classification on MNIST and CIFAR-10 and compare its performance with other pruning strategies. ",

This enables instance discriminative representation learning by contrasting desired intra-video pixel association against negative inter-video correspondence. Second, we merge position information into correspondence matching, and design a position shifting strategy to remove the side-effect of position encoding during inter-video affinity computation, making our LIIR location-sensitive. Third, to make full use of the spatial continuity nature of video data, we impose a compactness-based constraint on correspondence matching, yielding more sparse and reliable solutions.

In this paper, we annotate a focused evaluation set for \"Stereotype Detection\" that addresses those pitfalls by de-constructing various ways in which stereotypes manifest in text.

However, motion modeling, which facilitates object association by forecasting short-term trajectories with past observations, has been relatively under-explored in recent years. Current motion models in MOT typically assume that the object motion is linear in a small time window and needs continuous observations, so these methods are sensitive to occlusions and non-linear motion and require high frame-rate videos. In this work, we show that a simple motion model can obtain state-of-the-art tracking performance without other cues like appearance. We emphasize the role of \"observation\" when recovering tracks from being lost and reducing the error accumulated by linear motion models during the lost period. We thus name the proposed method as Observation-Centric SORT, OC-SORT for short. It remains simple, online, and real-time but improves robustness over occlusion and non-linear motion. It achieves 63.2 and 62.1 HOTA on MOT17 and MOT20, respectively, surpassing all published methods. It also sets new states of the art on KITTI Pedestrian Tracking and DanceTrack where the object motion is highly non-linear. The code and model are available at https://github.com/noahcao/OC_SORT. ",

To date, code review has been extensively studied to explore its general challenges, best practices and outcomes, and socio-technical aspects. However, little is known about how refactoring is being reviewed and what developers care about when they review refactored code. Hence, in this work, we present a quantitative and qualitative study to understand what are the main criteria developers rely on to develop a decision about accepting or rejecting a submitted refactored code, and what makes this process challenging. Through a case study of 11,010 refactoring and non-refactoring reviews spread across OpenStack open-source projects, we find that refactoring-related code reviews take significantly longer to be resolved in terms of code review efforts. Moreover, upon performing a thematic analysis on a significant sample of the refactoring code review discussions, we built a comprehensive taxonomy consisting of 28 refactoring review criteria. We envision our findings reaffirming the necessity of developing accurate and efficient tools and techniques that can assist developers in the review process in the presence of refactorings. ",

In this work, for the first time, we propose an effective MUlti-Granular Self-supervised learning (Mugs) framework to explicitly learn multi-granular visual features. Mugs has three complementary granular supervisions: 1) an instance discrimination supervision (IDS), 2) a novel local-group discrimination supervision (LGDS), and 3) a group discrimination supervision (GDS). IDS distinguishes different instances to learn instance-level fine-grained features. LGDS aggregates features of an image and its neighbors into a local-group feature, and pulls local-group features from different crops of the same image together and push them away for others. It provides complementary instance supervision to IDS via an extra alignment on local neighbors, and scatters different local-groups separately to increase discriminability. Accordingly, it helps learn high-level fine-grained features at a local-group level. Finally, to prevent similar local-groups from being scattered randomly or far away, GDS brings similar samples close and thus pulls similar local-groups together, capturing coarse-grained features at a (semantic) group level. Consequently, Mugs can capture three granular features that often enjoy higher generality on diverse downstream tasks over single-granular features, e.g.~instance-level fine-grained features in contrastive learning. By only pretraining on ImageNet-1K, Mugs sets new SoTA linear probing accuracy 82.1$\\%$ on ImageNet-1K and improves previous SoTA by $1.1\\%$. It also surpasses SoTAs on other tasks, e.g. transfer learning, detection and segmentation. ",

Although object detection has a broad range of applications, mAP evaluates detectors in terms of the performance of ranked instance retrieval. Such the assumption for the evaluation task does not suit some downstream tasks. To alleviate the gap between downstream tasks and the evaluation scenario, we propose Optimal Correction Cost (OC-cost), which assesses detection accuracy at image level. OC-cost computes the cost of correcting detections to ground truths as a measure of accuracy. The cost is obtained by solving an optimal transportation problem between the detections and the ground truths. Unlike mAP, OC-cost is designed to penalize false positive and false negative detections properly, and every image in a dataset is treated equally. Our experimental result validates that OC-cost has better agreement with human preference than a ranking-based measure, i.e., mAP for a single image. We also show that detectors' rankings by OC-cost are more consistent on different data splits than mAP. Our goal is not to replace mAP with OC-cost but provide an additional tool to evaluate detectors from another aspect. To help future researchers and developers choose a target measure, we provide a series of experiments to clarify how mAP and OC-cost differ. ",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we present a second order spatial compatibility (SC^2) measure based method for efficient and robust point cloud registration (PCR), called SC^2-PCR. Firstly, we propose a second order spatial compatibility (SC^2) measure to compute the similarity between correspondences. It considers the global compatibility instead of local consistency, allowing for more distinctive clustering between inliers and outliers at early stage. Based on this measure, our registration pipeline employs a global spectral technique to find some reliable seeds from the initial correspondences. Then we design a two-stage strategy to expand each seed to a consensus set based on the SC^2 measure matrix. Finally, we feed each consensus set to a weighted SVD algorithm to generate a candidate rigid transformation and select the best model as the final result.

    "abstract": "Face representation in the wild is extremely hard due to the large scale face variations. To this end, some deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been developed to learn discriminative feature by designing properly margin-based losses, which perform well on easy samples but fail on hard samples. Based on this, some methods mainly adjust the weights of hard samples in training stage to improve the feature discrimination. However, these methods overlook the feature distribution property which may lead to better results since the miss-classified hard samples may be corrected by using the distribution metric. This paper proposes the hard samples guided optimal transport (OT) loss for deep face representation, OTFace for short. OTFace aims to enhance the performance of hard samples by introducing the feature distribution discrepancy while maintain the performance on easy samples. Specifically, we embrace triplet scheme to indicate hard sample groups in one mini-batch during training. OT is then used to characterize the distribution differences of features from the high level convolutional layer. Finally, we integrate the margin-based-softmax (e.g. ArcFace or AM-Softmax) and OT to guide deep CNN learning. Extensive experiments are conducted on several benchmark databases. The quantitative results demonstrate the advantages of the proposed OTFace over state-of-the-art methods. ",

Building an interpretable neural text classifier for RRP promotes the understanding of why a research paper is predicted as replicable or non-replicable and therefore makes its real-world application more reliable and trustworthy. However, the prior works on model interpretation mainly focused on improving the model interpretability at the word/phrase level, which are insufficient especially for long research papers in RRP. Furthermore, the existing methods cannot utilize a large size of unlabeled dataset to further improve the model interpretability. To address these limitations, we aim to build an interpretable neural model which can provide sentence-level explanations and apply weakly supervised approach to further leverage the large corpus of unlabeled datasets to boost the interpretability in addition to improving prediction performance as existing works have done. In this work, we propose the Variational Contextual Consistency Sentence Masking (VCCSM) method to automatically extract key sentences based on the context in the classifier, using both labeled and unlabeled datasets. Results of our experiments on RRP along with European Convention of Human Rights (ECHR) datasets demonstrate that VCCSM is able to improve the model interpretability for the long document classification tasks using the area over the perturbation curve and post-hoc accuracy as evaluation metrics.

Since this optimization is more difficult than minimization of a single objective function, we propose to apply the conjugate gradient method to solve the local Nash equilibrium problem in GANs.

Through language modeling (LM) evaluations and manual analyses, we confirm that there are noticeable differences in linguistic expressions among five English-speaking countries and across four states in the US. Additionally, our evaluations on nine syntactic (CoNLL-2003), semantic (PAWS-Wiki, QNLI, STS-B, and RTE), and psycholinguistic tasks (SST-5, SST-2, Emotion, and Go-Emotions) show that, while introducing cultural background information does not benefit the Go-Emotions task due to text domain conflicts, it noticeably improves deep learning (DL) model performance on other tasks. Our findings strongly support the importance of cultural background modeling to a wide variety of NLP tasks and demonstrate the applicability of EnCBP in culture-related research. ",

However, those anomalies seen during training often do not illustrate every possible class of anomaly, rendering these models ineffective in generalizing to unseen anomaly classes. This paper tackles open-set supervised anomaly detection, in which we learn detection models using the anomaly examples with the objective to detect both seen anomalies (`gray swans') and unseen anomalies (`black swans'). We propose a novel approach that learns disentangled representations of abnormalities illustrated by seen anomalies, pseudo anomalies, and latent residual anomalies (i.e., samples that have unusual residuals compared to the normal data in a latent space), with the last two abnormalities designed to detect unseen anomalies. Extensive experiments on nine real-world anomaly detection datasets show superior performance of our model in detecting seen and unseen anomalies under diverse settings.

To address this concern, methods are proposed to make data unlearnable for deep learning models by adding a type of error-minimizing noise. However, such conferred unlearnability is found fragile to adversarial training. In this paper, we design new methods to generate robust unlearnable examples that are protected from adversarial training. We first find that the vanilla error-minimizing noise, which suppresses the informative knowledge of data via minimizing the corresponding training loss, could not effectively minimize the adversarial training loss. This explains the vulnerability of error-minimizing noise in adversarial training. Based on the observation, robust error-minimizing noise is then introduced to reduce the adversarial training loss. Experiments show that the unlearnability brought by robust error-minimizing noise can effectively protect data from adversarial training in various scenarios.

To deal the problem caused by distribution gap between labeled and unlabeled data, we propose a semi-supervised anomaly detection algorithm using KL divergence (SAD-KL). The proposed SAD-KL is composed of two steps: (1) estimating KL divergence of probability density functions (PDFs) of the local outlier factors (LOFs) of the labeled normal data and the unlabeled data (2) estimating detection probability and threshold for detecting normal data in unlabeled data by using the KL divergence. We show that the PDFs of the LOFs follow Burr distribution and use them for detection. Once the threshold is computed, the SAD-KL runs iteratively until the labeling change rate is lower than the predefined threshold. Experiments results show that the SAD-KL shows superior detection probability over the existing algorithms even though it takes less learning time. ",

However, depth information cannot be obtained directly by monocular cameras due to the inherent imaging mechanism, resulting in more challenging monocular 3D tasks. Most of the current monocular 3D vehicle detection methods leverage 2D detectors and additional geometric modules, which reduces the efficiency. In this paper, we propose a 3D vehicle localization network CenterLoc3D for roadside monocular cameras, which directly predicts centroid and eight vertexes in image space, and dimension of 3D bounding boxes without 2D detectors. In order to improve the precision of 3D vehicle localization, we propose a weighted-fusion module and a loss with spatial constraints embedding in CenterLoc3D. Firstly, the transformation matrix between 2D image space and 3D world space is solved by camera calibration. Secondly, vehicle type, centroid, eight vertexes and dimension of 3D vehicle bounding boxes are obtained by CenterLoc3D. Finally, centroid in 3D world space can be obtained by camera calibration and CenterLoc3D for 3D vehicle localization. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first application of 3D vehicle localization for roadside monocular cameras. Hence, we also propose a benchmark for this application including dataset (SVLD-3D), annotation tool (LabelImg-3D) and evaluation metrics.

Traditional methods have considered how to utilize neighboring frames by the single-scale alignment for restoration. However, they typically suffer from misalignment caused by severe blur. In this work, we aim to better utilize neighboring frames with high efficient feature alignment. We propose a Pyramid Feature Alignment Network (PFAN) for video deblurring. First, the multi-scale feature of blurry frames is extracted with the strategy of Structure-to-Detail Downsampling (SDD) before alignment. This downsampling strategy makes the edges sharper, which is helpful for alignment. Then we align the feature at each scale and reconstruct the image at the corresponding scale. This strategy effectively supervises the alignment at each scale, overcoming the problem of propagated errors from the above scales at the alignment stage. To better handle the challenges of complex and large motions, instead of aligning features at each scale separately, lower-scale motion information is used to guide the higher-scale motion estimation. Accordingly, a Cascade Guided Deformable Alignment (CGDA) is proposed to integrate coarse motion into deformable convolution for finer and more accurate alignment. As demonstrated in extensive experiments, our proposed PFAN achieves superior performance with competitive speed compared to the state-of-the-art methods. ",

Existing DA/DG-based PAD methods, however, have not yet fully explored the domain-specific style information that can provide knowledge regarding attack styles (e.g., materials, background, illumination and resolution). In this paper, we introduce a novel Style-Guided Domain Adaptation (SGDA) framework for inference-time adaptive PAD. Specifically, Style-Selective Normalization (SSN) is proposed to explore the domain-specific style information within the high-order feature statistics. The proposed SSN enables the adaptation of the model to the target domain by reducing the style difference between the target and the source domains. Moreover, we carefully design Style-Aware Meta-Learning (SAML) to boost the adaptation ability, which simulates the inference-time adaptation with style selection process on virtual test domain. In contrast to previous domain adaptation approaches, our method does not require either additional auxiliary models (e.g., domain adaptors) or the unlabeled target domain during training, which makes our method more practical to PAD task. To verify our experiments, we utilize the public datasets: MSU-MFSD, CASIA-FASD, OULU-NPU and Idiap REPLAYATTACK.

This potential mainly stems from the capacity of task offloading and allocation at the network edge, which reduces the delay and improves the quality of service. Despite the significant potential, optimizing the performance of a fog network is often challenging. In the fog architecture, the computing nodes are heterogeneous smart devices with distinct abilities and capacities, thereby, preferences. Besides, in an ultra-dense fog network with random task arrival, centralized control results in excessive overhead, and therefore, it is not feasible. We study a distributed task allocation problem in a heterogeneous fog computing network under uncertainty. We formulate the problem as a social-concave game, where the players attempt to minimize their regret on the path to Nash equilibrium. To solve the formulated problem, we develop two no-regret decision-making strategies. One strategy, namely bandit gradient ascent with momentum, is an online convex optimization algorithm with bandit feedback. The other strategy, Lipschitz Bandit with Initialization, is an EXP3 multi-armed bandit algorithm. We establish a regret bound for both strategies and analyze their convergence characteristics. Moreover, we compare the proposed strategies with a centralized allocation strategy named Learning with Linear Rewards. Theoretical and numerical analysis shows the superior performance of the proposed strategies for efficient task allocation compared to the state-of-the-art methods. ",

    "title": "Demystifying the Neural Tangent Kernel from a Practical Perspective: Can  it be trusted for Neural Architecture Search without training?",
    "abstract": "In Neural Architecture Search (NAS), reducing the cost of architecture evaluation remains one of the most crucial challenges. Among a plethora of efforts to bypass training of each candidate architecture to convergence for evaluation, the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) is emerging as a promising theoretical framework that can be utilized to estimate the performance of a neural architecture at initialization. In this work, we revisit several at-initialization metrics that can be derived from the NTK and reveal their key shortcomings. Then, through the empirical analysis of the time evolution of NTK, we deduce that modern neural architectures exhibit highly non-linear characteristics, making the NTK-based metrics incapable of reliably estimating the performance of an architecture without some amount of training. To take such non-linear characteristics into account, we introduce Label-Gradient Alignment (LGA), a novel NTK-based metric whose inherent formulation allows it to capture the large amount of non-linear advantage present in modern neural architectures. With minimal amount of training, LGA obtains a meaningful level of rank correlation with the post-training test accuracy of an architecture. Lastly, we demonstrate that LGA, complemented with few epochs of training, successfully guides existing search algorithms to achieve competitive search performances with significantly less search cost.

    "abstract": "Domain-specific named entity recognition (NER) on Computer Science (CS) scholarly articles is an information extraction task that is arguably more challenging for the various annotation aims that can beset the task and has been less studied than NER in the general domain. Given that significant progress has been made on NER, we believe that scholarly domain-specific NER will receive increasing attention in the years to come. Currently, progress on CS NER -- the focus of this work -- is hampered in part by its recency and the lack of a standardized annotation aim for scientific entities/terms. This work proposes a standardized task by defining a set of seven contribution-centric scholarly entities for CS NER viz., research problem, solution, resource, language, tool, method, and dataset. Following which, its main contributions are: combines existing CS NER resources that maintain their annotation focus on the set or subset of contribution-centric scholarly entities we consider; further, noting the need for big data to train neural NER models, this work additionally supplies thousands of contribution-centric entity annotations from article titles and abstracts, thus releasing a cumulative large novel resource for CS NER; and, finally, trains a sequence labeling CS NER model inspired after state-of-the-art neural architectures from the general domain NER task. Throughout the work, several practical considerations are made which can be useful to information technology designers of the digital libraries. ",

    "abstract": "Combining the respective advantages of cross-modality images can compensate for the lack of information in the single modality, which has attracted increasing attention of researchers into multi-modal image matching tasks. Meanwhile, due to the great appearance differences between cross-modality image pairs, it often fails to make the feature representations of correspondences as close as possible. In this letter, we design a cross-modality feature representation learning network, S2-Net, which is based on the recently successful detect-and-describe pipeline, originally proposed for visible images but adapted to work with cross-modality image pairs. To solve the consequent problem of optimization difficulties, we introduce self-supervised learning with a well-designed loss function to guide the training without discarding the original advantages. This novel strategy simulates image pairs in the same modality, which is also a useful guide for the training of cross-modality images. Notably, it does not require additional data but significantly improves the performance and is even workable for all methods of the detect-and-describe pipeline. Extensive experiments are conducted to evaluate the performance of the strategy we proposed, compared to both handcrafted and deep learning-based methods. Results show that our elegant formulation of combined optimization of supervised and self-supervised learning outperforms state-of-the-arts on RoadScene and RGB-NIR datasets. ",

However, it has been demonstrated that DNNs are very vulnerable to adversarial examples even in black-box settings. A large number of black-box attack methods have been proposed to in the literature. However, those methods usually suffer from low success rates and large query counts, which cannot fully satisfy practical purposes. In this paper, we propose a hybrid attack method which trains meta adversarial perturbations (MAPs) on surrogate models and performs black-box attacks by estimating gradients of the models. Our method uses the meta adversarial perturbation as an initialization and subsequently trains any black-box attack method for several epochs. Furthermore, the MAPs enjoy favorable transferability and universality, in the sense that they can be employed to boost performance of other black-box adversarial attack methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method can not only improve the attack success rates, but also reduces the number of queries compared to other methods. ",

We introduce a parameter that tunes the focus between demand-based and safety-based development, and investigate systematically this tradeoff for the city of Turin. We find that a full focus on demand or safety generates different network extensions in the short term, with an optimal tradeoff in-between. In the long term our framework improves overall network quality independent of short-term focus. Thus, this data-driven process can provide urban planners with automated assistance for variable short-term scenario planning while maintaining the long-term goal of a sustainable, city-spanning micromobility network.

    "abstract": "Graph embedding based retrieval has become one of the most popular techniques in the information retrieval community and search engine industry. The classical paradigm mainly relies on the flat Euclidean geometry. In recent years, hyperbolic (negative curvature) and spherical (positive curvature) representation methods have shown their superiority to capture hierarchical and cyclic data structures respectively. However, in industrial scenarios such as e-commerce sponsored search platforms, the large-scale heterogeneous query-item-advertisement interaction graphs often have multiple structures coexisting. Existing methods either only consider a single geometry space, or combine several spaces manually, which are incapable and inflexible to model the complexity and heterogeneity in the real scenario. To tackle this challenge, we present a web-scale Adaptive Mixed-Curvature ADvertisement retrieval system (AMCAD) to automatically capture the complex and heterogeneous graph structures in non-Euclidean spaces. Specifically, entities are represented in adaptive mixed-curvature spaces, where the types and curvatures of the subspaces are trained to be optimal combinations. Besides, an attentive edge-wise space projector is designed to model the similarities between heterogeneous nodes according to local graph structures and the relation types. Moreover, to deploy AMCAD in Taobao, one of the largest ecommerce platforms with hundreds of million users, we design an efficient two-layer online retrieval framework for the task of graph based advertisement retrieval. Extensive evaluations on real-world datasets and A/B tests on online traffic are conducted to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed system. ",

To allow for hypothetical reasoning while accommodating such dependencies, we develop HypeR, a framework that supports what-if and how-to queries accounting for probabilistic dependencies among attributes captured by a probabilistic causal model. We extend the SQL syntax to include the necessary operators for expressing these hypothetical queries, define their semantics, devise efficient algorithms and optimizations to compute their results using concepts from causality and probabilistic databases, and evaluate the effectiveness of our approach experimentally.

In this approach, first, the FNN parameters are trained using an NSGA-II-based optimization engine by considering the main design challenges of MPSoCs including temperature, power consumption, failure rate, and execution time on a training dataset consisting of different application graphs of various sizes. Next, the trained FNN is employed as an online task scheduler to jointly optimize the main design challenges in heterogeneous MPSoCs. Due to the uncertainty in sensor measurements and the difference between computational models and reality, applying the fuzzy neural network is advantageous in online scheduling procedures. The performance of the method is compared with some previous heuristic, meta-heuristic, and rule-based approaches in several experiments. Based on these experiments our proposed method outperforms the related studies in optimizing all design criteria. Its improvement over related heuristic and meta-heuristic approaches are estimated 10.58% in temperature, 9.22% in power consumption, 39.14% in failure rate, and 12.06% in execution time, averagely.

As massive graphs (e.g., online social networks, hyperlink networks, and road networks) have become pervasive, graph compression has gained importance for the efficient processing of such graphs with limited resources. Graph summarization is an extensively-studied lossy compression method. It provides a summary graph where nodes with similar connectivity are merged into supernodes, and a variety of graph queries can be answered approximately from the summary graph. In this work, we introduce a new problem, namely personalized graph summarization, where the objective is to obtain a summary graph where more emphasis is put on connections closer to a given set of target nodes. Then, we propose PeGaSus, a linear-time algorithm for the problem. Through experiments on six real-world graphs, we demonstrate that PeGaSus is (a) Effective: node-similarity queries for target nodes can be answered significantly more accurately from personalized summary graphs than from non-personalized ones of similar size, (b) Scalable: it summarizes graphs with up to one billion edges, and (c) Applicable to distributed multi-query answering: it successfully replaces graph partitioning for communication-free multi-query processing.

However, radio signals in FR2 experience high path and diffraction loss in mobile environments. To address this issue, multi-panel user equipment (MPUE) is adopted for FR2 whereby multiple antenna panels are placed on the UE body to leverage gains from antenna directivity. In contrast to traditional UEs with isotropic radiation patterns, signal measurements of cells in the network may not be available on all panels simultaneously for MPUE, which may result in outdated signal measurements that affect the reliability of mobility decisions. In this paper, we investigate the mobility performance of two different MPUE schemes following different paradigms for signal measurement and compare their performance with traditional UEs. This performance evaluation is based in multi-beam 5G networks operating in FR2 where there are multiple simultaneously active beams per cell to realize the high throughput requirements. Furthermore, an in-depth analysis of the mobility performance is carried out to determine the best mobility parameter combinations for the different MPUE schemes. Results have shown that both MPUE schemes offer considerable mobility performance gains as compared to traditional UEs. Moreover, it is seen that the MPUE schemes require different mobility parameter settings for the best mobility performance. ",

    "abstract": "Interventional magnetic resonance imaging (i-MRI) for surgical guidance could help visualize the interventional process such as deep brain stimulation (DBS), improving the surgery performance and patient outcome. Different from retrospective reconstruction in conventional dynamic imaging, i-MRI for DBS has to acquire and reconstruct the interventional images sequentially online. Here we proposed a convolutional long short-term memory (Conv-LSTM) based recurrent neural network (RNN), or ConvLR, to reconstruct interventional images with golden-angle radial sampling. By using an initializer and Conv-LSTM blocks, the priors from the pre-operative reference image and intra-operative frames were exploited for reconstructing the current frame. Data consistency for radial sampling was implemented by a soft-projection method. An adversarial learning strategy was adopted to improve the reconstruction accuracy. A set of interventional images based on the pre-operative and post-operative MR images were simulated for algorithm validation. Results showed with only 10 radial spokes, ConvLR provided the best performance compared with state-of-the-art methods, giving an acceleration up to 40 folds. The proposed algorithm has the potential to achieve real-time i-MRI for DBS and can be used for general purpose MR-guided intervention. ",

    "abstract": "With the aim of obtaining time/space improvements in classic Data Structures, an emerging trend is to combine Machine Learning techniques with the ones proper of Data Structures. This new area goes under the name of Learned Data Structures. The motivation for its study is a perceived change of paradigm in Computer Architectures that would favour the use of Graphics Processing Units and Tensor Processing Units over conventional Central Processing Units. In turn, that would favour the use of Neural Networks as building blocks of Classic Data Structures. Indeed, Learned Bloom Filters, which are one of the main pillars of Learned Data Structures, make extensive use of Neural Networks to improve the performance of classic Filters. However, no use of Neural Networks is reported in the realm of Learned Indexes, which is another main pillar of that new area. In this contribution, we provide the first, and much needed, comparative experimental analysis regarding the use of Neural Networks as building blocks of Learned Indexes. The results reported here highlight the need for the design of very specialized Neural Networks tailored to Learned Indexes and it establishes a solid ground for those developments. Our findings, methodologically important, are of interest to both Scientists and Engineers working in Neural Networks Design and Implementation, in view also of the importance of the application areas involved, e.g., Computer Networks and Data Bases.

    "abstract": "The increasing use of Internet of Things devices coincides with more communication and data movement in networks, which can exceed existing network capabilities. These devices often process sensor or user information, where data privacy and latency are a major concern. Therefore, traditional approaches like cloud computing do not fit well, yet new architectures such as edge computing address this gap. In addition, the Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) paradigm gains in prevalence as a workload execution platform, however the decoupling of storage results in further challenges for highly distributed edge environments. To address this, we propose SyncMesh, a system to manage, query, and transform data in a scalable and stateless manner by leveraging the capabilities of Function-as-a-Service and at the same time enabling data locality. Furthermore, we provide a prototypical implementation and evaluate it against established centralized and decentralized systems in regard to traffic usage and request times. The preliminary results indicate that SyncMesh is able to exonerate the network layer and accelerate the transmission of data to clients, while simultaneously improving local data processing. ",

    "abstract": "Finding items with potential to increase sales is of great importance in online market. In this paper, we propose to study this novel and practical problem: rising star prediction. We call these potential items Rising Star, which implies their ability to rise from low-turnover items to best-sellers in the future. Rising stars can be used to help with unfair recommendation in e-commerce platform, balance supply and demand to benefit the retailers and allocate marketing resources rationally. Although the study of rising star can bring great benefits, it also poses challenges to us. The sales trend of rising star fluctuates sharply in the short-term and exhibits more contingency caused by some external events (e.g., COVID-19 caused increasing purchase of the face mask) than other items, which cannot be solved by existing sales prediction methods. To address above challenges, in this paper, we observe that the presence of rising stars is closely correlated with the early diffusion of user interest in social networks, which is validated in the case of Taocode (an intermediary that diffuses user interest in Taobao). Thus, we propose a novel framework, RiseNet, to incorporate the user interest diffusion process with the item dynamic features to effectively predict rising stars. Specifically, we adopt a coupled mechanism to capture the dynamic interplay between items and user interest, and a special designed GNN based framework to quantify user interest. Our experimental results on large-scale real-world datasets provided by Taobao demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework. ",

The Integrated Multi-satellitE Retrievals for the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) mission (IMERG) datasets are widely used for global and regional precipitation investigations. However, their local application is limited by the relatively coarse spatial resolution. Therefore, in this paper, an attention mechanism based convolutional network (AMCN) is proposed to downscale GPM IMERG monthly precipitation data. The proposed method is an end-to-end network, which consists of a global cross-attention module, a multi-factor cross-attention module, and a residual convolutional module, comprehensively considering the potential relationships between precipitation and complicated surface characteristics. In addition, a degradation loss function based on low-resolution precipitation is designed to physically constrain the network training, to improve the robustness of the proposed network under different time and scale variations. The experiments demonstrate that the proposed network significantly outperforms three baseline methods. Finally, a geographic difference analysis method is introduced to further improve the downscaled results by incorporating in-situ measurements for high-quality and fine-scale precipitation estimation.

    "abstract": "Predictions of hydrologic variables across the entire water cycle have significant value for water resource management as well as downstream applications such as ecosystem and water quality modeling. Recently, purely data-driven deep learning models like long short-term memory (LSTM) showed seemingly-insurmountable performance in modeling rainfall-runoff and other geoscientific variables, yet they cannot predict unobserved physical variables and remain challenging to interpret. Here we show that differentiable, learnable, process-based models (called {\\delta} models here) can approach the performance level of LSTM for the intensively-observed variable (streamflow) with regionalized parameterization. We use a simple hydrologic model HBV as the backbone and use embedded neural networks, which can only be trained in a differentiable programming framework, to parameterize, replace, or enhance the process-based model modules. Without using an ensemble or post-processor, {\\delta} models can obtain a median Nash Sutcliffe efficiency of 0.715 for 671 basins across the USA for a particular forcing data, compared to 0.72 from a state-of-the-art LSTM model with the same setup. Meanwhile, the resulting learnable process-based models can be evaluated (and later, to be trained) by multiple sources of observations, e.g., groundwater storage, evapotranspiration, surface runoff, and baseflow. Both simulated evapotranspiration and fraction of discharge from baseflow agreed decently with alternative estimates. The general framework can work with models with various process complexity and opens up the path for learning physics from big data. ",

Smart contracts become immutable when deployed to the Ethereum blockchain. Therefore, it is essential to understand the nature of vulnerabilities in Ethereum smart contracts to prevent them in the future. Existing classifications exist, but are limited in several ways. Objective: We aim to characterize vulnerabilities in Ethereum smart contracts written in Solidity, and unify existing classifications schemes. Method: We extracted 2143 vulnerabilities from public coding platforms and popular vulnerability databases and categorized them using a card sorting approach. We targeted the Ethereum blockchain in this paper, as it is the first and most popular blockchain to support the deployment of smart contracts, and Solidity as the most widely used language to implement smart contracts. We devised a classification scheme of smart contract vulnerabilities according to their error source and impact. Afterwards, we mapped existing classification schemes to our classification. Results: The resulting classification consists of 11 categories describing the error source of a vulnerability and 13 categories describing potential impacts. Our findings show that the language specific coding and the structural data flow categories are the dominant categories, but that the frequency of occurrence differs substantially between the data sources. Conclusions: Our findings enable researchers to better understand smart contract vulnerabilities by defining various dimensions of the problem and supporting our classification with mappings with literature-based classifications and frequency distributions of the defined categories.

    "abstract": "The pursuit algorithms integrated in multi-layer convolutional sparse coding (ML-CSC) can interpret the convolutional neural networks (CNNs). However, many current state-of-art (SOTA) pursuit algorithms require multiple iterations to optimize the solution of ML-CSC, which limits their applications to deeper CNNs due to high computational cost and large number of resources for getting very tiny gain of performance. In this study, we focus on the 0th iteration in pursuit algorithm by introducing an effective initialization strategy for each layer, by which the solution for ML-CSC can be improved. Specifically, we first propose a novel width-depth synchronous extension-based basis pursuit (WSEBP) algorithm which solves the ML-CSC problem without the limitation of the number of iterations compared to the SOTA algorithms and maximizes the performance by an effective initialization in each layer. Then, we propose a simple and unified ML-CSC-based classification network (ML-CSC-Net) which consists of an ML-CSC-based feature encoder and a fully-connected layer to validate the performance of WSEBP on image classification task. The experimental results show that our proposed WSEBP outperforms SOTA algorithms in terms of accuracy and consumption resources. In addition, the WSEBP integrated in CNNs can improve the performance of deeper CNNs and make them interpretable. Finally, taking VGG as an example, we propose WSEBP-VGG13 to enhance the performance of VGG13, which achieves competitive results on four public datasets, i.e., 87.79% vs. 86.83% on Cifar-10 dataset, 58.01% vs. 54.60% on Cifar-100 dataset, 91.52% vs. 89.58% on COVID-19 dataset, and 99.88% vs. 99.78% on Crack dataset, respectively. The results show the effectiveness of the proposed WSEBP, the improved performance of ML-CSC with WSEBP, and interpretation of the CNNs or deeper CNNs. ",

In particular, this technique is used with frequency oracles (FO) because it can protect each user's privacy and prevent leakage of sensitive information. However, the definition of LDP is so conservative that it requires all inputs to be indistinguishable after perturbation. Indeed, LDP protects each value; however, it is rarely used in practical scenarios owing to its cost in terms of accuracy. In this paper, we address the challenge of providing weakened but flexible protection where each value only needs to be indistinguishable from part of the domain after perturbation. First, we present this weakened but flexible LDP (FLDP) notion. We then prove the association with LDP and DP. Second, we design an FHR approach for the common FO issue while satisfying FLDP. The proposed approach balances communication cost, computational complexity, and estimation accuracy.

Temporal Graph Neural Networks capture temporal information as well as structural and contextual information in the generated dynamic node embeddings. Researchers have shown that these embeddings achieve state-of-the-art performance in many different tasks. In this work, we propose TGL, a unified framework for large-scale offline Temporal Graph Neural Network training where users can compose various Temporal Graph Neural Networks with simple configuration files. TGL comprises five main components, a temporal sampler, a mailbox, a node memory module, a memory updater, and a message passing engine. We design a Temporal-CSR data structure and a parallel sampler to efficiently sample temporal neighbors to formtraining mini-batches. We propose a novel random chunk scheduling technique that mitigates the problem of obsolete node memory when training with a large batch size. To address the limitations of current TGNNs only being evaluated on small-scale datasets, we introduce two large-scale real-world datasets with 0.2 and 1.3 billion temporal edges. We evaluate the performance of TGL on four small-scale datasets with a single GPU and the two large datasets with multiple GPUs for both link prediction and node classification tasks. We compare TGL with the open-sourced code of five methods and show that TGL achieves similar or better accuracy with an average of 13x speedup. Our temporal parallel sampler achieves an average of 173x speedup on a multi-core CPU compared with the baselines. On a 4-GPU machine, TGL can train one epoch of more than one billion temporal edges within 1-10 hours. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that proposes a general framework for large-scale Temporal Graph Neural Networks training on multiple GPUs. ",

To overcome this, large knowledge graphs need to be partitioned into multiple sub-graphs and placed in nodes in a distributed system. But querying these fragmented sub-graphs poses new challenges, such as increased communication costs, due to distributed joins involving cut edges. To combat these problems, a good partitioning should reduce the edge cuts while considering a given query workload. However, a partitioned graph needs to be continually re-partitioned to accommodate changes in the query workload and maintain a good average processing time. In this paper, an adaptive partitioning method for large-scale knowledge graphs is introduced, which adapts the partitioning in response to changes in the query workload. Our evaluation demonstrates that the performance of processing time for queries is improved after dynamically adapting the partitioning of knowledge graph triples. ",

During the projection, current methods simply adopt uniform aggregation of pixels for embedding; however, this risks involving object-irrelevant nuisances and spatial misalignment for different augmentations. In this paper, we present a new approach, Learning Where to Learn (LEWEL), to adaptively aggregate spatial information of features, so that the projected embeddings could be exactly aligned and thus guide the feature learning better. Concretely, we reinterpret the projection head in SSL as a per-pixel projection and predict a set of spatial alignment maps from the original features by this weight-sharing projection head. A spectrum of aligned embeddings is thus obtained by aggregating the features with spatial weighting according to these alignment maps. As a result of this adaptive alignment, we observe substantial improvements on both image-level prediction and dense prediction at the same time: LEWEL improves MoCov2 by 1.6%/1.3%/0.5%/0.4% points, improves BYOL by 1.3%/1.3%/0.7%/0.6% points, on ImageNet linear/semi-supervised classification, Pascal VOC semantic segmentation, and object detection, respectively.

    "abstract": "Modern object detectors have achieved impressive progress under the close-set setup. However, open-set object detection (OSOD) remains challenging since objects of unknown categories are often misclassified to existing known classes. In this work, we propose to identify unknown objects by separating high/low-density regions in the latent space, based on the consensus that unknown objects are usually distributed in low-density latent regions. As traditional threshold-based methods only maintain limited low-density regions, which cannot cover all unknown objects, we present a novel Open-set Detector (OpenDet) with expanded low-density regions. To this aim, we equip OpenDet with two learners, Contrastive Feature Learner (CFL) and Unknown Probability Learner (UPL). CFL performs instance-level contrastive learning to encourage compact features of known classes, leaving more low-density regions for unknown classes; UPL optimizes unknown probability based on the uncertainty of predictions, which further divides more low-density regions around the cluster of known classes. Thus, unknown objects in low-density regions can be easily identified with the learned unknown probability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method can significantly improve the OSOD performance, e.g., OpenDet reduces the Absolute Open-Set Errors by 25%-35% on six OSOD benchmarks.

Such approaches typically involve tedious reward function tuning to achieve the desired motion style. Imitation learning approaches such as adversarial motion priors aim to reduce this problem by encouraging a pre-defined motion style. In this work, we present an approach to augment the concept of adversarial motion prior-based RL to allow for multiple, discretely switchable styles. We show that multiple styles and skills can be learned simultaneously without notable performance differences, even in combination with motion data-free skills. Our approach is validated in several real-world experiments with a wheeled-legged quadruped robot showing skills learned from existing RL controllers and trajectory optimization, such as ducking and walking, and novel skills such as switching between a quadrupedal and humanoid configuration. For the latter skill, the robot is required to stand up, navigate on two wheels, and sit down. Instead of tuning the sit-down motion, we verify that a reverse playback of the stand-up movement helps the robot discover feasible sit-down behaviors and avoids tedious reward function tuning. ",

    "abstract": "Critical energy infrastructures are increasingly relying on advanced sensing and control technologies for efficient and optimal utilization of flexible energy resources. Algorithmic procedures are needed to ensure that such systems are designed to be resilient to a wide range of cyber-physical adversarial events. This paper provides a robust optimization framework to quantify the range of adversarial perturbations that a system can accommodate without violating pre-specified resiliency metrics. An inner-approximation of the set of adversarial events which can be mitigated by the available flexibility is constructed using an optimization based approach. The proposed algorithm is illustrated on an islanded microgrid example: a modified IEEE 123-node feeder with distributed energy resources. Simulations are carried out to validate that the resiliency metrics are met for any event sampled from the constructed adversarial set for varying levels of available flexibility (energy reserves).

    "abstract": "Current approaches for modeling propagation in networks (e.g., spread of disease) are unable to adequately capture temporal properties of the data such as order and duration of evolving connections or dynamic likelihoods of propagation along these connections. Temporal models in evolving networks are crucial in many applications that need to analyze dynamic spread. For example, a disease-spreading virus has varying transmissibility based on interactions between individuals occurring over time with different frequency, proximity, and venue population density. To capture such behaviors, we first develop the Temporal Independent Cascade (T-IC) model and propose a novel spread function, that we prove to be submodular, with a hypergraph-based sampling strategy that efficiently utilizes dynamic propagation probabilities. We then introduce the notion of 'reverse spread' using the proposed T-IC processes, and develop solutions to identify both sentinel/detector nodes and highly susceptible nodes. The proven guarantees of approximation quality enable scalable analysis of highly granular temporal networks. Extensive experimental results on a variety of real-world datasets show that the proposed approach significantly outperforms the alternatives in modeling both if and how spread occurs, by considering evolving network topology as well as granular contact/interaction information. Our approach has numerous applications, including its utility for the vital challenge of monitoring disease spread. Utilizing the proposed methods and T-IC, we analyze the impact of various intervention strategies over real spatio-temporal contact networks. Our approach is shown also to be highly effective in quantifying the importance of superspreaders, designing targeted restrictions for controlling spread, and backward contact tracing. ",

    "abstract": "Finding the connected components of a graph is a fundamental problem with uses throughout computer science and engineering. The task of computing connected components becomes more difficult when graphs are very large, or when they are dynamic, meaning the edge set changes over time subject to a stream of edge insertions and deletions. A natural approach to computing the connected components on a large, dynamic graph stream is to buy enough RAM to store the entire graph. However, the requirement that the graph fit in RAM is prohibitive for very large graphs. Thus, there is an unmet need for systems that can process dense dynamic graphs, especially when those graphs are larger than available RAM. We present a new high-performance streaming graph-processing system for computing the connected components of a graph. This system, which we call GraphZeppelin, uses new linear sketching data structures (CubeSketches) to solve the streaming connected components problem and as a result requires space asymptotically smaller than the space required for a lossless representation of the graph. GraphZeppelin is optimized for massive dense graphs: GraphZeppelin can process millions of edge updates (both insertions and deletions) per second, even when the underlying graph is far too large to fit in available RAM. As a result GraphZeppelin vastly increases the scale of graphs that can be processed. ",

    "abstract": "Recently, vision-language pre-training shows great potential in open-vocabulary object detection, where detectors trained on base classes are devised for detecting new classes. The class text embedding is firstly generated by feeding prompts to the text encoder of a pre-trained vision-language model. It is then used as the region classifier to supervise the training of a detector. The key element that leads to the success of this model is the proper prompt, which requires careful words tuning and ingenious design. To avoid laborious prompt engineering, there are some prompt representation learning methods being proposed for the image classification task, which however can only be sub-optimal solutions when applied to the detection task. In this paper, we introduce a novel method, detection prompt (DetPro), to learn continuous prompt representations for open-vocabulary object detection based on the pre-trained vision-language model. Different from the previous classification-oriented methods, DetPro has two highlights: 1) a background interpretation scheme to include the proposals in image background into the prompt training; 2) a context grading scheme to separate proposals in image foreground for tailored prompt training. We assemble DetPro with ViLD, a recent state-of-the-art open-world object detector, and conduct experiments on the LVIS as well as transfer learning on the Pascal VOC, COCO, Objects365 datasets. Experimental results show that our DetPro outperforms the baseline ViLD in all settings, e.g., +3.4 APbox and +3.0 APmask improvements on the novel classes of LVIS.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose the LiDAR Distillation to bridge the domain gap induced by different LiDAR beams for 3D object detection. In many real-world applications, the LiDAR points used by mass-produced robots and vehicles usually have fewer beams than that in large-scale public datasets. Moreover, as the LiDARs are upgraded to other product models with different beam amount, it becomes challenging to utilize the labeled data captured by previous versions' high-resolution sensors. Despite the recent progress on domain adaptive 3D detection, most methods struggle to eliminate the beam-induced domain gap. We find that it is essential to align the point cloud density of the source domain with that of the target domain during the training process. Inspired by this discovery, we propose a progressive framework to mitigate the beam-induced domain shift. In each iteration, we first generate low-beam pseudo LiDAR by downsampling the high-beam point clouds. Then the teacher-student framework is employed to distill rich information from the data with more beams. Extensive experiments on Waymo, nuScenes and KITTI datasets with three different LiDAR-based detectors demonstrate the effectiveness of our LiDAR Distillation. Notably, our approach does not increase any additional computation cost for inference. ",

To overcome the challenge and facilitate the real-time deployment of SISR tasks on mobile, we combine neural architecture search with pruning search and propose an automatic search framework that derives sparse super-resolution (SR) models with high image quality while satisfying the real-time inference requirement. To decrease the search cost, we leverage the weight sharing strategy by introducing a supernet and decouple the search problem into three stages, including supernet construction, compiler-aware architecture and pruning search, and compiler-aware pruning ratio search. With the proposed framework, we are the first to achieve real-time SR inference (with only tens of milliseconds per frame) for implementing 720p resolution with competitive image quality (in terms of PSNR and SSIM) on mobile platforms (Samsung Galaxy S20).

In this paper, uncertainty sets are constructed in a data-driven manner using kernel method, i.e., they are centered around empirical distributions of training samples from the null and alternative hypotheses, respectively; and are constrained via the distance between kernel mean embeddings of distributions in the reproducing kernel Hilbert space, i.e., maximum mean discrepancy (MMD). The Bayesian setting and the Neyman-Pearson setting are investigated. For the Bayesian setting where the goal is to minimize the worst-case error probability, an optimal test is firstly obtained when the alphabet is finite. When the alphabet is infinite, a tractable approximation is proposed to quantify the worst-case average error probability, and a kernel smoothing method is further applied to design test that generalizes to unseen samples. A direct robust kernel test is also proposed and proved to be exponentially consistent. For the Neyman-Pearson setting, where the goal is to minimize the worst-case probability of miss detection subject to a constraint on the worst-case probability of false alarm, an efficient robust kernel test is proposed and is shown to be asymptotically optimal. Numerical results are provided to demonstrate the performance of the proposed robust tests. ",

However, many medical image databases with appropriately labeled and annotated images are small and imbalanced, and thus unsuitable to train and validate such models. The option is to generate synthetic images and one successful technique has been patented which limits its use for others. We have developed a free-access, alternate method for generating synthetic high-resolution images using Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) for data augmentation and showed their effectiveness using eye-fundus images for Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD) identification. Ten different GAN architectures were compared to generate synthetic eye-fundus images with and without AMD. Data from three public databases were evaluated using the Fr\\'echet Inception Distance (FID), two clinical experts and deep-learning classification. The results show that StyleGAN2 reached the lowest FID (166.17), and clinicians could not accurately differentiate between real and synthetic images. ResNet-18 architecture obtained the best performance with 85% accuracy and outperformed the two experts in detecting AMD fundus images, whose average accuracy was 77.5%. These results are similar to a recently patented method, and will provide an alternative to generating high-quality synthetic medical images.

We investigate the classifier response to input data with injected mismodelings and probe the vulnerability of flavor tagging algorithms via application of adversarial attacks. Subsequently, we present an adversarial training strategy that mitigates the impact of such simulated attacks and improves the classifier robustness.

While standard supervised learning models expect a label for every instance, MIL relaxes this and only considers bags of instances to be labeled. This is ideally suited for flare prediction with IRIS data that consists of time series of bags of UV spectra measured along the instrument slit. In particular, we consider the readout window around the Mg II h&k lines that encodes information on the dynamics of the solar chromosphere. Our MIL models are not only able to predict whether flares occur within the next $\\sim$25 minutes with accuracies of around 90%, but are also able to explain which spectral profiles were particularly important for their bag-level prediction. This information can be used to highlight regions of interest in ongoing IRIS observations in real-time and to identify candidates for typical flare precursor spectral profiles. We use k-means clustering to extract groups of spectral profiles that appear relevant for flare prediction. The recovered groups show high intensity, triplet red wing emission and single-peaked h and k lines, as found by previous works. They seem to be related to small-scale explosive events that have been reported to occur tens of minutes before a flare. ",

For these two systems we create artificial neural networks that are able to reproduce their dynamics. The created networks operate as recurrent maps and are trained on trajectory cuts sampled at random parameter values within a certain range. Although the networks are trained only on oscillatory trajectory cuts, it also discover the fixed point of the considered systems. The position and even the eigenvalues coincide very well with the fixed point of the initial ODEs. For the bistable model it means that the network being trained only on one brunch of the solutions recovers another brunch without seeing it during the training. These results, as we see it, are able to trigger the development of new approaches to complex dynamics reconstruction and discovering. From the practical point of view reproducing dynamics with the neural network can be considered as a sort of alternative method of numerical modeling intended for use with contemporary parallel hard- and software.

Existing solutions for client-side privacy mainly focus on voice conversion or voice modification to convert a raw utterance into another one with similar content but different, or no, identity-related information. However, an alternative approach to share speech data under the form of privacy-preserving representations has been largely under-explored. To fill this gap, we propose a speech anonymization framework that provides formal privacy guarantees via noise perturbation to a selected subset of the high-utility representations extracted using a pre-trained speech encoder. The subset is chosen with a Transformer-based privacy-risk saliency estimator. We validate our framework on four tasks, namely, Automatic Speaker Verification (ASV), ASR, SER and Intent Classification (IC) for privacy and utility assessment. Experimental results show that our approach is able to achieve a competitive, or even better, utility compared to the baselines that use voice conversion and voice modification, providing the same level of privacy. Moreover, the easily-controlled amount of perturbation allows our framework to have a flexible range of privacy-utility trade-offs without re-training any components. ",

    "abstract": "Distributed scheduling algorithms for throughput or utility maximization in dense wireless multi-hop networks can have overwhelmingly high overhead, causing increased congestion, energy consumption, radio footprint, and security vulnerability. For wireless networks with dense connectivity, we propose a distributed scheme for link sparsification with graph convolutional networks (GCNs), which can reduce the scheduling overhead while keeping most of the network capacity. In a nutshell, a trainable GCN module generates node embeddings as topology-aware and reusable parameters for a local decision mechanism, based on which a link can withdraw itself from the scheduling contention if it is not likely to win. In medium-sized wireless networks, our proposed sparse scheduler beats classical threshold-based sparsification policies by retaining almost $70\\%$ of the total capacity achieved by a distributed greedy max-weight scheduler with $0.4\\%$ of the point-to-point message complexity and $2.6\\%$ of the average number of interfering neighbors per link.

    "abstract": "Segmentation is essential for medical image analysis to identify and localize diseases, monitor morphological changes, and extract discriminative features for further diagnosis. Skin cancer is one of the most common types of cancer globally, and its early diagnosis is pivotal for the complete elimination of malignant tumors from the body. This research develops an Artificial Intelligence (AI) framework for supervised skin lesion segmentation employing the deep learning approach. The proposed framework, called MFSNet (Multi-Focus Segmentation Network), uses differently scaled feature maps for computing the final segmentation mask using raw input RGB images of skin lesions. In doing so, initially, the images are preprocessed to remove unwanted artifacts and noises. The MFSNet employs the Res2Net backbone, a recently proposed convolutional neural network (CNN), for obtaining deep features used in a Parallel Partial Decoder (PPD) module to get a global map of the segmentation mask. In different stages of the network, convolution features and multi-scale maps are used in two boundary attention (BA) modules and two reverse attention (RA) modules to generate the final segmentation output. MFSNet, when evaluated on three publicly available datasets: $PH^2$, ISIC 2017, and HAM10000, outperforms state-of-the-art methods, justifying the reliability of the framework.

Conventional approaches such as trial-and-error experiments and computational simulations are labor-intensive or costly with their success heavily depending on experts' heuristics. Recently deep generative models have been successfully proposed for materials generation by learning implicit knowledge from known materials datasets, with performance however limited by their confinement to a special material family or failing to incorporate physical rules into the model training process. Here we propose a Physics Guided Crystal Generative Model (PGCGM) for new materials generation, which captures and exploits the pairwise atomic distance constraints among neighbor atoms and symmetric geometric constraints. By augmenting the base atom sites of materials, our model can generates new materials of 20 space groups. With atom clustering and merging on generated crystal structures, our method increases the generator's validity by 8 times compared to one of the baselines and by 143\\% compared to the previous CubicGAN along with its superiority in properties distribution and diversity. We further validated our generated candidates by Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculation, which successfully optimized/relaxed 1869 materials out of 2000, of which 39.6\\% are with negative formation energy, indicating their stability.

    "abstract": "Seismic imaging is an ill-posed inverse problem that is challenged by noisy data and modeling inaccuracies -- due to errors in the background squared-slowness model. Uncertainty quantification is essential for determining how variability in the background models affects seismic imaging. Due to the costs associated with the forward Born modeling operator as well as the high dimensionality of seismic images, quantification of uncertainty is computationally expensive. As such, the main contribution of this work is a survey-specific Fourier neural operator surrogate to velocity continuation that maps seismic images associated with one background model to another virtually for free. While being trained with only 200 background and seismic image pairs, this surrogate is able to accurately predict seismic images associated with new background models, thus accelerating seismic imaging uncertainty quantification. We support our method with a realistic data example in which we quantify seismic imaging uncertainties using a Fourier neural operator surrogate, illustrating how variations in background models affect the position of reflectors in a seismic image.

In this paper we propose a deep learning method, specifically a bidirectional long short-term memory (biLSTM) network, to predict if an active region (AR) would produce an SEP event given that (i) the AR will produce an M- or X-class flare and a coronal mass ejection (CME) associated with the flare, or (ii) the AR will produce an M- or X-class flare regardless of whether or not the flare is associated with a CME. The data samples used in this study are collected from the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite's X-ray flare catalogs provided by the National Centers for Environmental Information. We select M- and X-class flares with identified ARs in the catalogs for the period between 2010 and 2021, and find the associations of flares, CMEs and SEPs in the Space Weather Database of Notifications, Knowledge, Information during the same period. Each data sample contains physical parameters collected from the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory. Experimental results based on different performance metrics demonstrate that the proposed biLSTM network is better than related machine learning algorithms for the two SEP prediction tasks studied here. We also discuss extensions of our approach for probabilistic forecasting and calibration with empirical evaluation. ",

Additionally, monitoring usually requires the solvers for these physics to be coupled and differentiable to effectively invert for the subsurface properties of interest. To drastically reduce the computational cost, we introduce a learned coupled inversion framework based on the wave modeling operator, rock property conversion and a proxy fluid-flow simulator. We show that we can accurately use a Fourier neural operator as a proxy for the fluid-flow simulator for a fraction of the computational cost. We demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed method by means of a synthetic experiment. Finally, our framework is extended to carbon sequestration forecasting, where we effectively use the surrogate Fourier neural operator to forecast the CO2 plume in the future at near-zero additional cost.

In this work, we propose a novel multi- view drug substructure network for DDI prediction (MSN-DDI), which learns chemical substructures from both the representations of the single drug (intra-view) and the drug pair (inter-view) simultaneously and utilizes the substructures to update the drug representation iteratively. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that MSN-DDI has almost solved DDI prediction for existing drugs by achieving a relatively improved accuracy of 19.32% and an over 99% accuracy under the transductive setting. More importantly, MSN-DDI exhibits better generalization ability to unseen drugs with a relatively improved accuracy of 7.07% under more challenging inductive scenarios. Finally, MSN-DDI improves prediction performance for real-world DDI applications to new drugs. ",

This suggests that they are random and do not contain system specific information, which we investigate further by comparing the statistics of eigenvector entries to the universal Porter-Thomas distribution. We find that for most eigenvectors the hypothesis of randomness cannot be rejected, and that only eigenvectors belonging to the largest singular values deviate from the RMT prediction, indicating that they may encode learned information. We analyze the spectral distribution of such large singular values using the Hill estimator and find that the distribution cannot be characterized by a tail index, i.e. is not of power law type. ",

    "abstract": "Speech emotion recognition~(SER) refers to the technique of inferring the emotional state of an individual from speech signals. SERs continue to garner interest due to their wide applicability. Although the domain is mainly founded on signal processing, machine learning, and deep learning, generalizing over languages continues to remain a challenge. However, developing generalizable and transferable models are critical due to a lack of sufficient resources in terms of data and labels for languages beyond the most commonly spoken ones. To improve performance over languages, we propose a denoising autoencoder with semi-supervision using a continuous metric loss based on either activation or valence. The novelty of this work lies in our proposal of continuous metric learning, which is among the first proposals on the topic to the best of our knowledge. Furthermore, to address the lack of activation and valence labels in the transfer datasets, we annotate the signal samples with activation and valence levels corresponding to a dimensional model of emotions, which were then used to evaluate the quality of the embedding over the transfer datasets. We show that the proposed semi-supervised model consistently outperforms the baseline unsupervised method, which is a conventional denoising autoencoder, in terms of emotion classification accuracy as well as correlation with respect to the dimensional variables. Further evaluation of classification accuracy with respect to the reference, a BERT based speech representation model, shows that the proposed method is comparable to the reference method in classifying specific emotion classes at a much lower complexity.
