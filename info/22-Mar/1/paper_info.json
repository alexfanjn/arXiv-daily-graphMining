    "abstract": "We introduce in this paper a new statistical perspective, exploiting the Jaccard similarity metric, as a measure-based metric to effectively invoke non-linear features in the loss of self-supervised contrastive learning. Specifically, our proposed metric may be interpreted as a dependence measure between two adapted projections learned from the so-called latent representations. This is in contrast to the cosine similarity measure in the conventional contrastive learning model, which accounts for correlation information. To the best of our knowledge, this effectively non-linearly fused information embedded in the Jaccard similarity, is novel to self-supervision learning with promising results. The proposed approach is compared to two state-of-the-art self-supervised contrastive learning methods on three image datasets. We not only demonstrate its amenable applicability in current ML problems, but also its improved performance and training efficiency. ",

    "abstract": "Neural architecture search (NAS), the study of automating the discovery of optimal deep neural network architectures for tasks in domains such as computer vision and natural language processing, has seen rapid growth in the machine learning research community. While there have been many recent advancements in NAS, there is still a significant focus on reducing the computational cost incurred when validating discovered architectures by making search more efficient. Evolutionary algorithms, specifically genetic algorithms, have a history of usage in NAS and continue to gain popularity versus other optimization approaches as a highly efficient way to explore the architecture objective space. Most NAS research efforts have centered around computer vision tasks and only recently have other modalities, such as the rapidly growing field of natural language processing, been investigated in depth. In this work, we show how genetic algorithms can be paired with lightly trained objective predictors in an iterative cycle to accelerate multi-objective architectural exploration in a way that works in the modalities of both machine translation and image classification.

    "abstract": "Recent advances in Neural Architecture Search (NAS) which extract specialized hardware-aware configurations (a.k.a. \"sub-networks\") from a hardware-agnostic \"super-network\" have become increasingly popular. While considerable effort has been employed towards improving the first stage, namely, the training of the super-network, the search for derivative high-performing sub-networks is still largely under-explored. For example, some recent network morphism techniques allow a super-network to be trained once and then have hardware-specific networks extracted from it as needed. These methods decouple the super-network training from the sub-network search and thus decrease the computational burden of specializing to different hardware platforms. We propose a comprehensive system that automatically and efficiently finds sub-networks from a pre-trained super-network that are optimized to different performance metrics and hardware configurations. By combining novel search tactics and algorithms with intelligent use of predictors, we significantly decrease the time needed to find optimal sub-networks from a given super-network. Further, our approach does not require the super-network to be refined for the target task a priori, thus allowing it to interface with any super-network. We demonstrate through extensive experiments that our system works seamlessly with existing state-of-the-art super-network training methods in multiple domains. Moreover, we show how novel search tactics paired with evolutionary algorithms can accelerate the search process for ResNet50, MobileNetV3 and Transformer while maintaining objective space Pareto front diversity and demonstrate an 8x faster search result than the state-of-the-art Bayesian optimization WeakNAS approach.

    "abstract": "Label differential privacy (LDP) is a popular framework for training private ML models on datasets with public features and sensitive private labels. Despite its rigorous privacy guarantee, it has been observed that in practice LDP does not preclude label inference attacks (LIAs): Models trained with LDP can be evaluated on the public training features to recover, with high accuracy, the very private labels that it was designed to protect. In this work, we argue that this phenomenon is not paradoxical and that LDP merely limits the advantage of an LIA adversary compared to predicting training labels using the Bayes classifier. At LDP $\\epsilon=0$ this advantage is zero, hence the optimal attack is to predict according to the Bayes classifier and is independent of the training labels. Finally, we empirically demonstrate that our result closely captures the behavior of simulated attacks on both synthetic and real world datasets. ",

Two primary limitations of the current evasion attack methods are highlighted: (1) The current GradArgmax ignores the \"long-term\" benefit of the perturbation. It is faced with zero-gradient and invalid benefit estimates in certain situations. (2) In the reinforcement learning-based attack methods, the learned attack strategies might not be transferable when the attack budget changes. To this end, we first formulate the perturbation space and propose an evaluation framework and the projective ranking method. We aim to learn a powerful attack strategy then adapt it as little as possible to generate adversarial samples under dynamic budget settings. In our method, based on mutual information, we rank and assess the attack benefits of each perturbation for an effective attack strategy. By projecting the strategy, our method dramatically minimizes the cost of learning a new attack strategy when the attack budget changes. In the comparative assessment with GradArgmax and RL-S2V, the results show our method owns high attack performance and effective transferability. The visualization of our method also reveals various attack patterns in the generation of adversarial samples. ",

Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have been proposed in the past as a tool to identify anomalies in computer networks. Although detecting these anomalies provides an indication of an attack, just detecting an anomaly is not enough information for a user to understand the anomaly. The black-box nature of off-the-shelf ML models prevents extracting important information that is fundamental to isolate the source of the fault/attack and take corrective measures. In this paper, we introduce the Network Transformer (NeT), a DNN model for anomaly detection that incorporates the graph structure of the communication network in order to improve interpretability. The presented approach has the following advantages: 1) enhanced interpretability by incorporating the graph structure of computer networks; 2) provides a hierarchical set of features that enables analysis at different levels of granularity; 3) self-supervised training that does not require labeled data. The presented approach was tested by evaluating the successful detection of anomalies in an Industrial Control System (ICS). The presented approach successfully identified anomalies, the devices affected, and the specific connections causing the anomalies, providing a data-driven hierarchical approach to analyze the behavior of a cyber network.

    "abstract": "Many machine learning tasks involve processing eigenvectors derived from data. Especially valuable are Laplacian eigenvectors, which capture useful structural information about graphs and other geometric objects. However, ambiguities arise when computing eigenvectors: for each eigenvector $v$, the sign flipped $-v$ is also an eigenvector. More generally, higher dimensional eigenspaces contain infinitely many choices of basis eigenvectors. These ambiguities make it a challenge to process eigenvectors and eigenspaces in a consistent way. In this work we introduce SignNet and BasisNet -- new neural architectures that are invariant to all requisite symmetries and hence process collections of eigenspaces in a principled manner. Our networks are universal, i.e., they can approximate any continuous function of eigenvectors with the proper invariances. They are also theoretically strong for graph representation learning -- they can approximate any spectral graph convolution, can compute spectral invariants that go beyond message passing neural networks, and can provably simulate previously proposed graph positional encodings. Experiments show the strength of our networks for learning spectral graph filters and learning graph positional encodings. ",

In contrast to previous methods, our process is not limited to scenes viewed under controlled lighting conditions but can handle complex indoor and outdoor scenes viewed under arbitrary illumination conditions. An end-to-end process uses a model of the scene's geometry and several images capturing the scene's surfaces from arbitrary viewpoints and under various natural illumination conditions. We develop a differentiable path tracer that leverages least-square conformal mapping for handling multiple disjoint objects appearing in the scene. We follow a two-step optimization process and introduce a multi-view gradient consistency loss which results in up to 30-50% improvement in the image reconstruction loss and can further achieve better disentanglement of the diffuse and specular BRDFs compared to other state-of-the-art. We demonstrate the process in real-world indoor and outdoor scenes from images in the wild and show that we can produce realistic renders consistent with actual images using the estimated reflectance properties. Experiments show that our technique produces realistic results for arbitrary outdoor scenes with complex geometry.

One of the most popular type of models is graph attention networks. These models were introduced to allow a node to aggregate information from the features of neighbor nodes in a non-uniform way in contrast to simple graph convolution which does not distinguish the neighbors of a node. In this paper, we study theoretically this expected behaviour of graph attention networks. We prove multiple results on the performance of the graph attention mechanism for the problem of node classification for a contextual stochastic block model. Here the features of the nodes are obtained from a mixture of Gaussians and the edges from a stochastic block model where the features and the edges are coupled in a natural way. First, we show that in an \"easy\" regime, where the distance between the means of the Gaussians is large enough, graph attention maintains the weights of intra-class edges and significantly reduces the weights of the inter-class edges. As a corollary, we show that this implies perfect node classification independent of the weights of inter-class edges. However, a classical argument shows that in the \"easy\" regime, the graph is not needed at all to classify the data with high probability. In the \"hard\" regime, we show that every attention mechanism fails to distinguish intra-class from inter-class edges. We evaluate our theoretical results on synthetic and real-world data. ",

Then the identity can be extracted to prove the copyright from the watermarked carrier even after suffering various attacks. Most of the existing watermarking technologies take the nature images as carriers. Different from the natural images, document images are not so rich in color and texture, and thus have less redundant information to carry watermarks. This paper proposes an end-to-end document image watermarking scheme using the deep neural network. Specifically, an encoder and a decoder are designed to embed and extract the watermark. A noise layer is added to simulate the various attacks that could be encountered in reality, such as the Cropout, Dropout, Gaussian blur, Gaussian noise, Resize, and JPEG Compression. A text-sensitive loss function is designed to limit the embedding modification on characters. An embedding strength adjustment strategy is proposed to improve the quality of watermarked image with little loss of extraction accuracy. Experimental results show that the proposed document image watermarking technology outperforms three state-of-the-arts in terms of the robustness and image quality. ",

However, more recently joint models for intent classification and slot filling have achieved state-of-the-art performance, and have proved that there exists a strong relationship between the two tasks. In this paper, we propose a bi-directional joint model for intent classification and slot filling, which includes a multi-stage hierarchical process via BERT and bi-directional joint natural language understanding mechanisms, including intent2slot and slot2intent, to obtain mutual performance enhancement between intent classification and slot filling. The evaluations show that our model achieves state-of-the-art results on intent classification accuracy, slot filling F1, and significantly improves sentence-level semantic frame accuracy when applied to publicly available benchmark datasets, ATIS (88.6%) and SNIPS (92.8%).

    "abstract": "To meet the need of computation-sensitive (CS) and high-rate (HR) communications, the framework of mobile edge computing and caching has been widely regarded as a promising solution. When such a framework is implemented in small-cell IoT (Internet of Tings) networks, it is a key and open topic how to assign mobile edge computing and caching servers to mobile devices (MDs) with CS and HR communications. Since these servers are integrated into small base stations (BSs), the assignment of them refers to not only the BS selection (i.e., MD association), but also the selection of computing and caching modes. To mitigate the network interference and thus enhance the system performance, some highly-effective resource partitioning mechanisms are introduced for access and backhaul links firstly. After that a problem with minimizing the sum of MDs' weighted delays is formulated to attain a goal of joint MD association and resource allocation under limited resources. Considering that the MD association and resource allocation parameters are coupling in such a formulated problem, we develop an alternating optimization algorithm according to the coalitional game and convex optimization theorems. To ensure that the designed algorithm begins from a feasible initial solution, we develop an initiation algorithm according to the conventional best channel association, which is used for comparison and the input of coalition game in the simulation. Simulation results show that the algorithm designed for minimizing the sum of MDs' weighted delays may achieve a better performance than the initiation (best channel association) algorithm in general.

    "abstract": "The development of accurate and scalable cross-modal image-text retrieval methods, where queries from one modality (e.g., text) can be matched to archive entries from another (e.g., remote sensing image) has attracted great attention in remote sensing (RS). Most of the existing methods assume that a reliable multi-modal training set with accurately matched text-image pairs is existing. However, this assumption may not always hold since the multi-modal training sets may include noisy pairs (i.e., textual descriptions/captions associated to training images can be noisy), distorting the learning process of the retrieval methods. To address this problem, we propose a novel unsupervised cross-modal hashing method robust to the noisy image-text correspondences (CHNR). CHNR consists of three modules: 1) feature extraction module, which extracts feature representations of image-text pairs; 2) noise detection module, which detects potential noisy correspondences; and 3) hashing module that generates cross-modal binary hash codes. The proposed CHNR includes two training phases: i) meta-learning phase that uses a small portion of clean (i.e., reliable) data to train the noise detection module in an adversarial fashion; and ii) the main training phase for which the trained noise detection module is used to identify noisy correspondences while the hashing module is trained on the noisy multi-modal training set. Experimental results show that the proposed CHNR outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Our code is publicly available at https://git.tu-berlin.de/rsim/chnr ",

From our analysis, we observe that models trained with different OCCF objectives capture distinct aspects of user-item relationships, which in turn produces complementary recommendations. This paper proposes a novel OCCF framework, named ConCF, that exploits the complementarity from heterogeneous objectives throughout the training process, generating a more generalizable model. ConCF constructs a multi-branch variant of a given target model by adding auxiliary heads, each of which is trained with heterogeneous objectives. Then, it generates consensus by consolidating the various views from the heads, and guides the heads based on the consensus. The heads are collaboratively evolved based on their complementarity throughout the training, which again results in generating more accurate consensus iteratively. After training, we convert the multi-branch architecture back to the original target model by removing the auxiliary heads, thus there is no extra inference cost for the deployment. Our extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that ConCF significantly improves the generalization of the model by exploiting the complementarity from heterogeneous objectives. ",

    "abstract": "Semantic segmentation algorithms require access to well-annotated datasets captured under diverse illumination conditions to ensure consistent performance. However, poor visibility conditions at varying illumination conditions result in laborious and error-prone labeling. Alternatively, using synthetic samples to train segmentation algorithms has gained interest with the drawback of domain gap that results in sub-optimal performance. While current state-of-the-art (SoTA) have proposed different mechanisms to bridge the domain gap, they still perform poorly in low illumination conditions with an average performance drop of - 10.7 mIOU. In this paper, we focus upon single source domain generalization to overcome the domain gap and propose a two-step framework wherein we first identify an adversarial style that maximizes the domain gap between stylized and source images. Subsequently, these stylized images are used to categorically align features such that features belonging to the same class are clustered together in latent space, irrespective of domain gap. Furthermore, to increase intra-class variance while training, we propose a style mixing mechanism wherein the same objects from different styles are mixed to construct a new training image. This framework allows us to achieve a domain generalized semantic segmentation algorithm with consistent performance without prior information of the target domain while relying on a single source. Based on extensive experiments, we match SoTA performance on SYNTHIA $\\to$ Cityscapes, GTAV $\\to$ Cityscapes while setting new SoTA on GTAV $\\to$ Dark Zurich and GTAV $\\to$ Night Driving benchmarks without retraining.

Unlike previous few-shot NeRF approaches, our pipeline is unsupervised, capable of being trained with independent images without 3D, multi-view, or pose supervision.

Collecting sketches for training is a slow and tedious process that has so far precluded any attempts to large-scale sketch recognition. We overcome the lack of training sketch data by exploiting labeled collections of natural images that are easier to obtain. To bridge the domain gap we present a novel augmentation technique that is tailored to the task of learning sketch recognition from a training set of natural images. Randomization is introduced in the parameters of edge detection and edge selection. Natural images are translated to a pseudo-novel domain called \"randomized Binary Thin Edges\" (rBTE), which is used as a training domain instead of natural images. The ability to scale up is demonstrated by training CNN-based sketch recognition of more than 2.5 times larger number of categories than used previously. For this purpose, a dataset of natural images from 874 categories is constructed by combining a number of popular computer vision datasets. The categories are selected to be suitable for sketch recognition. To estimate the performance, a subset of 393 categories with sketches is also collected. ",

We aim to fill in some of these blanks through a systematic evaluation of the largest existing models: Codex, GPT-J, GPT-Neo, GPT-NeoX-20B, and CodeParrot, across various programming languages. Although Codex itself is not open-source, we find that existing open-source models do achieve close results in some programming languages, although targeted mainly for natural language modeling. We further identify an important missing piece in the form of a large open-source model trained exclusively on a multi-lingual corpus of code. We release a new model, PolyCoder, with 2.7B parameters based on the GPT-2 architecture, which was trained on 249GB of code across 12 programming languages on a single machine.

To relieve the burden of labor-intensive labeling, deep unsupervised SOD methods have been proposed to exploit noisy labels generated by handcrafted saliency methods.

In this paper, we propose to learn saliency from synthetic but clean labels, which naturally has higher pixel-labeling quality without the effort of manual annotations. Specifically, we first construct a novel synthetic SOD dataset by a simple copy-paste strategy. Considering the large appearance differences between the synthetic and real-world scenarios, directly training with synthetic data will lead to performance degradation on real-world scenarios. To mitigate this problem, we propose a novel unsupervised domain adaptive SOD method to adapt between these two domains by uncertainty-aware self-training. Experimental results show that our proposed method outperforms the existing state-of-the-art deep unsupervised SOD methods on several benchmark datasets, and is even comparable to fully-supervised ones.

The high performance of modern neural network-based MRC systems depends on high-quality, large-scale, human-annotated training datasets. In the biomedical domain, a crucial challenge in creating such datasets is the requirement for domain knowledge, inducing the scarcity of labeled data and the need for transfer learning from the labeled general-purpose (source) domain to the biomedical (target) domain. However, there is a discrepancy in marginal distributions between the general-purpose and biomedical domains due to the variances in topics. Therefore, direct-transferring of learned representations from a model trained on a general-purpose domain to the biomedical domain can hurt the model's performance. Results: We present an adversarial learning-based domain adaptation framework for the biomedical machine reading comprehension task (BioADAPT-MRC), a neural network-based method to address the discrepancies in the marginal distributions between the general and biomedical domain datasets. BioADAPT-MRC relaxes the need for generating pseudo labels for training a well-performing biomedical-MRC model. We extensively evaluate the performance of BioADAPT-MRC by comparing it with the best existing methods on three widely used benchmark biomedical-MRC datasets -- BioASQ-7b, BioASQ-8b, and BioASQ-9b. Our results suggest that without using any synthetic or human-annotated data from the biomedical domain, BioADAPT-MRC can achieve state-of-the-art performance on these datasets.

The current algorithms available on targeted sequence querying are based on specific scenarios and cannot be generalized to other applications. In this paper, we formulate the problem of targeted sequential pattern mining and propose a generic framework namely TaSPM, based on the fast CM-SPAM algorithm. What's more, to improve the efficiency of TaSPM on large-scale datasets and multiple-items-based sequence datasets, we propose several pruning strategies to reduce meaningless operations in mining processes. Totally four pruning strategies are designed in TaSPM, and hence it can terminate unnecessary pattern extensions quickly and achieve better performance. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on different datasets to compare the existing SPM algorithms with TaSPM. Experiments show that the novel targeted mining algorithm TaSPM can achieve faster running time and less memory consumption. ",

However, during their operation, they may suffer from the occurrence of the cavitation, which can cause loud noise, vibration and damage to the internal components of the valve. Therefore, monitoring the flow status inside valves is significantly beneficial to prevent the additional cost induced by cavitation. In this paper, a novel acoustic signal cavitation detection framework--based on XGBoost with adaptive selection feature engineering--is proposed. Firstly, a data augmentation method with non-overlapping sliding window (NOSW) is developed to solve small-sample problem involved in this study. Then, the each segmented piece of time-domain acoustic signal is transformed by fast Fourier transform (FFT) and its statistical features are extracted to be the input to the adaptive selection feature engineering (ASFE) procedure, where the adaptive feature aggregation and feature crosses are performed. Finally, with the selected features the XGBoost algorithm is trained for cavitation detection and tested on valve acoustic signal data provided by Samson AG (Frankfurt). Our method has achieved state-of-the-art results. The prediction performance on the binary classification (cavitation and no-cavitation) and the four-class classification (cavitation choked flow, constant cavitation, incipient cavitation and no-cavitation) are satisfactory and outperform the traditional XGBoost by 4.67% and 11.11% increase of the accuracy.

    "abstract": "Online learning in large-scale structured bandits is known to be challenging due to the curse of dimensionality. In this paper, we propose a unified meta-learning framework for a general class of structured bandit problems where the parameter space can be factorized to item-level. The novel bandit algorithm is general to be applied to many popular problems,scalable to the huge parameter and action spaces, and robust to the specification of the generalization model. At the core of this framework is a Bayesian hierarchical model that allows information sharing among items via their features, upon which we design a meta Thompson sampling algorithm. Three representative examples are discussed thoroughly. Both theoretical analysis and numerical results support the usefulness of the proposed method. ",

The proposed approach consists in minimizing pairwise ranking loss over blocks of consecutive items constituted by a sequence of non-clicked items followed by a clicked one for each user. We present two variants of this strategy where model parameters are updated using either the momentum method or a gradient-based approach. To prevent updating the parameters for an abnormally high number of clicks over some targeted items (mainly due to bots), we introduce an upper and a lower threshold on the number of updates for each user. These thresholds are estimated over the distribution of the number of blocks in the training set. They affect the decision of RS by shifting the distribution of items that are shown to the users. Furthermore, we provide a convergence analysis of both algorithms and demonstrate their practical efficiency over six large-scale collections with respect to various ranking measures. ",

In practice, it is vital to precisely identify abnormal status of the working mechanical system, which can further facilitate the failure troubleshooting. In this paper, we propose a multi-pattern adversarial learning one-class classification framework, which allows us to use both the generator and the discriminator of an adversarial model for efficient ASD. The core idea is learning to reconstruct the normal patterns of acoustic data through two different patterns of auto-encoding generators, which succeeds in extending the fundamental role of a discriminator from identifying real and fake data to distinguishing between regional and local pattern reconstructions. Furthermore, we present a global filter layer for long-term interactions in the frequency domain space, which directly learns from the original data without introducing any human priors. Extensive experiments performed on four real-world datasets from different industrial domains (three cavitation datasets provided by SAMSON AG, and one existing publicly) for anomaly detection show superior results, and outperform recent state-of-the-art ASD methods.

When setup permits, multi-view fusion can provide increased levels of depth completion. However, due to the slow acquisition speed of high-end active stereo cameras, collecting a large number of viewpoints for a single scene is generally not practical. In this work, we propose a next-best-view framework to strategically select camera viewpoints for completing depth data on reflective objects. In particular, we explicitly model the specular reflection of reflective surfaces based on the Phong reflection model and a photometric response function. Given the object CAD model and grayscale image, we employ an RGB-based pose estimator to obtain current pose predictions from the existing data, which is used to form predicted surface normal and depth hypotheses, and allows us to then assess the information gain from a subsequent frame for any candidate viewpoint. Using this formulation, we implement an active perception pipeline which is evaluated on a challenging real-world dataset. The evaluation results demonstrate that our active depth acquisition method outperforms two strong baselines for both depth completion and object pose estimation performance. ",

    "abstract": "The very high spatial resolution (VHR) remote sensing images have been an extremely valuable source for monitoring changes occurred on the earth surface. However, precisely detecting relevant changes in VHR images still remains a challenge, due to the complexity of the relationships among ground objects. To address this limitation, a dual neighborhood hypergraph neural network is proposed in this article, which combines the multiscale superpixel segmentation and hypergraph convolution to model and exploit the complex relationships. First, the bi-temporal image pairs are segmented under two scales and fed to a pre-trained U-net to obtain node features by treating each object under the fine scale as a node. The dual neighborhood is then defined using the father-child and adjacent relationships of the segmented objects to construct the hypergraph, which permits models to represent the higher-order structured information far more complex than just pairwise relationships. The hypergraph convolutions are conducted on the constructed hypergraph to propagate the label information from a small amount of labeled nodes to the other unlabeled ones by the node-edge-node transform. Moreover, to alleviate the problem of imbalanced sample, the focal loss function is adopted to train the hypergraph neural network. The experimental results on optical, SAR and heterogeneous optical/SAR data sets demonstrate that the proposed method comprises better effectiveness and robustness compared to many state-of-the-art methods.

In an instance of the $(p,q)$-Flexible Graph Connectivity problem, denoted $(p,q)$-FGC, we have an undirected connected graph $G = (V,E)$, a partition of $E$ into a set of safe edges $S$ and a set of unsafe edges $U$, and nonnegative costs $c: E\\to\\Re$ on the edges. A subset $F \\subseteq E$ of edges is feasible for the $(p,q)$-FGC problem if for any subset $F'$ of unsafe edges with $|F'|\\leq q$, the subgraph $(V, F \\setminus F')$ is $p$-edge connected. The algorithmic goal is to find a feasible solution $F$ that minimizes $c(F) = \\sum_{e \\in F} c_e$. We present a simple $2$-approximation algorithm for the $(1,1)$-FGC problem via a reduction to the minimum-cost rooted $2$-arborescence problem. This improves on the $2.527$-approximation algorithm of Adjiashvili et al. Our $2$-approximation algorithm for the $(1,1)$-FGC problem extends to a $(k+1)$-approximation algorithm for the $(1,k)$-FGC problem. We present a $4$-approximation algorithm for the $(p,1)$-FGC problem, and an $O(q\\log|V|)$-approximation algorithm for the $(p,q)$-FGC problem. Finally, we improve on the result of Adjiashvili et al. for the unweighted $(1,1)$-FGC problem by presenting a $16/11$-approximation algorithm. The $(p,q)$-FGC problem is related to the well-known Capacitated $k$-Connected Subgraph problem (denoted Cap-k-ECSS) that arises in the area of Capacitated Network Design.

However, many previous works employ neural networks with fixed architecture and size to represent different 3D objects, which lead to excessive network parameters for simple objects and limited reconstruction accuracy for complex objects. For each 3D model, it is desirable to have an end-to-end neural network with as few parameters as possible to achieve high-fidelity reconstruction. In this paper, we propose an efficient model reconstruction method utilizing neural architecture search (NAS) and binary classification. Taking the number of layers, the number of nodes in each layer, and the activation function of each layer as the search space, a specific network architecture can be obtained based on reinforcement learning technology. Furthermore, to get rid of the traditional surface reconstruction algorithms (e.g., marching cube) used after network inference, we complete the end-to-end network by classifying binary voxels. Compared to other signed distance field (SDF) prediction or binary classification networks, our method achieves significantly higher reconstruction accuracy using fewer network parameters. ",

DBF-Net contains a TC features branch that extracts temporal features from 1D inherent features of TCs and a pressure field branch that extracts spatio-temporal features from reanalysis 2D pressure field. Through the encoder-decoder-based architecture and efficient feature fusion, DBF-Net can fully mine the information of the two types of data, and achieve good TCs track prediction results.

To assert a certain level of robustness, we perturb the off-policy estimators along an adversarial direction in view of the runtime uncertainty. It allows the resulting estimators to be robust not only to observed but also unexpected runtime uncertainties. Leveraging this idea, we bring runtime-uncertainty robustness to three major off-policy learning methods: the inverse propensity score method, reward-model method, and doubly robust method.

    "abstract": "Co-registration of multimodal remote sensing images is still an ongoing challenge because of nonlinear radiometric differences (NRD) and significant geometric distortions (e.g., scale and rotation changes) between these images. In this paper, a robust matching method based on the Steerable filters is proposed consisting of two critical steps. First, to address severe NRD, a novel structural descriptor named the Steerable Filters of first- and second-Order Channels (SFOC) is constructed, which combines the first- and second-order gradient information by using the steerable filters with a multi-scale strategy to depict more discriminative structure features of images. Then, a fast similarity measure is established called Fast Normalized Cross-Correlation (Fast-NCCSFOC), which employs the Fast Fourier Transform technique and the integral image to improve the matching efficiency. Furthermore, to achieve reliable registration performance, a coarse-to-fine multimodal registration system is designed consisting of two pivotal modules. The local coarse registration is first conducted by involving both detection of interest points (IPs) and local geometric correction, which effectively utilizes the prior georeferencing information of RS images to address global geometric distortions. In the fine registration stage, the proposed SFOC is used to resist significant NRD, and to detect control points between multimodal images by a template matching scheme. The performance of the proposed matching method has been evaluated with many different kinds of multimodal RS images. The results show its superior matching performance compared with the state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, the designed registration system also outperforms the popular commercial software in both registration accuracy and computational efficiency.

In this paper, we delve into structure reliability for accurate self-supervised ego-motion estimation and aim to alleviate the influence of unreliable structures in training, inference and mapping phases. We improve the self-supervised LiDAR odometry substantially from three aspects: 1) A two-stage odometry estimation network is developed, where we obtain the ego-motion by estimating a set of sub-region transformations and averaging them with a motion voting mechanism, to encourage the network focusing on representative structures. 2) The inherent alignment errors, which cannot be eliminated via ego-motion optimization, are down-weighted in losses based on the 3D point covariance estimations. 3) The discovered representative structures and learned point covariances are incorporated in the mapping module to improve the robustness of map construction. Our two-frame odometry outperforms the previous state of the arts by 16%/12% in terms of translational/rotational errors on the KITTI dataset and performs consistently well on the Apollo-Southbay datasets.

    "abstract": "This work proposes a comprehensively progressive Bayesian neural network for robust continual learning of a sequence of tasks. A Bayesian neural network is progressively pruned and grown such that there are sufficient network resources to represent a sequence of tasks, while the network does not explode. It starts with the contention that similar tasks should have the same number of total network resources, to ensure fair representation of all tasks in a continual learning scenario. Thus, as the data for new task streams in, sufficient neurons are added to the network such that the total number of neurons in each layer of the network, including the shared representations with previous tasks and individual task related representation, are equal for all tasks. The weights that are redundant at the end of training each task are also pruned through re-initialization, in order to be efficiently utilized in the subsequent task. Thus, the network grows progressively, but ensures effective utilization of network resources. We refer to our proposed method as 'Robust Continual Learning through a Comprehensively Progressive Bayesian Neural Network (RCL-CPB)' and evaluate the proposed approach on the MNIST data set, under three different continual learning scenarios. Further to this, we evaluate the performance of RCL-CPB on a homogeneous sequence of tasks using split CIFAR100 (20 tasks of 5 classes each), and a heterogeneous sequence of tasks using MNIST, SVHN and CIFAR10 data sets. The demonstrations and the performance results show that the proposed strategies for progressive BNN enable robust continual learning. ",

    "abstract": "Modelling and simulation of mixed-traffic zones is an important tool for transportation planners to assess safety, efficiency, and human-friendliness of future urban areas. This paper addresses problems of calibration and transferability of existing shared space models when applied to scenarios that differ in terms of cultural aspects, traffic conditions, and spatial layout. In particular, the first contribution of this work is an enhancement of the Game-Theoretic Social Force Model (GSFM) by a generic methodology for largely automated model calibration; we illustrate the use of the calibration method for a shared space environment in Germany. The second contribution is an investigation into transferability of shared space models. We define criteria for model transferability and present a case study, in which we analyse and evaluate transferability of the model we constructed based on the ``German dataset'' to a different shared space environment from China. Our results indicate that although -- as to be expected -- the model faces difficulties to replicate the movement behaviours of road users from a new environment, by adding social norms (derived through analysis) of that environment to our model, satisfactory improvement of model accuracy can be obtained with limited effort.

    "title": "The Art of Manipulation: Threat of Multi-Step Manipulative Attacks in  Security Games",
    "abstract": "This paper studies the problem of multi-step manipulative attacks in Stackelberg security games, in which a clever attacker attempts to orchestrate its attacks over multiple time steps to mislead the defender's learning of the attacker's behavior. This attack manipulation eventually influences the defender's patrol strategy towards the attacker's benefit. Previous work along this line of research only focuses on one-shot games in which the defender learns the attacker's behavior and then designs a corresponding strategy only once. Our work, on the other hand, investigates the long-term impact of the attacker's manipulation in which current attack and defense choices of players determine the future learning and patrol planning of the defender. This paper has three key contributions. First, we introduce a new multi-step manipulative attack game model that captures the impact of sequential manipulative attacks carried out by the attacker over the entire time horizon. Second, we propose a new algorithm to compute an optimal manipulative attack plan for the attacker, which tackles the challenge of multiple connected optimization components involved in the computation across multiple time steps. Finally, we present extensive experimental results on the impact of such misleading attacks, showing a significant benefit for the attacker and loss for the defender. ",

    "abstract": "Spatio-temporal graphs (ST-graphs) have been used to model time series tasks such as traffic forecasting, human motion modeling, and action recognition. The high-level structure and corresponding features from ST-graphs have led to improved performance over traditional architectures. However, current methods tend to be limited by simple features, despite the rich information provided by the full graph structure, which leads to inefficiencies and suboptimal performance in downstream tasks. We propose the use of features derived from meta-paths, walks across different types of edges, in ST-graphs to improve the performance of Structural Recurrent Neural Network. In this paper, we present the Meta-path Enhanced Structural Recurrent Neural Network (MESRNN), a generic framework that can be applied to any spatio-temporal task in a simple and scalable manner. We employ MESRNN for pedestrian trajectory prediction, utilizing these meta-path based features to capture the relationships between the trajectories of pedestrians at different points in time and space. We compare our MESRNN against state-of-the-art ST-graph methods on standard datasets to show the performance boost provided by meta-path information. The proposed model consistently outperforms the baselines in trajectory prediction over long time horizons by over 32\\%, and produces more socially compliant trajectories in dense crowds.

Recently, research on the expressive power of GNN attracted growing attention. A highly-expressive GNN has the ability to generate discriminative graph representations. However, in the end-to-end training process for a certain graph learning task, a highly-expressive GNN risks generating graph representations overfitting the training data for the target task, while losing information important for the model generalization. In this paper, we propose Distribution Preserving GNN (DP-GNN) - a GNN framework that can improve the generalizability of expressive GNN models by preserving several kinds of distribution information in graph representations and node representations. Besides the generalizability, by applying an expressive GNN backbone, DP-GNN can also have high expressive power. We evaluate the proposed DP-GNN framework on multiple benchmark datasets for graph classification tasks. The experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performances. ",

Long term demographic changes, geographic shortages of care providers, and now a global pandemic contribute to this need. Telepresence provides an option for delivering this care. However, telepresence using video and audio alone does not provide an interaction of the same quality as in-person. To bridge this gap, we propose the use of social robot augmented telepresence (SRAT). We have constructed a demonstration SRAT system for upper extremity rehab, in which a humanoid, with a head, body, face, and arms, is attached to a mobile telepresence system, to collaborate with the patient and clinicians as an independent social entity. The humanoid can play games with the patient and demonstrate activities.These activities could be used both to perform assessments in support of self-directed rehab and to perform exercises. In this paper, we present a case series with six subjects who completed interactions with the robot, three subjects who have previously suffered a stroke and three pediatric subjects who are typically developing. Subjects performed a Simon Says activity and a target touch activity in person, using classical telepresence (CT), and using SRAT. Subjects were able to effectively work with the social robot guiding interactions and 5 of 6 rated SRAT better than CT. This study demonstrates the feasibility of SRAT and some of its benefits. ",

    "abstract": "It is well-known that deep neural networks (DNNs) are susceptible to adversarial attacks, exposing a severe fragility of deep learning systems. As the result, adversarial training (AT) method, by incorporating adversarial examples during training, represents a natural and effective approach to strengthen the robustness of a DNN-based classifier. However, most AT-based methods, notably PGD-AT and TRADES, typically seek a pointwise adversary that generates the worst-case adversarial example by independently perturbing each data sample, as a way to \"probe\" the vulnerability of the classifier. Arguably, there are unexplored benefits in considering such adversarial effects from an entire distribution. To this end, this paper presents a unified framework that connects Wasserstein distributional robustness with current state-of-the-art AT methods. We introduce a new Wasserstein cost function and a new series of risk functions, with which we show that standard AT methods are special cases of their counterparts in our framework. This connection leads to an intuitive relaxation and generalization of existing AT methods and facilitates the development of a new family of distributional robustness AT-based algorithms. Extensive experiments show that our distributional robustness AT algorithms robustify further their standard AT counterparts in various settings. ",

    "abstract": "Regulatory networks (RNs) are a well-accepted modelling formalism in computational systems biology. The control of RNs is currently receiving a lot of attention because it provides a computational basis for cell reprogramming -- an attractive technology developed in regenerative medicine. By solving the control problem, we learn which parts of a biological system should be perturbed to stabilise the system in the desired phenotype. We allow the specification of the Boolean model representing a given RN to be incomplete. To that end, we utilise the formalism of partially specified Boolean networks which covers every possible behaviour of unspecified parts of the system. Such an approach causes a significant state explosion. This problem is addressed by using symbolic methods to represent both the unspecified model parts and all possible perturbations of the system. Additionally, to make the control design efficient and practically applicable, the optimal control should be minimal in terms of size. Moreover, in a partially specified model, a control may achieve the desired stabilisation only for a subset of the possible fully specified model instantiations. To address these aspects, we utilise several quantitative measures. Apart from the size of perturbation, we also examine its robustness -- a portion of instantiations for which the control is applicable. We show that proposed symbolic methods solving the control problem for partially specified BNs are efficient and scale well. We also evaluate the robustness metrics in cases of all three studied control types. The robustness metric tells us how big a proportion of fully defined systems the given perturbation works. Our experiments support the hypothesis that one-step perturbations may be less robust than temporary or permanent perturbations. This is a full version of a paper that is submitted to a journal. ",

    "abstract": "The contextual word embedding model, BERT, has proved its ability on downstream tasks with limited quantities of annotated data. BERT and its variants help to reduce the burden of complex annotation work in many interdisciplinary research areas, for example, legal argument mining in digital humanities. Argument mining aims to develop text analysis tools that can automatically retrieve arguments and identify relationships between argumentation clauses. Since argumentation is one of the key aspects of case law, argument mining tools for legal texts are applicable to both academic and non-academic legal research. Domain-specific BERT variants (pre-trained with corpora from a particular background) have also achieved strong performance in many tasks. To our knowledge, previous machine learning studies of argument mining on judicial case law still heavily rely on statistical models. In this paper, we provide a broad study of both classic and contextual embedding models and their performance on practical case law from the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR). During our study, we also explore a number of neural networks when being combined with different embeddings. Our experiments provide a comprehensive overview of a variety of approaches to the legal argument mining task. We conclude that domain pre-trained transformer models have great potential in this area, although traditional embeddings can also achieve strong performance when combined with additional neural network layers.

In this paper, we propose UCTopic, a novel unsupervised contrastive learning framework for context-aware phrase representations and topic mining. UCTopic is pretrained in a large scale to distinguish if the contexts of two phrase mentions have the same semantics. The key to pretraining is positive pair construction from our phrase-oriented assumptions. However, we find traditional in-batch negatives cause performance decay when finetuning on a dataset with small topic numbers. Hence, we propose cluster-assisted contrastive learning(CCL) which largely reduces noisy negatives by selecting negatives from clusters and further improves phrase representations for topics accordingly. UCTopic outperforms the state-of-the-art phrase representation model by 38.2% NMI in average on four entity cluster-ing tasks. Comprehensive evaluation on topic mining shows that UCTopic can extract coherent and diverse topical phrases. ",

We present three new attacks on QI-deidentification: two theoretical attacks and one practical attack on a real dataset. In contrast to prior work, our theoretical attacks work even if every attribute is a quasi-identifier. Hence, they apply to $k$-anonymity, $\\ell$-diversity, $t$-closeness, and most other QI-deidentification techniques. First, we introduce a new class of privacy attacks called downcoding attacks, and prove that every QI-deidentification scheme is vulnerable to downcoding attacks if it is minimal and hierarchical. Second, we convert the downcoding attacks into powerful predicate singling-out (PSO) attacks, which were recently proposed as a way to demonstrate that a privacy mechanism fails to legally anonymize under Europe's General Data Protection Regulation. Third, we use LinkedIn.com to reidentify 3 students in a $k$-anonymized dataset published by EdX (and show thousands are potentially vulnerable), undermining EdX's claimed compliance with the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act. The significance of this work is both scientific and political. Our theoretical attacks demonstrate that QI-deidentification may offer no protection even if every attribute is treated as a quasi-identifier. Our practical attack demonstrates that even deidentification experts acting in accordance with strict privacy regulations fail to prevent real-world reidentification. Together, they rebut a foundational tenet of QI-deidentification and challenge the actual arguments made to justify the continued use of $k$-anonymity and other QI-deidentification techniques. ",

ONE-NAS is tested on real-world large-scale multivariate wind turbine data as well a univariate Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) dataset, and is shown to outperform traditional statistical time series forecasting, including naive, moving average, and exponential smoothing methods, as well as state of the art online ARIMA strategies.

Causal DA is a special case of DA that solves the problem from the view of causality. It embeds the probabilistic relationships in multiple domains in a larger causal structure network of a system and tries to find the causal source (or intervention) on the system as the reason of distribution drifts of the system states across domains. In this sense, causal DA is transformed as a causal discovery problem that finds invariant representation across domains through the conditional independence between the state variables and observable state of the system given interventions. Testing conditional independence is the corner stone of causal discovery. Recently, a copula entropy based conditional independence test was proposed with a rigorous theory and a non-parametric estimation method. In this paper, we first present a mathemetical model for causal DA problem and then propose a method for causal DA that finds the invariant representation across domains with the copula entropy based conditional independence test. The effectiveness of the method is verified on two simulated data.

With the rapid proliferation of such online services, learning data-driven user behavior models is indispensable to enable personalized user experiences. Recently, representation learning has emerged as an effective strategy for user modeling, powered by neural networks trained over large volumes of interaction data. Despite their enormous potential, we encounter the unique challenge of data sparsity for a vast majority of entities, e.g., sparsity in ground-truth labels for entities and in entity-level interactions (cold-start users, items in the long-tail, and ephemeral groups). In this dissertation, we develop generalizable neural representation learning frameworks for user behavior modeling designed to address different sparsity challenges across applications. Our problem settings span transductive and inductive learning scenarios, where transductive learning models entities seen during training and inductive learning targets entities that are only observed during inference. We leverage different facets of information reflecting user behavior (e.g., interconnectivity in social networks, temporal and attributed interaction information) to enable personalized inference at scale. Our proposed models are complementary to concurrent advances in neural architectural choices and are adaptive to the rapid addition of new applications in online platforms. ",

Instead, the GCN output approaches a subspace spanned by the first eigenvector of the normalized graph Laplacian matrix with the convergence rate characterized by the \"eigen-gap\": the difference between the Laplacian's first two distinct eigenvalues. To promote a deeper GCN architecture with sufficient expressiveness, in this paper, given an empirical covariance matrix $\\bar{C}$ computed from observable data, we learn a sparse graph Laplacian matrix $L$ closest to $\\bar{C}^{-1}$ while maintaining a desirable eigen-gap that slows down convergence. Specifically, we first define a sparse graph learning problem with constraints on the first eigenvector (the most common signal) and the eigen-gap. We solve the corresponding dual problem greedily, where a locally optimal eigen-pair is computed one at a time via a fast approximation of a semi-definite programming (SDP) formulation. The computed $L$ with the desired eigen-gap is normalized spectrally and used for supervised training of GCN for a targeted task. Experiments show that our proposal produced deeper GCNs and smaller errors compared to a competing scheme without explicit eigen-gap optimization. ",

    "abstract": "Subgraph-based graph representation learning (SGRL) has been recently proposed to deal with some fundamental challenges encountered by canonical graph neural networks (GNNs), and has demonstrated advantages in many important data science applications such as link, relation and motif prediction. However, current SGRL approaches suffer from a scalability issue since they require extracting subgraphs for each training and testing query. Recent solutions that scale up canonical GNNs may not apply to SGRL. Here, we propose a novel framework SUREL for scalable SGRL by co-designing the learning algorithm and its system support. SUREL adopts walk-based decomposition of subgraphs and reuses the walks to form subgraphs, which substantially reduces the redundancy of subgraph extraction and supports parallel computation. Experiments over seven homogeneous, heterogeneous and higher-order graphs with millions of nodes and edges demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of SUREL. In particular, compared to SGRL baselines, SUREL achieves 10$\\times$ speed-up with comparable or even better prediction performance; while compared to canonical GNNs, SUREL achieves 50% prediction accuracy improvement. SUREL is also applied to the brain vessel prediction task. SUREL significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art baseline in both prediction accuracy and efficiency. ",

    "abstract": "Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) plays pivotal roles in many real-world applications. Despite the successes of GCN deployment, GCN often exhibits performance disparity with respect to node degrees, resulting in worse predictive accuracy for low-degree nodes. We formulate the problem of mitigating the degree-related performance disparity in GCN from the perspective of the Rawlsian difference principle, which is originated from the theory of distributive justice. Mathematically, we aim to balance the utility between low-degree nodes and high-degree nodes while minimizing the task-specific loss. Specifically, we reveal the root cause of this degree-related unfairness by analyzing the gradients of weight matrices in GCN. Guided by the gradients of weight matrices, we further propose a pre-processing method RawlsGCN-Graph and an in-processing method RawlsGCN-Grad that achieves fair predictive accuracy in low-degree nodes without modification on the GCN architecture or introduction of additional parameters. Extensive experiments on real-world graphs demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed RawlsGCN methods in significantly reducing degree-related bias while retaining comparable overall performance.

Meanwhile, deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved very impressive success in various applications such as surveillance and autonomous driving. The convergence of point cloud and DNNs has led to many deep point cloud models, largely trained under the supervision of large-scale and densely-labelled point cloud data. Unsupervised point cloud representation learning, which aims to learn general and useful point cloud representations from unlabelled point cloud data, has recently attracted increasing attention due to the constraint in large-scale point cloud labelling. This paper provides a comprehensive review of unsupervised point cloud representation learning using DNNs. It first describes the motivation, general pipelines as well as terminologies of the recent studies. Relevant background including widely adopted point cloud datasets and DNN architectures is then briefly presented. This is followed by an extensive discussion of existing unsupervised point cloud representation learning methods according to their technical approaches. We also quantitatively benchmark and discuss the reviewed methods over multiple widely adopted point cloud datasets. Finally, we share our humble opinion about several challenges and problems that could be pursued in the future research in unsupervised point cloud representation learning.

However, compression-based approach has a drawback in that generating multiple segmentations is difficult due to the determinism. To overcome this difficulty, we focus on a probabilistic string algorithm, called locally-consistent parsing (LCP), that has been applied to achieve optimum compression. Employing the probabilistic mechanism of LCP, we propose LCP-dropout for multiple subword segmentation that improves BPE/BPE-dropout, and show that it outperforms various baselines in learning from especially small training data.

We propose to introduce a geometric task structure to the representation learning problem that geometrically encodes the task specification from human demonstration videos, and that enables generalization by building task specification correspondence between categorical objects. Specifically, we propose CoVGS-IL, which uses a graph-structured task function to learn task representations under structural constraints. Our method enables task generalization by selecting geometric features from different objects whose inner connection relationships define the same task in geometric constraints. The learned task representation is then transferred to a robot controller using uncalibrated visual servoing (UVS); thus, the need for extra robot training or pre-recorded robot motions is removed.

    "abstract": "In the last decades, researchers, practitioners and companies struggled in devising mechanisms to detect malicious activities originating security threats. Amongst the many solutions, network intrusion detection emerged as one of the most popular to analyze network traffic and detect ongoing intrusions based on rules or by means of Machine Learners (MLs), which process such traffic and learn a model to suspect intrusions. Supervised MLs are very effective in detecting known threats, but struggle in identifying zero-day attacks (unknown during learning phase), which instead can be detected through unsupervised MLs. Unfortunately, there are no definitive answers on the combined use of both approaches for network intrusion detection. In this paper we first expand the problem of zero-day attacks and motivate the need to combine supervised and unsupervised algorithms. We propose the adoption of meta-learning, in the form of a two-layer Stacker, to create a mixed approach that detects both known and unknown threats. Then we implement and empirically evaluate our Stacker through an experimental campaign that allows i) debating on meta-features crafted through unsupervised base-level learners, ii) electing the most promising supervised meta-level classifiers, and iii) benchmarking classification scores of the Stacker with respect to supervised and unsupervised classifiers. Last, we compare our solution with existing works from the recent literature. Overall, our Stacker reduces misclassifications with respect to (un)supervised ML algorithms in all the 7 public datasets we considered, and outperforms existing studies in 6 out of those 7 datasets. In particular, it turns out to be more effective in detecting zero-day attacks than supervised algorithms, limiting their main weakness but still maintaining adequate capabilities in detecting known attacks.

Neural sequential recommendation models, which formulates learning the user-item relevance as a sequential classification problem to distinguish items in future behaviors from others based on the user's historical behaviors, have attracted a lot of interest in both industry and academic due to their substantial practical value. Though achieving many practical successes, we argue that the intrinsic {\\bf incompleteness} and {\\bf inaccuracy} of user behaviors in implicit feedback data is ignored and conduct preliminary experiments for supporting our claims. Motivated by the observation that model-free methods like behavioral retargeting (BR) and item-based collaborative filtering (ItemCF) hit different parts of the user-item relevance compared to neural sequential recommendation models, we propose a novel model-agnostic training approach called WSLRec, which adopts a three-stage framework: pre-training, top-$k$ mining, and fine-tuning. WSLRec resolves the incompleteness problem by pre-training models on extra weak supervisions from model-free methods like BR and ItemCF, while resolves the inaccuracy problem by leveraging the top-$k$ mining to screen out reliable user-item relevance from weak supervisions for fine-tuning. Experiments on two benchmark datasets and online A/B tests verify the rationality of our claims and demonstrate the effectiveness of WSLRec. ",

In a weakly supervised manner, we propose a Spatial Transform AutoEncoder (STAE) to learn an interpretable and controllable representation in which different parts correspond to different object attributes (shape, color, position). Due to the high controllability of the representations, STAE can simply recombine and recode the representations to generate unseen goals for agents to practice themselves. The manifold structure of the learned representation maintains consistency with the physical position, which is beneficial for reward calculation. We empirically demonstrate that DR-GRL significantly outperforms the previous methods in sample efficiency and policy generalization. In addition, DR-GRL is also easy to expand to the real robot. ",

However, under such a challenging but practical setting, the crafted adversarial examples are always prone to overfitting to the proxy model employed, presenting poor transferability. In this paper, we suggest alleviating the overfitting issue from a novel perspective, i.e., designing a fitted model architecture. Specifically, delving the bottom of the cause of poor transferability, we arguably decompose and reconstruct the existing model architecture into an effective model architecture, namely multi-track model architecture (MMA). The adversarial examples crafted on the MMA can maximumly relieve the effect of model-specified features to it and toward the vulnerable directions adopted by diverse architectures. Extensive experimental evaluation demonstrates that the transferability of adversarial examples based on the MMA significantly surpass other state-of-the-art model architectures by up to 40% with comparable overhead.

    "abstract": "Most dominant neural machine translation (NMT) models are restricted to make predictions only according to the local context of preceding words in a left-to-right manner. Although many previous studies try to incorporate global information into NMT models, there still exist limitations on how to effectively exploit bidirectional global context. In this paper, we propose a Confidence Based Bidirectional Global Context Aware (CBBGCA) training framework for NMT, where the NMT model is jointly trained with an auxiliary conditional masked language model (CMLM). The training consists of two stages: (1) multi-task joint training; (2) confidence based knowledge distillation. At the first stage, by sharing encoder parameters, the NMT model is additionally supervised by the signal from the CMLM decoder that contains bidirectional global contexts. Moreover, at the second stage, using the CMLM as teacher, we further pertinently incorporate bidirectional global context to the NMT model on its unconfidently-predicted target words via knowledge distillation. Experimental results show that our proposed CBBGCA training framework significantly improves the NMT model by +1.02, +1.30 and +0.57 BLEU scores on three large-scale translation datasets, namely WMT'14 English-to-German, WMT'19 Chinese-to-English and WMT'14 English-to-French, respectively.

Convolutional neural network (CNN) approaches based on U-shaped structures have achieved remarkable performance in this task. However, the single-stage encoder-decoder unresolvable the inter-class similarity due to the inadequate utilization of contextual information, such as lesion-tissue similarity. In addition, most approaches use fine-grained spatial attention to capture spatial context information, yet fail to generate accurate attention maps in encoding stage and lack effective regularization. In this work, we propose a new network, Triple Context Network (TC-Net), with the capture of spatial contextual information as the core. We firstly design a coarse-grained patch attention module to generate patch-level attention maps in the encoding stage to distinguish targets from patches and learn target-specific detail features. Then, to enrich the representation of boundary information of these features, a cross-feature fusion module with global contextual information is explored to guide the selective aggregation of 2D and 3D feature maps, which compensates for the lack of boundary learning capability of 2D convolution. Finally, we use multi-scale deconvolution instead of linear interpolation to enhance the recovery of target space and boundary information in the decoding stage. Our network is evaluated on the open dataset ATLAS, achieving the highest DSC score of 0.594, Hausdorff distance of 27.005 mm, and average symmetry surface distance of 7.137 mm, where our proposed method outperforms other state-of-the-art methods.

We solve the online version of the problem where slices arrive over time.

The key feature of our algorithm is to observe NRPA cannot exploit knowledge acquired in one branch of the state tree for another one which starts differently. NEPA learns by combining NRPA with Neighbordhood Search in a frugal manner which improves only promising solutions while keeping the running time low. We call this technique a monkey business because it comes down to jumping from one interesting branch to the other, similar to how monkeys jump from tree to tree instead of going down everytime. NEPA achieves better results in terms of acceptance ratio and revenue-to-cost ratio compared to other state-of-the-art algorithms, both on real and synthetic topologies. ",

While these results are disappointing, we still believe that adaptive test-time defenses are a promising avenue of research and, as such, we provide recommendations on evaluating such defenses. We go beyond the checklist provided by Carlini et al. (2019) by providing concrete steps that are specific to this type of defense. ",

    "abstract": "The Max-Cut problem is a fundamental NP-hard problem, which is attracting attention in the field of quantum computation these days. Regarding the approximation algorithm of the Max-Cut problem, algorithms based on semidefinite programming have achieved much better approximation ratios than combinatorial algorithms. Therefore, filling the gap is an interesting topic as combinatorial algorithms also have some merits. In sparse graphs, there is a linear-time combinatorial algorithm with the approximation ratio $\\frac{1}{2}+\\frac{n-1}{4m}$ [Ngoc and Tuza, Comb. Probab. Comput. 1993], which is known as the Edwards-Erd\\H{o}s bound. In subcubic graphs, the combinatorial algorithm by Bazgan and Tuza [Discrete Math. 2008] has the best approximation ratio $\\frac{5}{6}$ that runs in $O(n^2)$ time. Based on the approach by Bazgan and Tuza, we introduce a new vertex decomposition of graphs, which we call tree-bipartite decomposition. With the decomposition, we present a linear-time $(\\frac{1}{2}+\\frac{n-1}{2m})$-approximation algorithm for the Max-Cut problem. As a derivative, we also present a linear-time $\\frac{5}{6}$-approximation algorithm in subcubic graphs, which solves an open problem in their paper. ",

The most comprehensive manifestation of a scientific model, including crucial assumptions and parameters that underpin its usability, is usually embedded in associated source code and documentation, which may employ a variety of (potentially outdated) programming practices and languages. Domain experts cannot gain a complete understanding of the implementation of a scientific model if they are not familiar with the code. Furthermore, rapid research and development iterations make it challenging to keep up with constantly evolving scientific model codebases. To address these challenges, we develop a system for the automated creation and human-assisted curation of a knowledge graph of computable scientific models that analyzes a model's code in the context of any associated inline comments and external documentation. Our system uses knowledge-driven as well as data-driven approaches to identify and extract relevant concepts from code and equations from textual documents to semantically annotate models using domain terminology. These models are converted into executable Python functions and then can further be composed into complex workflows to answer different forms of domain-driven questions.

By analyzing the pose of features and their relative positions, it is more capable to recognize images after affine transformation. The stacked capsule autoencoder (SCAE) is a state-of-the-art CapsNet, and achieved unsupervised classification of CapsNets for the first time. However, the security vulnerabilities and the robustness of the SCAE has rarely been explored. In this paper, we propose an evasion attack against SCAE, where the attacker can generate adversarial perturbations based on reducing the contribution of the object capsules in SCAE related to the original category of the image. The adversarial perturbations are then applied to the original images, and the perturbed images will be misclassified. Furthermore, we propose a defense method called Hybrid Adversarial Training (HAT) against such evasion attacks. HAT makes use of adversarial training and adversarial distillation to achieve better robustness and stability. We evaluate the defense method and the experimental results show that the refined SCAE model can achieve 82.14% classification accuracy under evasion attack.

As maps are naturally graph-structured, investigation on graph neural networks (GNNs) for encoding HD maps is burgeoning in recent years. However, unlike many other applications where GNNs have been straightforwardly deployed, HD maps are heterogeneous graphs where vertices (lanes) are connected by edges (lane-lane interaction relationships) of various nature, and most graph-based models are not designed to understand the variety of edge types which provide crucial cues for predicting how the agents would travel the lanes. To overcome this challenge, we propose Path-Aware Graph Attention, a novel attention architecture that infers the attention between two vertices by parsing the sequence of edges forming the paths that connect them. Our analysis illustrates how the proposed attention mechanism can facilitate learning in a didactic problem where existing graph networks like GCN struggle.

Previous studies often use discrete systems, composed of rigid elements and nonlinear springs, to model the nonlinear dynamic responses of the continuum metamaterials. Yet it remains a challenge to accurately construct such systems based on the geometry of the building blocks of the metamaterial. In this work, we propose a machine learning approach to address this challenge. A metamaterial graph network (MGN) is used to represent the discrete system, where the nodal features contain the positions and orientations the rigid elements, and the edge update functions describe the mechanics of the nonlinear springs. We use Gaussian process regression as the surrogate model to characterize the elastic energy of the nonlinear springs as a function of the relative positions and orientations of the connected rigid elements. The optimal model can be obtained by \"learning\" from the data generated via finite element calculation over the corresponding building block of the continuum metamaterial. Then, we deploy the optimal model to the network so that the dynamics of the metamaterial at the structural scale can be studied. We verify the accuracy of our machine learning approach against several representative numerical examples. In these examples, the proposed approach can significantly reduce the computational cost when compared to direct numerical simulation while reaching comparable accuracy. Moreover, defects and spatial inhomogeneities can be easily incorporated into our approach, which can be useful for the rational design of soft mechanical metamaterials. ",

To address the above challenges, we propose a novel and scalable Commonsense-Aware Knowledge Embedding (CAKE) framework to automatically extract commonsense from factual triples with entity concepts. The generated commonsense augments effective self-supervision to facilitate both high-quality negative sampling (NS) and joint commonsense and fact-view link prediction. Experimental results on the KGC task demonstrate that assembling our framework could enhance the performance of the original KGE models, and the proposed commonsense-aware NS module is superior to other NS techniques.

Specifically, we argue that the original sample should have similar representation with its adversarial counterparts and distinguish its representation from other samples for better robustness. To this end, we adopt the triplet metric learning into the standard training to pull the words closer to their positive samples (i.e., synonyms) and push away their negative samples (i.e., non-synonyms) in the embedding space. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FTML can significantly promote the model robustness against various advanced adversarial attacks while keeping competitive classification accuracy on original samples. Besides, our method is efficient as it only needs to adjust the embedding and introduces very little overhead on the standard training. Our work shows the great potential of improving the textual robustness through robust word embedding. ",

In the present study, I provide a prototype implementation of how one might curb self-modifying code by introducing a control mechanisms for code modifications within specific regions and for specific transitions between code and data. I show that this is possible to achieve with the so-called allagmatic method - an approach to formalise, model, implement, and interpret complex systems inspired by Gilbert Simondon's philosophy of individuation and Alfred North Whitehead's philosophy of organism.

An important capability of a distributed architecture is the ability to reach consensus among all its nodes. To achieve this, several consensus algorithms have been proposed for various scenarii, and many of these algorithms come with proofs of correctness that are not mechanically checked. Unfortunately, those proofs are known to be intricate and prone to errors. In this paper, we formalize and mechanically check a consensus algorithm widely used in the distributed controls community: the Weighted-Mean Subsequence Reduced (W-MSR) algorithm proposed by Le Blanc et al. This algorithm provides a way to achieve asymptotic consensus in a distributed controls scenario in the presence of adversarial agents (attackers) that may not update their states based on the nominal consensus protocol, and may share inaccurate information with their neighbors. Using the Coq proof assistant, we formalize the necessary and sufficient conditions required to achieve resilient asymptotic consensus under the assumed attacker model. We leverage the existing Coq formalizations of graph theory, finite sets and sequences of the mathcomp library for our development. To our knowledge, this is the first mechanical proof of an asymptotic consensus algorithm. During the formalization, we clarify several imprecisions in the paper proof, including an imprecision on quantifiers in the main theorem. ",

    "abstract": "Modern software systems have become increasingly complex, which makes them difficult to test and validate. Detecting software partial anomalies in complex systems at runtime can assist with handling unintended software behaviors, avoiding catastrophic software failures and improving software runtime availability. These detection techniques aim to identify the manifestation of faults (anomalies) before they ultimately lead to unavoidable failures, thus, supporting the following runtime fault-tolerant techniques. In this work, we propose a novel anomaly detection method named DistAD, which is based on the distribution of software runtime dynamic execution traces. Unlike other existing works using key performance indicators, the execution trace is collected during runtime via intrusive instrumentation. Instrumentation are controlled following a sampling mechanism to avoid excessive overheads. Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM), an architecture of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) is used to achieve the anomaly detection. The whole framework is constructed under a One-Class Neural Network (OCNN) learning mode which can help eliminate the limits of lacking for enough labeled samples and the data imbalance issues. A series of controlled experiments are conducted on a widely used database system named Cassandra to prove the validity and feasibility of the proposed method. Overheads brought about by the intrusive probing are also evaluated. The results show that DistAD can achieve more than 70% accuracy and 90% recall (in normal states) with no more than 2 times overheads compared with unmonitored executions. ",

Defining such a distribution is very challenging, due to the combinatorially large sample space, and approximations based on MCMC are often required. Recently, a novel class of probabilistic models, called Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets), have been introduced as a general framework for generative modeling of discrete and composite objects, such as graphs. In this work, we propose to use a GFlowNet as an alternative to MCMC for approximating the posterior distribution over the structure of Bayesian networks, given a dataset of observations. Generating a sample DAG from this approximate distribution is viewed as a sequential decision problem, where the graph is constructed one edge at a time, based on learned transition probabilities. Through evaluation on both simulated and real data, we show that our approach, called DAG-GFlowNet, provides an accurate approximation of the posterior over DAGs, and it compares favorably against other methods based on MCMC or variational inference.

    "abstract": "Mitotic count (MC) is an important histological parameter for cancer diagnosis and grading, but the manual process for obtaining MC from whole-slide histopathological images is very time-consuming and prone to error. Therefore, deep learning models have been proposed to facilitate this process. Existing approaches utilize a two-stage pipeline: the detection stage for identifying the locations of potential mitotic cells and the classification stage for refining prediction confidences. However, this pipeline formulation can lead to inconsistencies in the classification stage due to the poor prediction quality of the detection stage and the mismatches in training data distributions between the two stages. In this study, we propose a Refine Cascade Network (ReCasNet), an enhanced deep learning pipeline that mitigates the aforementioned problems with three improvements. First, window relocation was used to reduce the number of poor quality false positives generated during the detection stage. Second, object re-cropping was performed with another deep learning model to adjust poorly centered objects. Third, improved data selection strategies were introduced during the classification stage to reduce the mismatches in training data distributions. ReCasNet was evaluated on two large-scale mitotic figure recognition datasets, canine cutaneous mast cell tumor (CCMCT) and canine mammary carcinoma (CMC), which resulted in up to 4.8% percentage point improvements in the F1 scores for mitotic cell detection and 44.1% reductions in mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) for MC prediction. Techniques that underlie ReCasNet can be generalized to other two-stage object detection networks and should contribute to improving the performances of deep learning models in broad digital pathology applications.

However, a backlash takes the form of evasion attacks, in which an adversary changes malicious samples such that those samples will be misclassified as benign. This paper fully inspects a well-known Android malware detection system, MaMaDroid, which analyzes the control flow graph of the application. Changes to the portion of benign samples in the train set and models are considered to see their effect on the classifier. The changes in the ratio between benign and malicious samples have a clear effect on each one of the models, resulting in a decrease of more than 40% in their detection rate. Moreover, adopted ML models are implemented as well, including 5-NN, Decision Tree, and Adaboost. Exploration of the six models reveals a typical behavior in different cases, of tree-based models and distance-based models. Moreover, three novel attacks that manipulate the CFG and their detection rates are described for each one of the targeted models. The attacks decrease the detection rate of most of the models to 0%, with regards to different ratios of benign to malicious apps. As a result, a new version of MaMaDroid is engineered. This model fuses the CFG of the app and static analysis of features of the app. This improved model is proved to be robust against evasion attacks targeting both CFG-based models and static analysis models, achieving a detection rate of more than 90% against each one of the attacks.

Langevin Monte Carlo (LMC) is an efficient gradient-based approximate Bayesian learning strategy that aims at producing samples drawn from the posterior distribution of the model parameters. Prior work focused on a distributed implementation of LMC over a multi-access wireless channel via analog modulation. In contrast, this paper proposes quantized federated LMC (FLMC), which integrates one-bit stochastic quantization of the local gradients with channel-driven sampling. Channel-driven sampling leverages channel noise for the purpose of contributing to Monte Carlo sampling, while also serving the role of privacy mechanism. Analog and digital implementations of wireless LMC are compared as a function of differential privacy (DP) requirements, revealing the advantages of the latter at sufficiently high signal-to-noise ratio.

For training an object detector, a method called Mixup, which overlays two training images to mitigate data bias, has been empirically shown to be effective for data augmentation. However, in hand-object detection, mixing two hand-manipulation images produces unintended biases, e.g., the concentration of hands and objects in a specific region degrades the ability of the hand-object detector to identify object boundaries. We propose a data-augmentation method called Background Mixup that leverages data-mixing regularization while reducing the unintended effects in hand-object detection. Instead of mixing two images where a hand and an object in contact appear, we mix a target training image with background images without hands and objects-in-contact extracted from external image sources, and use the mixed images for training the detector. Our experiments demonstrated that the proposed method can effectively reduce false positives and improve the performance of hand-object detection in both supervised and semi-supervised learning settings.

The use of X-Ray images has made this process much easier, allowing not only to detect superficial defects in a much simpler way, but also to detect welding or casting defects that could represent a serious hazard for the physical integrity of the metal parts. On the other hand, the use of an automatic segmentation approach for detecting defects would help diminish the dependence of defect detection on the subjectivity of the factory operators and their time dependence variability.

    "abstract": "The npm registry is one of the pillars of the JavaScript and TypeScript ecosystems, hosting over 1.7 million packages ranging from simple utility libraries to complex frameworks and entire applications. Due to the overwhelming popularity of npm, it has become a prime target for malicious actors, who publish new packages or compromise existing packages to introduce malware that tampers with or exfiltrates sensitive data from users who install either these packages or any package that (transitively) depends on them. Defending against such attacks is essential to maintaining the integrity of the software supply chain, but the sheer volume of package updates makes comprehensive manual review infeasible. We present Amalfi, a machine-learning based approach for automatically detecting potentially malicious packages comprised of three complementary techniques. We start with classifiers trained on known examples of malicious and benign packages. If a package is flagged as malicious by a classifier, we then check whether it includes metadata about its source repository, and if so whether the package can be reproduced from its source code. Packages that are reproducible from source are not usually malicious, so this step allows us to weed out false positives. Finally, we also employ a simple textual clone-detection technique to identify copies of malicious packages that may have been missed by the classifiers, reducing the number of false negatives. Amalfi improves on the state of the art in that it is lightweight, requiring only a few seconds per package to extract features and run the classifiers, and gives good results in practice: running it on 96287 package versions published over the course of one week, we were able to identify 95 previously unknown malware samples, with a manageable number of false positives.

As in the early days of GPUs in HPC, for workloads that can reasonably be decoupled into loosely coupled working sets, multi-accelerator support can be achieved by using standard communication interfaces like MPI on the host side. However, for performance and productivity, some applications can profit from a tighter coupling of the accelerators. FPGAs offer unique opportunities here when extending the dataflow characteristics to their communication ininterfaces. In this work, we extend the HPCC FPGA benchmark suite by multi-FPGA support and three missing benchmarks that particularly characterize or stress inter-device communication: b_eff, PTRANS, and LINPACK. With all benchmarks implemented for current boards with Intel and Xilinx FPGAs, we established a baseline for multi-FPGA performance. Additionally, for the communication-centric benchmarks, we explored the potential of direct FPGA-to-FPGA communication with a circuit-switched inter-FPGA network that is currently only available for one of the boards.

While fitness apps are becoming popular, they lack the functionality to detect errors in workout form. Detecting such errors naturally requires estimating users' body pose. However, off-the-shelf pose estimators struggle to perform well on the videos recorded in gym scenarios due to factors such as camera angles, occlusion from gym equipment, illumination, and clothing. To aggravate the problem, the errors to be detected in the workouts are very subtle. To that end, we propose to learn exercise-specific representations from unlabeled samples such that a small dataset annotated by experts suffices for supervised error detection. In particular, our domain knowledge-informed self-supervised approaches exploit the harmonic motion of the exercise actions, and capitalize on the large variances in camera angles, clothes, and illumination to learn powerful representations. To facilitate our self-supervised pretraining, and supervised finetuning, we curated a new exercise dataset, Fitness-AQA, comprising of three exercises: BackSquat, BarbellRow, and OverheadPress. It has been annotated by expert trainers for multiple crucial and typically occurring exercise errors. Experimental results show that our self-supervised representations outperform off-the-shelf 2D- and 3D-pose estimators and several other baselines. ",

However, when the training data is corrupted, it has been well-known that over-parameterized networks tend to overfit and do not generalize. In this work, we propose a principled approach for robust training of over-parameterized deep networks in classification tasks where a proportion of training labels are corrupted. The main idea is yet very simple: label noise is sparse and incoherent with the network learned from clean data, so we model the noise and learn to separate it from the data. Specifically, we model the label noise via another sparse over-parameterization term, and exploit implicit algorithmic regularizations to recover and separate the underlying corruptions. Remarkably, when trained using such a simple method in practice, we demonstrate state-of-the-art test accuracy against label noise on a variety of real datasets. Furthermore, our experimental results are corroborated by theory on simplified linear models, showing that exact separation between sparse noise and low-rank data can be achieved under incoherent conditions. The work opens many interesting directions for improving over-parameterized models by using sparse over-parameterization and implicit regularization. ",

However, the landscape of online crowdsourcing has changed significantly over the last five years, with the rise of Prolific as a major platform and the increasing presence of bots. This work attempts to replicate the prior results about the external validity of online privacy and security surveys. We conduct an online survey on MTurk (n=800), a gender-balanced survey on Prolific (n=800), and a representative survey on Prolific (n=800) and compare the responses to a probabilistic survey conducted by the Pew Research Center (n=4272). We find that MTurk responses are no longer representative of the U.S. population, even when responses that fail attention check questions or CAPTCHAs are excluded. Data collected through Prolific is generally representative for questions about user perceptions and experience, but not for questions about security and privacy knowledge.

    "abstract": "Physiological and behavioral data collected from wearable or mobile sensors have been used to estimate self-reported stress levels. Since the stress annotation usually relies on self-reports during the study, a limited amount of labeled data can be an obstacle in developing accurate and generalized stress predicting models. On the other hand, the sensors can continuously capture signals without annotations. This work investigates leveraging unlabeled wearable sensor data for stress detection in the wild. We first applied data augmentation techniques on the physiological and behavioral data to improve the robustness of supervised stress detection models. Using an auto-encoder with actively selected unlabeled sequences, we pre-trained the supervised model structure to leverage the information learned from unlabeled samples. Then, we developed a semi-supervised learning framework to leverage the unlabeled data sequences. We combined data augmentation techniques with consistency regularization, which enforces the consistency of prediction output based on augmented and original unlabeled data. We validated these methods using three wearable/mobile sensor datasets collected in the wild. Our results showed that combining the proposed methods improved stress classification performance by 7.7% to 13.8% on the evaluated datasets, compared to the baseline supervised learning models. ",

Our results reveal that PD patients comprehend arousal better than valence, and amongst emotion categories, \\textit{fear}, \\textit{disgust} and \\textit{surprise} less accurately, and \\textit{sadness} most accurately. Mislabeling analyses confirm confounds among opposite-valence emotions with PD data. Emotional EEG responses also achieve near-perfect PD vs HC recognition. {Cumulatively, our study demonstrates that (a) examining \\textit{implicit} responses alone enables (i) discovery of valence-related impairments in PD patients, and (ii) differentiation of PD from HC, and (b) emotional EEG analysis is an ecologically-valid, effective, facile and sustainable tool for PD diagnosis vis-\\'a-vis self reports, expert assessments and resting-state analysis.} ",

    "abstract": "The emergence of self-supervised learning in the field of wearables-based human activity recognition (HAR) has opened up opportunities to tackle the most pressing challenges in the field, namely to exploit unlabeled data to derive reliable recognition systems from only small amounts of labeled training samples. Furthermore, self-supervised methods enable a host of new application domains such as, for example, domain adaptation and transfer across sensor positions, activities etc. As such, self-supervision, i.e., the paradigm of 'pretrain-then-finetune' has the potential to become a strong alternative to the predominant end-to-end training approaches, let alone the classic activity recognition chain with hand-crafted features of sensor data. Recently a number of contributions have been made that introduced self-supervised learning into the field of HAR, including, Multi-task self-supervision, Masked Reconstruction, CPC to name but a few. With the initial success of these methods, the time has come for a systematic inventory and analysis of the potential self-supervised learning has for the field. This paper provides exactly that. We assess the progress of self-supervised HAR research by introducing a framework that performs a multi-faceted exploration of model performance. We organize the framework into three dimensions, each containing three constituent criteria, and utilize it to assess state-of-the-art self-supervised learning methods in a large empirical study on a curated set of nine diverse benchmarks. This exploration leads us to the formulation of insights into the properties of these techniques and to establish their value towards learning representations for diverse scenarios. Based on our findings we call upon the community to join our efforts and to contribute towards shaping the evaluation of the ongoing paradigm change in modeling human activities from body-worn sensor data.

    "abstract": "Cardiovascular disease (CVDs) is one of the universal deadly diseases, and the detection of it in the early stage is a challenging task to tackle. Recently, deep learning and convolutional neural networks have been employed widely for the classification of objects. Moreover, it is promising that lots of networks can be deployed on wearable devices. An increasing number of methods can be used to realize ECG signal classification for the sake of arrhythmia detection. However, the existing neural networks proposed for arrhythmia detection are not hardware-friendly enough due to a remarkable quantity of parameters resulting in memory and power consumption. In this paper, we present a 1-D adaptive loss-aware quantization, achieving a high compression rate that reduces memory consumption by 23.36 times. In order to adapt to our compression method, we need a smaller and simpler network. We propose a 17 layer end-to-end neural network classifier to classify 17 different rhythm classes trained on the MIT-BIH dataset, realizing a classification accuracy of 93.5%, which is higher than most existing methods. Due to the adaptive bitwidth method making important layers get more attention and offered a chance to prune useless parameters, the proposed quantization method avoids accuracy degradation. It even improves the accuracy rate, which is 95.84%, 2.34% higher than before. Our study achieves a 1-D convolutional neural network with high performance and low resources consumption, which is hardware-friendly and illustrates the possibility of deployment on wearable devices to realize a real-time arrhythmia diagnosis.

    "abstract": "One of the most significant challenges of EEG-based emotion recognition is the cross-subject EEG variations, leading to poor performance and generalizability. This paper proposes a novel EEG-based emotion recognition model called the domain adversarial graph attention model (DAGAM). The basic idea is to generate a graph to model multichannel EEG signals using biological topology. Graph theory can topologically describe and analyze relationships and mutual dependency between channels of EEG. Then, unlike other graph convolutional networks, self-attention pooling is applied to benefit salient EEG feature extraction from the graph, which effectively improves the performance. Finally, after graph pooling, the domain adversarial based on the graph is employed to identify and handle EEG variation across subjects, efficiently reaching good generalizability. We conduct extensive evaluations on two benchmark datasets (SEED and SEED IV) and obtain state-of-the-art results in subject-independent emotion recognition. Our model boosts the SEED accuracy to 92.59% (4.69% improvement) with the lowest standard deviation of 3.21% (2.92% decrements) and SEED IV accuracy to 80.74% (6.90% improvement) with the lowest standard deviation of 4.14% (3.88% decrements) respectively.

Despite the presence of quality maps (QMs) that indicate noises in images, most of the methods tested in the PROBA-V dataset have not been used QMs for temporal attention. We present a quality map associated temporal attention network (QA-Net), a novel method that incorporates QMs into both feature representation and fusion processes for the first time.

    "abstract": "Quantum Neural Network (QNN) is drawing increasing research interest thanks to its potential to achieve quantum advantage on near-term Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) hardware. In order to achieve scalable QNN learning, the training process needs to be offloaded to real quantum machines instead of using exponential-cost classical simulators. One common approach to obtain QNN gradients is parameter shift whose cost scales linearly with the number of qubits. We present On-chip QNN, the first experimental demonstration of practical on-chip QNN training with parameter shift. Nevertheless, we find that due to the significant quantum errors (noises) on real machines, gradients obtained from naive parameter shift have low fidelity and thus degrade the training accuracy. To this end, we further propose probabilistic gradient pruning to firstly identify gradients with potentially large errors and then remove them. Specifically, small gradients have larger relative errors than large ones, thus having a higher probability to be pruned. We perform extensive experiments on 5 classification tasks with 5 real quantum machines. The results demonstrate that our on-chip training achieves over 90% and 60% accuracy for 2-class and 4-class image classification tasks. The probabilistic gradient pruning brings up to 7% QNN accuracy improvements over no pruning. Overall, we successfully obtain similar on-chip training accuracy compared with noise-free simulation but have much better training scalability. The code for parameter shift on-chip training is available in the TorchQuantum library. ",

Given the singing voice of an amateur singer, SVB aims to improve the intonation and vocal tone of the voice, while keeping the content and vocal timbre. Current automatic pitch correction techniques are immature, and most of them are restricted to intonation but ignore the overall aesthetic quality. Hence, we introduce Neural Singing Voice Beautifier (NSVB), the first generative model to solve the SVB task, which adopts a conditional variational autoencoder as the backbone and learns the latent representations of vocal tone. In NSVB, we propose a novel time-warping approach for pitch correction: Shape-Aware Dynamic Time Warping (SADTW), which ameliorates the robustness of existing time-warping approaches, to synchronize the amateur recording with the template pitch curve. Furthermore, we propose a latent-mapping algorithm in the latent space to convert the amateur vocal tone to the professional one. To achieve this, we also propose a new dataset containing parallel singing recordings of both amateur and professional versions. Extensive experiments on both Chinese and English songs demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods in terms of both objective and subjective metrics.

The training of state-of-the-art machine-learning methods almost universally relies on either vast amounts of labeled experimental data or the ability to numerically simulate realistic datasets. However, the data produced by experiments are often challenging to label and cannot be easily reproduced numerically. Here, we propose a novel deep-learning method, named LodeSTAR (Low-shot deep Symmetric Tracking And Regression), that learns to tracks objects with sub-pixel accuracy from a single unlabeled experimental image. This is made possible by exploiting the inherent roto-translational symmetries of the data. We demonstrate that LodeSTAR outperforms traditional methods in terms of accuracy. Furthermore, we analyze challenging experimental data containing densely packed cells or noisy backgrounds. We also exploit additional symmetries to extend the measurable particle properties to the particle's vertical position by propagating the signal in Fourier space and its polarizability by scaling the signal strength. Thanks to the ability to train deep-learning models with a single unlabeled image, LodeSTAR can accelerate the development of high-quality microscopic analysis pipelines for engineering, biology, and medicine.

These methods capture the intuitive notion that a prediction is fair if it coincides with the prediction that would have been made if someone's race, gender or religion were counterfactually different. In order to achieve this, we must have causal models that are able to capture what someone would be like if we were to counterfactually change these traits. However, we argue that any model that can do this must lie outside the particularly well behaved class that is commonly considered in the fairness literature. This is because in fairness settings, models in this class entail a particularly strong causal assumption, normally only seen in a randomised controlled trial. We argue that in general this is unlikely to hold. Furthermore, we show in many cases it can be explicitly rejected due to the fact that samples are selected from a wider population. We show this creates difficulties for counterfactual fairness as well as for the application of more general causal fairness methods. ",

The resulting method creates a penalty equivalent to a common Bayesian prior, but it also includes information that typically would not be available within a standard Bayesian context. In this work, we extend the aforementioned methodology with grammatical evolution, a symbolic genetic programming technique that we utilise for automating the rules' derivation. Our motivation is that grammatical evolution can potentially detect patterns from the data with valuable information, equivalent to that of expert knowledge. We illustrate the use of the rule-based Evolutionary Bayesian learning technique by applying it to synthetic as well as real data, and examine the results in terms of point predictions and associated uncertainty.

    "abstract": "Color inconsistency is an inevitable challenge in computational pathology, which generally happens because of stain intensity variations or sections scanned by different scanners. It harms the pathological image analysis methods, especially the learning-based models. A series of approaches have been proposed for stain normalization. However, most of them are lack flexibility in practice. In this paper, we formulated stain normalization as a digital re-staining process and proposed a self-supervised learning model, which is called RestainNet. Our network is regarded as a digital restainer which learns how to re-stain an unstained (grayscale) image. Two digital stains, Hematoxylin (H) and Eosin (E) were extracted from the original image by Beer-Lambert's Law. We proposed a staining loss to maintain the correctness of stain intensity during the restaining process. Thanks to the self-supervised nature, paired training samples are no longer necessary, which demonstrates great flexibility in practical usage. Our RestainNet outperforms existing approaches and achieves state-of-the-art performance with regard to color correctness and structure preservation. We further conducted experiments on the segmentation and classification tasks and the proposed RestainNet achieved outstanding performance compared with SOTA methods. The self-supervised design allows the network to learn any staining style with no extra effort. ",

    "title": "The Causal Marginal Polytope for Bounding Treatment Effects",
    "abstract": "Due to unmeasured confounding, it is often not possible to identify causal effects from a postulated model. Nevertheless, we can ask for partial identification, which usually boils down to finding upper and lower bounds of a causal quantity of interest derived from all solutions compatible with the encoded structural assumptions. One appealing way to derive such bounds is by casting it in terms of a constrained optimization method that searches over all causal models compatible with evidence, as introduced in the classic work of Balke and Pearl (1994) for discrete data. Although by construction this guarantees tight bounds, it poses a formidable computational challenge. To cope with this issue, alternatives include algorithms that are not guaranteed to be tight, or by introducing restrictions on the class of models. In this paper, we introduce a novel alternative: inspired by ideas coming from belief propagation, we enforce compatibility between marginals of a causal model and data, without constructing a global causal model. We call this collection of locally consistent marginals the causal marginal polytope. As global independence constraints disappear when considering small dimensional tractable marginals, this also leads to a rethinking of how to elicit and express causal knowledge. We provide an explicit algorithm and implementation of this idea, and assess its practicality with numerical experiments. ",

    "abstract": "Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a non-invasive tool for the clinical assessment of low-prevalence neuromuscular disorders. Automated diagnosis methods might reduce the need for biopsies and provide valuable information on disease follow-up. In this paper, three methods are proposed to classify target muscles in Collagen VI-related myopathy cases, based on their degree of involvement, notably a Convolutional Neural Network, a Fully Connected Network to classify texture features, and a hybrid method combining the two feature sets. The proposed methods was evaluated on axial T1-weighted Turbo Spin-Echo MRI from 26 subjects, including Ullrich Congenital Muscular Dystrophy or Bethlem Myopathy patients at different evolution stages. The best results were obtained with the hybrid model, resulting in a global accuracy of 93.8\\%, and F-scores of 0.99, 0.82, and 0.95, for healthy, mild and moderate/severe cases, respectively. ",

    "abstract": "Feature embedding methods have been proposed in literature to represent sequences as numeric vectors to be used in some bioinformatics investigations, such as family classification and protein structure prediction. Recent theoretical results showed that the well-known Lyndon factorization preserves common factors in overlapping strings. Surprisingly, the fingerprint of a sequencing read, which is the sequence of lengths of consecutive factors in variants of the Lyndon factorization of the read, is effective in preserving sequence similarities, suggesting it as basis for the definition of novels representations of sequencing reads. We propose a novel feature embedding method for Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) data using the notion of fingerprint. We provide a theoretical and experimental framework to estimate the behaviour of fingerprints and of the k-mers extracted from it, called k-fingers, as possible feature embeddings for sequencing reads. As a case study to assess the effectiveness of such embeddings, we use fingerprints to represent RNA-Seq reads and to assign them to the most likely gene from which they were originated as fragments of transcripts of the gene. We provide an implementation of the proposed method in the tool lyn2vec, which produces Lyndon-based feature embeddings of sequencing reads. ",
