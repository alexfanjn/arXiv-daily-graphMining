    "title": "Are Evolutionary Algorithms Safe Optimizers?",
    "abstract": "We consider a type of constrained optimization problem, where the violation of a constraint leads to an irrevocable loss, such as breakage of a valuable experimental resource/platform or loss of human life. Such problems are referred to as safe optimization problems (SafeOPs). While SafeOPs have received attention in the machine learning community in recent years, there was little interest in the evolutionary computation (EC) community despite some early attempts between 2009 and 2011. Moreover, there is a lack of acceptable guidelines on how to benchmark different algorithms for SafeOPs, an area where the EC community has significant experience in. Driven by the need for more efficient algorithms and benchmark guidelines for SafeOPs, the objective of this paper is to reignite the interest of this problem class in the EC community. To achieve this we (i) provide a formal definition of SafeOPs and contrast it to other types of optimization problems that the EC community is familiar with, (ii) investigate the impact of key SafeOP parameters on the performance of selected safe optimization algorithms, (iii) benchmark EC against state-of-the-art safe optimization algorithms from the machine learning community, and (iv) provide an open-source Python framework to replicate and extend our work.

    "abstract": "Robust localization in a given map is a crucial component of most autonomous robots. In this paper, we address the problem of localizing in an indoor environment that changes and where prominent structures have no correspondence in the map built at a different point in time. To overcome the discrepancy between the map and the observed environment caused by such changes, we exploit human-readable localization cues to assist localization. These cues are readily available in most facilities and can be detected using RGB camera images by utilizing text spotting. We integrate these cues into a Monte Carlo localization framework using a particle filter that operates on 2D LiDAR scans and camera data. By this, we provide a robust localization solution for environments with structural changes and dynamics by humans walking. We evaluate our localization framework on multiple challenging indoor scenarios in an office environment. The experiments suggest that our approach is robust to structural changes and can run on an onboard computer. We release an open source implementation of our approach (upon paper acceptance), which uses off-the-shelf text spotting, written in C++ with a ROS wrapper. ",

However, for any special-purpose co-processor, Boolean functions and binary arithmetic operations are useful for, among other things, avoiding unnecessary I/O on-and-off the co-processor by pre- and post-processing data on-device. This is especially true for spiking neuromorphic architectures where these basic operations are not fundamental low-level operations. Instead, these functions require specific implementation.

    "abstract": "The Internet of Things (IoT) has been continuously rising in the past few years, and its potentials are now more apparent. However, transient data generation and limited energy resources are the major bottlenecks of these networks. Besides, minimum delay and other conventional quality of service measurements are still valid requirements to meet. An efficient caching policy can help meet the standard quality of service requirements while bypassing IoT networks' specific limitations. Adopting deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms enables us to develop an effective caching scheme without the need for any prior knowledge or contextual information. In this work, we propose a DRL-based caching scheme that improves the cache hit rate and reduces energy consumption of the IoT networks, in the meanwhile, taking data freshness and limited lifetime of IoT data into account. To better capture the regional-different popularity distribution, we propose a hierarchical architecture to deploy edge caching nodes in IoT networks. The results of comprehensive experiments show that our proposed method outperforms the well-known conventional caching policies and an existing DRL-based solution in terms of cache hit rate and energy consumption of the IoT networks by considerable margins.

A directly related, simple, yet important technical novelty we subsequently present is softRmax: a reasoned alternative to the standard softmax function employed in contemporary (deep) neural networks.

    "abstract": "Neural language models show vulnerability to adversarial examples which are semantically similar to their original counterparts with a few words replaced by their synonyms. A common way to improve model robustness is adversarial training which follows two steps-collecting adversarial examples by attacking a target model, and fine-tuning the model on the augmented dataset with these adversarial examples. The objective of traditional adversarial training is to make a model produce the same correct predictions on an original/adversarial example pair. However, the consistency between model decision-makings on two similar texts is ignored. We argue that a robust model should behave consistently on original/adversarial example pairs, that is making the same predictions (what) based on the same reasons (how) which can be reflected by consistent interpretations. In this work, we propose a novel feature-level adversarial training method named FLAT. FLAT aims at improving model robustness in terms of both predictions and interpretations. FLAT incorporates variational word masks in neural networks to learn global word importance and play as a bottleneck teaching the model to make predictions based on important words. FLAT explicitly shoots at the vulnerability problem caused by the mismatch between model understandings on the replaced words and their synonyms in original/adversarial example pairs by regularizing the corresponding global word importance scores. Experiments show the effectiveness of FLAT in improving the robustness with respect to both predictions and interpretations of four neural network models (LSTM, CNN, BERT, and DeBERTa) to two adversarial attacks on four text classification tasks. The models trained via FLAT also show better robustness than baseline models on unforeseen adversarial examples across different attacks. ",

    "abstract": "Self-supervised learning (SSL) aims to eliminate one of the major bottlenecks in representation learning - the need for human annotations. As a result, SSL holds the promise to learn representations from data in-the-wild, i.e., without the need for finite and static datasets. Instead, true SSL algorithms should be able to exploit the continuous stream of data being generated on the internet or by agents exploring their environments. But do traditional self-supervised learning approaches work in this setup? In this work, we investigate this question by conducting experiments on the continuous self-supervised learning problem. While learning in the wild, we expect to see a continuous (infinite) non-IID data stream that follows a non-stationary distribution of visual concepts. The goal is to learn a representation that can be robust, adaptive yet not forgetful of concepts seen in the past. We show that a direct application of current methods to such continuous setup is 1) inefficient both computationally and in the amount of data required, 2) leads to inferior representations due to temporal correlations (non-IID data) in some sources of streaming data and 3) exhibits signs of catastrophic forgetting when trained on sources with non-stationary data distributions. We propose the use of replay buffers as an approach to alleviate the issues of inefficiency and temporal correlations. We further propose a novel method to enhance the replay buffer by maintaining the least redundant samples. Minimum redundancy (MinRed) buffers allow us to learn effective representations even in the most challenging streaming scenarios composed of sequential visual data obtained from a single embodied agent, and alleviates the problem of catastrophic forgetting when learning from data with non-stationary semantic distributions.

    "abstract": "Memory bloat is an important source of inefficiency in complex production software, especially in software written in managed languages such as Java. Prior approaches to this problem have focused on identifying objects that outlive their life span. Few studies have, however, looked into whether and to what extent myriad objects of the same type are identical. A quantitative assessment of identical objects with code-level attribution can assist developers in refactoring code to eliminate object bloat, and favor reuse of existing object(s). The result is reduced memory pressure, reduced allocation and garbage collection, enhanced data locality, and reduced re-computation, all of which result in superior performance. We develop OJXPerf, a lightweight sampling-based profiler, which probabilistically identifies identical objects. OJXPerf employs hardware performance monitoring units (PMU) in conjunction with hardware debug registers to sample and compare field values of different objects of the same type allocated at the same calling context but potentially accessed at different program points. The result is a lightweight measurement, a combination of object allocation contexts and usage contexts ordered by duplication frequency. This class of duplicated objects is relatively easier to optimize. OJXPerf incurs 9% runtime and 6% memory overheads on average. We empirically show the benefit of OJXPerf by using its profiles to instruct us to optimize a number of Java programs, including well-known benchmarks and real-world applications. The results show a noticeable reduction in memory usage (up to 11%) and a significant speedup (up to 25%). ",

However, existing algorithms face issues with slow convergence and/or robustness of performance due to the considerable heterogeneity of data distribution, computation and communication capability at the edge. In this work, we tackle both of these issues by focusing on the key component of model aggregation in federated learning systems and studying optimal algorithms to perform this task. Particularly, we propose a contextual aggregation scheme that achieves the optimal context-dependent bound on loss reduction in each round of optimization. The aforementioned context-dependent bound is derived from the particular participating devices in that round and an assumption on smoothness of the overall loss function. We show that this aggregation leads to a definite reduction of loss function at every round. Furthermore, we can integrate our aggregation with many existing algorithms to obtain the contextual versions. Our experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in convergence speed and robustness of the contextual versions compared to the original algorithms. We also consider different variants of the contextual aggregation and show robust performance even in the most extreme settings. ",

First, SelfAPR generates and constructs training samples by perturbing a previous version of the program being repaired, enforcing the neural model to capture project-specific knowledge. This is different from all the existing work based on past commits. Second, SelfAPR extracts and encodes test execution diagnostics into the input representation, steering the neural model to fix the specific kind of fault.

Two deployment options are considered for the presented framework. The first option features the integration of the standard services of the 3GPP Management System within ZSM. The other one considers ZSM as a complementary system for the standard 3GPP Management System. From these deployment options, some key questions are identified on ZSM's interoperability with the existing 3GPP Network Slicing systems. Finally, for each option, the architectural and operational feasibility of the ZSM interoperation with 3GPP Network Slicing systems is shown through an example use case. ",

Because of this novelty, a heavy-tail of rare events accounts for a significant amount of the total probability mass of distributions in language (Baayen, 2001). Standard language modeling metrics such as perplexity quantify the performance of language models (LM) in aggregate. As a result, we have relatively little understanding of whether neural LMs accurately estimate the probability of sequences in this heavy-tail of rare events. To address this gap, we develop a controlled evaluation scheme which uses generative models trained on natural data as artificial languages from which we can exactly compute sequence probabilities. Training LMs on generations from these artificial languages, we compare the sequence-level probability estimates given by LMs to the true probabilities in the target language. Our experiments reveal that LSTM and Transformer language models (i) systematically underestimate the probability of sequences drawn from the target language, and (ii) do so more severely for less-probable sequences. Investigating where this probability mass went, (iii) we find that LMs tend to overestimate the probability of ill formed (perturbed) sequences. In addition, we find that this underestimation behaviour (iv) is weakened, but not eliminated by greater amounts of training data, and (v) is exacerbated for target distributions with lower entropy.

These previous works, however, treat the communication graphs and the P2P botnet structures as static. In reality, communication graphs are dynamic as they represent the continuously changing network traffic flows. Similarly, the P2P botnets also evolve with time, as new bots join and existing bots leave either temporarily or permanently. In this paper we address the problem of detecting such evolving P2P botnet communities in dynamic communication graphs. We propose a reinforcement-based approach, suitable for large communication graphs, that improves precision and recall of P2P botnet community detection in dynamic communication graphs. ",

The fault diagnosis technology based on time series can monitor the operating status of the system in real-time, detect the abnormal operation of the system within the allowable time interval, diagnose the root cause of the fault and predict the status trend. In order to guide the technical personnel to troubleshoot and solve related faults, in this paper, an industrial fault diagnosis system is implemented based on the cubic DUCG theory.

    "abstract": "Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) has shown promising performance in graph representation learning (GRL) without the supervision of manual annotations. GCL can generate graph-level embeddings by maximizing the Mutual Information (MI) between different augmented views of the same graph (positive pairs). However, we identify an obstacle that the optimization of InfoNCE loss only concentrates on a few embeddings dimensions, limiting the distinguishability of embeddings in downstream graph classification tasks. This paper proposes an effective graph complementary contrastive learning approach named GraphCoCo to tackle the above issue. Specifically, we set the embedding of the first augmented view as the anchor embedding to localize \"highlighted\" dimensions (i.e., the dimensions contribute most in similarity measurement). Then remove these dimensions in the embeddings of the second augmented view to discover neglected complementary representations. Therefore, the combination of anchor and complementary embeddings significantly improves the performance in downstream tasks. Comprehensive experiments on various benchmark datasets are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of GraphCoCo, and the results show that our model outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. Source code will be made publicly available. ",

    "abstract": "Multiple-instance learning (MIL) provides an effective way to tackle the video anomaly detection problem by modeling it as a weakly supervised problem as the labels are usually only available at the video level while missing for frames due to expensive labeling cost. We propose to conduct novel Bayesian non-parametric submodular video partition (BN-SVP) to significantly improve MIL model training that can offer a highly reliable solution for robust anomaly detection in practical settings that include outlier segments or multiple types of abnormal events. BN-SVP essentially performs dynamic non-parametric hierarchical clustering with an enhanced self-transition that groups segments in a video into temporally consistent and semantically coherent hidden states that can be naturally interpreted as scenes. Each segment is assumed to be generated through a non-parametric mixture process that allows variations of segments within the same scenes to accommodate the dynamic and noisy nature of many real-world surveillance videos. The scene and mixture component assignment of BN-SVP also induces a pairwise similarity among segments, resulting in non-parametric construction of a submodular set function. Integrating this function with an MIL loss effectively exposes the model to a diverse set of potentially positive instances to improve its training. A greedy algorithm is developed to optimize the submodular function and support efficient model training. Our theoretical analysis ensures a strong performance guarantee of the proposed algorithm. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated over multiple real-world anomaly video datasets with robust detection performance. ",

In order to address these shortcomings, we propose to study the particular case of real-time and robust keypoints tracking. Specifically, we propose a novel architecture which ensures a fast and robust estimation of the keypoints tracking between successive images of a video sequence. Our method takes advantage of a recent breakthrough in computer vision, namely, visual transformer networks. Our method consists of two successive stages, a coarse matching followed by a fine localization of the keypoints' correspondences prediction. Through various experiments, we demonstrate that our approach achieves competitive results and demonstrates high robustness against adverse conditions, such as illumination change, occlusion and viewpoint differences.

    "abstract": "This paper addresses the problem of real-time monitoring of long-term voltage instability (LTVI) by using local field measurements. Existing local measurement-based methods use Thevenin equivalent parameter estimation that is sensitive to the noise in measurements. For solving this issue, we avoid the Thevenin approach by projecting the power flow equations as circles to develop local static-voltage stability indicator (LS-VSI) that is robust to measurement noises. The proposed method is an attractive option for practical implementation because of its decentralized nature, robustness to noise, and realistic modeling. Next, we utilize LS-VSI to propose a new local dynamic - VSI (LD-VSI) to identify the LTVI triggered by large disturbances and load tap changer dynamics. LD-VSI can identify not only the onset of instability with an alarm but also the voltage collapse point (VCP). Extensive numerical validation comparing LS-VSI with existing methods is presented on IEEE 30-bus and larger test systems like 2000-bus Texas synthetic grid to validate the robustness, accuracy, and situational awareness feature. We also verify the LD-VSI behavior on the Nordic power grid using PSSE dynamic simulation. When compared to existing methods, we observe that LD-VSI is not only more robust to measurement noise but also can identify VCP. ",

In this paper, we propose a framework based on a recurrent neural network (RNN) for object pose refinement, which is robust to erroneous initial poses and occlusions. During the recurrent iterations, object pose refinement is formulated as a non-linear least squares problem based on the estimated correspondence field (between a rendered image and the observed image). The problem is then solved by a differentiable Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) algorithm for end-toend training. The correspondence field estimation and pose refinement are conducted alternatively in each iteration to recover accurate object poses. Furthermore, to improve the robustness to occlusions, we introduce a consistencycheck mechanism based on the learned descriptors of the 3D model and observed 2D image, which downweights the unreliable correspondences during pose optimization. Extensive experiments on LINEMOD, Occlusion-LINEMOD, and YCB-Video datasets validate the effectiveness of our method and demonstrate state-of-the-art performance. ",

We propose the Privileged Attribution Loss (PAL), a method that directs the attention of the model towards the most salient facial regions by encouraging its attribution maps to correspond to a heatmap formed by facial landmarks. Furthermore, we introduce several channel strategies that allow the model to have more degrees of freedom. The proposed method is independent of the backbone architecture and doesn't need additional semantic information at test time. Finally, experimental results show that the proposed PAL method outperforms current state-of-the-art methods on both RAF-DB and AffectNet. ",

This network is able to leverage the observed photometric variance and shadows on the surface, and recover both surface shape and general non-Lambertian reflectance. We explicitly predict cast shadows, mitigating possible artifacts on these shadowing regions, leading to higher estimation accuracy. Our framework is entirely self-supervised, in the sense that it requires neither ground truth shape nor BRDF.

    "abstract": "Deep learning has recently been widely applied to many applications across different domains, e.g., image classification and audio recognition. However, the quality of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) still raises concerns in the practical operational environment, which calls for systematic testing, especially in safety-critical scenarios. Inspired by software testing, a number of structural coverage criteria are designed and proposed to measure the test adequacy of DNNs. However, due to the blackbox nature of DNN, the existing structural coverage criteria are difficult to interpret, making it hard to understand the underlying principles of these criteria. The relationship between the structural coverage and the decision logic of DNNs is unknown. Moreover, recent studies have further revealed the non-existence of correlation between the structural coverage and DNN defect detection, which further posts concerns on what a suitable DNN testing criterion should be. In this paper, we propose the interpretable coverage criteria through constructing the decision structure of a DNN. Mirroring the control flow graph of the traditional program, we first extract a decision graph from a DNN based on its interpretation, where a path of the decision graph represents a decision logic of the DNN. Based on the control flow and data flow of the decision graph, we propose two variants of path coverage to measure the adequacy of the test cases in exercising the decision logic. The higher the path coverage, the more diverse decision logic the DNN is expected to be explored. Our large-scale evaluation results demonstrate that: the path in the decision graph is effective in characterizing the decision of the DNN, and the proposed coverage criteria are also sensitive with errors including natural errors and adversarial examples, and strongly correlated with the output impartiality.

However, unlike images, information in the industrial data based tensor is not necessarily spatially ordered. Thus, directly applying CNN is ineffective. To tackle such issue, we propose a plug and play module, the Rubik's Cube Operator (RCO), to adaptively permutate the data organization of the industrial data based tensor to an optimal or suboptimal order of attributes before being processed by CNNs, which can be updated with subsequent CNNs together via the gradient-based optimizer. The proposed RCO maintains K binary and right stochastic permutation matrices to permutate attributes of K axes of the input industrial data based tensor. A novel learning process is proposed to enable learning permutation matrices from data, where the Gumbel-Softmax is employed to reparameterize elements of permutation matrices, and the soft regularization loss is proposed and added to the task-specific loss to ensure the feature diversity of the permuted data. We verify the effectiveness of the proposed RCO via considering two representative learning tasks processing industrial data via CNNs, the wind power prediction (WPP) and the wind speed prediction (WSP) from the renewable energy domain. Computational experiments are conducted based on four datasets collected from different wind farms and the results demonstrate that the proposed RCO can improve the performance of CNN based networks significantly.

The analysis module extracts distortionless speech features and distortion features from degraded speech, while the synthesis module synthesizes the restored speech waveform, and the channel module adds distortions to the speech waveform. Our model also enables audio effect transfer, in which only acoustic distortions are extracted from degraded speech and added to arbitrary high-quality audio.

Many existing semantic matching models use inner products in embedding spaces to measure the plausibility of triples and quadruples in static and temporal knowledge graphs. However, vectors that have the same inner products with another vector can still be orthogonal to each other, which implies that entities with similar semantics may have dissimilar embeddings. This property of inner products significantly limits the performance of semantic matching models. To address this challenge, we propose a novel regularizer -- namely, DUality-induced RegulArizer (DURA) -- which effectively encourages the entities with similar semantics to have similar embeddings. The major novelty of DURA is based on the observation that, for an existing semantic matching KGE model (primal), there is often another distance based KGE model (dual) closely associated with it, which can be used as effective constraints for entity embeddings. Experiments demonstrate that DURA consistently and significantly improves the performance of state-of-the-art semantic matching models on both static and temporal knowledge graph benchmarks. ",

    "abstract": "Deep neural networks (DNNs) have been successfully applied to many real-world problems, but a complete understanding of their dynamical and computational principles is still lacking. Conventional theoretical frameworks for analysing DNNs often assume random networks with coupling weights obeying Gaussian statistics. However, non-Gaussian, heavy-tailed coupling is a ubiquitous phenomenon in DNNs. Here, by weaving together theories of heavy-tailed random matrices and non-equilibrium statistical physics, we develop a new type of mean field theory for DNNs which predicts that heavy-tailed weights enable the emergence of an extended critical regime without fine-tuning parameters. In this extended critical regime, DNNs exhibit rich and complex propagation dynamics across layers. We further elucidate that the extended criticality endows DNNs with profound computational advantages: balancing the contraction as well as expansion of internal neural representations and speeding up training processes, hence providing a theoretical guide for the design of efficient neural architectures.

Specific problems in aerial images makes the detection problem harder, such as small objects, densely packed objects, objects in different sizes and with different orientations. To address small object detection problem, we propose a two-stage object detection framework called \"Focus-and-Detect\". The first stage which consists of an object detector network supervised by a Gaussian Mixture Model, generates clusters of objects constituting the focused regions. The second stage, which is also an object detector network, predicts objects within the focal regions. Incomplete Box Suppression (IBS) method is also proposed to overcome the truncation effect of region search approach. Results indicate that the proposed two-stage framework achieves an AP score of 42.06 on VisDrone validation dataset, surpassing all other state-of-the-art small object detection methods reported in the literature, to the best of authors' knowledge.

    "abstract": "In addition to signature-based and heuristics-based detection techniques, Machine learning (ML) is being widely used to generalize to new never-before-seen malicious software (malware). However, it has been demonstrated that ML models can be fooled by tricking the classifier into returning the incorrect label. These studies usually rely on a prediction score that is fragile to gradient-based attacks for instance. In the context of a more realistic situation where an attacker has very little information about the outputs of a malware detection engine, modest evasion rates are achieved. In this paper, we propose a method using Reinforcement Learning with DQN and REINFORCE algorithms to challenge two state-of-the-art Machine Learning based detection engines (MalConv \\& EMBER) and a commercial AV classified by Gartner as a leader in 2021. Our stateful method combines several actions modifying a Windows Portable Execution (PE) file without breaking its functionalities. Our method also identifies which actions perform better and compiles a detailed vulnerability report to help mitigate the evasion. We demonstrate that REINFORCE achieves very good evasion rates even on a commercial AV with low provided information. ",

    "abstract": "Although face swapping has attracted much attention in recent years, it remains a challenging problem. The existing methods leverage a large number of data samples to explore the intrinsic properties of face swapping without taking into account the semantic information of face images. Moreover, the representation of the identity information tends to be fixed, leading to suboptimal face swapping. In this paper, we present a simple yet efficient method named FaceSwapper, for one-shot face swapping based on Generative Adversarial Networks. Our method consists of a disentangled representation module and a semantic-guided fusion module. The disentangled representation module is composed of an attribute encoder and an identity encoder, which aims to achieve the disentanglement of the identity and the attribute information. The identity encoder is more flexible and the attribute encoder contains more details of the attributes than its competitors. Benefiting from the disentangled representation, FaceSwapper can swap face images progressively. In addition, semantic information is introduced into the semantic-guided fusion module to control the swapped area and model the pose and expression more accurately. The experimental results show that our method achieves state-of-the-art results on benchmark datasets with fewer training samples.

    "abstract": "Recently, significant progress has been made on image denoising with strong supervision from large-scale datasets. However, obtaining well-aligned noisy-clean training image pairs for each specific scenario is complicated and costly in practice. Consequently, applying a conventional supervised denoising network on in-the-wild noisy inputs is not straightforward. Although several studies have challenged this problem without strong supervision, they rely on less practical assumptions and cannot be applied to practical situations directly. To address the aforementioned challenges, we propose a novel and powerful self-supervised denoising method called CVF-SID based on a Cyclic multi-Variate Function (CVF) module and a self-supervised image disentangling (SID) framework. The CVF module can output multiple decomposed variables of the input and take a combination of the outputs back as an input in a cyclic manner. Our CVF-SID can disentangle a clean image and noise maps from the input by leveraging various self-supervised loss terms. Unlike several methods that only consider the signal-independent noise models, we also deal with signal-dependent noise components for real-world applications. Furthermore, we do not rely on any prior assumptions about the underlying noise distribution, making CVF-SID more generalizable toward realistic noise. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets show that CVF-SID achieves state-of-the-art self-supervised image denoising performance and is comparable to other existing approaches.

An information designer determines the fidelity of information revealed to the agents about the payoff state to maximize the social welfare. Prior results show that full information disclosure is optimal under certain assumptions on the payoffs, i.e., it is beneficial for the average individual. In this paper, we provide conditions based on the strength of the dependence of payoffs on neighbors' actions, i.e., competition, under which a rational agent is expected to benefit, i.e., receive higher payoffs, from full information disclosure. We find that all agents benefit from information disclosure for the star network structure when the game is symmetric and submodular or supermodular. We also identify that the central agent benefits more than a peripheral agent from full information disclosure unless the competition is strong and the number of peripheral agents is small enough. Despite the fact that all agents expect to benefit from information disclosure ex-ante, a central agent can be worse-off from information disclosure in many realizations of the payoff state under strong competition, indicating that a risk-averse central agent can prefer uninformative signals ex-ante.

First, we perform a detailed local Fourier analysis (LFA) of a well-known collective Jacobi relaxation (CJR) scheme, where the optimal smoothing factors are derived. This insightful analysis reveals that the optimal relaxation parameters depend on mesh size and regularization parameters, which was not investigated in literature. Second, we propose and analyze a new mass-based Braess-Sarazin relaxation (BSR) scheme, which is proven to provide smaller smoothing factors than the CJR scheme when $\\alpha\\ge ch^4$ for a small constant $c$. Here $\\alpha$ is the regularization parameter and $h$ is the spatial mesh step size. These schemes are successfully extended to control-constrained cases through the semi-smooth Newton method. Coarsening by three or four with BSR is competitive with coarsening by two. Numerical examples are presented to validate our theoretical outcomes. The proposed inexact BSR (IBSR) scheme, where two preconditioned conjugate gradients iterations are applied to the Schur complement system, yields better computational efficiency than the CJR scheme.

Without this frame of reference, the performance score of a model is basically meaningless. What does it mean when a model achieves an $F_1$ of 0.8 on a test set? A proper baseline is needed to evaluate the `goodness' of a performance score. Comparing with the latest state-of-the-art model is usually insightful. However, being state-of-the-art can change rapidly when newer models are developed. Contrary to an advanced model, a simple dummy classifier could be used. However, the latter could be beaten too easily, making the comparison less valuable. This paper presents a universal baseline method for all binary classification models, named the Dutch Draw (DD). This approach weighs simple classifiers and determines the best classifier to use as a baseline. We theoretically derive the DD baseline for many commonly used evaluation measures and show that in most situations it reduces to (almost) always predicting either zero or one. Summarizing, the DD baseline is: (1) general, as it is applicable to all binary classification problems; (2) simple, as it is quickly determined without training or parameter-tuning; (3) informative, as insightful conclusions can be drawn from the results. The DD baseline serves two purposes. First, to enable comparisons across research papers by this robust and universal baseline. Secondly, to provide a sanity check during the development process of a prediction model. It is a major warning sign when a model is outperformed by the DD baseline. ",

This paper proposes ColBERTer, a neural retrieval model using contextualized late interaction (ColBERT) with enhanced reduction. Along the effectiveness Pareto frontier, ColBERTer's reductions dramatically lower ColBERT's storage requirements while simultaneously improving the interpretability of its token-matching scores. To this end, ColBERTer fuses single-vector retrieval, multi-vector refinement, and optional lexical matching components into one model. For its multi-vector component, ColBERTer reduces the number of stored vectors per document by learning unique whole-word representations for the terms in each document and learning to identify and remove word representations that are not essential to effective scoring. We employ an explicit multi-task, multi-stage training to facilitate using very small vector dimensions. Results on the MS MARCO and TREC-DL collection show that ColBERTer can reduce the storage footprint by up to 2.5x, while maintaining effectiveness. With just one dimension per token in its smallest setting, ColBERTer achieves index storage parity with the plaintext size, with very strong effectiveness results. Finally, we demonstrate ColBERTer's robustness on seven high-quality out-of-domain collections, yielding statistically significant gains over traditional retrieval baselines. ",

    "abstract": "Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) struggles with catastrophic forgetting when learning new knowledge, and Data-Free CIL (DFCIL) is even more challenging without access to the training data of previous classes. Though recent DFCIL works introduce techniques such as model inversion to synthesize data for previous classes, they fail to overcome forgetting due to the severe domain gap between the synthetic and real data. To address this issue, this paper proposes relation-guided representation learning (RRL) for DFCIL, dubbed R-DFCIL. In RRL, we introduce relational knowledge distillation to flexibly transfer the structural relation of new data from the old model to the current model. Our RRL-boosted DFCIL can guide the current model to learn representations of new classes better compatible with representations of previous classes, which greatly reduces forgetting while improving plasticity. To avoid the mutual interference between representation and classifier learning, we employ local rather than global classification loss during RRL. After RRL, the classification head is fine-tuned with global class-balanced classification loss to address the data imbalance issue as well as learn the decision boundary between new and previous classes. Extensive experiments on CIFAR100, Tiny-ImageNet200, and ImageNet100 demonstrate that our R-DFCIL significantly surpasses previous approaches and achieves a new state-of-the-art performance for DFCIL.

Using attribution methods such as layer-wise relevance propagation or SHAP heatmaps can be created that highlight which regions of an input are more relevant for the decision than others. While this allows the detection of potential data set biases and can be used as a guide for a human expert, it does not allow an understanding of the underlying principles the model has learned. In this study, we instead show, to the best of our knowledge, for the first time results using feature visualization of neuroimaging CNNs. Particularly, we have trained CNNs for different tasks including sex classification and artificial lesion classification based on structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data. We have then iteratively generated images that maximally activate specific neurons, in order to visualize the patterns they respond to. To improve the visualizations we compared several regularization strategies. The resulting images reveal the learned concepts of the artificial lesions, including their shapes, but remain hard to interpret for abstract features in the sex classification task. ",

    "abstract": "In this paper, a self-triggered scheme is proposed to optimally control the traffic flow of Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAVs) at conflict areas of a traffic network with the main aim of reducing the data exchange among CAVs in the control zone and at the same to minimize the travel time and energy consumption. The safety constraints and the vehicle limitations are considered using the Control Barrier Function (CBF) framework and a self-triggered scheme is proposed using the CBF constraints. Moreover, modified CBF constraints are developed to ensure a minimum inter-event interval for the proposed self-triggered schemes. Finally, it is shown through a simulation study that the number of data exchanges among CAVs is significantly reduced using the proposed self-triggered schemes in comparison with the standard time-triggered framework.

    "abstract": "This paper presents a novel method for face clustering in videos using a video-centralised transformer. Previous works often employed contrastive learning to learn frame-level representation and used average pooling to aggregate the features along the temporal dimension. This approach may not fully capture the complicated video dynamics. In addition, despite the recent progress in video-based contrastive learning, few have attempted to learn a self-supervised clustering-friendly face representation that benefits the video face clustering task. To overcome these limitations, our method employs a transformer to directly learn video-level representations that can better reflect the temporally-varying property of faces in videos, while we also propose a video-centralised self-supervised framework to train the transformer model. We also investigate face clustering in egocentric videos, a fast-emerging field that has not been studied yet in works related to face clustering. To this end, we present and release the first large-scale egocentric video face clustering dataset named EasyCom-Clustering. We evaluate our proposed method on both the widely used Big Bang Theory (BBT) dataset and the new EasyCom-Clustering dataset. Results show the performance of our video-centralised transformer has surpassed all previous state-of-the-art methods on both benchmarks, exhibiting a self-attentive understanding of face videos. ",

Surrogate modeling is an enabling methodology for many-query computations in science and engineering, which include iterative methods in optimization and sampling methods in uncertainty quantification. Over the last few years, several approaches to surrogate modeling for PDEs using neural networks have emerged, motivated by successes in using neural networks to approximate nonlinear maps in other areas. In principle, the relative merits of these different approaches can be evaluated by understanding, for each one, the cost required to achieve a given level of accuracy. However, the absence of a complete theory of approximation error for these approaches makes it difficult to assess this cost-accuracy trade-off. The purpose of the paper is to provide a careful numerical study of this issue, comparing a variety of different neural network architectures for operator approximation across a range of problems arising from PDE models in continuum mechanics.

The quality of the siamese embeddings of input images was evaluated by measuring the classifier performance for different dataset coding types.

    "abstract": "Recent optical flow methods are almost exclusively judged in terms of accuracy, while analyzing their robustness is often neglected. Although adversarial attacks offer a useful tool to perform such an analysis, current attacks on optical flow methods rather focus on real-world attacking scenarios than on a worst case robustness assessment. Hence, in this work, we propose a novel adversarial attack - the Perturbation Constrained Flow Attack (PCFA) - that emphasizes destructivity over applicability as a real-world attack. More precisely, PCFA is a global attack that optimizes adversarial perturbations to shift the predicted flow towards a specified target flow, while keeping the L2 norm of the perturbation below a chosen bound. Our experiments not only demonstrate PCFA's applicability in white- and black-box settings, but also show that it finds stronger adversarial samples for optical flow than previous attacking frameworks. Moreover, based on these strong samples, we provide the first common ranking of optical flow methods in the literature considering both prediction quality and adversarial robustness, indicating that high quality methods are not necessarily robust. Our source code will be publicly available. ",

To mitigate this issue, we propose SMARAGD (Synthesized sMatch for accurate and rapid AMR graph distance).

    "abstract": "3D point cloud registration in remote sensing field has been greatly advanced by deep learning based methods, where the rigid transformation is either directly regressed from the two point clouds (correspondences-free approaches) or computed from the learned correspondences (correspondences-based approaches). Existing correspondences-free methods generally learn the holistic representation of the entire point cloud, which is fragile for partial and noisy point clouds. In this paper, we propose a correspondences-free unsupervised point cloud registration (UPCR) method from the representation separation perspective. First, we model the input point cloud as a combination of pose-invariant representation and pose-related representation. Second, the pose-related representation is used to learn the relative pose wrt a \"latent canonical shape\" for the source and target point clouds respectively. Third, the rigid transformation is obtained from the above two learned relative poses. Our method not only filters out the disturbance in pose-invariant representation but also is robust to partial-to-partial point clouds or noise. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our unsupervised method achieves comparable if not better performance than state-of-the-art supervised registration methods. ",

GNNs have found powerful use-cases in reconstruction, tagging, generation and end-to-end analysis. With the wide-spread adoption of GNNs in industry, the HEP community is well-placed to benefit from rapid improvements in GNN latency and memory usage. However, industry use-cases are not perfectly aligned with HEP and much work needs to be done to best match unique GNN capabilities to unique HEP obstacles.

The formulated problem consists of energy management at a large timescale, as well as rate control, channel selection, and power allocation at a small timescale. To address this challenge, we develop an online solution to guarantee bounded performance deviation with only causal information. Specifically, Lyapunov optimization is leveraged to transform the long-term stochastic optimization problem into a series of short-term deterministic optimization problems. Then, a low-complexity rate control algorithm is developed based on alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), which accelerates the convergence speed via the decomposition-coordination approach. Next, the joint channel selection and power allocation problem is transformed into a one-to-many matching problem, and solved by the proposed price-based matching with quota restriction.

Gesture recognition exploiting surface electromyographic (sEMG) signals is one of the most promising approaches, given that sEMG signal acquisition is non-invasive and is directly related to muscle contraction. However, the analysis of these signals still presents many challenges since similar gestures result in similar muscle contractions. Thus the resulting signal shapes are almost identical, leading to low classification accuracy. To tackle this challenge, complex neural networks are employed, which require large memory footprints, consume relatively high energy and limit the maximum battery life of devices used for classification. This work addresses this problem with the introduction of the Bioformers. This new family of ultra-small attention-based architectures approaches state-of-the-art performance while reducing the number of parameters and operations of 4.9X. Additionally, by introducing a new inter-subjects pre-training, we improve the accuracy of our best Bioformer by 3.39%, matching state-of-the-art accuracy without any additional inference cost. Deploying our best performing Bioformer on a Parallel, Ultra-Low Power (PULP) microcontroller unit (MCU), the GreenWaves GAP8, we achieve an inference latency and energy of 2.72 ms and 0.14 mJ, respectively, 8.0X lower than the previous state-of-the-art neural network, while occupying just 94.2 kB of memory.

    "abstract": "In this article we consider Bayesian inference associated to deep neural networks (DNNs) and in particular, trace-class neural network (TNN) priors which were proposed by Sell et al. [39]. Such priors were developed as more robust alternatives to classical architectures in the context of inference problems. For this work we develop multilevel Monte Carlo (MLMC) methods for such models. MLMC is a popular variance reduction technique, with particular applications in Bayesian statistics and uncertainty quantification. We show how a particular advanced MLMC method that was introduced in [4] can be applied to Bayesian inference from DNNs and establish mathematically, that the computational cost to achieve a particular mean square error, associated to posterior expectation computation, can be reduced by several orders, versus more conventional techniques. To verify such results we provide numerous numerical experiments on model problems arising in machine learning. These include Bayesian regression, as well as Bayesian classification and reinforcement learning. ",

    "abstract": "Pulmonary hypertension (PH) in newborns and infants is a complex condition associated with several pulmonary, cardiac, and systemic diseases contributing to morbidity and mortality. Therefore, accurate and early detection of PH is crucial for successful management. Using echocardiography, the primary diagnostic tool in pediatrics, human assessment is both time-consuming and expertise-demanding, raising the need for an automated approach. In this work, we present an interpretable multi-view video-based deep learning approach to predict PH for a cohort of 194 newborns using echocardiograms. We use spatio-temporal convolutional architectures for the prediction of PH from each view, and aggregate the predictions of the different views using majority voting. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work for an automated assessment of PH in newborns using echocardiograms. Our results show a mean F1-score of 0.84 for severity prediction and 0.92 for binary detection using 10-fold cross-validation. We complement our predictions with saliency maps and show that the learned model focuses on clinically relevant cardiac structures, motivating its usage in clinical practice. ",

    "abstract": "Although radiographs are the most frequently used worldwide due to their cost-effectiveness and widespread accessibility, the structural superposition along the x-ray paths often renders suspicious or concerning lung nodules difficult to detect. In this study, we apply \"X-ray dissectography\" to dissect lungs digitally from a few radiographic projections, suppress the interference of irrelevant structures, and improve lung nodule detectability. For this purpose, a collaborative detection network is designed to localize lung nodules in 2D dissected projections and 3D physical space. Our experimental results show that our approach can significantly improve the average precision by 20+% in comparison with the common baseline that detects lung nodules from original projections using a popular detection network. Potentially, this approach could help re-design the current X-ray imaging protocols and workflows and improve the diagnostic performance of chest radiographs in lung diseases. ",

    "title": "Addressing Missing Sources with Adversarial Support-Matching",
    "abstract": "When trained on diverse labeled data, machine learning models have proven themselves to be a powerful tool in all facets of society. However, due to budget limitations, deliberate or non-deliberate censorship, and other problems during data collection and curation, the labeled training set might exhibit a systematic shortage of data for certain groups. We investigate a scenario in which the absence of certain data is linked to the second level of a two-level hierarchy in the data. Inspired by the idea of protected groups from algorithmic fairness, we refer to the partitions carved by this second level as \"subgroups\"; we refer to combinations of subgroups and classes, or leaves of the hierarchy, as \"sources\". To characterize the problem, we introduce the concept of classes with incomplete subgroup support. The representational bias in the training set can give rise to spurious correlations between the classes and the subgroups which render standard classification models ungeneralizable to unseen sources. To overcome this bias, we make use of an additional, diverse but unlabeled dataset, called the \"deployment set\", to learn a representation that is invariant to subgroup. This is done by adversarially matching the support of the training and deployment sets in representation space. In order to learn the desired invariance, it is paramount that the sets of samples observed by the discriminator are balanced by class; this is easily achieved for the training set, but requires using semi-supervised clustering for the deployment set. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method with experiments on several datasets and variants of the problem. ",

In particular, we consider group-structured and bounded $f$-divergence uncertainty sets. Our approach relies on an accelerated method that queries a ball optimization oracle, i.e., a subroutine that minimizes the objective within a small ball around the query point. Our main contribution is efficient implementations of this oracle for DRO objectives. For DRO with $N$ non-smooth loss functions, the resulting algorithms find an $\\epsilon$-accurate solution with $\\widetilde{O}\\left(N\\epsilon^{-2/3} + \\epsilon^{-2}\\right)$ first-order oracle queries to individual loss functions. Compared to existing algorithms for this problem, we improve complexity by a factor of up to $\\epsilon^{-4/3}$. ",

We show that there is a function $f(k, d) = O(k^{10} + 2^{d^5})$ so that if a graph has treewidth at least $f(k, d)$ and maximum degree at most $d$, then it contains a $k \\times k$-grid as an induced minor. This proves the conjecture of Aboulker, Adler, Kim, Sintiari, and Trotignon [Eur. J. Comb., 98, 2021] that any graph with large treewidth and bounded maximum degree contains a large wall or the line graph of a large wall as an induced subgraph. It also implies that for any fixed planar graph $H$, there is a subexponential time algorithm for maximum weight independent set on $H$-induced-minor-free graphs. ",
