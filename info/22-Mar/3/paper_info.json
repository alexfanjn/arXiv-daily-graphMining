    "abstract": "Hyper-partisan misinformation has become a major public concern. In order to examine what type of misinformation label can mitigate hyper-partisan misinformation sharing on social media, we conducted a 4 (label type: algorithm, community, third-party fact-checker, and no label) X 2 (post ideology: liberal vs. conservative) between-subjects online experiment (N = 1,677) in the context of COVID-19 health information. The results suggest that for liberal users, all labels reduced the perceived accuracy and believability of fake posts regardless of the posts' ideology. In contrast, for conservative users, the efficacy of the labels depended on whether the posts were ideologically consistent: algorithmic labels were more effective in reducing the perceived accuracy and believability of fake conservative posts compared to community labels, whereas all labels were effective in reducing their belief in liberal posts. Our results shed light on the differing effects of various misinformation labels dependent on people's political ideology. ",

    "title": "Subspace-Based Pilot Decontamination in User-Centric Scalable Cell-Free  Wireless Networks",
    "abstract": "We consider a cell-free wireless system operated in Time Division Duplex (TDD) mode with localized user-centric clusters of remote radio units (RUs). Since the uplink pilot dimensions per channel coherence slot is limited, co-pilot users might incur mutual pilot contamination. In the current literature, it is assumed that the long-term statistical knowledge of all user channels is available. This enables MMSE channel estimation or simplified dominant subspace projection, which achieves significant pilot decontamination under certain assumptions on the channel covariance matrices. However, estimating the channel covariance matrix or even just its dominant subspace at all RUs forming a user cluster is not an easy task. In fact, if not properly designed, a piloting scheme for such long-term statistics estimation will also be subject to the contamination problem. In this paper, we propose a new channel subspace estimation scheme explicitly designed for cell-free wireless networks. Our scheme is based on 1) a sounding reference signal (SRS) using latin squares wideband frequency hopping, and 2) a subspace estimation method based on robust Principal Component Analysis (R-PCA). The SRS hopping scheme ensures that for any user and any RU participating in its cluster, only a few pilot measurements will contain strong co-pilot interference. These few heavily contaminated measurements are (implicitly) eliminated by R-PCA, which is designed to regularize the estimation and discount the \"outlier\" measurements. Our simulation results show that the proposed scheme achieves almost perfect subspace knowledge, which in turns yields system performance very close to that with ideal channel state information, thus essentially solving the problem of pilot contamination in cell-free user-centric TDD wireless networks.

Our agents succeed at real-time cultural transmission from humans in novel contexts without using any pre-collected human data.

    "abstract": "In this work we propose a novel solution for 3D skeleton-based human motion prediction. The objective of this task consists in forecasting future human poses based on a prior skeleton pose sequence. This involves solving two main challenges still present in recent literature; (1) discontinuity of the predicted motion which results in unrealistic motions and (2) performance deterioration in long-term horizons resulting from error accumulation across time. We tackle these issues by using a compact manifold-valued representation of 3D human skeleton motion. Specifically, we model the temporal evolution of the 3D poses as trajectory, what allows us to map human motions to single points on a sphere manifold. Using such a compact representation avoids error accumulation and provides robust representation for long-term prediction while ensuring the smoothness and the coherence of the whole motion. To learn these non-Euclidean representations, we build a manifold-aware Wasserstein generative adversarial model that captures the temporal and spatial dependencies of human motion through different losses. Experiments have been conducted on CMU MoCap and Human 3.6M datasets and demonstrate the superiority of our approach over the state-of-the-art both in short and long term horizons. The smoothness of the generated motion is highlighted in the qualitative results. ",

This paper presents a runtime monitoring system for the detection of executional errors during surgical tasks through the analysis of kinematic data. The proposed system incorporates dual Siamese neural networks and knowledge of surgical context, including surgical tasks and gestures, their distributional similarities, and common error modes, to learn the differences between normal and erroneous surgical trajectories from small training datasets. We evaluate the performance of the error detection using Siamese networks compared to single CNN and LSTM networks trained with different levels of contextual knowledge and training data, using the dry-lab demonstrations of the Suturing and Needle Passing tasks from the JIGSAWS dataset. Our results show that gesture specific task nonspecific Siamese networks obtain micro F1 scores of 0.94 (Siamese-CNN) and 0.95 (Siamese-LSTM), and perform better than single CNN (0.86) and LSTM (0.87) networks. These Siamese networks also outperform gesture nonspecific task specific Siamese-CNN and Siamese-LSTM models for Suturing and Needle Passing. ",

We analyze sampled Netflow records at a medium-sized US Regional Optical Network to quantify the changes in the network traffic due to stay-at-home measures in that region. We find that human-driven traffic in the network decreases to around 70%, and mostly shifts to local ISPs, while VPN and online meeting traffic increases up to 5 times. We also find that networks adopt a variety of online meeting solutions and favor one but continue using a few others. We find that educational and government institutions experience large traffic changes, but aim to keep their productivity via increased online meetings. Some scientific traffic also reduces possibly leading to loss of research productivity. Businesses mostly lose their traffic and few show VPN or online meeting activity. Most network prefixes experience large loss of live addresses but a handful increase their liveness. We also find increased incidence of network attacks. Our findings can help plan network provisioning and management to prepare for future possible infection outbreaks and natural disasters. ",

    "abstract": "Maintaining energy balance and economical operation is significant for multi-energy systems such as the energy hub. However, it is usually challenged by the frequently changing and unpredictable uncertainties at different timescales. Under this scope, this paper investigates the coordinated energy management problem for day-ahead and intra-day conditions considering uncertainties of source-load and market prices concurrently. Note that the precise knowledge of distributions about uncertainties may be unaccessible before the decision-making in day-ahead phase. A two-stage chance-constrained model based on distributionally robust approach with ambiguous moment information is proposed to immunize scheduling strategies against the worst-case probability distributions. The first stage is dedicated to obtaining more energy arbitrage and operation flexibility by optimizing bidding strategies in day-ahead power, natural gas and carbon markets. The second stage focuses on the optimization of worst-case expected operation cost. It provides a robust energy equipment and load scheduling strategy for the reference of subsequent intra-day arrangements. With respect to different variations of electrical and thermal components, an intra-day two-timescale coordination is implemented step by step. The energy scheduling is re-dispatched circularly to minimize the operation and penalty costs. The possible energy imbalance is also compensated by this way. As the energy management program is nonlinear, chance-constrained and multi-stage, linearization and dual transformation techniques are designed to enhance tractability of programs. Experimental results show that the developed multi-level framework results in a carbon emission decrease of 37%, and reduces energy cost averagely 3% compared with corresponding contrasting cases. The obtained strategy validates a good tradeoff between robustness and optimality. ",

Our empirical analysis is conducted using the Nicad code clone detection tool on a dataset of approximately 50k Ethereum smart contracts. We evaluated VOLCANO on two datasets, one with confirmed vulnerabilities and another with approximately 50k random smart contracts collected from the Etherscan. Our approach shows an improvement in the detection of vulnerabilities in terms of coverage and efficiency when compared to two of the publicly available static analyzers to detect vulnerabilities in smart contracts. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that uses a clone detection technique to identify vulnerabilities and their evolution in Ethereum smart contracts. ",

In this review, we describe the studies on the current privacy policies of fitness app providers, heuristically evaluate the methods for consent management by fitness providers, summarize the gaps identified in our review of these studies, and discuss potential solutions for filling the gaps identified. We have identified four main problems related to preserving the privacy of users of fitness apps: lack of system transparency, lack of privacy policy legibility, concerns regarding one-time consent, and issues of noncompliance regarding consent management.

Second, we summarized five code smells in DL systems. Third, we validated the prevalence, and the impact of our newly identified code smells through a mixture of qualitative and quantitative analysis.

This raises the key question of whether or not one can construct stable and accurate deep neural networks for inverse problems. In this work, we present a novel construction of an accurate, stable and efficient neural network for inverse problems with general analysis-sparse models. To construct the network, we unroll NESTA, an accelerated first-order method for convex optimization. Combined with a compressed sensing analysis, we prove accuracy and stability. Finally, a restart scheme is employed to enable exponential decay of the required network depth, yielding a shallower, and consequently more efficient, network. We showcase this approach in the case of Fourier imaging, and verify its stability and performance via a series of numerical experiments. The key impact of this work is to provide theoretical guarantees for computing and developing stable neural networks in practice. ",

One novelty of the proposed method is the use of a multi-head attention of the transformer network that matches moving objects across time and models their interaction and dynamics. This enables accurate and robust pose estimation for each object instance. Most image-to-depth predication frameworks make the assumption of rigid scenes, which largely degrades their performance with respect to dynamic objects. Only a few SOTA papers have accounted for dynamic objects. The proposed method is shown to largely outperform these methods on standard benchmarks and the impact of the dynamic motion on these benchmarks is exposed.

Modern autonomous vehicles adopt various deep learning methods to train lane detection models, making it challenging to devise a universal backdoor attack technique. In our solution, (1) we propose a novel semantic trigger design, which leverages the traffic cones with specific poses and locations to activate the backdoor. Such trigger can be easily realized under the physical setting, and looks very natural not to be detected. (2) We introduce a new clean-annotation approach to generate poisoned samples. These samples have correct annotations but are still capable of embedding the backdoor to the model. Comprehensive evaluations on public datasets and physical autonomous vehicles demonstrate that our backdoor attack is effective, stealthy and robust. ",

IDS focuses on stylizing the content identity, rather than completely swapping it using the reference identity. We use an effective heterogeneous-network-based framework $Styleverse$ that uses a single domain-aware generator to exploit the Metaverse of diverse heterogeneous faces, based on the proposed dataset FS13 with limited data. FS13 means 13 kinds of Face Styles considering diverse lighting conditions, art representations and life dimensions. Previous similar tasks, \\eg, image style transfer can handle textural style transfer based on a reference image. This task usually ignores the high structure-aware facial area and high-fidelity preservation of the content. However, Styleverse intends to controllably create topology-aware faces in the Parallel Style Universe, where the source facial identity is adaptively styled via AdaIN guided by the domain-aware and reference-aware style embeddings from heterogeneous pretrained models. We first establish the IDS quantitative benchmark as well as the qualitative Styleverse matrix. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Styleverse achieves higher-fidelity identity stylization compared with other state-of-the-art methods. ",

It aims to discover object instances in real pictures from a huge number of established categories. In recent years, deep learning-based object detection techniques that developed from computer vision have grabbed the public's interest. Object recognition methods based on deep learning frameworks have quickly become a popular way to interpret moving images acquired by various sensors. Due to its vast variety of applications for various computer vision tasks such as activity or event detection, content-based image retrieval, and scene understanding, academics have spent decades attempting to solve this problem. With this goal in mind, a unique deep learning classification technique is used to create an autonomous object detecting system. The noise destruction and normalising operations, which are carried out using gaussian filter and contrast normalisation techniques, respectively, are the first steps in the study activity. The pre-processed picture is next subjected to entropy-based segmentation algorithms, which separate the image's significant areas in order to distinguish between distinct occurrences. The classification challenge is completed by the suggested Hybrid Optimized Dense Convolutional Neural Network (HODCNN). The major goal of this framework is to aid in the precise recognition of distinct items from the gathered input frames. The suggested system's performance is assessed by comparing it to existing machine learning and deep learning methodologies. The experimental findings reveal that the suggested framework has a detection accuracy of 0.9864, which is greater than current techniques. As a result, the suggested object detection model outperforms other current methods. ",

To enhance multi-modal learning, we train directly with ground truth 2D bounding box labels, avoiding noisy, detector-specific, 2D predictions. Additionally, we use LiDAR ground truth sampling to simulate missed 2D detections and to accelerate training convergence. Both DVF and the multi-modal training approaches can be applied to any voxel-based LiDAR backbone without introducing additional learnable parameters. DVF outperforms existing sparse fusion detectors, ranking $1^{st}$ among all published fusion methods on KITTI's 3D car detection benchmark at the time of submission and significantly improves 3D vehicle detection performance of voxel-based methods on the Waymo Open Dataset. We also show that our proposed multi-modal training strategy results in better generalization compared to training using erroneous 2D predictions. ",

When evaluating grasp poses in these scenarios, a target-driven grasping system requires knowledge of spatial relations between scene objects (e.g., proximity, adjacency, and occlusions). To efficiently complete this task, we propose a target-driven grasping system that simultaneously considers object relations and predicts 6-DoF grasp poses. A densely cluttered scene is first formulated as a grasp graph with nodes representing object geometries in the grasp coordinate frame and edges indicating spatial relations between the objects. We design a Grasp Graph Neural Network (G2N2) that evaluates the grasp graph and finds the most feasible 6-DoF grasp pose for a target object. Additionally, we develop a shape completion-assisted grasp pose sampling method that improves sample quality and consequently grasping efficiency. We compare our method against several baselines in both simulated and real settings. In real-world experiments with novel objects, our approach achieves a 77.78% grasping accuracy in densely cluttered scenarios, surpassing the best-performing baseline by more than 15%.

We take the latter semantics as the research object, take \"split\" (a common psychological semantics reflecting the inner integration of testers) as the research goal, and use the method of machine learning to realize the automatic detection of split semantics, so as to explore the application of machine learning in the detection of subjective psychological semantics of sandplay images. To this end, we present a feature dimensionality reduction and extraction algorithm to obtain a one-dimensional vector representing the split feature, and build the split semantic detector based on Multilayer Perceptron network to get the detection results.

The former extracts multiscale point-wise descriptive features, while the latter captures rich feature details with hierarchical residuals. To generate neat edges, our discriminator uses a graph filter to extract and retain high frequency points. The generated high resolution point cloud and corresponding high frequency points help the discriminator learn the global and high frequency properties of the point cloud. We also propose an identity distribution loss function to make sure that the upsampled points remain on the underlying surface of the input low resolution point cloud. To assess the regularity of the upsampled points in high frequency regions, we introduce two evaluation metrics. Objective and subjective results demonstrate that the visual quality of the upsampled point clouds generated by our method is better than that of the state-of-the-art methods. ",

Existing MIA defenses conceal the presence of a target sample through strong regularization, knowledge distillation, confidence masking, or differential privacy. We propose MIAShield, a new MIA defense based on preemptive exclusion of member samples instead of masking the presence of a member. The key insight in MIAShield is weakening the strong membership signal that stems from the presence of a target sample by preemptively excluding it at prediction time without compromising model utility. To that end, we design and evaluate a suite of preemptive exclusion oracles leveraging model-confidence, exact or approximate sample signature, and learning-based exclusion of member data points. To be practical, MIAShield splits a training data into disjoint subsets and trains each subset to build an ensemble of models. The disjointedness of subsets ensures that a target sample belongs to only one subset, which isolates the sample to facilitate the preemptive exclusion goal. We evaluate MIAShield on three benchmark image classification datasets. We show that MIAShield effectively mitigates membership inference (near random guess) for a wide range of MIAs, achieves far better privacy-utility trade-off compared with state-of-the-art defenses, and remains resilient against an adaptive adversary.

Photoplethysmography (PPG) signals are convenient owning to its ease of measurement and are usually well protected against remote adversaries in authentication. Any leaked PPG signals help adversaries compromise the biometric authentication systems, and the advent of remote PPG (rPPG) enables adversaries to acquire PPG signals through restoration. While potentially dangerous, rPPG-based attacks are overlooked because existing methods require the victim's PPG signals. This paper proposes a novel spoofing attack approach that uses the waveforms of rPPG signals extracted from video clips to fool the PPG-based biometric authentication. We develop a new PPG restoration model that does not require leaked PPG signals for adversarial attacks. Test results on state-of-art PPG-based biometric authentication show that the signals recovered through rPPG pose a severe threat to PPG-based biometric authentication. ",

In this paper, a novel cross-layer optimization problem is considered, namely, the user scheduling and beamforming are jointly discussed subjecting to the requirement of per-user quality of service (QoS) and the maximum allowable transmit power for multicell multiuser joint transmission networks. To achieve the goal, a mixed discrete-continue variables combinational optimization problem is investigated with aiming at maximizing the sum rate of the communication system. To circumvent the original non-convex problem with dynamic solution space, we first transform it into a 0-1 integer and continue variables optimization problem, and then obtain a tractable form with continuous variables by exploiting the characteristics of 0-1 constraint. Finally, the scheduled users and the optimized beamforming vectors are simultaneously calculated by an alternating optimization algorithm. We also theoretically prove that the base stations allocate zero power to the unscheduled users. Furthermore, two heuristic optimization algorithms are proposed respectively based on brute-force search and greedy search. Numerical results validate the effectiveness of our proposed methods, and the optimization approach gets relatively balanced results compared with the other two approaches. ",

However, despite their state-of-the-art performance in predictive graph-based applications, recent studies have shown that GNNs can raise significant privacy concerns when graph data contain sensitive information. As a result, in this paper, we study the problem of learning GNNs with Differential Privacy (DP). We propose GAP, a novel differentially private GNN that safeguards the privacy of nodes and edges using aggregation perturbation, i.e., adding calibrated stochastic noise to the output of the GNN's aggregation function, which statistically obfuscates the presence of a single edge (edge-level privacy) or a single node and all its adjacent edges (node-level privacy). To circumvent the accumulation of privacy cost at every forward pass of the model, we tailor the GNN architecture to the specifics of private learning. In particular, we first precompute private aggregations by recursively applying neighborhood aggregation and perturbing the output of each aggregation step. Then, we privately train a deep neural network on the resulting perturbed aggregations for any node-wise classification task. A major advantage of GAP over previous approaches is that we guarantee edge-level and node-level DP not only for training, but also at inference time with no additional costs beyond the training's privacy budget. We theoretically analyze the formal privacy guarantees of GAP using R\\'enyi DP. Empirical experiments conducted over three real-world graph datasets demonstrate that GAP achieves a favorable privacy-accuracy trade-off and significantly outperforms existing approaches. ",

Usually, such knowledge services are provided through triple data, while this implementation includes (1) tedious data selection works on product knowledge graph and (2) task model designing works to infuse those triples knowledge. More importantly, product knowledge graph is far from complete, resulting error propagation to knowledge enhanced tasks. To avoid these problems, we propose a Pre-trained Knowledge Graph Model (PKGM) for the billion-scale product knowledge graph.

On the other hand, it's service is provided based on implicitly completed product knowledge graph, overcoming the common the incomplete issue. We also propose two general ways to integrate the service vectors from PKGM into downstream task models. We test PKGM in five knowledge-related tasks, item classification, item resolution, item recommendation, scene detection and sequential recommendation. Experimental results show that PKGM introduces significant performance gains on these tasks, illustrating the useful of service vectors from PKGM. ",

Additionally, they have longer memories than RNNs, albeit with some instability and efficiency problems.

The framework makes full use parallel calculations to dramatically reduce training times, while substantially increasing accuracy with stable prediction windows up to 13 times longer than the status quo.

Consequently, local connectivity of real world mesh networks, due to the limited communication range of its wireless nodes, undermines the efficiency of decentralized learning protocols, rendering them potentially impracticable. In this work we investigate the role of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), used as flying relay, in facilitating decentralized learning procedures in such challenging conditions. We propose an optimized UAV trajectory, that is defined as a sequence of waypoints that the UAV visits sequentially in order to transfer intelligence across sparsely connected group of users. We then provide a series of experiments highlighting the essential role of UAVs in the context of decentralized learning over mesh networks. ",

Additionally, we show that PBPO+ is well suited for rewriting labeled graphs and some classes of attributed graphs, by introducing a lattice structure on the label set and requiring graph morphisms to be order-preserving.

    "abstract": "Interpolations in the latent space of deep generative models is one of the standard tools to synthesize semantically meaningful mixtures of generated samples. As the generator function is non-linear, commonly used linear interpolations in the latent space do not yield the shortest paths in the sample space, resulting in non-smooth interpolations. Recent work has therefore equipped the latent space with a suitable metric to enforce shortest paths on the manifold of generated samples. These are often, however, susceptible of veering away from the manifold of real samples, resulting in smooth but unrealistic generation that requires an additional method to assess the sample quality along paths. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), by construction, measure the sample quality using its discriminator network. In this paper, we establish that the discriminator can be used effectively to avoid regions of low sample quality along shortest paths. By reusing the discriminator network to modify the metric on the latent space, we propose a lightweight solution for improved interpolations in pre-trained GANs. ",

Over the course of its development, the label supervision has been considered necessary for accurate alignments. Inspired by the recent progress of self-supervised learning, we explore the extent to which we can get rid of supervision for entity alignment. Commonly, the label information (positive entity pairs) is used to supervise the process of pulling the aligned entities in each positive pair closer. However, our theoretical analysis suggests that the learning of entity alignment can actually benefit more from pushing unlabeled negative pairs far away from each other than pulling labeled positive pairs close. By leveraging this discovery, we develop the self-supervised learning objective for entity alignment. We present SelfKG with efficient strategies to optimize this objective for aligning entities without label supervision. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that SelfKG without supervision can match or achieve comparable results with state-of-the-art supervised baselines. The performance of SelfKG suggests that self-supervised learning offers great potential for entity alignment in KGs. The code and data are available at https://github.com/THUDM/SelfKG. ",

Nonetheless, involuntary contact may be unavoidable when the robot travels in crowded areas or when encountering adversarial pedestrians. Freezing the robot in response to contact might be detrimental to bystanders' safety and prevents it from achieving its task. Unavoidable contacts must hence be controlled to ensure the safe and smooth travelling of robots in pedestrian alleys. We present a force-limited and obstacle avoidance controller integrated into a time-invariant dynamical system (DS) in a closed-loop force controller that let the robot react instantaneously to contact or to the sudden appearance of pedestrians. Mitigating the risk of collision is done by modulating the velocity commands upon detecting a contact and by absorbing part of the contact force through active compliant control when the robot bumps inadvertently against a pedestrian. We evaluated our method with a personal mobility robot -- Qolo -- showing contact mitigation with passive and active compliance. We showed the robot able to overcome an adversarial pedestrian within 9 N of the set limit contact force for speeds under 1 m/s. Moreover, we evaluated integrated obstacle avoidance proving the ability to advance without incurring any other collision. ",

Current works model historical dependencies and anticipate future to perceive the action evolution within a video segment and improve the detection accuracy. However, the existing paradigm ignores category-level modeling and does not pay sufficient attention to efficiency. Considering a category, its representative frames exhibit various characteristics. Thus, the category-level modeling can provide complementary guidance to the temporal dependencies modeling. In this paper, we develop an effective exemplar-consultation mechanism that first measures the similarity between a frame and exemplary frames, and then aggregates exemplary features based on the similarity weights. This is also an efficient mechanism as both similarity measurement and feature aggregation require limited computations. Based on the exemplar-consultation mechanism, the long-term dependencies can be captured by regarding historical frames as exemplars, and the category-level modeling can be achieved by regarding representative frames from a category as exemplars. Due to the complementarity from the category-level modeling, our method employs a lightweight architecture but achieves new high performance on three benchmarks. In addition, using a spatio-temporal network to tackle video frames, our method spends 9.8 seconds to dispose of a one-minute video and achieves comparable performance. ",

GNN-based Active Learning (AL) methods are proposed to improve the labeling efficiency by selecting the most valuable nodes to label. Existing methods assume an oracle can correctly categorize all the selected nodes and thus just focus on the node selection. However, such an exact labeling task is costly, especially when the categorization is out of the domain of individual expert (oracle). The paper goes further, presenting a soft-label approach to AL on GNNs. Our key innovations are: i) relaxed queries where a domain expert (oracle) only judges the correctness of the predicted labels (a binary question) rather than identifying the exact class (a multi-class question), and ii) new criteria of maximizing information gain propagation for active learner with relaxed queries and soft labels. Empirical studies on public datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art GNN-based AL methods in terms of both accuracy and labeling cost. ",

A very common approach to detect faults in PV systems is based on the comparison between measured and simulated performance. Although this approach has been explored by many authors, due to the lack a common basis for evaluating their performance, it is still unclear what are the influencing aspects in the design of AFD algorithms. In this study, a series of AFD algorithms have been tested under real operating conditions, using monitoring data collected over 58 months on 80 rooftop-type PV systems installed in Germany. The results shown that this type of AFD algorithm have the potential to detect up to 82.8% of the energy losses with specificity above 90%. In general, the higher the simulation accuracy, the higher the specificity. The use of less accurate simulations can increase sensitivity at the cost of decreasing specificity. Analyzing the measurements individually makes the algorithm less sensitive to the simulation accuracy. The use of machine learning clustering algorithm for the statistical analysis showed exceptional ability to prevent false alerts, even in cases where the modeling accuracy is not high. If a slightly higher level of false alerts can be tolerated, the analysis of daily PR using a Shewhart chart provides the high sensitivity with an exceptionally simple solution with no need for more complex algorithms for modeling or clustering.

Our datasets are designed to have equal number of tweets distributed over five domains. The experimental results supported by statistical tests show that Transformer-based language models outperform conventional bag-of-words and neural models by at least 5% in English and 10% in Turkish for large-scale hate speech detection. The performance is also scalable to different training sizes, such that 98% of performance in English, and 97% in Turkish, are recovered when 20% of training instances are used. We further examine the generalization ability of cross-domain transfer among hate domains. We show that 96% of the performance of a target domain in average is recovered by other domains for English, and 92% for Turkish. Gender and religion are more successful to generalize to other domains, while sports fail most. ",

    "abstract": "Big data streams are possibly one of the most essential underlying notions. However, data streams are often challenging to handle owing to their rapid pace and limited information lifetime. It is difficult to collect and communicate stream samples while storing, transmitting and computing a function across the whole stream or even a large segment of it. In answer to this research issue, many streaming-specific solutions were developed. Stream techniques imply a limited capacity of one or more resources such as computing power and memory, as well as time or accuracy limits. Reservoir sampling algorithms choose and store results that are probabilistically significant. A weighted random sampling approach using a generalised sampling algorithmic framework to detect unique events is the key research goal of this work. Briefly, a gradually developed estimate of the joint stream distribution across all feasible components keeps k stream elements judged representative for the full stream. Once estimate confidence is high, k samples are chosen evenly. The complexity is O(min(k,n-k)), where n is the number of items inspected. Due to the fact that events are usually considered outliers, it is sufficient to extract element patterns and push them to an alternate version of k-means as proposed here. The suggested technique calculates the sum of squared errors (SSE) for each cluster, and this is utilised not only as a measure of convergence, but also as a quantification and an indirect assessment of the element distribution's approximation accuracy. This clustering enables for the detection of outliers in the stream based on their distance from the usual event centroids. The findings reveal that weighted sampling and res-means outperform typical approaches for stream event identification. Detected events are shown as knowledge graphs, along with typical clusters of events. ",

    "abstract": "With the rapid development of smart manufacturing, data-driven machinery health management has received a growing attention. As one of the most popular methods in machinery health management, deep learning (DL) has achieved remarkable successes. However, due to the issues of limited samples and poor separability of different cavitation states of acoustic signals, which greatly hinder the eventual performance of DL modes for cavitation intensity recognition and cavitation detection. In this work, a novel multi-task learning framework for simultaneous cavitation detection and cavitation intensity recognition framework using 1-D double hierarchical residual networks (1-D DHRN) is proposed for analyzing valves acoustic signals. Firstly, a data augmentation method based on sliding window with fast Fourier transform (Swin-FFT) is developed to alleviate the small-sample issue confronted in this study. Secondly, a 1-D double hierarchical residual block (1-D DHRB) is constructed to capture sensitive features from the frequency domain acoustic signals of valve. Then, a new structure of 1-D DHRN is proposed. Finally, the devised 1-D DHRN is evaluated on two datasets of valve acoustic signals without noise (Dataset 1 and Dataset 2) and one dataset of valve acoustic signals with realistic surrounding noise (Dataset 3) provided by SAMSON AG (Frankfurt). Our method has achieved state-of-the-art results. The prediction accurcies of 1-D DHRN for cavitation intensitys recognition are as high as 93.75%, 94.31% and 100%, which indicates that 1-D DHRN outperforms other DL models and conventional methods. At the same time, the testing accuracies of 1-D DHRN for cavitation detection are as high as 97.02%, 97.64% and 100%. In addition, 1-D DHRN has also been tested for different frequencies of samples and shows excellent results for frequency of samples that mobile phones can accommodate. ",

While estimating the scene flow from LiDAR has progressed recently, it remains largely unknown how to estimate the scene flow from a 4D radar - an increasingly popular automotive sensor for its robustness against adverse weather and lighting conditions. Compared with the LiDAR point clouds, radar data are drastically sparser, noisier and in much lower resolution. Annotated datasets for radar scene flow are also in absence and costly to acquire in the real world. These factors jointly pose the radar scene flow estimation as a challenging problem. This work aims to address the above challenges and estimate scene flow from 4D radar point clouds by leveraging self-supervised learning. A robust scene flow estimation architecture and three novel losses are bespoken designed to cope with intractable radar data.

The core idea of our method is that contextual information is critical to tell the difference when the instance geometry is incomplete or featureless. We find that relations between proposals provide a good representation to describe the context. However, adopting relations between all the object or patch proposals for detection is inefficient, and an imbalanced combination of local and global relations brings extra noise that could mislead the training. Rather than working with all relations, we found that training with relations only between the most representative ones, or anchors, can significantly boost the detection performance. A good anchor should be semantic-aware with no ambiguity and independent with other anchors as well. To find the anchors, we first perform a preliminary relation anchor module with an objectness-aware sampling approach and then devise a displacement-based module for weighing the relation importance for better utilization of contextual information. This lightweight relation module leads to significantly higher accuracy of object instance detection when being plugged into the state-of-the-art detectors. Evaluations on the public benchmarks of real-world scenes show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on both SUN RGB-D and ScanNet V2. ",

On the other hand, recent developments in artificial intelligence have led to algorithms that promise much higher counting quality (lower bias). However, gradient-based methods (including Deep Learning) have one limitation: they typically run into local optima. In this work, we explore and exploit various aspects of machine learning to increase reliability, performance, and counting quality. We perform a grid search with several fundamental parameters: the selection and size of the training set, which is similar to cross-validation, and the initial network weights and randomness during the training process. Using this experiment, we show how aggregation techniques such as ensemble quantiles can reduce bias, and we give an idea of the overall spread of the results. We utilize the test success chance, a simulative metric based on the empirical distribution. We also employ a post-training Monte Carlo quantization approach and introduce cumulative summation to turn counting into a stationary method and allow unbounded counts. ",

In this paper, we (i) propose a novel adversarial perturbation detection scheme based on multi-task perception of complex vision tasks (i.e., depth estimation and semantic segmentation). Specifically, adversarial perturbations are detected by inconsistencies between extracted edges of the input image, the depth output, and the segmentation output. To further improve this technique, we (ii) develop a novel edge consistency loss between all three modalities, thereby improving their initial consistency which in turn supports our detection scheme. We verify our detection scheme's effectiveness by employing various known attacks and image noises. In addition, we (iii) develop a multi-task adversarial attack, aiming at fooling both tasks as well as our detection scheme. Experimental evaluation on the Cityscapes and KITTI datasets shows that under an assumption of a 5% false positive rate up to 100% of images are correctly detected as adversarially perturbed, depending on the strength of the perturbation.

The ground surface is modeled as a UBS which is robust towards varying measurement densities and with a single parameter controlling the smoothness prior. We model the estimation process as a robust LS optimization problem which can be reformulated as a linear problem and thus solved efficiently. Using the SemanticKITTI data set, we conduct a quantitative evaluation by classifying the point-wise semantic annotations into ground and non-ground points. Finally, we validate the approach on our research vehicle in real-world scenarios. ",

We propose an architecture that combines state-of-the-art vision backbone networks with graph neural networks. More specifically, we perform a road type classification task on an Open Street Map road network through encoding of satellite imagery using various ResNet architectures. Our architecture further enables fine-tuning and a transfer-learning approach is evaluated by pretraining on the NWPU-RESISC45 image classification dataset for remote sensing and comparing them to purely ImageNet-pretrained ResNet models as visual feature encoders. The results show not only that the visual feature encoders are superior to low-level visual features, but also that the fine-tuning of the visual feature encoder to a general remote sensing dataset such as NWPU-RESISC45 can further improve the performance of a GNN on a machine learning task like road type classification.

While a model-free DRL algorithm can solve unknown dynamics and high-dimensional problems, it lacks safety assurance. Although safety constraints can be encoded as part of a reward function, there still exists a large gap between an RL controller trained with this modified reward and a safe controller. In contrast, instead of implicitly encoding safety constraints with rewards, we explicitly co-learn a Twin Neural Lyapunov Function (TNLF) with the control policy in the DRL training loop and use the learned TNLF to build a runtime monitor. Combined with the path generated from a planner, the monitor chooses appropriate waypoints that guide the learned controller to provide collision-free control trajectories. Our approach inherits the scalability advantages from DRL while enhancing safety guarantees. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach compared to DRL with augmented rewards and constrained DRL methods over a range of high-dimensional safety-sensitive navigation tasks.

We address the filling type classification with audio data and then combine this information from audio with video modalities to address the filling level classification. For the container capacity, dimension, and mass estimation, we present a data augmentation and consistency measurement to alleviate the over-fitting issue in the CCM dataset caused by the limited number of containers. We augment the training data using an object-of-interest-based re-scaling that increases the variety of physical values of the containers. We then perform the consistency measurement to choose a model with low prediction variance in the same containers under different scenes, which ensures the generalization ability of the model. Our method improves the generalization ability of the models to estimate the property of the containers that were not previously seen in the training. ",

Researchers have recently found an intrinsic trade-off between the accuracy and smoothness of neural networks, so training a network with a loose Lipschitz constant estimation imposes a strong regularization and can hurt the model accuracy significantly. In this work, we provide a unified theoretical framework, a quantitative geometric approach, to address the Lipschitz constant estimation. By adopting this framework, we can immediately obtain several theoretical results, including the computational hardness of Lipschitz constant estimation and its approximability. Furthermore, the quantitative geometric perspective can also provide some insights into recent empirical observations that techniques for one norm do not usually transfer to another one. We also implement the algorithms induced from this quantitative geometric approach in a tool GeoLIP. These algorithms are based on semidefinite programming (SDP). Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that GeoLIP is more scalable and precise than existing tools on Lipschitz constant estimation for $\\ell_\\infty$-perturbations. Furthermore, we also show its intricate relations with other recent SDP-based techniques, both theoretically and empirically. We believe that this unified quantitative geometric perspective can bring new insights and theoretical tools to the investigation of neural-network smoothness and robustness. ",

The mapping is achieved via the use of the recently-developed cycle-consistent generative adversarial network (cycle-GAN) and an assembly of neural networks targeted on maintaining the desired orthogonality. The method is tested on simulated data from structures with cubic nonlinearities and different numbers of degrees of freedom, and also on data from an experimental three-degree-of-freedom set-up with a column-bumper nonlinearity. The results reveal the method's efficiency in separating the `modes'. The method also provides a nonlinear superposition function, which in most cases has very good accuracy. ",

This phenomenon is called Neural Collapse (NC), which seems to take place regardless of the choice of loss functions. In this work, we justify NC under the mean squared error (MSE) loss, where recent empirical evidence shows that it performs comparably or even better than the de-facto cross-entropy loss. Under a simplified unconstrained feature model, we provide the first global landscape analysis for vanilla nonconvex MSE loss and show that the (only!) global minimizers are neural collapse solutions, while all other critical points are strict saddles whose Hessian exhibit negative curvature directions. Furthermore, we justify the usage of rescaled MSE loss by probing the optimization landscape around the NC solutions, showing that the landscape can be improved by tuning the rescaling hyperparameters. Finally, our theoretical findings are experimentally verified on practical network architectures. ",

Particularly, our representation, named H4D, represents dynamic 3D human over a temporal span into the latent spaces encoding shape, initial pose, motion and auxiliary information. A simple yet effective linear motion model is proposed to provide a rough and regularized motion estimation, followed by per-frame compensation for pose and geometry details with the residual encoded in the auxiliary code. Technically, we introduce novel GRU-based architectures to facilitate learning and improve the representation capability. Extensive experiments demonstrate our method is not only efficacy in recovering dynamic human with accurate motion and detailed geometry, but also amenable to various 4D human related tasks, including motion retargeting, motion completion and future prediction.

Some works capture the features that are unrelated to method-specific artifacts, such as clues of blending boundary, accumulated up-sampling, to strengthen the generalization ability. However, the effectiveness of these methods can be easily corrupted by post-processing operations such as compression. Inspired by transfer learning, neural networks pre-trained on other large-scale face-related tasks may provide useful features for deepfake detection. For example, lip movement has been proved to be a kind of robust and good-transferring highlevel semantic feature, which can be learned from the lipreading task. However, the existing method pre-trains the lip feature extraction model in a supervised manner, which requires plenty of human resources in data annotation and increases the difficulty of obtaining training data. In this paper, we propose a self-supervised transformer based audio-visual contrastive learning method. The proposed method learns mouth motion representations by encouraging the paired video and audio representations to be close while unpaired ones to be diverse. After pre-training with our method, the model will then be partially fine-tuned for deepfake detection task.

We applied a flow redistribution model to investigate the robustness against cascading failures in modern systems carrying flows/loads (i.e. power grid, transportation system, etc.) that contain multiple interdependent networks. In such a system, the coupling coefficients between networks, which determine how much flows/loads are redistributed between networks, are a key factor determining the robustness to cascading failures. We derive recursive expressions to characterize the evolution of such a system under dynamic network coupling. Using these expressions, we enhance the robustness of interdependent network systems by dynamically adjusting the coupling coefficients based on current system situations, minimizing the subsequent failures. The analytical and simulation results show a significant improvement in robustness compared to prior work, which considers only fixed coupling coefficients. Our proposed Step-wise Optimization (SWO) method not only shows good performance against cascading failures, but also offers better computational complexity, scalability to multiple networks, and flexibility to different attack types. We show in simulation that SWO provides robustness against cascading failures for multiple different network topologies. ",

In order to accelerate generalization towards diverse and understudied modalities, we investigate methods for high-modality (a large set of diverse modalities) and partially-observable (each task only defined on a small subset of modalities) scenarios. To tackle these challenges, we design a general multimodal model that enables multitask and transfer learning: multitask learning with shared parameters enables stable parameter counts (addressing scalability), and cross-modal transfer learning enables information sharing across modalities and tasks (addressing partial observability). Our resulting model generalizes across text, image, video, audio, time-series, sensors, tables, and set modalities from different research areas, improves the tradeoff between performance and efficiency, transfers to new modalities and tasks, and reveals surprising insights on the nature of information sharing in multitask models.

In a nutshell, PoS allows an adversary with a vanishing amount of stake to produce an unlimited number of equivocating blocks. While most equivocating blocks will be orphaned, such orphaned `uncle blocks' still influence fork choice under the GHOST paradigm, bestowing upon the adversary devastating control over the canonical chain. While the Latest Message Driven (LMD) aspect of current PoS Ethereum prevents a straightforward application of this attack, our second attack shows how LMD specifically can be exploited to obtain a new variant of the balancing attack that overcomes a recent protocol addition that was intended to mitigate balancing-type attacks.

Being sourced by the electron pressure field, the tSZ effect depends on baryonic physics that is usually modeled by expensive hydrodynamic simulations. We train neural networks on the IllustrisTNG-300 cosmological simulation to predict the continuous electron pressure field in galaxy clusters from gravity-only simulations. Modeling clusters is challenging for neural networks as most of the gas pressure is concentrated in a handful of voxels and even the largest hydrodynamical simulations contain only a few hundred clusters that can be used for training. Instead of conventional convolutional neural net (CNN) architectures, we choose to employ a rotationally equivariant DeepSets architecture to operate directly on the set of dark matter particles. We argue that set-based architectures provide distinct advantages over CNNs. For example, we can enforce exact rotational and permutation equivariance, incorporate existing knowledge on the tSZ field, and work with sparse fields as are standard in cosmology. We compose our architecture with separate, physically meaningful modules, making it amenable to interpretation. For example, we can separately study the influence of local and cluster-scale environment, determine that cluster triaxiality has negligible impact, and train a module that corrects for mis-centering. Our model improves by 70 % on analytic profiles fit to the same simulation data. We argue that the electron pressure field, viewed as a function of a gravity-only simulation, has inherent stochasticity, and model this property through a conditional-VAE extension to the network. This modification yields further improvement by 7 %, it is limited by our small training set however. (abridged) ",

To do so, we introduce a new model that considers a layered structure of teams to unveil a new form of hierarchical localization (i.e., the localization of information at the top or center of an organization) and study its interplay with known phenomena of mesoscopic localization (i.e., the localization of information in large groups), $k$-core localization (i.e., around denser $k$-cores) and hub localization (i.e., around high degree stars). We also include a complex contagion mechanism by considering a general infection kernel which can depend on hierarchical level (influence), degree (popularity), infectious neighbors (social reinforcement) or team size (importance). This general model allows us to study the multifaceted phenomenon of information siloing in complex organizational interaction networks and opens the door to new optimization problems to promote or hinder the emergence of different localization regimes.

    "abstract": "Preserving the performance of a trained model while removing unique characteristics of marked training data points is challenging. Recent research usually suggests retraining a model from scratch with remaining training data or refining the model by reverting the model optimization on the marked data points. Unfortunately, aside from their computational inefficiency, those approaches inevitably hurt the resulting model's generalization ability since they remove not only unique characteristics but also discard shared (and possibly contributive) information. To address the performance degradation problem, this paper presents a novel approach called Performance Unchanged Model Augmentation~(PUMA). The proposed PUMA framework explicitly models the influence of each training data point on the model's generalization ability with respect to various performance criteria. It then complements the negative impact of removing marked data by reweighting the remaining data optimally. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the PUMA framework, we compared it with multiple state-of-the-art data removal techniques in the experiments, where we show the PUMA can effectively and efficiently remove the unique characteristics of marked training data without retraining the model that can 1) fool a membership attack, and 2) resist performance degradation. In addition, as PUMA estimates the data importance during its operation, we show it could serve to debug mislabelled data points more efficiently than existing approaches. ",

In adversarial PAC learning, an adversary is allowed to replace a test point $x$ with an arbitrary point in a closed ball of radius $r$ centered at $x$. In the tolerant version, the error of the learner is compared with the best achievable error with respect to a slightly larger perturbation radius $(1+\\gamma)r$. For perturbation sets with doubling dimension $d$, we show that a variant of the natural ``perturb-and-smooth'' algorithm PAC learns any hypothesis class $\\mathcal{H}$ with VC dimension $v$ in the $\\gamma$-tolerant adversarial setting with $O\\left(\\frac{v(1+1/\\gamma)^{O(d)}}{\\varepsilon}\\right)$ samples. This is the first such general guarantee with linear dependence on $v$ even for the special case where the domain is the real line and the perturbation sets are closed balls (intervals) of radius $r$. However, the proposed guarantees for the perturb-and-smooth algorithm currently only hold in the tolerant robust realizable setting and exhibit exponential dependence on $d$. We additionally propose an alternative learning method which yields sample complexity bounds with only linear dependence on the doubling dimension even in the more general agnostic case. This approach is based on sample compression. ",

We propose a new vision on neural network robustness using Riemannian geometry and foliation theory, and create a new adversarial attack by taking into account the curvature of the data space. This new adversarial attack called the \"dog-leg attack\" is a two-step approximation of a geodesic in the data space. The data space is treated as a (pseudo) Riemannian manifold equipped with the pullback of the Fisher Information Metric (FIM) of the neural network. In most cases, this metric is only semi-definite and its kernel becomes a central object to study. A canonical foliation is derived from this kernel. The curvature of the foliation's leaves gives the appropriate correction to get a two-step approximation of the geodesic and hence a new efficient adversarial attack. Our attack is tested on a toy example, a neural network trained to mimic the $\\texttt{Xor}$ function, and demonstrates better results that the state of the art attack presented by Zhao et al.

However, we observe that thequality scores of an image given by a group of subjects are verysubjective and diverse. Thus it is not enough to use a MOS todescribe the image quality. In this paper, we propose to describeimage quality using a parameterized distribution rather thana MOS, and an objective method is also proposed to predictthe image quality score distribution (IQSD). At first, the LIVEdatabase is re-recorded. Specifically, we have invited a largegroup of subjects to evaluate the quality of all images in theLIVE database, and each image is evaluated by a large numberof subjects (187 valid subjects), whose scores can form a reliableIQSD. By analyzing the obtained subjective quality scores, wefind that the IQSD can be well modeled by an alpha stable model,and it can reflect much more information than a single MOS, suchas the skewness of opinion score, the subject diversity and themaximum probability score for an image. Therefore, we proposeto model the IQSD using the alpha stable model. Moreover, wepropose a framework and an algorithm to predict the alphastable model based IQSD, where quality features are extractedfrom each image based on structural information and statisticalinformation, and support vector regressors are trained to predictthe alpha stable model parameters. Experimental results verifythe feasibility of using alpha stable model to describe the IQSD,and prove the effectiveness of objective alpha stable model basedIQSD prediction method. ",

This method capitalizes on recent advances which frame the change detection problem into a robust fusion framework. More precisely, we show that a deep adversarial network designed and trained beforehand to fuse a pair of multiband images can be easily complemented by a network with the same architecture to perform change detection. The resulting overall architecture itself follows an adversarial strategy where the fusion network and the additional network are interpreted as essential building blocks of a generator. A comparison with state-of-the-art change detection methods demonstrate the versatility and the effectiveness of the proposed approach. ",

    "abstract": "Low-rank matrix estimation under heavy-tailed noise is challenging, both computationally and statistically. Convex approaches have been proven statistically optimal but suffer from high computational costs, especially since robust loss functions are usually non-smooth. More recently, computationally fast non-convex approaches via sub-gradient descent are proposed, which, unfortunately, fail to deliver a statistically consistent estimator even under sub-Gaussian noise. In this paper, we introduce a novel Riemannian sub-gradient (RsGrad) algorithm which is not only computationally efficient with linear convergence but also is statistically optimal, be the noise Gaussian or heavy-tailed. Convergence theory is established for a general framework and specific applications to absolute loss, Huber loss and quantile loss are investigated. Compared with existing non-convex methods, ours reveals a surprising phenomenon of dual-phase convergence. In phase one, RsGrad behaves as in a typical non-smooth optimization that requires gradually decaying stepsizes. However, phase one only delivers a statistically sub-optimal estimator which is already observed in existing literature. Interestingly, during phase two, RsGrad converges linearly as if minimizing a smooth and strongly convex objective function and thus a constant stepsize suffices. Underlying the phase-two convergence is the smoothing effect of random noise to the non-smooth robust losses in an area close but not too close to the truth. Numerical simulations confirm our theoretical discovery and showcase the superiority of RsGrad over prior methods. ",

Our method utilizes positional information of a network's nodes by appropriately normalizing the frequency of automorphic orbits appearing in the induced graphlets of sizes 2-5. There are some evolutionary constraints imposed on the network's topology which shape its local architecture as well as its behavior. According to these rules (features), each type of network occupies its respective position within a common network space. A deep neural network was trained on differentially expressed orbits resulting in a prediction accuracy of 85%.

Cumulative Merging Percolation (CMP) is an new percolation process that assumes long-range interactions, such that nodes can merge into clusters even if they are topologically distant. Hence in CMP percolation clusters do not coincide with the topological connected components of the network. Previous work has shown that a specific formulation of CMP features peculiar mechanisms for the formation of the giant cluster, and allows to model different network dynamics such as recurrent epidemic processes. Here we develop a more general formulation of CMP in terms of the functional form of the cluster interaction range, showing an even richer phase transition scenario with competition of different mechanisms resulting in crossover phenomena.

However, the predicted segmentation maps obtained from such standard CNN do not allow direct quantification of regional shape properties such as regional wall thickness. Furthermore, the CNNs lack explicit shape constraints, occasionally resulting in unrealistic segmentations. In this paper, we use a CNN to predict shape parameters of an underlying statistical shape model of the myocardium learned from a training set of images. Additionally, the cardiac pose is predicted, which allows to reconstruct the myocardial contours. The integrated shape model regularizes the predicted contours and guarantees realistic shapes. We enforce robustness of shape and pose prediction by simultaneously performing pixel-wise semantic segmentation during training and define two loss functions to impose consistency between the two predicted representations: one distance-based loss and one overlap-based loss. We evaluated the proposed method in a 5-fold cross validation on an in-house clinical dataset with 75 subjects and on the ACDC and LVQuan19 public datasets. We show the benefits of simultaneous semantic segmentation and the two newly defined loss functions for the prediction of shape parameters. Our method achieved a correlation of 99% for left ventricular (LV) area on the three datasets, between 91% and 97% for myocardial area, 98-99% for LV dimensions and between 80% and 92% for regional wall thickness.

These two test statistics are both theoretically well-founded and exploit different sources of information based on the likelihood for the typicality test and its gradient for the score test. We show that combining them using Fisher's method overall leads to a more accurate out-of-distribution test. We also discuss the benefits of casting out-of-distribution detection as a statistical testing problem, noting in particular that false positive rate control can be valuable for practical out-of-distribution detection.

In this paper, to encode an intra-prediction residual block, we pursue a hybrid model-based / data-driven approach: the first $K$ eigenvectors of a transform matrix are derived from a statistical model, e.g., the asymmetric discrete sine transform (ADST), for stability, while the remaining $N-K$ are computed from $\\bar{C}$ for performance. The transform computation is posed as a graph learning problem, where we seek a graph Laplacian matrix minimizing a graphical lasso objective inside a convex cone sharing the first $K$ eigenvectors in a Hilbert space of real symmetric matrices. We efficiently solve the problem via augmented Lagrangian relaxation and proximal gradient (PG). Using WebP as a baseline image codec, experimental results show that our hybrid graph transform achieved better energy compaction than default discrete cosine transform (DCT) and better stability than KLT.

Here, the gold standard for estimating causal effects are randomized controlled trials; however, such trials are costly and sometimes even unethical. Instead, medical practice is increasingly interested in estimating causal effects among patient subgroups from electronic health records, that is, observational data. In this paper, we aim at estimating the average causal effect (ACE) from observational data (patient trajectories) that are collected over time. For this, we propose DeepACE: an end-to-end deep learning model. DeepACE leverages the iterative G-computation formula to adjust for the bias induced by time-varying confounders. Moreover, we develop a novel sequential targeting procedure which ensures that DeepACE has favorable theoretical properties, i.e., is doubly robust and asymptotically efficient. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that proposes an end-to-end deep learning model for estimating time-varying ACEs. We compare DeepACE in an extensive number of experiments, confirming that it achieves state-of-the-art performance. We further provide a case study for patients suffering from low back pain to demonstrate that DeepACE generates important and meaningful findings for clinical practice.

Our goal is to compare machine learning retrievals of exoplanet transmission spectra with nested sampling, and understand if machine learning can be as reliable as Bayesian retrievals for a statistically significant sample of spectra while being orders of magnitude faster. We generate grids of synthetic transmission spectra and their corresponding planetary and atmospheric parameters, one using free chemistry models, and the other using equilibrium chemistry models. Each grid is subsequently rebinned to simulate both HST/WFC3 and JWST/NIRSpec observations, yielding four datasets in total. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are trained with each of the datasets. We perform retrievals on a 1,000 simulated observations for each combination of model type and instrument with nested sampling and machine learning. We also use both methods to perform retrievals on real WFC3 transmission spectra. Finally, we test how robust machine learning and nested sampling are against incorrect assumptions in our models. CNNs reach a lower coefficient of determination between predicted and true values of the parameters. Nested sampling underestimates the uncertainty in ~8% of retrievals, whereas CNNs estimate them correctly. For real WFC3 observations, nested sampling and machine learning agree within $2\\sigma$ for ~86% of spectra. When doing retrievals with incorrect assumptions, nested sampling underestimates the uncertainty in ~12% to ~41% of cases, whereas this is always below ~10% for the CNN. ",

    "title": "Flow-based density of states for complex actions",
    "abstract": "Emerging sampling algorithms based on normalizing flows have the potential to solve ergodicity problems in lattice calculations. Furthermore, it has been noted that flows can be used to compute thermodynamic quantities which are difficult to access with traditional methods. This suggests that they are also applicable to the density-of-states approach to complex action problems. In particular, flow-based sampling may be used to compute the density directly, in contradistinction to the conventional strategy of reconstructing it via measuring and integrating the derivative of its logarithm. By circumventing this procedure, the accumulation of errors from the numerical integration is avoided completely and the overall normalization factor can be determined explicitly. In this proof-of-principle study, we demonstrate our method in the context of two-component scalar field theory where the $O(2)$ symmetry is explicitly broken by an imaginary external field. First, we concentrate on the zero-dimensional case which can be solved exactly. We show that with our method, the Lee-Yang zeroes of the associated partition function can be successfully located. Subsequently, we confirm that the flow-based approach correctly reproduces the density computed with conventional methods in one- and two-dimensional models. ",
