    "abstract": "Despite the enormous success of artificial neural networks (ANNs) in many disciplines, the characterization of their computations and the origin of key properties such as generalization and robustness remain open questions. Recent literature suggests that robust networks with good generalization properties tend to be biased towards processing low frequencies in images. To explore the frequency bias hypothesis further, we develop an algorithm that allows us to learn modulatory masks highlighting the essential input frequencies needed for preserving a trained network's performance. We achieve this by imposing invariance in the loss with respect to such modulations in the input frequencies. We first use our method to test the low-frequency preference hypothesis of adversarially trained or data-augmented networks. Our results suggest that adversarially robust networks indeed exhibit a low-frequency bias but we find this bias is also dependent on directions in frequency space. However, this is not necessarily true for other types of data augmentation. Our results also indicate that the essential frequencies in question are effectively the ones used to achieve generalization in the first place. Surprisingly, images seen through these modulatory masks are not recognizable and resemble texture-like patterns. ",

    "abstract": "The Multi-Objective Real-Valued Gene-pool Optimal Mixing Evolutionary Algorithm (MO-RV-GOMEA) has been proven effective and efficient in solving real-world problems. A prime example is optimizing treatment plans for prostate cancer brachytherapy, an internal form of radiation treatment, for which equally important clinical aims from a base protocol are grouped into two objectives and bi-objectively optimized. This use of MO-RV-GOMEA was recently successfully introduced into clinical practice. Brachytherapy can also play an important role in treating cervical cancer. However, using the same approach to optimize treatment plans often does not immediately lead to clinically desirable results. Concordantly, medical experts indicate that they use additional aims beyond the cervix base protocol. Moreover, these aims have different priorities and can be patient-specifically adjusted. For this reason, we propose a novel adaptive objective configuration method to use with MO-RV-GOMEA so that we can accommodate additional aims of this nature. Based on results using only the base protocol, in consultation with medical experts, we configured key additional aims. We show how, for 10 patient cases, the new approach achieves the intended result, properly taking into account the additional aims. Consequently, plans resulting from the new approach are preferred by medical specialists in 8/10 cases. ",

Assuming that the observed system follows an unknown partial differential equation, we derive a continuous-time model for the dynamics of the data via the finite element method. The resulting graph neural network estimates the instantaneous effects of the unknown dynamics on each cell in a meshing of the spatial domain. Our model can incorporate prior knowledge via assumptions on the form of the unknown PDE, which induce a structural bias towards learning specific processes. Through this mechanism, we derive a transport variant of our model from the convection equation and show that it improves the transfer performance to higher-resolution meshes on sea surface temperature and gas flow forecasting against baseline models representing a selection of spatio-temporal forecasting methods. A qualitative analysis shows that our model disentangles the data dynamics into their constituent parts, which makes it uniquely interpretable. ",

However, there are few works in the literature focused on studying the internal quality of systems implemented in this language. Particularly, to the best of our knowledge, there is currently no catalog of code smells for Elixir. Therefore, in this paper, through a grey literature review, we investigate whether Elixir developers discuss code smells. Our preliminary results indicate that 11 of the 22 traditional code smells cataloged by Fowler and Beck are discussed by Elixir developers. We also propose a list of 18 new smells specific for Elixir systems and investigate whether these smells are currently identified by Credo, a well-known static code analysis tool for Elixir. We conclude that only two traditional code smells and one Elixir-specific code smell are automatically detected by this tool. Thus, these early results represent an opportunity for extending tools such as Credo to detect code smells and then contribute to improving the internal quality of Elixir systems. ",

    "abstract": "Objective: Disease knowledge graphs are a way to connect, organize, and access disparate information about diseases with numerous benefits for artificial intelligence (AI). To create knowledge graphs, it is necessary to extract knowledge from multimodal datasets in the form of relationships between disease concepts and normalize both concepts and relationship types. Methods: We introduce REMAP, a multimodal approach for disease relation extraction and classification. The REMAP machine learning approach jointly embeds a partial, incomplete knowledge graph and a medical language dataset into a compact latent vector space, followed by aligning the multimodal embeddings for optimal disease relation extraction. Results: We apply REMAP approach to a disease knowledge graph with 96,913 relations and a text dataset of 1.24 million sentences. On a dataset annotated by human experts, REMAP improves text-based disease relation extraction by 10.0% (accuracy) and 17.2% (F1-score) by fusing disease knowledge graphs with text information. Further, REMAP leverages text information to recommend new relationships in the knowledge graph, outperforming graph-based methods by 8.4% (accuracy) and 10.4% (F1-score). Discussion: Systematized knowledge is becoming the backbone of AI, creating opportunities to inject semantics into AI and fully integrate it into machine learning algorithms. While prior semantic knowledge can assist in extracting disease relationships from text, existing methods can not fully leverage multimodal datasets. Conclusion: REMAP is a multimodal approach for extracting and classifying disease relationships by fusing structured knowledge and text information. REMAP provides a flexible neural architecture to easily find, access, and validate AI-driven relationships between disease concepts. ",

It supports technologies like the Internet-of-Things (IoT) to pave the way for futuristic smart environments, like smart homes, smart transportation, smart energy trading, smart industries, smart supply chains, and more. To enable these environments, IoT devices, machines, appliances, and vehicles, need to intercommunicate without the need for centralized trusted parties. Blockchain replaces these trusted parties in such trustless environments. It provides security enforcement, privacy assurance, authentication, and other key features to IoT ecosystems. Besides IoT-Blockchain integration, other technologies add more benefits that attract the research community. Software-Defined Networking (SDN), Fog, Edge, and Cloud Computing technologies, for example, play a key role in enabling realistic IoT applications. Moreover, the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) provides smart, dynamic, and autonomous decision-making capabilities for IoT devices in smart environments. To push the research further in this domain, we provide in this paper a comprehensive survey that includes state-of-the-art technological integration, challenges, and solutions for smart environments, and the role of these technologies as the building blocks of such smart environments. We also demonstrate how the level of integration between these technologies has increased over the years, which brings us closer to the futuristic view of smart environments. We further discuss the current need to provide general-purpose Blockchain platforms that can adapt to unique design requirements of different applications and solutions. Finally, we provide a simplified architecture of futuristic smart environments that integrate these technologies, showing the advantage of such integration. ",

Nonetheless, they often suffer from high overhead of communications over network and/or PCIe links. To tackle the limitations of the current solutions, this paper proposes ORCA, a holistic network and architecture co-design solution that leverages current RDMA and emerging cache-coherent off-chip interconnect technologies. Specifically, ORCA consists of four hardware and software components: (1) unified abstraction of inter- and intra-machine communications managed by one-sided RDMA write and cache-coherent memory write; (2) efficient notification of requests to accelerators assisted by cache coherence; (3) cache-coherent accelerator architecture directly processing requests received by NIC; and (4) adaptive device-to-host data transfer for modern server memory systems consisting of both DRAM and NVM exploiting state-of-the-art features in CPUs and PCIe. We prototype ORCA with a commercial system and evaluate three popular datacenter applications: in-memory key-value store, chain replication-based distributed transaction system, and deep learning recommendation model inference. The evaluation shows that ORCA provides 30.1~69.1% lower latency, up to 2.5x higher throughput, and 3x higher power efficiency than the current state-of-the-art solutions. ",

We show that select discriminators (e.g. discriminator trained for Jensen-Shannon divergence) are able to map support differences as support differences in their one-dimensional output space. Following this result, our method aligns supports by minimizing a symmetrized relaxed optimal transport cost in the discriminator 1D space via an adversarial process. Furthermore, we show that our approach can be viewed as a limit of existing notions of alignment by increasing transportation assignment tolerance. We quantitatively evaluate the method across domain adaptation tasks with shifts in label distributions. Our experiments show that the proposed method is more robust against these shifts than other alignment-based baselines. ",

    "abstract": "A large body of the literature on automated program repair develops approaches where patches are automatically generated to be validated against an oracle (e.g., a test suite). Because such an oracle can be imperfect, the generated patches, although validated by the oracle, may actually be incorrect. Our empirical work investigates different representation learning approaches for code changes to derive embeddings that are amenable to similarity computations of patch correctness identification, and assess the possibility of accurate classification of correct patch by combining learned embeddings with engineered features. Experimental results demonstrate the potential of learned embeddings to empower Leopard (a patch correctness predicting framework implemented in this work) with learning algorithms in reasoning about patch correctness: a machine learning predictor with BERT transformer-based learned embeddings associated with XGBoost achieves an AUC value of about 0.895 in the prediction of patch correctness on a new dataset of 2,147 labeled patches that we collected for the experiments. Our investigations show that deep learned embeddings can lead to complementary/better performance when comparing against the state-of-the-art, PATCH-SIM, which relies on dynamic information. By combining deep learned embeddings and engineered features, Panther (the upgraded version of Leopard implemented in this work) outperforms Leopard with higher scores in terms of AUC, +Recall and -Recall, and can accurately identify more (in)correct patches that cannot be predicted by the classifiers only with learned embeddings or engineered features. Finally, we use an explainable ML technique, SHAP, to empirically interpret how the learned embeddings and engineered features are contributed to the patch correctness prediction. ",

However, most deep CNN-based SR models take massive computations to obtain high performance. Downsampling features for multi-resolution fusion is an efficient and effective way to improve the performance of visual recognition. Still, it is counter-intuitive in the SR task, which needs to project a low-resolution input to high-resolution. In this paper, we propose a novel Hybrid Pixel-Unshuffled Network (HPUN) by introducing an efficient and effective downsampling module into the SR task. The network contains pixel-unshuffled downsampling and Self-Residual Depthwise Separable Convolutions. Specifically, we utilize pixel-unshuffle operation to downsample the input features and use grouped convolution to reduce the channels. Besides, we enhance the depthwise convolution's performance by adding the input feature to its output. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that our HPUN achieves and surpasses the state-of-the-art reconstruction performance with fewer parameters and computation costs. ",

This motivated us to explore the reasons why people switch their privacy setting. We studied these switching phenomena quantitatively by comparing the tweeting behaviour of users when public vs protected, and qualitatively using two follow-up surveys (n=100, n=324) to understand potential reasoning behind the observed behaviours. Our quantitative analysis shows that users who switch privacy settings mention others and share hashtags more when their setting is public. Our surveys highlighted that users turn protected to share personal content and regulate boundaries while they turn public to interact with others in ways prevented by being protected. ",

    "abstract": "Temporal action proposal generation (TAPG) aims to estimate temporal intervals of actions in untrimmed videos, which is a challenging yet plays an important role in many tasks of video analysis and understanding. Despite the great achievement in TAPG, most existing works ignore the human perception of interaction between agents and the surrounding environment by applying a deep learning model as a black-box to the untrimmed videos to extract video visual representation. Therefore, it is beneficial and potentially improve the performance of TAPG if we can capture these interactions between agents and the environment. In this paper, we propose a novel framework named Agent-Aware Boundary Network (ABN), which consists of two sub-networks (i) an Agent-Aware Representation Network to obtain both agent-agent and agents-environment relationships in the video representation, and (ii) a Boundary Generation Network to estimate the confidence score of temporal intervals. In the Agent-Aware Representation Network, the interactions between agents are expressed through local pathway, which operates at a local level to focus on the motions of agents whereas the overall perception of the surroundings are expressed through global pathway, which operates at a global level to perceive the effects of agents-environment. Comprehensive evaluations on 20-action THUMOS-14 and 200-action ActivityNet-1.3 datasets with different backbone networks (i.e C3D, SlowFast and Two-Stream) show that our proposed ABN robustly outperforms state-of-the-art methods regardless of the employed backbone network on TAPG. We further examine the proposal quality by leveraging proposals generated by our method onto temporal action detection (TAD) frameworks and evaluate their detection performances.

However, attacks bounded by fractional L_p \"norms\" (quasi-norms defined by the L_p distance with 0<p<1) have yet to be thoroughly considered. We proactively propose a defense with several desirable properties: it provides provable (certified) robustness, scales to ImageNet, and yields deterministic (rather than high-probability) certified guarantees when applied to quantized data (e.g., images). Our technique for fractional L_p robustness constructs expressive, deep classifiers that are globally Lipschitz with respect to the L_p^p metric, for any 0<p<1. However, our method is even more general: we can construct classifiers which are globally Lipschitz with respect to any metric defined as the sum of concave functions of components. Our approach builds on a recent work, Levine and Feizi (2021), which provides a provable defense against L_1 attacks. However, we demonstrate that our proposed guarantees are highly non-vacuous, compared to the trivial solution of using (Levine and Feizi, 2021) directly and applying norm inequalities.

Unfortunately, we find that the privacy of a substantial fraction of end-users is still at risk, despite the efforts by ISPs and electronic vendors to improve end-user security, e.g., by adopting prefix rotation and IPv6 privacy extensions. By analyzing passive data from a large ISP, we find that around 19% of end-users' privacy can be at risk. When we investigate the root causes, we notice that a single device at home that encodes its MAC address into the IPv6 address can be utilized as a tracking identifier for the entire end-user prefix -- even if other devices use IPv6 privacy extensions. Our results show that IoT devices contribute the most to this privacy leakage and, to a lesser extent, personal computers and mobile devices. To our surprise, some of the most popular IoT manufacturers have not yet adopted privacy extensions that could otherwise mitigate this privacy risk. Finally, we show that third-party providers, e.g., hypergiants, can track up to 17% of subscriber lines in our study. ",

We leverage contrastive learning to improve adversarial robustness by considering an adversarial example as another positive example, and aim to maximize the similarity between random augmentations of data samples and their adversarial example, while constantly updating the classification head in order to avoid a cognitive dissociation between the classification head and the embedding space. This dissociation is caused by the fact that CL updates the network up to the embedding space, while freezing the classification head which is used to generate new positive adversarial examples. We validate our method, Contrastive Learning with Adversarial Features(CLAF), on the CIFAR-10 dataset on which it outperforms both robust accuracy and clean accuracy over alternative supervised and self-supervised adversarial learning methods.

In this paper, we propose Point-Unet, a novel method that incorporates the efficiency of deep learning with 3D point clouds into volumetric segmentation. Our key idea is to first predict the regions of interest in the volume by learning an attentional probability map, which is then used for sampling the volume into a sparse point cloud that is subsequently segmented using a point-based neural network. We have conducted the experiments on the medical volumetric segmentation task with both a small-scale dataset Pancreas and large-scale datasets BraTS18, BraTS19, and BraTS20 challenges. A comprehensive benchmark on different metrics has shown that our context-aware Point-Unet robustly outperforms the SOTA voxel-based networks at both accuracies, memory usage during training, and time consumption during testing.

    "abstract": "The last decade has brought forward many great contributions regarding presentation attack detection for the domain of finger and hand vein biometrics. Among those contributions, one is able to find a variety of different attack databases that are either private or made publicly available to the research community. However, it is not always shown whether the used attack samples hold the capability to actually deceive a realistic vein recognition system. Inspired by previous works, this study provides a systematic threat evaluation including three publicly available finger vein attack databases and one private dorsal hand vein database. To do so, 14 distinct vein recognition schemes are confronted with attack samples and the percentage of wrongly accepted attack samples is then reported as the Impostor Attack Presentation Match Rate. As a second step, comparison scores from different recognition schemes are combined using score level fusion with the goal of performing presentation attack detection. ",

To eliminate such vulnerabilities, people built tools to detect security-API misuses via pattern matching. However, most tools do not (1) fix misuses or (2) allow users to extend tools' pattern sets. To overcome both limitations, we created Seader-an example-based approach to detect and repair security-API misuses. Given an exemplar <insecure, secure>code pair, Seader compares the snippets to infer any API-misuse template and corresponding fixing edit. Based on the inferred info, given a program, Seader performs inter-procedural static analysis to search for security-API misuses and to propose customized fixes. For evaluation, we applied Seader to 28 <insecure, secure> codepairs; Seader successfully inferred 21 unique API-misuse templates and related fixes. With these <vulnerability, fix> patterns, we applied SEADER to a program benchmark that has 86 known vulnerabilities. Seader detected vulnerabilities with 95% precision, 72% recall, and82% F-score. We also applied Seader to 100 open-source projects and manually checked 77 suggested repairs; 76 of the repairs were correct. Seader can help developers correctly use security APIs. ",

    "abstract": "Zero-shot learning (ZSL) aims to recognize objects from unseen classes, where the kernel problem is to transfer knowledge from seen classes to unseen classes by establishing appropriate mappings between visual and semantic features. The knowledge transfer in many existing works is limited mainly due to the facts that 1) the widely used visual features are global ones but not totally consistent with semantic attributes; 2) only one mapping is learned in existing works, which is not able to effectively model diverse visual-semantic relations; 3) the bias problem in the generalized ZSL (GZSL) could not be effectively handled. In this paper, we propose two techniques to alleviate these limitations. Firstly, we propose a Semantic-diversity transfer Network (SetNet) addressing the first two limitations, where 1) a multiple-attention architecture and a diversity regularizer are proposed to learn multiple local visual features that are more consistent with semantic attributes and 2) a projector ensemble that geometrically takes diverse local features as inputs is proposed to model visual-semantic relations from diverse local perspectives. Secondly, we propose an inner disagreement based domain detection module (ID3M) for GZSL to alleviate the third limitation, which picks out unseen-class data before class-level classification. Due to the absence of unseen-class data in training stage, ID3M employs a novel self-contained training scheme and detects out unseen-class data based on a designed inner disagreement criterion. Experimental results on three public datasets demonstrate that the proposed SetNet with the explored ID3M achieves a significant improvement against $30$ state-of-the-art methods. ",

Therefore, in this survey, we in-depth review GAL techniques from macro (graph), meso (subgraph), and micro (node/edge) levels. We further detailedly illustrate how GAL enhance the data quality and the model performance. The aggregation mechanism of augmentation strategies and graph learning models are also discussed by different application scenarios, i.e., data-specific, model-specific, and hybrid scenarios. To better show the outperformance of GAL, we experimentally validate the effectiveness and adaptability of different GAL strategies in different downstream tasks. Finally, we share our insights on several open issues of GAL, including heterogeneity, spatio-temporal dynamics, scalability, and generalization. ",

Exploiting the structure of the underlying power network model, we show that the model reduction bases resulting from Q-IRKA have a special subspace structure, which allows us to effectively construct the final model reduction basis.

Precise flight trajectory prediction is of great significance in air transportation management, which contributes to the decision-making for safe and orderly flights. Existing research and application mainly focus on the sequence generation based on historical trajectories, while the aircraft-aircraft interactions in crowded airspace especially the airspaces near busy airports have been largely ignored. On the other hand, there are distinct characteristics of aerodynamics for different flight phases, and the trajectory may be affected by various uncertainties such as weather and advisories from air traffic controllers. However, there is no literature fully considers all these issues. Therefore, we proposed a phased flight trajectory prediction framework. Multi-source and multi-modal datasets have been analyzed and mined using variants of recurrent neural network (RNN) mixture. To be specific, we first introduce spatio temporal graphs into the low-altitude airway prediction problem, and the motion constraints of an aircraft are embedded to the inference process for reliable forecasting results. In the en-route phase, the dual attention mechanism is employed to adaptively extract much more important features from overall datasets to learn the hidden patterns in dynamical environments. The experimental results demonstrate our proposed framework can outperform state-of-the-art methods for flight trajectory prediction for large passenger/transport airplanes. ",

To improve fMRI representation learning and classification under a label-efficient setting, we propose a novel and theory-driven self-supervised learning (SSL) framework on GCNs, namely Graph CCA for Temporal self-supervised learning on fMRI analysis GATE. Concretely, it is demanding to design a suitable and effective SSL strategy to extract formation and robust features for fMRI. To this end, we investigate several new graph augmentation strategies from fMRI dynamic functional connectives (FC) for SSL training. Further, we leverage canonical-correlation analysis (CCA) on different temporal embeddings and present the theoretical implications. Consequently, this yields a novel two-step GCN learning procedure comprised of (i) SSL on an unlabeled fMRI population graph and (ii) fine-tuning on a small labeled fMRI dataset for a classification task.

Consequently, our table detection approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on three public table detection benchmarks, namely cTDaR TrackA, PubLayNet and IIIT-AR-13K, by only using a lightweight ResNet-18 backbone network.

As the spatial CNN module can effectively propagate contextual information across the whole table image, our table structure recognizer can robustly recognize tables with large blank spaces and geometrically distorted (even curved) tables. Thanks to these two techniques, our table structure recognition approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on three public benchmarks, including SciTSR, PubTabNet and cTDaR TrackB. Moreover, we have further demonstrated the advantages of our approach in recognizing tables with complex structures, large blank spaces, empty or spanning cells as well as geometrically distorted or even curved tables on a more challenging in-house dataset.

The high-level intention estimate enables the robot to both (1) safely avoid collision with the human to minimize interruption and (2) cooperatively approach the human and help recover from an assembly failure through admittance control. The low-level intention estimate provides the robot with task-specific information (e.g., which part the human is working on) for concurrent task execution.

    "abstract": "Modern deep neural networks for classification usually jointly learn a backbone for representation and a linear classifier to output the logit of each class. A recent study has shown a phenomenon called neural collapse that the within-class means of features and the classifier vectors converge to the vertices of a simplex equiangular tight frame (ETF) at the terminal phase of training on a balanced dataset. Since the ETF geometric structure maximally separates the pair-wise angles of all classes in the classifier, it is natural to raise the question, why do we spend an effort to learn a classifier when we know its optimal geometric structure? In this paper, we study the potential of learning a neural network for classification with the classifier randomly initialized as an ETF and fixed during training. Our analytical work based on the layer-peeled model indicates that the feature learning with a fixed ETF classifier naturally leads to the neural collapse state even when the dataset is imbalanced among classes. We further show that in this case the cross entropy (CE) loss is not necessary and can be replaced by a simple squared loss that shares the same global optimality but enjoys a more accurate gradient and better convergence property. Our experimental results show that our method is able to achieve similar performances on image classification for balanced datasets, and bring significant improvements in the long-tailed and fine-grained classification tasks.

Key idea of the proposed scheme, referred to as Riemannian conjugate gradient-based joint optimization (RCG-JO), is to jointly optimize the RIS phase shifts and the BS beamforming vectors using the Riemannian conjugate gradient technique. By exploiting the product Riemannian manifold structure of the sets of unit-modulus phase shifts and unit-norm beamforming vectors, we convert the nonconvex uplink power minimization problem into the unconstrained problem and then find out the optimal solution on the product Riemannian manifold.

Among these breakthroughs, a high-quality dataset is one of the essential building blocks that can lead to success in model generalisation and the deployment of data-driven deep neural networks. In particular, synthetic data generation tasks often require more training samples than other supervised approaches. Therefore, in this paper, we share the NIR+RGB datasets that are re-processed from two public datasets (i.e., nirscene and SEN12MS) and our novel NIR+RGB sweet pepper(capsicum) dataset. We quantitatively and qualitatively demonstrate that these NIR+RGB datasets are sufficient to be used for synthetic NIR image generation. We achieved Frechet Inception Distance (FID) of 11.36, 26.53, and 40.15 for nirscene1, SEN12MS, and sweet pepper datasets respectively. In addition, we release manual annotations of 11 fruit bounding boxes that can be exported as various formats using cloud service. Four newly added fruits [blueberry, cherry, kiwi, and wheat] compound 11 novel bounding box datasets on top of our previous work presented in the deepFruits project [apple, avocado, capsicum, mango, orange, rockmelon, strawberry]. The total number of bounding box instances of the dataset is 162k and it is ready to use from cloud service. For the evaluation of the dataset, Yolov5 single stage detector is exploited and reported impressive mean-average-precision,mAP[0.5:0.95] results of[min:0.49, max:0.812].

    "abstract": "One-shot object detection aims at detecting novel objects according to merely one given instance. With extreme data scarcity, current approaches explore various feature fusions to obtain directly transferable meta-knowledge. Yet, their performances are often unsatisfactory. In this paper, we attribute this to inappropriate correlation methods that misalign query-support semantics by overlooking spatial structures and scale variances. Upon analysis, we leverage the attention mechanism and propose a simple but effective architecture named Semantic-aligned Fusion Transformer (SaFT) to resolve these issues. Specifically, we equip SaFT with a vertical fusion module (VFM) for cross-scale semantic enhancement and a horizontal fusion module (HFM) for cross-sample feature fusion. Together, they broaden the vision for each feature point from the support to a whole augmented feature pyramid from the query, facilitating semantic-aligned associations. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our framework. Without fine-tuning on novel classes, it brings significant performance gains to one-stage baselines, lifting state-of-the-art results to a higher level. ",

    "abstract": "Code review is an essential part to software development lifecycle since it aims at guaranteeing the quality of codes. Modern code review activities necessitate developers viewing, understanding and even running the programs to assess logic, functionality, latency, style and other factors. It turns out that developers have to spend far too much time reviewing the code of their peers. Accordingly, it is in significant demand to automate the code review process. In this research, we focus on utilizing pre-training techniques for the tasks in the code review scenario. We collect a large-scale dataset of real world code changes and code reviews from open-source projects in nine of the most popular programming languages. To better understand code diffs and reviews, we propose CodeReviewer, a pre-trained model that utilizes four pre-training tasks tailored specifically for the code review senario. To evaluate our model, we focus on three key tasks related to code review activities, including code change quality estimation, review comment generation and code refinement. Furthermore, we establish a high-quality benchmark dataset based on our collected data for these three tasks and conduct comprehensive experiments on it. The experimental results demonstrate that our model outperforms the previous state-of-the-art pre-training approaches in all tasks. Further analysis show that our proposed pre-training tasks and the multilingual pre-training dataset benefit the model on the understanding of code changes and reviews. ",

    "abstract": "The ability to predict the future trajectory of a patient is a key step toward the development of therapeutics for complex diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, most machine learning approaches developed for prediction of disease progression are either single-task or single-modality models, which can not be directly adopted to our setting involving multi-task learning with high dimensional images. Moreover, most of those approaches are trained on a single dataset (i.e. cohort), which can not be generalized to other cohorts. We propose a novel multimodal multi-task deep learning model to predict AD progression by analyzing longitudinal clinical and neuroimaging data from multiple cohorts. Our proposed model integrates high dimensional MRI features from a 3D convolutional neural network with other data modalities, including clinical and demographic information, to predict the future trajectory of patients. Our model employs an adversarial loss to alleviate the study-specific imaging bias, in particular the inter-study domain shifts. In addition, a Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) optimization technique is applied to further improve model generalization. The proposed model is trained and tested on various datasets in order to evaluate and validate the results. Our results showed that 1) our model yields significant improvement over the baseline models, and 2) models using extracted neuroimaging features from 3D convolutional neural network outperform the same models when applied to MRI-derived volumetric features.

    "abstract": "Speaker embedding is an important front-end module to explore discriminative speaker features for many speech applications where speaker information is needed. Current SOTA backbone networks for speaker embedding are designed to aggregate multi-scale features from an utterance with multi-branch network architectures for speaker representation. However, naively adding many branches of multi-scale features with the simple fully convolutional operation could not efficiently improve the performance due to the rapid increase of model parameters and computational complexity. Therefore, in the most current state-of-the-art network architectures, only a few branches corresponding to a limited number of temporal scales could be designed for speaker embeddings. To address this problem, in this paper, we propose an effective temporal multi-scale (TMS) model where multi-scale branches could be efficiently designed in a speaker embedding network almost without increasing computational costs. The new model is based on the conventional TDNN, where the network architecture is smartly separated into two modeling operators: a channel-modeling operator and a temporal multi-branch modeling operator. Adding temporal multi-scale in the temporal multi-branch operator needs only a little bit increase of the number of parameters, and thus save more computational budget for adding more branches with large temporal scales. Moreover, in the inference stage, we further developed a systemic re-parameterization method to convert the TMS-based model into a single-path-based topology in order to increase inference speed. We investigated the performance of the new TMS method for automatic speaker verification (ASV) on in-domain and out-of-domain conditions. Results show that the TMS-based model obtained a significant increase in the performance over the SOTA ASV models, meanwhile, had a faster inference speed. ",

    "abstract": "How people think, feel, and behave, primarily is a representation of their personality characteristics. By being conscious of personality characteristics of individuals whom we are dealing with or decided to deal with, one can competently ameliorate the relationship, regardless of its type. With the rise of Internet-based communication infrastructures (social networks, forums, etc.), a considerable amount of human communications take place there. The most prominent tool in such communications, is the language in written and spoken form that adroitly encodes all those essential personality characteristics of individuals. Text-based Automatic Personality Prediction (APP) is the automated forecasting of the personality of individuals based on the generated/exchanged text contents. This paper presents a novel knowledge graph-enabled approach to text-based APP that relies on the Big Five personality traits. To this end, given a text a knowledge graph which is a set of interlinked descriptions of concepts, was built through matching the input text's concepts with DBpedia knowledge base entries. Then, due to achieving more powerful representation the graph was enriched with the DBpedia ontology, NRC Emotion Intensity Lexicon, and MRC psycholinguistic database information. Afterwards, the knowledge graph which is now a knowledgeable alternative for the input text was embedded to yield an embedding matrix. Finally, to perform personality predictions the resulting embedding matrix was fed to four suggested deep learning models independently, which are based on convolutional neural network (CNN), simple recurrent neural network (RNN), long short term memory (LSTM) and bidirectional long short term memory (BiLSTM). The results indicated a considerable improvements in prediction accuracies in all of the suggested classifiers. ",

This motion synthesis consists of our modified Variational AutoEncoder (VAE) and Inverse Kinematics (IK). In this VAE, our proposed sampling-near-samples method generates various valid motions even with insufficient training motion data. Our IK-based motion synthesis method allows us to generate a variety of motions semi-automatically. Since these two schemes generate unrealistic artifacts in the synthesized motions, our motion correction rectifies them. This motion correction scheme consists of imitation learning with physics simulation and subsequent motion debiasing. For this imitation learning, we propose the PD-residual force that significantly accelerates the training process. Furthermore, our motion debiasing successfully offsets the motion bias induced by imitation learning to maximize the effect of augmentation. As a result, our method outperforms previous noise-based motion augmentation methods by a large margin on both Recurrent Neural Network-based and Graph Convolutional Network-based human motion prediction models.

    "abstract": "The daily practice of sharing images on social media raises a severe issue about privacy leakage. To address the issue, privacy-leaking image detection is studied recently, with the goal to automatically identify images that may leak privacy. Recent advance on this task benefits from focusing on crucial objects via pretrained object detectors and modeling their correlation. However, these methods have two limitations: 1) they neglect other important elements like scenes, textures, and objects beyond the capacity of pretrained object detectors; 2) the correlation among objects is fixed, but a fixed correlation is not appropriate for all the images. To overcome the limitations, we propose the Dynamic Region-Aware Graph Convolutional Network (DRAG) that dynamically finds out crucial regions including objects and other important elements, and models their correlation adaptively for each input image. To find out crucial regions, we cluster spatially-correlated feature channels into several region-aware feature maps. Further, we dynamically model the correlation with the self-attention mechanism and explore the interaction among the regions with a graph convolutional network. The DRAG achieved an accuracy of 87% on the largest dataset for privacy-leaking image detection, which is 10 percentage points higher than the state of the art. The further case study demonstrates that it found out crucial regions containing not only objects but other important elements like textures. ",

    "abstract": "The transferability of adversarial examples allows the deception on black-box models, and transfer-based targeted attacks have attracted a lot of interest due to their practical applicability. To maximize the transfer success rate, adversarial examples should avoid overfitting to the source model, and image augmentation is one of the primary approaches for this. However, prior works utilize simple image transformations such as resizing, which limits input diversity. To tackle this limitation, we propose the object-based diverse input (ODI) method that draws an adversarial image on a 3D object and induces the rendered image to be classified as the target class. Our motivation comes from the humans' superior perception of an image printed on a 3D object. If the image is clear enough, humans can recognize the image content in a variety of viewing conditions. Likewise, if an adversarial example looks like the target class to the model, the model should also classify the rendered image of the 3D object as the target class. The ODI method effectively diversifies the input by leveraging an ensemble of multiple source objects and randomizing viewing conditions. In our experimental results on the ImageNet-Compatible dataset, this method boosts the average targeted attack success rate from 28.3% to 47.0% compared to the state-of-the-art methods. We also demonstrate the applicability of the ODI method to adversarial examples on the face verification task and its superior performance improvement.

As with the recent emergence of vision transformer (ViT) models, it remains underexplored how spurious correlations are manifested in such architectures. In this paper, we systematically investigate the robustness of vision transformers to spurious correlations on three challenging benchmark datasets and compare their performance with popular CNNs. Our study reveals that when pre-trained on a sufficiently large dataset, ViT models are more robust to spurious correlations than CNNs. Key to their success is the ability to generalize better from the examples where spurious correlations do not hold. Further, we perform extensive ablations and experiments to understand the role of the self-attention mechanism in providing robustness under spuriously correlated environments. We hope that our work will inspire future research on further understanding the robustness of ViT models. ",

    "abstract": "Self-supervised learning, especially contrastive learning, has made an outstanding contribution to the development of many deep learning research fields. Recently, researchers in the acoustic signal processing field noticed its success and leveraged contrastive learning for better music representation. Typically, existing approaches maximize the similarity between two distorted audio segments sampled from the same music. In other words, they ensure a semantic agreement at the music level. However, those coarse-grained methods neglect some inessential or noisy elements at the frame level, which may be detrimental to the model to learn the effective representation of music. Towards this end, this paper proposes a novel Positive-nEgative frame mask for Music Representation based on the contrastive learning framework, abbreviated as PEMR. Concretely, PEMR incorporates a Positive-Negative Mask Generation module, which leverages transformer blocks to generate frame masks on the Log-Mel spectrogram. We can generate self-augmented negative and positive samples by masking important components or inessential components, respectively. We devise a novel contrastive learning objective to accommodate both self-augmented positives/negatives sampled from the same music. We conduct experiments on four public datasets. The experimental results of two music-related downstream tasks, music classification, and cover song identification, demonstrate the generalization ability and transferability of music representation learned by PEMR.

However, due to the non-convexity of deep neural nets (DNNs) and the bi-level formulation of MAML, the theoretical properties of MAML with DNNs remain largely unknown. In this paper, we first prove that MAML with over-parameterized DNNs is guaranteed to converge to global optima at a linear rate. Our convergence analysis indicates that MAML with over-parameterized DNNs is equivalent to kernel regression with a novel class of kernels, which we name as Meta Neural Tangent Kernels (MetaNTK). Then, we propose MetaNTK-NAS, a new training-free neural architecture search (NAS) method for few-shot learning that uses MetaNTK to rank and select architectures. Empirically, we compare our MetaNTK-NAS with previous NAS methods on two popular few-shot learning benchmarks, miniImageNet, and tieredImageNet. We show that the performance of MetaNTK-NAS is comparable or better than the state-of-the-art NAS method designed for few-shot learning while enjoying more than 100x speedup. We believe the efficiency of MetaNTK-NAS makes itself more practical for many real-world tasks. ",

    "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as prominent models for representation learning on graph structured data. GNNs follow an approach of message passing analogous to 1-dimensional Weisfeiler Lehman (1-WL) test for graph isomorphism and consequently are limited by the distinguishing power of 1-WL. More expressive higher-order GNNs which operate on k-tuples of nodes need increased computational resources in order to process higher-order tensors. Instead of the WL approach, in this work, we follow the classical approach of Individualization and Refinement (IR), a technique followed by most practical isomorphism solvers. Individualization refers to artificially distinguishing a node in the graph and refinement is the propagation of this information to other nodes through message passing. We learn to adaptively select nodes to individualize and to aggregate the resulting graphs after refinement to help handle the complexity. Our technique lets us learn richer node embeddings while keeping the computational complexity manageable. Theoretically, we show that our procedure is more expressive than the 1-WL test. Experiments show that our method outperforms prominent 1-WL GNN models as well as competitive higher-order baselines on several benchmark synthetic and real datasets.

This model does not require the clean speech reference nor the word labels during testing as the ASR decoding step, which finds the most likely sequence of words given phoneme posterior probabilities, is omitted. The model is evaluated via the root-mean-squared error between the predicted and observed speech reception thresholds from eight normal-hearing listeners. The recognition task consists of identifying noisy words from a German matrix sentence test. The speech material was mixed with eight noise maskers covering different modulation types, from speech-shaped stationary noise to a single-talker masker. The prediction performance is compared to five established models and an ASR-model using word labels. Two combinations of features and networks were tested. Both include temporal information either at the feature level (amplitude modulation filterbanks and a feed-forward network) or captured by the architecture (mel-spectrograms and a time-delay deep neural network, TDNN). The TDNN model is on par with the DNN while reducing the number of parameters by a factor of 37; this optimization allows parallel streams on dedicated hearing aid hardware as a forward-pass can be computed within the 10ms of each frame. The proposed model performs almost as well as the label-based model and produces more accurate predictions than the baseline models. ",

Thus some scene graph generation methods are trapped into most frequent relation predictions caused by capricious visual features and trivial dataset annotations. Therefore, recent works emphasized the \"unbiased\" approaches to balance predictions for a more informative scene graph. However, human's quick and accurate judgments over relations between numerous objects should be attributed to \"bias\" (i.e., experience and linguistic knowledge) rather than pure vision. To enhance the model capability, inspired by the \"cognitive bias\" mechanism, we propose a novel 3-paradigms framework that simulates how humans incorporate the label linguistic features as guidance of vision-based representations to better mine hidden relation patterns and alleviate noisy visual propagation. Our framework is model-agnostic to any scene graph model. Comprehensive experiments prove our framework outperforms baseline modules in several metrics with minimum parameters increment and achieves new SOTA performance on Visual Genome dataset. ",

In this work, we examine this approach and identify potential hazards associated with the use of log-likelihood in conjunction with gradient-based optimizers. First, we present a synthetic example illustrating how this approach can lead to very poor but stable parameter estimates. Second, we identify the culprit to be the log-likelihood loss, along with certain conditions that exacerbate the issue. Third, we present an alternative formulation, termed $\\beta$-NLL, in which each data point's contribution to the loss is weighted by the $\\beta$-exponentiated variance estimate. We show that using an appropriate $\\beta$ largely mitigates the issue in our illustrative example. Fourth, we evaluate this approach on a range of domains and tasks and show that it achieves considerable improvements and performs more robustly concerning hyperparameters, both in predictive RMSE and log-likelihood criteria.

The cells we compare include classical long short term memory (LSTM), gated recurrent unit (GRU), modified LSTM with dilation, and two new cells we proposed recently, which are equipped with dilation and attention mechanisms. To model the temporal dependencies of different scales, our RNN architecture has multiple dilated recurrent layers stacked with hierarchical dilations. The proposed RNN produces both point forecasts and predictive intervals (PIs) for them. An empirical study concerning short-term electrical load forecasting for 35 European countries confirmed that the new gated cells with dilation and attention performed best. ",

However, identifying such personal disclosures is a challenging task due to their rarity in a sea of social media content and the variety of linguistic forms used to describe them. Here, we examine three Active Learning (AL) strategies in real-world settings of extreme class imbalance, and identify five types of disclosures about individuals' employment status (e.g. job loss) in three languages using BERT-based classification models. Our findings show that, even under extreme imbalance settings, a small number of AL iterations is sufficient to obtain large and significant gains in precision, recall, and diversity of results compared to a supervised baseline with the same number of labels. We also find that no AL strategy consistently outperforms the rest. Qualitative analysis suggests that AL helps focus the attention mechanism of BERT on core terms and adjust the boundaries of semantic expansion, highlighting the importance of interpretable models to provide greater control and visibility into this dynamic learning process.

Thus, an effective evaluation metric has to be multifaceted. In this paper, we propose an automatic evaluation metric incorporating several core aspects of natural language understanding (language competence, syntactic and semantic variation). Our proposed metric, RoMe, is trained on language features such as semantic similarity combined with tree edit distance and grammatical acceptability, using a self-supervised neural network to assess the overall quality of the generated sentence. Moreover, we perform an extensive robustness analysis of the state-of-the-art methods and RoMe. Empirical results suggest that RoMe has a stronger correlation to human judgment over state-of-the-art metrics in evaluating system-generated sentences across several NLG tasks. ",

To further achieve a higher rate, a method of maximizing minimum rate (Max-Min-R) is proposed with high complexity. To reduce its complexity, a low-complexity method of maximizing the sum rate (Max-SR) via general power iterative (GPI) is proposed, which is called Max-SR-GPI. Simulation results show that the proposed three methods outperform the case of random phase method, especially the proposed Max-SR-GPI method is the best one achieving at least 20\\% rate gain over random phase.

We therefore present a parameterized surrogate model for the prediction of three-dimensional flow fields in aerothermal vehicle simulations. The proposed physics-informed neural network (PINN) design is aimed at learning families of flow solutions according to a geometric variation. In scope of this work, we could show that our nondimensional, multivariate scheme can be efficiently trained to predict the velocity and pressure distribution for different design scenarios and geometric scales. The proposed algorithm is based on a parametric minibatch training which enables the utilization of large datasets necessary for the three-dimensional flow modeling. Further, we introduce a continuous resampling algorithm that allows to operate on one static dataset. Every feature of our methodology is tested individually and verified against conventional CFD simulations.

We discuss the formulations of DP applicable to the publication of graphs and their associated statistics as well as machine learning on graph-based data, including graph neural networks (GNNs). The formulation of DP in the context of graph-structured data is difficult, as individual data points are interconnected (often non-linearly or sparsely). This connectivity complicates the computation of individual privacy loss in differentially private learning. The problem is exacerbated by an absence of a single, well-established formulation of DP in graph settings. This issue extends to the domain of GNNs, rendering private machine learning on graph-structured data a challenging task. A lack of prior systematisation work motivated us to study graph-based learning from a privacy perspective. In this work, we systematise different formulations of DP on graphs, discuss challenges and promising applications, including the GNN domain. We compare and separate works into graph analysis tasks and graph learning tasks with GNNs.

The temporal features usually contain various noisy and uncorrelated information, and they may interfere with the restoration of the current frame. This paper proposes learning noise-robust feature representations to help video restoration. We are inspired by that the neural codec is a natural denoiser. In neural codec, the noisy and uncorrelated contents which are hard to predict but cost lots of bits are more inclined to be discarded for bitrate saving. Therefore, we design a neural compression module to filter the noise and keep the most useful information in features for video restoration. To achieve robustness to noise, our compression module adopts a spatial-channel-wise quantization mechanism to adaptively determine the quantization step size for each position in the latent. Experiments show that our method can significantly boost the performance on video denoising, where we obtain 0.13 dB improvement over BasicVSR++ with only 0.23x FLOPs. Meanwhile, our method also obtains SOTA results on video deraining and dehazing. ",

For Non-autoregressive NMT, we demonstrate it can also produce consistent performance gains, i.e., up to 5.3 BLEU.

Unfortunately, mainstream neural networks are poorly calibrated, with a large gap between accuracy and confidence. To handle this problem defined as confidence calibration, we propose a model using the hyperspherical space and rebalanced accuracy-uncertainty loss. Specifically, we project the label vector onto hyperspherical space uniformly to generate a dense label representation matrix, which mitigates over-confident predictions due to overfitting sparce one-hot label matrix. Besides, we rebalance samples of different accuracy and uncertainty to better guide model training. Experiments on the open datasets verify that our model outperforms the existing calibration methods and achieves a significant improvement on the calibration metric. ",

This means that the travel demand across different travel modes could be correlated as one mode may receive demand from or create demand for another mode, not to mention natural correlations between different demand time series due to general demand flow patterns across the network. It is expectable that cross-modal ripple effects become more prevalent, with Mobility as a Service. Therefore, by propagating demand data across modes, a better demand prediction could be obtained. To this end, this study explores various machine learning models and transfer learning strategies for cross-modal demand prediction. The trip data of bike-share, metro, and taxi are processed as the station-level passenger flows, and then the proposed prediction method is tested in the large-scale case studies of Nanjing and Chicago. The results suggest that prediction models with transfer learning perform better than unimodal prediction models. Furthermore, stacked Long Short-Term Memory model performs particularly well in cross-modal demand prediction.

Recently, embedding methods have been used for entity alignment tasks, that learn a vector-space representation of entities which preserves their similarity in the original KGs. A wide variety of supervised, unsupervised, and semi-supervised methods have been proposed that exploit both factual (attribute based) and structural information (relation based) of entities in the KGs. Still, a quantitative assessment of their strengths and weaknesses in real-world KGs according to different performance metrics and KG characteristics is missing from the literature. In this work, we conduct the first meta-level analysis of popular embedding methods for entity alignment, based on a statistically sound methodology. Our analysis reveals statistically significant correlations of different embedding methods with various meta-features extracted by KGs and rank them in a statistically significant way according to their effectiveness across all real-world KGs of our testbed.

    "abstract": "Backdoor attacks impose a new threat in Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), where a backdoor is inserted into the neural network by poisoning the training dataset, misclassifying inputs that contain the adversary trigger. The major challenge for defending against these attacks is that only the attacker knows the secret trigger and the target class. The problem is further exacerbated by the recent introduction of \"Hidden Triggers\", where the triggers are carefully fused into the input, bypassing detection by human inspection and causing backdoor identification through anomaly detection to fail. To defend against such imperceptible attacks, in this work we systematically analyze how representations, i.e., the set of neuron activations for a given DNN when using the training data as inputs, are affected by backdoor attacks. We propose PiDAn, an algorithm based on coherence optimization purifying the poisoned data. Our analysis shows that representations of poisoned data and authentic data in the target class are still embedded in different linear subspaces, which implies that they show different coherence with some latent spaces. Based on this observation, the proposed PiDAn algorithm learns a sample-wise weight vector to maximize the projected coherence of weighted samples, where we demonstrate that the learned weight vector has a natural \"grouping effect\" and is distinguishable between authentic data and poisoned data. This enables the systematic detection and mitigation of backdoor attacks. Based on our theoretical analysis and experimental results, we demonstrate the effectiveness of PiDAn in defending against backdoor attacks that use different settings of poisoned samples on GTSRB and ILSVRC2012 datasets. Our PiDAn algorithm can detect more than 90% infected classes and identify 95% poisoned samples. ",

    "title": "PreTR: Spatio-Temporal Non-Autoregressive Trajectory Prediction  Transformer",
    "abstract": "Nowadays, our mobility systems are evolving into the era of intelligent vehicles that aim to improve road safety. Due to their vulnerability, pedestrians are the users who will benefit the most from these developments. However, predicting their trajectory is one of the most challenging concerns. Indeed, accurate prediction requires a good understanding of multi-agent interactions that can be complex. Learning the underlying spatial and temporal patterns caused by these interactions is even more of a competitive and open problem that many researchers are tackling. In this paper, we introduce a model called PRediction Transformer (PReTR) that extracts features from the multi-agent scenes by employing a factorized spatio-temporal attention module. It shows less computational needs than previously studied models with empirically better results. Besides, previous works in motion prediction suffer from the exposure bias problem caused by generating future sequences conditioned on model prediction samples rather than ground-truth samples. In order to go beyond the proposed solutions, we leverage encoder-decoder Transformer networks for parallel decoding a set of learned object queries. This non-autoregressive solution avoids the need for iterative conditioning and arguably decreases training and testing computational time. We evaluate our model on the ETH/UCY datasets, a publicly available benchmark for pedestrian trajectory prediction. Finally, we justify our usage of the parallel decoding technique by showing that the trajectory prediction task can be better solved as a non-autoregressive task. ",

    "abstract": "Autonomous systems not only need to understand their current environment, but should also be able to predict future actions conditioned on past states, for instance based on captured camera frames. For certain tasks, detailed predictions such as future video frames are required in the near future, whereas for others it is beneficial to also predict more abstract representations for longer time horizons. However, existing video prediction models mainly focus on forecasting detailed possible outcomes for short time-horizons, hence being of limited use for robot perception and spatial reasoning. We propose Multi-Scale Hierarchical Prediction (MSPred), a novel video prediction model able to forecast future possible outcomes of different levels of granularity at different time-scales simultaneously. By combining spatial and temporal downsampling, MSPred is able to efficiently predict abstract representations such as human poses or object locations over long time horizons, while still maintaining a competitive performance for video frame prediction. In our experiments, we demonstrate that our proposed model accurately predicts future video frames as well as other representations (e.g. keypoints or positions) on various scenarios, including bin-picking scenes or action recognition datasets, consistently outperforming popular approaches for video frame prediction. Furthermore, we conduct an ablation study to investigate the importance of the different modules and design choices in MSPred. In the spirit of reproducible research, we open-source VP-Suite, a general framework for deep-learning-based video prediction, as well as pretrained models to reproduce our results. ",

    "abstract": "Traditionally, security systems for enterprises have implicit access based on strong cryptography, authentication and key sharing, wherein access control is based on Role Based Access Control (RBAC), in which roles such as manager, accountant and so on provide a way of deciding a subject's authority. However, years of post-attack analysis on enterprise networks has shown that a majority of times, security breaches occur intentionally or accidently due to implicitly trusted people of an enterprise itself. Zero Trust Architecture works on the principle of never granting trust implicitly, but rather continuously evaluating the trust parameters for each resource access request and has a strict, but not rigid, set of protocols for access control of a subject to resources. Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) systems are tools that collect a large number of attributes in and around machines within an enterprise network to have close visibility into sophisticated intrusion. In our work, we seek to deploy EDR systems and build trust algorithms using tactical provenance analysis, threshold cryptography and reputation management to continuously record data, evaluate trust of a subject, and simultaneously analyze them against a database of known threat vectors to provide conditional access control. However, EDR tools generate a high volume of data that leads to false alarms, misdetections and correspondingly a high backlog of tasks that makes it infeasible, which is addressed using tactical provenance analysis and information theory.

    "abstract": "Blockchain technology has the characteristics of decentralization, traceability and tamper-proof, which creates a reliable decentralized trust mechanism, further accelerating the development of blockchain finance. However, the anonymization of blockchain hinders market regulation, resulting in increasing illegal activities such as money laundering, gambling and phishing fraud on blockchain financial platforms. Thus financial security has become a top priority in the blockchain ecosystem, calling for effective market regulation. In this paper, we consider identifying Ethereum accounts from a graph classification perspective, and propose an end-to-end graph neural network framework named Ethident, to characterize the behavior patterns of accounts and further achieve account de-anonymization. Specifically, we first construct an Account Interaction Graph (AIG) using raw Ethereum data. Then we design a hierarchical graph attention encoder named HGATE as the backbone of our framework, which can effectively characterize the node-level account features and subgraph-level behavior patterns. For alleviating account label sparsity, we further introduce contrastive self-supervision mechanism as regularization to jointly train our framework. Comprehensive experiments on Ethereum datasets demonstrate that our framework achieves superior performance in account identification, yielding 1.13% - 4.93% relative improvement over previous state-of-the-art. Furthermore, detailed analyses illustrate the effectiveness of Ethident in identifying and understanding the behavior of known participants in Ethereum (e.g. exchanges, miners, etc.), as well as that of the lawbreakers (e.g. phishing scammers, hackers, etc.), which may aid in risk assessment and market regulation.

In this paper, we present Interacting Attention Graph Hand (IntagHand), the first graph convolution based network that reconstructs two interacting hands from a single RGB image. To solve occlusion and interaction challenges of two-hand reconstruction, we introduce two novel attention based modules in each upsampling step of the original GCN. The first module is the pyramid image feature attention (PIFA) module, which utilizes multiresolution features to implicitly obtain vertex-to-image alignment. The second module is the cross hand attention (CHA) module that encodes the coherence of interacting hands by building dense cross-attention between two hand vertices. As a result, our model outperforms all existing two-hand reconstruction methods by a large margin on InterHand2.6M benchmark. Moreover, ablation studies verify the effectiveness of both PIFA and CHA modules for improving the reconstruction accuracy. Results on in-the-wild images further demonstrate the generalization ability of our network. Our code is available at https://github.com/Dw1010/IntagHand. ",

Thus, we propose to leverage large-scale synthetic datasets of 3D shapes annotated with part information to learn Neural Part Priors (NPPs), optimizable spaces characterizing geometric part priors. Crucially, we can optimize over the learned part priors in order to fit to real-world scanned 3D scenes at test time, enabling robust part decomposition of the real objects in these scenes that also estimates the complete geometry of the object while fitting accurately to the observed real geometry. Moreover, this enables global optimization over geometrically similar detected objects in a scene, which often share strong geometric commonalities, enabling scene-consistent part decompositions. Experiments on the ScanNet dataset demonstrate that NPPs significantly outperforms state of the art in part decomposition and object completion in real-world scenes. ",

Our mathematical analysis shows that the resulting model is biased towards unitary effective spectral radius and zero local Lyapunov exponents, intrinsically operating at the edge of stability. Experiments on synthetic tasks indicate the marked superiority of the proposed approach, compared to standard RC models, in tasks requiring long-term memorization skills. Furthermore, results on real-world time series classification benchmarks point out that EuSN is capable of matching (or even surpassing) the level of accuracy of trainable Recurrent Neural Networks, while allowing up to 100-fold savings in computation time and energy consumption.

In conventional models, the edge image generated is ambiguous, and the edge lines are also very thick, which typically necessitates the use of non-maximum suppression (NMS) and morphological thinning operations to generate clear and thin edge images. In this paper, we aim to propose a one-stage neural network model that can generate high-quality edge images without postprocessing. The proposed model adopts a classic encoder-decoder framework in which a pre-trained neural model is used as the encoder and a multi-feature-fusion mechanism that merges the features of each level with each other functions as a learnable decoder. Further, we propose a new loss function that addresses the pixel-level imbalance in the edge image by suppressing the false positive (FP) edge information near the true positive (TP) edge and the false negative (FN) non-edge. The results of experiments conducted on several benchmark datasets indicate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art results without using NMS and morphological thinning operations. ",

Though significant improvement has been achieved by deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs), it remains difficult to reconstruct high-resolution images for spatially deformed texts, especially rotated and curve-shaped ones. This is because the current CNN-based methods adopt locality-based operations, which are not effective to deal with the variation caused by deformations. In this paper, we propose a CNN based Text ATTention network (TATT) to address this problem. The semantics of the text are firstly extracted by a text recognition module as text prior information. Then we design a novel transformer-based module, which leverages global attention mechanism, to exert the semantic guidance of text prior to the text reconstruction process. In addition, we propose a text structure consistency loss to refine the visual appearance by imposing structural consistency on the reconstructions of regular and deformed texts. Experiments on the benchmark TextZoom dataset show that the proposed TATT not only achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of PSNR/SSIM metrics, but also significantly improves the recognition accuracy in the downstream text recognition task, particularly for text instances with multi-orientation and curved shapes.

    "abstract": "Data Augmentation (DA) is known to improve the generalizability of deep neural networks. Most existing DA techniques naively add a certain number of augmented samples without considering the quality and the added computational cost of these samples. To tackle this problem, a common strategy, adopted by several state-of-the-art DA methods, is to adaptively generate or re-weight augmented samples with respect to the task objective during training. However, these adaptive DA methods: (1) are computationally expensive and not sample-efficient, and (2) are designed merely for a specific setting. In this work, we present a universal DA technique, called Glitter, to overcome both issues. Glitter can be plugged into any DA method, making training sample-efficient without sacrificing performance. From a pre-generated pool of augmented samples, Glitter adaptively selects a subset of worst-case samples with maximal loss, analogous to adversarial DA. Without altering the training strategy, the task objective can be optimized on the selected subset. Our thorough experiments on the GLUE benchmark, SQuAD, and HellaSwag in three widely used training setups including consistency training, self-distillation and knowledge distillation reveal that Glitter is substantially faster to train and achieves a competitive performance, compared to strong baselines.

In this work, we address both of these issues and propose Vox2Cortex, a deep learning-based algorithm that directly yields topologically correct, three-dimensional meshes of the boundaries of the cortex. Vox2Cortex leverages convolutional and graph convolutional neural networks to deform an initial template to the densely folded geometry of the cortex represented by an input MRI scan. We show in extensive experiments on three brain MRI datasets that our meshes are as accurate as the ones reconstructed by state-of-the-art methods in the field, without the need for time- and resource-intensive post-processing.

Motivated by this problem, this paper presents a transpilation approach based on inductive program synthesis for modernizing existing code. Our method is based on the observation that the overwhelming majority of source/target programs in this setting satisfy an assumption that we call trace-compatibility: not only do the programs share syntactically identical low-level expressions, but these expressions also take the same values in corresponding execution traces. Our method leverages this observation to design a new neural-guided synthesis algorithm that (1) uses a novel neural architecture called cognate grammar network (CGN) and (2) leverages a form of concolic execution to prune partial programs based on intermediate values that arise during a computation. We have implemented our approach in a tool called NGST2 and use it to translate imperative Java and Python code to functional variants that use the Stream and functools APIs respectively. Our experiments show that NGST2 significantly outperforms several baselines and that our proposed neural architecture and pruning techniques are vital for achieving good results. ",

The principle is to make the heat balance for the air volume of a room space considered at uniform temperature and to calculate from this equation the load, i.e. the power needed to obtain the required indoor temperature. The problem is that, by doing so, the physical causality is not respected. If the model is approximated by a piecewise linear dynamical system, this procedure results in an improper transfer function. In order to point out this problem, a method to obtain state space and transfer function models from thermal networks is introduced. Then, the transfer function representation is employed to show that changing the physical causality results in an improper transfer function. The practical consequence is that when the space temperature has a step variation, the calculated load tends to infinity if the simulation time step tends to zero. The issue of causality may be a problem in equation-based simulation software, such as MODELICA, in which the equations do not represent causal relations: a wrong choice of the causality in a balance equation may result in improper transfer functions.

We pair this framework with an architecture we term Transframer, which uses U-Net and Transformer components to condition on annotated context frames, and outputs sequences of sparse, compressed image features. Transframer is the state-of-the-art on a variety of video generation benchmarks, is competitive with the strongest models on few-shot view synthesis, and can generate coherent 30 second videos from a single image without any explicit geometric information. A single generalist Transframer simultaneously produces promising results on 8 tasks, including semantic segmentation, image classification and optical flow prediction with no task-specific architectural components, demonstrating that multi-task computer vision can be tackled using probabilistic image models. Our approach can in principle be applied to a wide range of applications that require learning the conditional structure of annotated image-formatted data. ",

    "abstract": "Detection Transformers have achieved competitive performance on the sample-rich COCO dataset. However, we show most of them suffer from significant performance drops on small-size datasets, like Cityscapes. In other words, the detection transformers are generally data-hungry. To tackle this problem, we empirically analyze the factors that affect data efficiency, through a step-by-step transition from a data-efficient RCNN variant to the representative DETR. The empirical results suggest that sparse feature sampling from local image areas holds the key. Based on this observation, we alleviate the data-hungry issue of existing detection transformers by simply alternating how key and value sequences are constructed in the cross-attention layer, with minimum modifications to the original models. Besides, we introduce a simple yet effective label augmentation method to provide richer supervision and improve data efficiency. Experiments show that our method can be readily applied to different detection transformers and improve their performance on both small-size and sample-rich datasets.

Such over-reliance on spurious correlations also causes systems to struggle with detecting implicitly toxic language. To help mitigate these issues, we create ToxiGen, a new large-scale and machine-generated dataset of 274k toxic and benign statements about 13 minority groups. We develop a demonstration-based prompting framework and an adversarial classifier-in-the-loop decoding method to generate subtly toxic and benign text with a massive pretrained language model. Controlling machine generation in this way allows ToxiGen to cover implicitly toxic text at a larger scale, and about more demographic groups, than previous resources of human-written text. We conduct a human evaluation on a challenging subset of ToxiGen and find that annotators struggle to distinguish machine-generated text from human-written language. We also find that 94.5% of toxic examples are labeled as hate speech by human annotators. Using three publicly-available datasets, we show that finetuning a toxicity classifier on our data improves its performance on human-written data substantially. We also demonstrate that ToxiGen can be used to fight machine-generated toxicity as finetuning improves the classifier significantly on our evaluation subset. ",

Current methods develop independent pipelines for 2D and 3D semi-supervised learning despite the availability of paired image and point cloud frames. Observing that the distinct characteristics of each sensor cause them to be biased towards detecting different objects, we propose DetMatch, a flexible framework for joint semi-supervised learning on 2D and 3D modalities. By identifying objects detected in both sensors, our pipeline generates a cleaner, more robust set of pseudo-labels that both demonstrates stronger performance and stymies single-modality error propagation. Further, we leverage the richer semantics of RGB images to rectify incorrect 3D class predictions and improve localization of 3D boxes. Evaluating on the challenging KITTI and Waymo datasets, we improve upon strong semi-supervised learning methods and observe higher quality pseudo-labels.

However, it has been observed that PINNs are difficult to train in certain \"stiff\" problems, which include various nonlinear hyperbolic PDEs that display shocks in their solutions. Recent studies added a diffusion term to the PDE, and an artificial viscosity (AV) value was manually tuned to allow PINNs to solve these problems. In this paper, we propose three approaches to address this problem, none of which rely on an a priori definition of the artificial viscosity value. The first method learns a global AV value, whereas the other two learn localized AV values around the shocks, by means of a parametrized AV map or a residual-based AV map. We applied the proposed methods to the inviscid Burgers equation and the Buckley-Leverett equation, the latter being a classical problem in Petroleum Engineering. The results show that the proposed methods are able to learn both a small AV value and the accurate shock location and improve the approximation error over a nonadaptive global AV alternative method.

We found that the best SSL model substantially outperformed the baseline supervised model.

We present a neural network model that is trained to learn the mapping from the raw density field containing each halo to the dark matter density profile. We show that the model recovers the widely-used Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) profile out to the virial radius, and can additionally describe the variability in the outer profile of the halos. The neural network architecture consists of a supervised encoder-decoder framework, which first compresses the density inputs into a low-dimensional latent representation, and then outputs $\\rho(r)$ for any desired value of radius $r$. The latent representation contains all the information used by the model to predict the density profiles. This allows us to interpret the latent representation by quantifying the mutual information between the representation and the halos' ground-truth density profiles. A two-dimensional representation is sufficient to accurately model the density profiles up to the virial radius; however, a three-dimensional representation is required to describe the outer profiles beyond the virial radius. The additional dimension in the representation contains information about the infalling material in the outer profiles of dark matter halos, thus discovering the splashback boundary of halos without prior knowledge of the halos' dynamical history.

However, little attention has been devoted to the analysis of the cell-based search spaces even though it is highly important for the continual development of NAS. In this work, we conduct an empirical post-hoc analysis of architectures from the popular cell-based search spaces and find that the existing search spaces contain a high degree of redundancy: the architecture performance is minimally sensitive to changes at large parts of the cells, and universally adopted designs, like the explicit search for a reduction cell, significantly increase the complexities but have very limited impact on the performance. Across architectures found by a diverse set of search strategies, we consistently find that the parts of the cells that do matter for architecture performance often follow similar and simple patterns. By explicitly constraining cells to include these patterns, randomly sampled architectures can match or even outperform the state of the art. These findings cast doubts into our ability to discover truly novel architectures in the existing cell-based search spaces, and inspire our suggestions for improvement to guide future NAS research.

Cloud particle properties include position, diameter, and shape. We present a hologram processing algorithm, HolodecML, that utilizes a neural segmentation model, GPUs, and computational parallelization. HolodecML is trained using synthetically generated holograms based on a model of the instrument, and predicts masks around particles found within reconstructed images. From these masks, the position and size of the detected particles can be characterized in three dimensions. In order to successfully process real holograms, we find we must apply a series of image corrupting transformations and noise to the synthetic images used in training. In this evaluation, HolodecML had comparable position and size estimation performance to the standard processing method, but improved particle detection by nearly 20\\% on several thousand manually labeled HOLODEC images. However, the improvement only occurred when image corruption was performed on the simulated images during training, thereby mimicking non-ideal conditions in the actual probe. The trained model also learned to differentiate artifacts and other impurities in the HOLODEC images from the particles, even though no such objects were present in the training data set, while the standard processing method struggled to separate particles from artifacts. The novelty of the training approach, which leveraged noise as a means for parameterizing non-ideal aspects of the HOLODEC detector, could be applied in other domains where the theoretical model is incapable of fully describing the real-world operation of the instrument and accurate truth data required for supervised learning cannot be obtained from real-world observations.

    "abstract": "Memristor-based neuromorphic computing systems address the memory-wall issue in von Neumann architecture that prevents the efficient training of deep neural networks (DNNs). Nevertheless, emerging memristor devices, with the existence of several non-idealities, such as poor yield and limited number of reliable conductance states, are still not mature for practical neuromorphic systems. At the same time, the mainstream neuromorphic DNNs utilize the error backpropagation-based gradient descent algorithm, requiring ideal synaptic behavior of the memristive devices and complex neural circuits. To address this challenge, we demonstrate the training of a memristive restricted Boltzmann machine (memristive RBM) and deep belief neural network (memristive DBN) that employ memristor devices fabricated in a commercial complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor process as artificial synapses and utilize the gradient descent algorithm based on contrastive divergence (CD). The memristor devices are based on the floating gate (FG) principle, showing analog tunability, high endurance, long retention time, predictable cycling degradation, moderate device-to-device variations, high yield, and two orders of magnitude higher energy efficiency for multiply-accumulate operations than today's graphical processing units. The CD-based gradient descent algorithm highly relaxes both the requirements of the synaptic behavior for the memristor devices and the complexity of the neuron circuits. Two 12-by-8 arrays of FG memristors are utilized to demonstrate the training of an RBM intended for pattern recognition. We then benchmark an extrapolated memristive DBN consisting of three memristive RBMs for the MNIST dataset, showing a recognition accuracy up to 97.05%. The designed memristive RBM and DBN have minimal neuron circuits where no digital-to-analog and analog-to-digital converters are needed. ",

    "abstract": "Quarter sampling and three-quarter sampling are novel sensor concepts that enable the acquisition of higher resolution images without increasing the number of pixels. This is achieved by non-regularly covering parts of each pixel of a low-resolution sensor such that only one quadrant or three quadrants of the sensor area of each pixel is sensitive to light. Combining a properly designed mask and a high-quality reconstruction algorithm, a higher image quality can be achieved than using a low-resolution sensor and subsequent upsampling. For the latter case, the image quality can be further enhanced using super resolution algorithms such as the very deep super resolution network (VDSR). In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end neural network to reconstruct high resolution images from non-regularly sampled sensor data. The network is a concatenation of a locally fully connected reconstruction network (LFCR) and a standard VDSR network. Altogether, using a three-quarter sampling sensor with our novel neural network layout, the image quality in terms of PSNR for the Urban100 dataset can be increased by 2.96 dB compared to the state-of-the-art approach. Compared to a low-resolution sensor with VDSR, a gain of 1.11 dB is achieved. ",

    "abstract": "The technical advances in Computed Tomography (CT) allow to obtain immense amounts of 3D data. For such datasets it is very costly and time-consuming to obtain the accurate 3D segmentation markup to train neural networks. The annotation is typically done for a limited number of 2D slices, followed by an interpolation. In this work, we propose a pre-training method SortingLoss. It performs pre-training on slices instead of volumes, so that a model could be fine-tuned on a sparse set of slices, without the interpolation step. Unlike general methods (e.g. SimCLR or Barlow Twins), the task specific methods (e.g. Transferable Visual Words) trade broad applicability for quality benefits by imposing stronger assumptions on the input data. We propose a relatively mild assumption -- if we take several slices along some axis of a volume, structure of the sample presented on those slices, should give a strong clue to reconstruct the correct order of those slices along the axis. Many biomedical datasets fulfill this requirement due to the specific anatomy of a sample and pre-defined alignment of the imaging setup. We examine the proposed method on two datasets: medical CT of lungs affected by COVID-19 disease, and high-resolution synchrotron-based full-body CT of model organisms (Medaka fish). We show that the proposed method performs on par with SimCLR, while working 2x faster and requiring 1.5x less memory. In addition, we present the benefits in terms of practical scenarios, especially the applicability to the pre-training of large models and the ability to localize samples within volumes in an unsupervised setup.

Most GNN models collect and update atom and molecule features from the fed atom (and, in some cases, bond) features, which are basically based on the two-dimensional (2D) graph representation of 3D molecules. Correspondingly, the adjacency matrix, containing the information on covalent bonds, or equivalent data structures (e.g., lists) have been the main core in the feature-updating processes, such as graph convolution. However, the 2D-based models do not faithfully represent 3D molecules and their physicochemical properties, exemplified by the overlooked field effect that is a \"through-space\" effect, not a \"through-bond\" effect. The GNN model proposed herein, denoted as MolNet, is chemically intuitive, accommodating the 3D non-bond information in a molecule, with a noncovalent adjacency matrix $\\bf{\\bar A}$, and also bond-strength information from a weighted bond matrix $\\bf{B}$. The noncovalent atoms, not directly bonded to a given atom in a molecule, are identified within 5 $\\unicode{x212B}$ of cut-off range for the construction of $\\bf{\\bar A}$, and $\\bf{B}$ has edge weights of 1, 1.5, 2, and 3 for single, aromatic, double, and triple bonds, respectively. Comparative studies show that MolNet outperforms various baseline GNN models and gives a state-of-the-art performance in the classification task of BACE dataset and regression task of ESOL dataset. This work suggests a future direction of deep-learning chemistry in the construction of deep-learning models that are chemically intuitive and comparable with the existing chemistry concepts and tools.

Owing to the development of technology and the increase in health awareness, ECG signals are currently obtained by using medical and commercial devices. Deep neural networks (DNNs) can be used to analyze these signals because of their high accuracy rate. However, researchers have found that adversarial attacks can significantly reduce the accuracy of DNNs. Studies have been conducted to defend ECG-based DNNs against traditional adversarial attacks, such as projected gradient descent (PGD), and smooth adversarial perturbation (SAP) which targets ECG classification; however, to the best of our knowledge, no study has completely explored the defense against adversarial attacks targeting ECG classification. Thus, we did different experiments to explore the effects of defense methods against white-box adversarial attack and black-box adversarial attack targeting ECG classification, and we found that some common defense methods performed well against these attacks. Besides, we proposed a new defense method called Adversarial Distillation Training (ADT) which comes from defensive distillation and can effectively improve the generalization performance of DNNs. The results show that our method performed more effectively against adversarial attacks targeting on ECG classification than the other baseline methods, namely, adversarial training, defensive distillation, Jacob regularization, and noise-to-signal ratio regularization. Furthermore, we found that our method performed better against PGD attacks with low noise levels, which means that our method has stronger robustness. ",

This problem occurs because the total utility of a single item cannot be used as a upper bound. The algorithm is under revision and shall be updated again, once it is appropriately corrected ",
