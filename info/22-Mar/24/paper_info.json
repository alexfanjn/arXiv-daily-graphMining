    "abstract": "Standard acoustic event classification (AEC) solutions require large-scale collection of data from client devices for model optimization. Federated learning (FL) is a compelling framework that decouples data collection and model training to enhance customer privacy. In this work, we investigate the feasibility of applying FL to improve AEC performance while no customer data can be directly uploaded to the server. We assume no pseudo labels can be inferred from on-device user inputs, aligning with the typical use cases of AEC. We adapt self-supervised learning to the FL framework for on-device continual learning of representations, and it results in improved performance of the downstream AEC classifiers without labeled/pseudo-labeled data available. Compared to the baseline w/o FL, the proposed method improves precision up to 20.3\\% relatively while maintaining the recall. Our work differs from prior work in FL in that our approach does not require user-generated learning targets, and the data we use is collected from our Beta program and is de-identified, to maximally simulate the production settings.

    "abstract": "Contrastive self-supervised learning has become a prominent technique in representation learning. The main step in these methods is to contrast semantically similar and dissimilar pairs of samples. However, in the domain of Natural Language, the augmentation methods used in creating similar pairs with regard to contrastive learning assumptions are challenging. This is because, even simply modifying a word in the input might change the semantic meaning of the sentence, and hence, would violate the distributional hypothesis. In this review paper, we formalize the contrastive learning framework in the domain of natural language processing. We emphasize the considerations that need to be addressed in the data transformation step and review the state-of-the-art methods and evaluations for contrastive representation learning in NLP. Finally, we describe some challenges and potential directions for learning better text representations using contrastive methods. ",

    "abstract": "Farfalle is a permutation-based pseudo-random function which has been proposed by G. Bertoni et al. in 2017. In this work, we show that by observing suitable inputs to Farfalle, one can derive various constructions of a periodic function with a period that involves a secret key. As this admits the application of Simon's algorithm in the so-called Q2 attack model, we further show that in the case when internal rolling function is linear, then the secret key can be extracted under feasible assumptions. Furthermore, using the provided constructions of periodic functions for Farfalle, we show that one can mount forgery attacks on the session-supporting mode for authenticated encryption (Farfalle-SAE) and the synthetic initial value AE mode (Farfalle-SIV). In addition, as the wide block cipher mode Farfalle-WBC is a 4-round Feistel scheme, a quantum distinguisher is constructed in the case when input branches are containing at last two blocks, where length of one block corresponds to the size of a permutation employed in Farfalle (a similar attack can be mounted to Farfalle-WBC-AE). And finally, we consider the problem of extracting a secret round key out of different periods obtained from a (Generalized) Feistel scheme (GFN), which has not been addressed in any of the previous works which consider the application of Simon's (or Simon-Grover) algorithm to round reduced versions of GFNs. In this part, we assume that the key is added to an input of an inner function utilized in the round function of a given GFN. By applying two different interpolation formulas, we show that one can extract the round key by utilizing amount of different periods which is closely related to the polynomial/algebraic degree of underlying inner function.

    "abstract": "Architecture reverse engineering has become an emerging attack against deep neural network (DNN) implementations. Several prior works have utilized side-channel leakage to recover the model architecture while the target is executing on a hardware acceleration platform. In this work, we target an open-source deep-learning accelerator, Versatile Tensor Accelerator (VTA), and utilize electromagnetic (EM) side-channel leakage to comprehensively learn the association between DNN architecture configurations and EM emanations. We also consider the holistic system -- including the low-level tensor program code of the VTA accelerator on a Xilinx FPGA and explore the effect of such low-level configurations on the EM leakage. Our study demonstrates that both the optimization and configuration of tensor programs will affect the EM side-channel leakage. Gaining knowledge of the association between the low-level tensor program and the EM emanations, we propose NNReArch, a lightweight tensor program scheduling framework against side-channel-based DNN model architecture reverse engineering. Specifically, NNReArch targets reshaping the EM traces of different DNN operators, through scheduling the tensor program execution of the DNN model so as to confuse the adversary. NNReArch is a comprehensive protection framework supporting two modes, a balanced mode that strikes a balance between the DNN model confidentiality and execution performance, and a secure mode where the most secure setting is chosen. We implement and evaluate the proposed framework on the open-source VTA with state-of-the-art DNN architectures. The experimental results demonstrate that NNReArch can efficiently enhance the model architecture security with a small performance overhead. In addition, the proposed obfuscation technique makes reverse engineering of the DNN architecture significantly harder. ",

However, with the increasing focus on reinforcement learning, applications outside of gaming and simulated environments require understanding the robustness, stability, and resilience of reinforcement learning methods. To this end, we conducted a comprehensive literature review to characterize the available literature on these three behaviors as they pertain to reinforcement learning. We classify the quantitative and theoretical approaches used to indicate or measure robustness, stability, and resilience behaviors. In addition, we identified the action or event to which the quantitative approaches were attempting to be stable, robust, or resilient. Finally, we provide a decision tree useful for selecting metrics to quantify the behaviors. We believe that this is the first comprehensive review of stability, robustness and resilience specifically geared towards reinforcement learning. ",

    "abstract": "Seed scheduling, the order in which seeds are selected, can greatly affect the performance of a fuzzer. Existing approaches schedule seeds based on their historical mutation data, but ignore the structure of the underlying Control Flow Graph (CFG). Examining the CFG can help seed scheduling by revealing the potential edge coverage gain from mutating a seed. An ideal strategy will schedule seeds based on a count of all reachable and feasible edges from a seed through mutations, but computing feasibility along all edges is prohibitively expensive. Therefore, a seed scheduling strategy must approximate this count. We observe that an approximate count should have 3 properties -- (i) it should increase if there are more edges reachable from a seed; (ii) it should decrease if mutation history information suggests an edge is hard to reach or is located far away from currently visited edges; and (iii) it should be efficient to compute over large CFGs. We observe that centrality measures from graph analysis naturally provide these three properties and therefore can efficiently approximate the likelihood of reaching unvisited edges by mutating a seed. We therefore build a graph called the edge horizon graph that connects seeds to their closest unvisited nodes and compute the seed node's centrality to measure the potential edge coverage gain from mutating a seed. We implement our approach in K-scheduler and compare with many popular seed scheduling strategies. We find that K-scheduler increases feature coverage by 25.89% compared to Entropic and edge coverage by 4.21% compared to the next-best AFL-based seed scheduler, in arithmetic mean on 12 Google FuzzBench programs. It also finds 3 more previously-unknown bugs than the next-best AFL-based seed scheduler. ",

This paper proposes a novel model with Cross Attention for SLU (denoted as CASLU). The cross attention block is devised to catch the fine-grained interactions between phoneme and word embeddings in order to make the joint representations catch the phonetic and semantic features of input simultaneously and for overcoming the ASR errors in downstream natural language understanding (NLU) tasks. Extensive experiments are conducted on three datasets, showing the effectiveness and competitiveness of our approach.

    "abstract": "Deep neural networks (DNNs) have demonstrated their effectiveness in a wide range of computer vision tasks, with the state-of-the-art results obtained through complex and deep structures that require intensive computation and memory. Now-a-days, efficient model inference is crucial for consumer applications on resource-constrained platforms. As a result, there is much interest in the research and development of dedicated deep learning (DL) hardware to improve the throughput and energy efficiency of DNNs. Low-precision representation of DNN data-structures through quantization would bring great benefits to specialized DL hardware. However, the rigorous quantization leads to a severe accuracy drop. As such, quantization opens a large hyper-parameter space at bit-precision levels, the exploration of which is a major challenge. In this paper, we propose a novel framework referred to as the Fixed-Point Quantizer of deep neural Networks (FxP-QNet) that flexibly designs a mixed low-precision DNN for integer-arithmetic-only deployment. Specifically, the FxP-QNet gradually adapts the quantization level for each data-structure of each layer based on the trade-off between the network accuracy and the low-precision requirements. Additionally, it employs post-training self-distillation and network prediction error statistics to optimize the quantization of floating-point values into fixed-point numbers. Examining FxP-QNet on state-of-the-art architectures and the benchmark ImageNet dataset, we empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of FxP-QNet in achieving the accuracy-compression trade-off without the need for training. The results show that FxP-QNet-quantized AlexNet, VGG-16, and ResNet-18 reduce the overall memory requirements of their full-precision counterparts by 7.16x, 10.36x, and 6.44x with less than 0.95%, 0.95%, and 1.99% accuracy drop, respectively.

Consequently, they often have high detection errors, especially on challenging polyp cases (e.g., small, flat, or partially visible polyps). In this work, we formulate polyp detection as a weakly-supervised anomaly detection task that uses video-level labelled training data to detect frame-level polyps. In particular, we propose a novel convolutional transformer-based multiple instance learning method designed to identify abnormal frames (i.e., frames with polyps) from anomalous videos (i.e., videos containing at least one frame with polyp). In our method, local and global temporal dependencies are seamlessly captured while we simultaneously optimise video and snippet-level anomaly scores. A contrastive snippet mining method is also proposed to enable an effective modelling of the challenging polyp cases. The resulting method achieves a detection accuracy that is substantially better than current state-of-the-art approaches on a new large-scale colonoscopy video dataset introduced in this work. ",

    "abstract": "As audio-visual systems are being deployed for safety-critical tasks such as surveillance and malicious content filtering, their robustness remains an under-studied area. Existing published work on robustness either does not scale to large-scale dataset, or does not deal with multiple modalities. This work aims to study several key questions related to multi-modal learning through the lens of robustness: 1) Are multi-modal models necessarily more robust than uni-modal models? 2) How to efficiently measure the robustness of multi-modal learning? 3) How to fuse different modalities to achieve a more robust multi-modal model? To understand the robustness of the multi-modal model in a large-scale setting, we propose a density-based metric, and a convexity metric to efficiently measure the distribution of each modality in high-dimensional latent space. Our work provides a theoretical intuition together with empirical evidence showing how multi-modal fusion affects adversarial robustness through these metrics. We further devise a mix-up strategy based on our metrics to improve the robustness of the trained model. Our experiments on AudioSet and Kinetics-Sounds verify our hypothesis that multi-modal models are not necessarily more robust than their uni-modal counterparts in the face of adversarial examples. We also observe our mix-up trained method could achieve as much protection as traditional adversarial training, offering a computationally cheap alternative.

    "abstract": "Automatic segmentation of vertebral bodies (VBs) and intervertebral discs (IVDs) in 3D magnetic resonance (MR) images is vital in diagnosing and treating spinal diseases. However, segmenting the VBs and IVDs simultaneously is not trivial. Moreover, problems exist, including blurry segmentation caused by anisotropy resolution, high computational cost, inter-class similarity and intra-class variability, and data imbalances. We proposed a two-stage algorithm, named semi-supervised hybrid spine network (SSHSNet), to address these problems by achieving accurate simultaneous VB and IVD segmentation. In the first stage, we constructed a 2D semi-supervised DeepLabv3+ by using cross pseudo supervision to obtain intra-slice features and coarse segmentation. In the second stage, a 3D full-resolution patch-based DeepLabv3+ was built. This model can be used to extract inter-slice information and combine the coarse segmentation and intra-slice features provided from the first stage. Moreover, a cross tri-attention module was applied to compensate for the loss of inter-slice and intra-slice information separately generated from 2D and 3D networks, thereby improving feature representation ability and achieving satisfactory segmentation results. The proposed SSHSNet was validated on a publicly available spine MR image dataset, and remarkable segmentation performance was achieved. Moreover, results show that the proposed method has great potential in dealing with the data imbalance problem. Based on previous reports, few studies have incorporated a semi-supervised learning strategy with a cross attention mechanism for spine segmentation. Therefore, the proposed method may provide a useful tool for spine segmentation and aid clinically in spinal disease diagnoses and treatments.

    "abstract": "Previously proposed FullSubNet has achieved outstanding performance in Deep Noise Suppression (DNS) Challenge and attracted much attention. However, it still encounters issues such as input-output mismatch and coarse processing for frequency bands. In this paper, we propose an extended single-channel real-time speech enhancement framework called FullSubNet+ with following significant improvements. First, we design a lightweight multi-scale time sensitive channel attention (MulCA) module which adopts multi-scale convolution and channel attention mechanism to help the network focus on more discriminative frequency bands for noise reduction. Then, to make full use of the phase information in noisy speech, our model takes all the magnitude, real and imaginary spectrograms as inputs. Moreover, by replacing the long short-term memory (LSTM) layers in original full-band model with stacked temporal convolutional network (TCN) blocks, we design a more efficient full-band module called full-band extractor. The experimental results in DNS Challenge dataset show the superior performance of our FullSubNet+, which reaches the state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance and outperforms other existing speech enhancement approaches.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we present a new self-supervised scene flow estimation approach for a pair of consecutive point clouds. The key idea of our approach is to represent discrete point clouds as continuous probability density functions using Gaussian mixture models. Scene flow estimation is therefore converted into the problem of recovering motion from the alignment of probability density functions, which we achieve using a closed-form expression of the classic Cauchy-Schwarz divergence. Unlike existing nearest-neighbor-based approaches that use hard pairwise correspondences, our proposed approach establishes soft and implicit point correspondences between point clouds and generates more robust and accurate scene flow in the presence of missing correspondences and outliers. Comprehensive experiments show that our method makes noticeable gains over the Chamfer Distance and the Earth Mover's Distance in real-world environments and achieves state-of-the-art performance among self-supervised learning methods on FlyingThings3D and KITTI, even outperforming some supervised methods with ground truth annotations.

    "abstract": "Model predictive control (MPC) provides a useful means for controlling systems with constraints, but suffers from the computational burden of repeatedly solving an optimization problem in real time. Offline (explicit) solutions for MPC attempt to alleviate real time computational challenges using either multiparametric programming or machine learning. The multiparametric approaches are typically applied to linear or quadratic MPC problems, while learning-based approaches can be more flexible and are less memory-intensive. Existing learning-based approaches offer significant speedups, but the challenge becomes ensuring constraint satisfaction while maintaining good performance. In this paper, we provide a neural network parameterization of MPC policies that explicitly encodes the constraints of the problem. Therefore, the constraints are satisfied by design. By exploring the interior of the MPC feasible set in an unsupervised learning paradigm, the neural network finds better policies faster than projection-based methods and exhibits substantially faster solve times. We use the proposed policy to solve both a robust (tube-based) and a scenario-based MPC problem, and demonstrate the performance and computational gains on two standard test systems. ",

Many deep learning techniques have been proposed to diagnose AD using Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans. Predicting AD using 2D slices extracted from 3D MRI scans is challenging as the inter-slice information gets lost. To this end, we propose a novel and lightweight framework termed 'Biceph-Net' for AD diagnosis using 2D MRI scans that model both the intra-slice and inter-slice information. Biceph-Net has been experimentally shown to perform similar to other Spatio-temporal neural networks while being computationally more efficient. Biceph-Net is also superior in performance compared to vanilla 2D convolutional neural networks (CNN) for AD diagnosis using 2D MRI slices. Biceph-Net also has an inbuilt neighbourhood-based model interpretation feature that can be exploited to understand the classification decision taken by the network. Biceph-Net experimentally achieves a test accuracy of 100% in the classification of Cognitively Normal (CN) vs AD, 98.16% for Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) vs AD, and 97.80% for CN vs MCI vs AD. ",

    "abstract": "Lung squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC) has a high recurrence and metastasis rate. Factors influencing recurrence and metastasis are currently unknown and there are no distinct histopathological or morphological features indicating the risks of recurrence and metastasis in LSCC. Our study focuses on the recurrence prediction of LSCC based on H&E-stained histopathological whole-slide images (WSI). Due to the small size of LSCC cohorts in terms of patients with available recurrence information, standard end-to-end learning with various convolutional neural networks for this task tends to overfit. Also, the predictions made by these models are hard to interpret. Histopathology WSIs are typically very large and are therefore processed as a set of smaller tiles. In this work, we propose a novel conditional self-supervised learning (SSL) method to learn representations of WSI at the tile level first, and leverage clustering algorithms to identify the tiles with similar histopathological representations. The resulting representations and clusters from self-supervision are used as features of a survival model for recurrence prediction at the patient level. Using two publicly available datasets from TCGA and CPTAC, we show that our LSCC recurrence prediction survival model outperforms both LSCC pathological stage-based approach and machine learning baselines such as multiple instance learning. The proposed method also enables us to explain the recurrence histopathological risk factors via the derived clusters. This can help pathologists derive new hypotheses regarding morphological features associated with LSCC recurrence. ",

    "abstract": "Contemporary computing employs cache hierarchy to fill the speed gap between processors and main memories. In order to optimise system performance, Last Level Caches(LLC) are shared among all the cores. Cache sharing has made them an attractive surface for cross-core timing channel attacks. In these attacks, an attacker running on another core can exploit the access timing of the victim process to infiltrate the secret information. One such attack is called cross-core Covert Channel Attack (CCA). Timely detection and then prevention of cross-core CCA is critical for maintaining the integrity and security of users, especially in a shared computing environment. In this work, we have proposed an efficient cross-core CCA mitigation technique. We propose a way-wise cache partitioning on targeted sets, only for the processes suspected to be attackers. In this way, the performance impact on the entire LLC is minimised, and benign applications can utilise the LLC to its full capacity. We have used a cycle-accurate simulator (gem5) to analyse the per-formance of the proposed method and its security effectiveness. It has been successful in abolishing the cross-core covert timing channel attack with no significant performance impact on benign applications. It causes 23% less cache misses in comparison to existing partitioning based solutions while requiring 0.26% storage overhead. ",

However, the problem remains challenging when one tries to generalize the detector to forgeries created by unseen methods in the training dataset. This work addresses the generalizable deepfake detection from a simple principle: a generalizable representation should be sensitive to diverse types of forgeries. Following this principle, we propose to enrich the \"diversity\" of forgeries by synthesizing augmented forgeries with a pool of forgery configurations and strengthen the \"sensitivity\" to the forgeries by enforcing the model to predict the forgery configurations. To effectively explore the large forgery augmentation space, we further propose to use the adversarial training strategy to dynamically synthesize the most challenging forgeries to the current model. Through extensive experiments, we show that the proposed strategies are surprisingly effective (see Figure 1), and they could achieve superior performance than the current state-of-the-art methods.

Due to the representation gap between discrete constraints and continuous vectors in NMT models, most existing works choose to construct synthetic data or modify the decoding algorithm to impose lexical constraints, treating the NMT model as a black box. In this work, we propose to open this black box by directly integrating the constraints into NMT models. Specifically, we vectorize source and target constraints into continuous keys and values, which can be utilized by the attention modules of NMT models. The proposed integration method is based on the assumption that the correspondence between keys and values in attention modules is naturally suitable for modeling constraint pairs. Experimental results show that our method consistently outperforms several representative baselines on four language pairs, demonstrating the superiority of integrating vectorized lexical constraints.

Recently, it has been observed that the best uni-modal network outperforms the jointly trained multi-modal network, which is counter-intuitive since multiple signals generally bring more information. This work provides a theoretical explanation for the emergence of such performance gap in neural networks for the prevalent joint training framework. Based on a simplified data distribution that captures the realistic property of multi-modal data, we prove that for the multi-modal late-fusion network with (smoothed) ReLU activation trained jointly by gradient descent, different modalities will compete with each other. The encoder networks will learn only a subset of modalities. We refer to this phenomenon as modality competition. The losing modalities, which fail to be discovered, are the origins where the sub-optimality of joint training comes from. Experimentally, we illustrate that modality competition matches the intrinsic behavior of late-fusion joint training. ",

However, most existing methods ignore the efficiency issues, e.g., high computational complexity and slow adaptation speed. Notably, efficiency has become an increasingly important evaluation metric for few-shot techniques due to an emerging trend toward embedded AI. To this end, we present an efficient pretrain-transfer framework (PTF) baseline with no computational increment, which achieves comparable results with previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. Upon this baseline, we devise an initializer named knowledge inheritance (KI) to reliably initialize the novel weights for the box classifier, which effectively facilitates the knowledge transfer process and boosts the adaptation speed. Within the KI initializer, we propose an adaptive length re-scaling (ALR) strategy to alleviate the vector length inconsistency between the predicted novel weights and the pretrained base weights. Finally, our approach not only achieves the SOTA results across three public benchmarks, i.e., PASCAL VOC, COCO and LVIS, but also exhibits high efficiency with 1.8-9.0x faster adaptation speed against the other methods on COCO/LVIS benchmark during few-shot transfer. To our best knowledge, this is the first work to consider the efficiency problem in FSOD. We hope to motivate a trend toward powerful yet efficient few-shot technique development.

There are many attempts to using deep learning for small-area fingerprint recognition, and there are many successes. But training deep neural network needs a lot of datasets for training.

Although they achieved certain success, the limited labeled data in semi-supervised learning scales up the challenges of object detection. We analyze the challenges these methods meet with the empirical experiment results. We find that the massive False Negative samples and inferior localization precision lack consideration. Besides, the large variance of object sizes and class imbalance (i.e., the extreme ratio between background and object) hinder the performance of prior arts. Further, we overcome these challenges by introducing a novel approach, Scale-Equivalent Distillation (SED), which is a simple yet effective end-to-end knowledge distillation framework robust to large object size variance and class imbalance. SED has several appealing benefits compared to the previous works. (1) SED imposes a consistency regularization to handle the large scale variance problem. (2) SED alleviates the noise problem from the False Negative samples and inferior localization precision. (3) A re-weighting strategy can implicitly screen the potential foreground regions of the unlabeled data to reduce the effect of class imbalance. Extensive experiments show that SED consistently outperforms the recent state-of-the-art methods on different datasets with significant margins.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose an effective and easily deployable approach to detect the presence of stealthy sensor attacks in industrial control systems, where (legacy) control devices critically rely on accurate (and usually non-encrypted) sensor readings. Specifically, we focus on stealthy attacks that crash a sensor and then immediately impersonate that sensor by sending out fake readings. We consider attackers who aim to stay hidden in the system for a prolonged period. To detect such attacks, our approach relies on continuous injection of \"micro distortion\" to the original sensor's readings. In particular, the injected distortion should be kept strictly within a small magnitude (e.g., $0.5\\%$ of the possible operating value range), to ensure it does not affect the normal functioning of the ICS. Our approach uses a pre-shared secret sequence between a sensor and the defender to generate the micro-distortions. One key challenge is that the micro-distortions injected are often much lower than the sensor's actual readings, hence can be easily overwhelmed by the latter. To overcome this, we leverage the observation that sensor readings in many ICS (and power grid in particular) often change gradually in a significant fraction of time (i.e., with small difference between consecutive time slots). We devise a simple yet effective algorithm that can detect stealthy attackers in a highly accurate and fast (i.e., using less than 100 samples) manner. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our defense using real-world sensor reading traces from two different smart grid systems. ",

To this end, we propose a topology-aware positive sampling strategy, which samples positives from the neighbourhood by considering the structural dependencies between nodes and thus enables positive selection upfront. In the extreme case when only one positive is sampled, we fully avoid expensive neighbourhood aggregation. Our methods achieve promising performance on various node classification datasets. It is also worth mentioning by applying our loss function to MLP based node encoders, our methods can be orders of faster than existing solutions.

    "abstract": "Unconstrained handwritten document recognition is a challenging computer vision task. It is traditionally handled by a two-step approach combining line segmentation followed by text line recognition. For the first time, we propose an end-to-end segmentation-free architecture for the task of handwritten document recognition: the Document Attention Network. In addition to the text recognition, the model is trained to label text parts using begin and end tags in an XML-like fashion. This model is made up of an FCN encoder for feature extraction and a stack of transformer decoder layers for a recurrent token-by-token prediction process. It takes whole text documents as input and sequentially outputs characters, as well as logical layout tokens. Contrary to the existing segmentation-based approaches, the model is trained without using any segmentation label. We achieve competitive results on the READ dataset at page level, as well as double-page level with a CER of 3.53% and 3.69%, respectively. We also provide results for the RIMES dataset at page level, reaching 4.54% of CER. We provide all source code and pre-trained model weights at https://github.com/FactoDeepLearning/DAN. ",

    "abstract": "In federated learning (FL), clients may have diverse objectives, merging all clients' knowledge into one global model will cause negative transfers to local performance. Thus, clustered FL is proposed to group similar clients into clusters and maintain several global models. Nevertheless, current clustered FL algorithms require the assumption of the number of clusters, they are not effective enough to explore the latent relationships among clients. However, we take advantage of peer-to-peer (P2P) FL, where clients communicate with neighbors without a central server and propose an algorithm that enables clients to form an effective communication topology in a decentralized manner without assuming the number of clusters. Additionally, the P2P setting will release the concerns caused by the central server in centralized FL, such as reliability and communication bandwidth problems. In our method, 1) we present two novel metrics for measuring client similarity, applicable under P2P protocols; 2) we devise a two-stage algorithm, in the first stage, an efficient method to enable clients to match same-cluster neighbors with high confidence is proposed; 3) then in the second stage, a heuristic method based on Expectation Maximization under the Gaussian Mixture Model assumption of similarities is used for clients to discover more neighbors with similar objectives. We make a theoretical analysis of how our work is superior to the P2P FL counterpart and extensive experiments show that our method outperforms all P2P FL baselines and has comparable or even superior performance to centralized cluster FL. Moreover, results show that our method is much effective in mining latent cluster relationships under various heterogeneity without assuming the number of clusters and it is effective even under low communication budgets.

In our work, we specifically focus on systems with a limit-cycle, beyond just an isolated equilibrium point, and use Koopman eigenfunctions to efficiently parameterize candidate Lyapunov functions to construct forward-invariant sets under some (unknown) attractor dynamics. Additionally, when the dynamics are polynomial and when neural networks are replaced by polynomials as a choice of function approximators in our approach, one can further leverage Sum-of-Squares programs and/or nonlinear programs to yield provably correct Lyapunov certificates. In such a polynomial case, our Koopman-based approach for constructing Lyapunov functions uses significantly fewer decision variables compared to directly formulating and solving a Sum-of-Squares optimization problem.

By observing normal and abnormal surface data across multiple source domains, our model is expected to be generalized to an unseen textured surface of interest, in which only a small number of normal data can be observed during testing. Although with only image-level labels observed in the training data, our patch-based meta-learning model exhibits promising generalization ability: not only can it generalize to unseen image domains, but it can also localize abnormal regions in the query image.

    "abstract": "Recent High Dynamic Range (HDR) techniques extend the capabilities of current cameras where scenes with a wide range of illumination can not be accurately captured with a single low-dynamic-range (LDR) image. This is generally accomplished by capturing several LDR images with varying exposure values whose information is then incorporated into a merged HDR image. While such approaches work well for static scenes, dynamic scenes pose several challenges, mostly related to the difficulty of finding reliable pixel correspondences. Data-driven approaches tackle the problem by learning an end-to-end mapping with paired LDR-HDR training data, but in practice generating such HDR ground-truth labels for dynamic scenes is time-consuming and requires complex procedures that assume control of certain dynamic elements of the scene (e.g. actor pose) and repeatable lighting conditions (stop-motion capturing). In this work, we propose a novel self-supervised approach for learnable HDR estimation that alleviates the need for HDR ground-truth labels. We propose to leverage the internal statistics of LDR images to create HDR pseudo-labels. We separately exploit static and well-exposed parts of the input images, which in conjunction with synthetic illumination clipping and motion augmentation provide high quality training examples. Experimental results show that the HDR models trained using our proposed self-supervision approach achieve performance competitive with those trained under full supervision, and are to a large extent superior to previous methods that equally do not require any supervision.

The main goal of the IoT is the creation of smart environments and self-aware things that help to facilitate a variety of services such as smart transport, climate monitoring, e-health, etc. Huge volumes of data are expected to be collected by the connected sensors/things, which in traditional cases are processed centrally by large data centers in the core network that will inevitably lead to excessive transportation power consumption as well as added latency overheads. Instead, fog computing has been proposed by researchers from industry and academia to extend the capability of the cloud right to the point where the data is collected at the sensing layer. This way, primitive tasks that can be hosted in IoT sensors do not need to be sent all the way to the cloud for processing. In this paper we propose energy efficient embedding of machine learning (ML) models over a cloud-fog network using a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) optimization model. We exploit virtualization in our framework to provide service abstraction of Deep Neural Networks (DNN) layers that can be composed into a set of VMs interconnected by virtual links. We constrain the number of VMs that can be processed at the IoT layer and study the impact on the performance of the cloud fog approach. ",

    "abstract": "A MasterFace is a face image that can successfully match against a large portion of the population. Since their generation does not require access to the information of the enrolled subjects, MasterFace attacks represent a potential security risk for widely-used face recognition systems. Previous works proposed methods for generating such images and demonstrated that these attacks can strongly compromise face recognition. However, previous works followed evaluation settings consisting of older recognition models, limited cross-dataset and cross-model evaluations, and the use of low-scale testing data. This makes it hard to state the generalizability of these attacks. In this work, we comprehensively analyse the generalizability of MasterFace attacks in empirical and theoretical investigations. The empirical investigations include the use of six state-of-the-art FR models, cross-dataset and cross-model evaluation protocols, and utilizing testing datasets of significantly higher size and variance. The results indicate a low generalizability when MasterFaces are training on a different face recognition model than the one used for testing. In these cases, the attack performance is similar to zero-effort imposter attacks. In the theoretical investigations, we define and estimate the face capacity and the maximum MasterFace coverage under the assumption that identities in the face space are well separated. The current trend of increasing the fairness and generalizability in face recognition indicates that the vulnerability of future systems might further decrease. We conclude that MasterFaces should not be seen as a threat to face recognition systems but, on the contrary, seen as a tool to understand and enhance the robustness of face recognition models. ",

    "title": "Towards Reproducible Network Traffic Analysis",
    "abstract": "Analysis techniques are critical for gaining insight into network traffic given both the higher proportion of encrypted traffic and increasing data rates. Unfortunately, the domain of network traffic analysis suffers from a lack of standardization, leading to incomparable results and barriers to reproducibility. Unlike other disciplines, no standard dataset format exists, forcing researchers and practitioners to create bespoke analysis pipelines for each individual task. Without standardization researchers cannot compare \"apples-to-apples\", preventing us from knowing with certainty if a new technique represents a methodological advancement or if it simply benefits from a different interpretation of a given dataset. In this work, we examine irreproducibility that arises from the lack of standardization in network traffic analysis. First, we study the literature, highlighting evidence of irreproducible research based on different interpretations of popular public datasets. Next, we investigate the underlying issues that have lead to the status quo and prevent reproducible research. Third, we outline the standardization requirements that any solution aiming to fix reproducibility issues must address. We then introduce pcapML, an open source system which increases reproducibility of network traffic analysis research by enabling metadata information to be directly encoded into raw traffic captures in a generic manner. Finally, we use the standardization pcapML provides to create the pcapML benchmarks, an open source leaderboard website and repository built to track the progress of network traffic analysis methods.

While optimizations have been proposed for inference latency, memory footprint, and energy consumption, prior hardware-aware neural architecture search (NAS) methods have omitted resource utilization, preventing DNNs to take full advantage of the target inference platforms. Modeling resource utilization efficiently and accurately is challenging, especially for widely-used array-based inference accelerators such as Google TPU. In this work, we propose a novel hardware-aware NAS framework that does not only optimize for task accuracy and inference latency, but also for resource utilization. We also propose and validate a new computational model for resource utilization in inference accelerators. By using the proposed NAS framework and the proposed resource utilization model, we achieve 2.8 - 4x speedup for DNN inference compared to prior hardware-aware NAS methods while attaining similar or improved accuracy in image classification on CIFAR-10 and Imagenet-100 datasets.

The attention encoded vector is derived using a weighted sum of the feature map and the attention scores later. Finally, the sigmoid function is used at the output layer to make the prediction suitable for multi-label AUs detection.

    "abstract": "Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) compute in an event-based matter to achieve a more efficient computation than standard Neural Networks. In SNNs, neuronal outputs (i.e. activations) are not encoded with real-valued activations but with sequences of binary spikes. The motivation of using SNNs over conventional neural networks is rooted in the special computational aspects of SNNs, especially the very high degree of sparsity of neural output activations. Well established architectures for conventional Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) feature large spatial arrays of Processing Elements (PEs) that remain highly underutilized in the face of activation sparsity. We propose a novel architecture that is optimized for the processing of Convolutional SNNs (CSNNs) that feature a high degree of activation sparsity. In our architecture, the main strategy is to use less but highly utilized PEs. The PE array used to perform the convolution is only as large as the kernel size, allowing all PEs to be active as long as there are spikes to process. This constant flow of spikes is ensured by compressing the feature maps (i.e. the activations) into queues that can then be processed spike by spike. This compression is performed in run-time using dedicated circuitry, leading to a self-timed scheduling. This allows the processing time to scale directly with the number of spikes. A novel memory organization scheme called memory interlacing is used to efficiently store and retrieve the membrane potentials of the individual neurons using multiple small parallel on-chip RAMs. Each RAM is hardwired to its PE, reducing switching circuitry and allowing RAMs to be located in close proximity to the respective PE. We implemented the proposed architecture on an FPGA and achieved a significant speedup compared to other implementations while needing less hardware resources and maintaining a lower energy consumption.

This facilitates the identification of interdisciplinary research without the use of disciplinary categories. We evaluate these representations and their ability to identify interdisciplinary research, according to their utility in interdisciplinary citation prediction. We find that those representations which preserve structural equivalence in the citation graph are best able to predict distant, interdisciplinary interactions in the network, according to multiple definitions of citation distance.

This work proposes Field of Study (FoS) networks as a novel network representation for use in scientometric analysis. We describe the formation of FoS networks, which relate research topics according to the authors who publish in them, from corpora of articles in which fields of study can be identified. FoS networks are particularly useful for the distant reading of large datasets of research papers when analysed through the lens of exploring multidisciplinary science. In an evolving scientific landscape, modular communities in FoS networks offer an alternative categorisation strategy for research topics and sub-disciplines, when compared to traditional prescribed discipline classification schemes. Furthermore, structural role analysis of FoS networks can highlight important characteristics of topics in such communities. To support this, we present two case studies which explore multidisciplinary research in corpora of varying size and scope; namely, 6,323 articles relating to network science research and 4,184,011 articles relating to research on the COVID-19-pandemic.

To improve the efficiency of ride-hailing service, accurate prediction of transportation demand is a fundamental challenge. In this paper, we tackle this problem from both aspects of network structure and data-set formulation. For network design, we propose a spatial-temporal attention multi-graph convolution network (STA-MGCN). A spatial-temporal layer in STA-MGCN is developed to capture the temporal correlations by temporal attention mechanism and temporal gate convolution, and the spatial correlations by multigraph convolution. A feature cluster layer is introduced to learn latent regional functions and to reduce the computation burden. For the data-set formulation, we develop a novel approach which considers the transportation feature of periodicity with offset. Instead of only using history data during the same time period, the history order demand in forward and backward neighboring time periods from yesterday and last week are also included. Extensive experiments on the three real-world datasets of New-York, Chicago and Chengdu show that the proposed algorithm achieves the state-of-the-art performance for ride-hailing demand prediction.

In this paper, we propose a normal refinement network, called Refine-Net, to predict accurate normals for noisy point clouds. Traditional normal estimation wisdom heavily depends on priors such as surface shapes or noise distributions, while learning-based solutions settle for single types of hand-crafted features. Differently, our network is designed to refine the initial normal of each point by extracting additional information from multiple feature representations. To this end, several feature modules are developed and incorporated into Refine-Net by a novel connection module. Besides the overall network architecture of Refine-Net, we propose a new multi-scale fitting patch selection scheme for the initial normal estimation, by absorbing geometry domain knowledge. Also, Refine-Net is a generic normal estimation framework: 1) point normals obtained from other methods can be further refined, and 2) any feature module related to the surface geometric structures can be potentially integrated into the framework. Qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrate the clear superiority of Refine-Net over the state-of-the-arts on both synthetic and real-scanned datasets.

In this work, we investigate the use of dimensionality reduction techniques such as PCA, t-SNE, and UMAP to see their effect on the performance of graph neural networks (GNNs) designed for semi-supervised propagation of node labels. Our study makes use of benchmark semi-supervised GDL datasets such as the Cora and Citeseer datasets to allow meaningful comparisons of the representations learned by each algorithm when paired with a dimensionality reduction technique. Our comprehensive benchmarks and clustering visualizations quantitatively and qualitatively demonstrate that, under certain conditions, employing a priori and a posteriori dimensionality reduction to GNN inputs and outputs, respectively, can simultaneously improve the effectiveness of semi-supervised node label propagation and node clustering.

While this has been demonstrated to improve the generalizability of classifiers, the coverage of such methods is limited and the dictionaries require regular manual updates from human experts.

Therefore, we introduce a stochastic and non-stationary knapsack problem, and we apply its resolution to mitigate misinformation in social network campaigns. We further propose a generic misinformation mitigation algorithm that is robust to different social networks' misinformation statistics, allowing a promising impact in real-world scenarios. A novel loss function ensures fair mitigation among users. We achieve fairness by intelligently allocating a mitigation incentivization budget to the knapsack, and optimizing the loss function. To this end, a team of Learning Automata (LA) drives the budget allocation. Each LA is associated with a user and learns to minimize its exposure to misinformation by performing a non-stationary and stochastic walk over its state space. Our results show how our LA-based method is robust and outperforms similar misinformation mitigation methods in how the mitigation is fairly influencing the network users. ",

    "abstract": "We present an adaptive simulation framework for binary-fluid flows, based on the Abels-Garcke-Gr\\\"un Navier-Stokes-Cahn-Hilliard (AGG NSCH) diffuse-interface model. The adaptive-refinement procedure is guided by a two-level hierarchical a-posteriori error estimate, and it effectively resolves the spatial multiscale behavior of the diffuse-interface model. To improve the robustness of the solution procedure and avoid severe time-step restrictions for small-interface thicknesses, we introduce an $\\varepsilon$-continuation procedure, in which the diffuse interface thickness ($\\varepsilon$) are enlarged on coarse meshes, and the mobility is scaled accordingly. To further accelerate the computations and improve robustness, we apply a modified Backward Euler scheme in the initial stages of the adaptive-refinement procedure in each time step, and a Crank--Nicolson scheme in the final stages of the refinement procedure. To enhance the robustness of the nonlinear solution procedure, we introduce a partitioned solution procedure for the linear tangent problems in Newton's method, based on a decomposition of the NSCH system into its NS and CH subsystems. We conduct a systematic investigation of the conditioning of the monolithic NSCH tangent matrix and of its NS and CH subsystems for a representative 2D model problem. To illustrate the properties of the presented adaptive simulation framework, we present numerical results for a 2D oscillating water droplet suspended in air, and we validate the obtained results versus those of a corresponding sharp-interface model.

    "abstract": "Sleep staging is essential for sleep assessment and plays a vital role as a health indicator. Many recent studies have devised various machine learning as well as deep learning architectures for sleep staging. However, two key challenges hinder the practical use of these architectures: effectively capturing salient waveforms in sleep signals and correctly classifying confusing stages in transitioning epochs. In this study, we propose a novel deep neural network structure, TransSleep, that captures distinctive local temporal patterns and distinguishes confusing stages using two auxiliary tasks. In particular, TransSleep adopts an attention-based multi-scale feature extractor module to capture salient waveforms; a stage-confusion estimator module with a novel auxiliary task, epoch-level stage classification, to estimate confidence scores for identifying confusing stages; and a context encoder module with the other novel auxiliary task, stage-transition detection, to represent contextual relationships across neighboring epochs. Results show that TransSleep achieves promising performance in automatic sleep staging. The validity of TransSleep is demonstrated by its state-of-the-art performance on two publicly available datasets, Sleep-EDF and MASS. Furthermore, we performed ablations to analyze our results from different perspectives. Based on our overall results, we believe that TransSleep has immense potential to provide new insights into deep learning-based sleep staging. ",

    "abstract": "We introduce ZOOMER, a system deployed at Taobao, the largest e-commerce platform in China, for training and serving GNN-based recommendations over web-scale graphs. ZOOMER is designed for tackling two challenges presented by the massive user data at Taobao: low training/serving efficiency due to the huge scale of the graphs, and low recommendation quality due to the information overload which distracts the recommendation model from specific user intentions. ZOOMER achieves this by introducing a key concept, Region of Interests (ROI) in GNNs for recommendations, i.e., a neighborhood region in the graph with significant relevance to a strong user intention. ZOOMER narrows the focus from the whole graph and \"zooms in\" on the more relevant ROIs, thereby reducing the training/serving cost and mitigating the information overload at the same time. With carefully designed mechanisms, ZOOMER identifies the interest expressed by each recommendation request, constructs an ROI subgraph by sampling with respect to the interest, and guides the GNN to reweigh different parts of the ROI towards the interest by a multi-level attention module. Deployed as a large-scale distributed system, ZOOMER supports graphs with billions of nodes for training and thousands of requests per second for serving. ZOOMER achieves up to 14x speedup when downsizing sampling scales with comparable (even better) AUC performance than baseline methods. Besides, both the offline evaluation and online A/B test demonstrate the effectiveness of ZOOMER. ",

    "abstract": "Pre-training video transformers on extra large-scale datasets is generally required to achieve premier performance on relatively small datasets. In this paper, we show that video masked autoencoders (VideoMAE) are data-efficient learners for self-supervised video pre-training (SSVP). We are inspired by the recent ImageMAE and propose customized video tube masking and reconstruction. These simple designs turn out to be effective for overcoming information leakage caused by the temporal correlation during video reconstruction. We obtain three important findings on SSVP: (1) An extremely high proportion of masking ratio (i.e., 90% to 95%) still yields favorable performance of VideoMAE. The temporally redundant video content enables higher masking ratio than that of images. (2) VideoMAE achieves impressive results on very small datasets (i.e., around 3k-4k videos) without using any extra data. This is partially ascribed to the challenging task of video reconstruction to enforce high-level structure learning. (3) VideoMAE shows that data quality is more important than data quantity for SSVP. Domain shift between pre-training and target datasets are important issues in SSVP. Notably, our VideoMAE with the vanilla ViT backbone can achieve 83.9% on Kinects-400, 75.3% on Something-Something V2, 90.8% on UCF101, and 61.1% on HMDB51 without using any extra data.

    "abstract": "We propose a novel method to reconstruct the 3D shapes of transparent objects using hand-held captured images under natural light conditions. It combines the advantage of explicit mesh and multi-layer perceptron (MLP) network, a hybrid representation, to simplify the capture setting used in recent contributions. After obtaining an initial shape through the multi-view silhouettes, we introduce surface-based local MLPs to encode the vertex displacement field (VDF) for the reconstruction of surface details. The design of local MLPs allows to represent the VDF in a piece-wise manner using two layer MLP networks, which is beneficial to the optimization algorithm. Defining local MLPs on the surface instead of the volume also reduces the searching space. Such a hybrid representation enables us to relax the ray-pixel correspondences that represent the light path constraint to our designed ray-cell correspondences, which significantly simplifies the implementation of single-image based environment matting algorithm. We evaluate our representation and reconstruction algorithm on several transparent objects with ground truth models. Our experiments show that our method can produce high-quality reconstruction results superior to state-of-the-art methods using a simplified data acquisition setup. ",

    "abstract": "Pre-training has shown success in different areas of machine learning, such as Computer Vision (CV), Natural Language Processing (NLP) and medical imaging. However, it has not been fully explored for clinical data analysis. Even though an immense amount of Electronic Health Record (EHR) data is recorded, data and labels can be scarce if the data is collected in small hospitals or deals with rare diseases. In such scenarios, pre-training on a larger set of EHR data could improve the model performance. In this paper, we apply unsupervised pre-training to heterogeneous, multi-modal EHR data for patient outcome prediction. To model this data, we leverage graph deep learning over population graphs. We first design a network architecture based on graph transformer designed to handle various input feature types occurring in EHR data, like continuous, discrete, and time-series features, allowing better multi-modal data fusion. Further, we design pre-training methods based on masked imputation to pre-train our network before fine-tuning on different end tasks. Pre-training is done in a fully unsupervised fashion, which lays the groundwork for pre-training on large public datasets with different tasks and similar modalities in the future. We test our method on two medical datasets of patient records, TADPOLE and MIMIC-III, including imaging and non-imaging features and different prediction tasks. We find that our proposed graph based pre-training method helps in modeling the data at a population level and further improves performance on the fine tuning tasks in terms of AUC on average by 4.15% for MIMIC and 7.64% for TADPOLE.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose to quantitatively compare loss functions based on parameterized Tsallis-Havrda-Charvat entropy and classical Shannon entropy for the training of a deep network in the case of small datasets which are usually encountered in medical applications. Shannon cross-entropy is widely used as a loss function for most neural networks applied to the segmentation, classification and detection of images. Shannon entropy is a particular case of Tsallis-Havrda-Charvat entropy. In this work, we compare these two entropies through a medical application for predicting recurrence in patients with head-neck and lung cancers after treatment. Based on both CT images and patient information, a multitask deep neural network is proposed to perform a recurrence prediction task using cross-entropy as a loss function and an image reconstruction task. Tsallis-Havrda-Charvat cross-entropy is a parameterized cross entropy with the parameter $\\alpha$. Shannon entropy is a particular case of Tsallis-Havrda-Charvat entropy for $\\alpha$ = 1. The influence of this parameter on the final prediction results is studied. In this paper, the experiments are conducted on two datasets including in total 580 patients, of whom 434 suffered from head-neck cancers and 146 from lung cancers. The results show that Tsallis-Havrda-Charvat entropy can achieve better performance in terms of prediction accuracy with some values of $\\alpha$. ",

    "abstract": "There has been significant recent interest in quantum neural networks (QNNs), along with their applications in diverse domains. Current solutions for QNNs pose significant challenges concerning their scalability, ensuring that the postulates of quantum mechanics are satisfied and that the networks are physically realizable. The exponential state space of QNNs poses challenges for the scalability of training procedures. The no-cloning principle prohibits making multiple copies of training samples, and the measurement postulates lead to non-deterministic loss functions. Consequently, the physical realizability and efficiency of existing approaches that rely on repeated measurement of several copies of each sample for training QNNs are unclear. This paper presents a new model for QNNs that relies on band-limited Fourier expansions of transfer functions of quantum perceptrons (QPs) to design scalable training procedures. This training procedure is augmented with a randomized quantum stochastic gradient descent technique that eliminates the need for sample replication. We show that this training procedure converges to the true minima in expectation, even in the presence of non-determinism due to quantum measurement. Our solution has a number of important benefits: (i) using QPs with concentrated Fourier power spectrum, we show that the training procedure for QNNs can be made scalable; (ii) it eliminates the need for resampling, thus staying consistent with the no-cloning rule; and (iii) enhanced data efficiency for the overall training process since each data sample is processed once per epoch. We present a detailed theoretical foundation for our models and methods' scalability, accuracy, and data efficiency. We also validate the utility of our approach through a series of numerical experiments. ",

Such efforts include equilibrium propagation (EP) and coupled learning (CL), which require storage of two different states-the free state and the perturbed state-during the learning process to retain information about gradients. Inspired by slime mold, we propose a new learning algorithm rooted in chemical signaling that does not require storage of two different states. Rather, the output error information is encoded in a chemical signal that diffuses into the network in a similar way as the activation/feedforward signal. The steady state feedback chemical concentration, along with the activation signal, stores the required gradient information locally. We apply our algorithm using a physical, linear flow network and test it using the Iris data set with 93% accuracy. We also prove that our algorithm performs gradient descent. Finally, in addition to comparing our algorithm directly with EP and CL, we address the biological plausibility of the algorithm. ",

However, it remains unclear how to achieve such distributional robustness when data samples from multiple sources are available. In this paper, we propose constructing the nominal distribution in Wasserstein distributionally robust optimization problems through the notion of Wasserstein barycenter as an aggregation of data samples from multiple sources. Under specific choices of the loss function, the proposed formulation admits a tractable reformulation as a finite convex program, with powerful finite-sample and asymptotic guarantees.

OTDR traces are prone to be distorted by different kinds of noise, causing blurring of the backscattered signals, and thereby leading to a misleading interpretation and a more cumbersome event detection task. To address this problem, a novel method combining a denoising convolutional autoencoder (DCAE) and a bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) is proposed, whereby the former is used for noise removal of OTDR signals and the latter for fault detection, localization, and diagnosis with the denoised signal as input. The proposed approach is applied to noisy OTDR signals of different levels of input SNR ranging from -5 dB to 15 dB. The experimental results demonstrate that: (i) the DCAE is efficient in denoising the OTDR traces and it outperforms other deep learning techniques and the conventional denoising methods; and (ii) the BiLSTM achieves a high detection and diagnostic accuracy of 96.7% with an improvement of 13.74% compared to the performance of the same model trained with noisy OTDR signals.
