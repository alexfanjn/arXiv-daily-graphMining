    "abstract": "We present Polarity Sampling, a theoretically justified plug-and-play method for controlling the generation quality and diversity of pre-trained deep generative networks DGNs). Leveraging the fact that DGNs are, or can be approximated by, continuous piecewise affine splines, we derive the analytical DGN output space distribution as a function of the product of the DGN's Jacobian singular values raised to a power $\\rho$. We dub $\\rho$ the $\\textbf{polarity}$ parameter and prove that $\\rho$ focuses the DGN sampling on the modes ($\\rho < 0$) or anti-modes ($\\rho > 0$) of the DGN output-space distribution. We demonstrate that nonzero polarity values achieve a better precision-recall (quality-diversity) Pareto frontier than standard methods, such as truncation, for a number of state-of-the-art DGNs. We also present quantitative and qualitative results on the improvement of overall generation quality (e.g., in terms of the Frechet Inception Distance) for a number of state-of-the-art DGNs, including StyleGAN3, BigGAN-deep, NVAE, for different conditional and unconditional image generation tasks. In particular, Polarity Sampling redefines the state-of-the-art for StyleGAN2 on the FFHQ Dataset to FID 2.57, StyleGAN2 on the LSUN Car Dataset to FID 2.27 and StyleGAN3 on the AFHQv2 Dataset to FID 3.95.

    "abstract": "Dense prediction is a class of computer vision problems aiming at mapping every pixel of the input image with some predicted values. Depending on the problem, the output values can be either continous or discrete. For instance, monocular depth estimation and image super-resolution are often formulated as regression, while semantic segmentation is a dense classification, i.e. discrete, problem. More specifically, the monocular depth estimation problem produces a dense depth map from a single image to be used in various applications including robotics, scene understanding, and augmented reality. Single image super-resolution (SISR) is a low-level vision task that generates a high-resolution image from its low-resolution counterpart. SISR is widely utilized in medical and surveillance imaging, where images with more precise details can provide invaluable information. On the other hand, semantic segmentation predicts a dense annotated map of different semantic categories from a given image that is crucial for image understanding tasks. ",

We first introduce the notion of a High Order Robust Adaptive Control Barrier Function (HO-RaCBF) as a means to compute control policies guaranteeing satisfaction of high relative degree safety constraints in the face of parametric model uncertainty. The developed approach guarantees safety by initially accounting for all possible parameter realizations but adaptively reduces uncertainty in the parameter estimates leveraging data recorded online. We then introduce the notion of an Exponentially Stabilizing Adaptive Control Lyapunov Function (ES-aCLF) that leverages the same data as the HO-RaCBF controller to guarantee exponential convergence of the system trajectory. The developed HO-RaCBF and ES-aCLF are unified in a quadratic programming framework, whose efficacy is showcased via two numerical examples that, to our knowledge, cannot be addressed by existing adaptive control barrier function techniques.

    "abstract": "As social networks are ubiquitous in everyday life, problems such as misinformation, bots and polarisation of opinion gain more and more importance. This paper focuses on the last one as we propose novel methods to reduce the amount of polarisation in a social group. We leverage the voter model in which users hold binary opinions and repeatedly update their beliefs based on others they connect with. Stubborn agents who never change their minds (\"zealots\") are also disseminated through the network. We are interested in two equilibrium metrics, the diversity of opinions $\\sigma$ and the density of active links $\\rho$. The latter is a measure of the exposure to adverse opinions. We derive formulas to compute them that are valid in any directed, weighted network. Then we study the problem of finding optimal numbers of zealots in order to maximise these quantities. We account for the presence of a backfire effect, which may lead the group to react negatively and reinforce its level of polarisation in response. We provide exact solutions in the specific context of a complete unweighted graph, and propose a method for $\\sigma$ in the general case. Finally we apply these problems to the network of the US House of Representatives. The network exhibits high levels of opinion diversity but lower levels of active links density. We find optimal numbers of zealots that maximise these quantities and show that both can be efficiently increased in some cases. ",

We first prove this phenomenon for a high-dimensional linear classification setting with noiseless observations. Our proof provides explanatory insights that may also transfer to feature learning models. Further, we observe in experiments on standard image datasets that the same behavior occurs for perceptible attacks that effectively reduce class information such as mask attacks and object corruptions.

    "abstract": "How can we make predictions for nodes in a heterogeneous graph when an entire type of node (e.g. user) has no labels (perhaps due to privacy issues) at all? Although heterogeneous graph neural networks (HGNNs) have shown superior performance as powerful representation learning techniques, there is no direct way to learn using labels rooted at different node types. Domain adaptation (DA) targets this setting, however, existing DA can not be applied directly to HGNNs. In heterogeneous graphs, the source and target domains have different modalities, thus HGNNs provide different feature extractors to them, while most of DA assumes source and target domains share a common feature extractor. In this work, we address the issue of zero-shot domain adaptation in HGNNs. We first theoretically induce a relationship between source and target domain features extracted from HGNNs, then propose a novel domain adaptation method, Knowledge Transfer Networks for HGNNs (HGNN-KTN). HGNN-KTN learns the relationship between source and target features, then maps the target distributions into the source domain. HGNN-KTN outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, showing up to 73.3% higher in MRR on 18 different domain adaptation tasks running on real-world benchmark graphs. ",

    "title": "Provable and Efficient Continual Representation Learning",
    "abstract": "In continual learning (CL), the goal is to design models that can learn a sequence of tasks without catastrophic forgetting. While there is a rich set of techniques for CL, relatively little understanding exists on how representations built by previous tasks benefit new tasks that are added to the network. To address this, we study the problem of continual representation learning (CRL) where we learn an evolving representation as new tasks arrive. Focusing on zero-forgetting methods where tasks are embedded in subnetworks (e.g., PackNet), we first provide experiments demonstrating CRL can significantly boost sample efficiency when learning new tasks. To explain this, we establish theoretical guarantees for CRL by providing sample complexity and generalization error bounds for new tasks by formalizing the statistical benefits of previously-learned representations. Our analysis and experiments also highlight the importance of the order in which we learn the tasks. Specifically, we show that CL benefits if the initial tasks have large sample size and high \"representation diversity\". Diversity ensures that adding new tasks incurs small representation mismatch and can be learned with few samples while training only few additional nonzero weights. Finally, we ask whether one can ensure each task subnetwork to be efficient during inference time while retaining the benefits of representation learning. To this end, we propose an inference-efficient variation of PackNet called Efficient Sparse PackNet (ESPN) which employs joint channel & weight pruning. ESPN embeds tasks in channel-sparse subnets requiring up to 80% less FLOPs to compute while approximately retaining accuracy and is very competitive with a variety of baselines. In summary, this work takes a step towards data and compute-efficient CL with a representation learning perspective. GitHub page: https://github.com/ucr-optml/CtRL ",

First, most AD methods cannot incorporate labeled data that are often available in practice in small quantities and can be crucial to achieve high AD accuracy. Second, most AD methods are not interpretable, a bottleneck that prevents stakeholders from understanding the reason behind the anomalies. In this paper, we propose a novel AD framework that adapts a white-box model class, Generalized Additive Models, to detect anomalies using a partial identification objective which naturally handles noisy or heterogeneous features. In addition, the proposed framework, DIAD, can incorporate a small amount of labeled data to further boost anomaly detection performances in semi-supervised settings. We demonstrate the superiority of our framework compared to previous work in both unsupervised and semi-supervised settings using diverse tabular datasets. For example, under 5 labeled anomalies DIAD improves from 86.2\\% to 89.4\\% AUC by learning AD from unlabeled data. We also present insightful interpretations that explain why DIAD deems certain samples as anomalies. ",

Whereas previous works on LDPC and SC-LDPC codes mostly take either an asymptotic or a finite-length design approach, in this paper we present a unified framework for jointly optimizing the codes' thresholds and cycle counts to address both regimes. The framework is based on efficient traversal and pruning of the code search space, building on the fact that the performance of a protograph-based SC-LDPC code depends on some characteristics of the code's partitioning matrix, which by itself is much smaller than the code's full parity-check matrix. We then propose an algorithm that traverses all nonequivalent partitioning matrices, and outputs a list of codes, each offering an attractive point on the trade-off between asymptotic and finite-length performance. We further extend the framework to designing SC-LDPC codes with sub-block locality, which is a recently introduced feature offering fast access to sub-blocks within the code block. Our simulations show that our framework results in SC-LDPC codes that outperform the state-of-the-art constructions, and that it offers the flexibility to choose low-SNR, high-SNR, or in-between SNR region as the primary design target.

Specifically, we show that different data modalities (e.g. images and text) are embedded at arm's length in their shared representation in multi-modal models such as CLIP. Our systematic analysis demonstrates that this gap is caused by a combination of model initialization and contrastive learning optimization. In model initialization, we show empirically and theoretically that the representation of a common deep neural network is restricted to a narrow cone. As a consequence, in a multi-modal model with two encoders, the representations of the two modalities are clearly apart when the model is initialized. During optimization, contrastive learning keeps the different modalities separate by a certain distance, which is influenced by the temperature parameter in the loss function. Our experiments further demonstrate that varying the modality gap distance has a significant impact in improving the model's downstream zero-shot classification performance and fairness.

State-of-the-art membership inference attacks have shown to achieve good accuracy which poses a great privacy threat. However, majority of SOTA attacks require training dozens to hundreds of shadow models to accurately infer membership. This huge computation cost raises questions about practicality of these attacks on deep models. In this paper, we introduce a fundamentally different MI attack approach which obviates the need to train hundreds of shadow models. Simply put, we compare the victim model output on the target sample versus the samples from the same subpopulation (i.e., semantically similar samples), instead of comparing it with the output of hundreds of shadow models. The intuition is that the model response should not be significantly different between the target sample and its subpopulation if it was not a training sample. In cases where subpopulation samples are not available to the attacker, we show that training only a single generative model can fulfill the requirement. Hence, we achieve the state-of-the-art membership inference accuracy while significantly reducing the training computation cost. ",

In this context, network traffic prediction is crucial for operators to provide reliable connectivity across large geographic regions. Although recent advances in neural network design have demonstrated potential to effectively tackle forecasting, in this work we reveal based on real-world measurements that network traffic across different regions differs widely. As a result, models trained on historical traffic data observed in one region can hardly serve in making accurate predictions in other areas. Training bespoke models for different regions is tempting, but that approach bears significant measurement overhead, is computationally expensive, and does not scale. Therefore, in this paper we propose TransMUSE, a novel deep learning framework that clusters similar services, groups edge-nodes into cohorts by traffic feature similarity, and employs a Transformer-based Multi-service Traffic Prediction Network (TMTPN), which can be directly transferred within a cohort without any customization. We demonstrate that TransMUSE exhibits imperceptible performance degradation in terms of mean absolute error (MAE) when forecasting traffic, compared with settings where a model is trained for each individual edge node. Moreover, our proposed TMTPN architecture outperforms the state-of-the-art, achieving up to 43.21% lower MAE in the multi-service traffic prediction task. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that jointly employs model transfer and multi-service traffic prediction to reduce measurement overhead, while providing fine-grained accurate demand forecasts for edge services provisioning.

    "abstract": "Weight sharing based and predictor based methods are two major types of fast neural architecture search methods. In this paper, we propose to jointly use weight sharing and predictor in a unified framework. First, we construct a SuperNet in a weight-sharing way and probabilisticly sample architectures from the SuperNet. To increase the correctness of the evaluation of architectures, besides direct evaluation using the inherited weights, we further apply a few-shot predictor to assess the architecture on the other hand. The final evaluation of the architecture is the combination of direct evaluation, the prediction from the predictor and the cost of the architecture. We regard the evaluation as a reward and apply a self-critical policy gradient approach to update the architecture probabilities. To further reduce the side effects of weight sharing, we propose a weakly weight sharing method by introducing another HyperNet. We conduct experiments on datasets including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and ImageNet under NATS-Bench, DARTS and MobileNet search space. The proposed WPNAS method achieves state-of-the-art performance on these datasets. ",

    "abstract": "The availability of wide-ranging third-party intellectual property (3PIP) cores enables integrated circuit (IC) designers to focus on designing high-level features in ASICs/SoCs. The massive proliferation of ICs brings with it an increased number of bad actors seeking to exploit those circuits for various nefarious reasons. This is not surprising as integrated circuits affect every aspect of society. Thus, malicious logic (Hardware Trojans, HT) being surreptitiously injected by untrusted vendors into 3PIP cores used in IC design is an ever present threat. In this paper, we explore methods for identification of trigger-based HT in designs containing synthesizable IP cores without a golden model. Specifically, we develop methods to detect hardware trojans by detecting triggers embedded in ICs purely based on netlists acquired from the vendor. We propose GATE-Net, a deep learning model based on graph-convolutional networks (GCN) trained using supervised contrastive learning, for flagging designs containing randomly-inserted triggers using only the corresponding netlist. Our proposed architecture achieves significant improvements over state-of-the-art learning models yielding an average 46.99% improvement in detection performance for combinatorial triggers and 21.91% improvement for sequential triggers across a variety of circuit types. Through rigorous experimentation, qualitative and quantitative performance evaluations, we demonstrate effectiveness of GATE-Net and the supervised contrastive training of GATE-Net for HT detection.

Despite the recent progress in reinforcement learning, it is still very challenging to learn a generalizable manipulation policy that can handle a category of geometrically diverse articulated objects. In this work, we tackle this category-level object manipulation policy learning problem via imitation learning in a task-agnostic manner, where we assume no handcrafted dense rewards but only a terminal reward. Given this novel and challenging generalizable policy learning problem, we identify several key issues that can fail the previous imitation learning algorithms and hinder the generalization to unseen instances. We then propose several general but critical techniques, including generative adversarial self-imitation learning from demonstrations, progressive growing of discriminator, and instance-balancing for expert buffer, that accurately pinpoints and tackles these issues and can benefit category-level manipulation policy learning regardless of the tasks. Our experiments on ManiSkill benchmarks demonstrate a remarkable improvement on all tasks and our ablation studies further validate the contribution of each proposed technique. ",

In this paper, we propose a HFL method using neural networks named continual horizontal federated learning (CHFL), a continual learning approach to improve the performance of HFL by taking advantage of unique features of each client. CHFL splits the network into two columns corresponding to common features and unique features, respectively. It jointly trains the first column by using common features through vanilla HFL and locally trains the second column by using unique features and leveraging the knowledge of the first one via lateral connections without interfering with the federated training of it. We conduct experiments on various real world datasets and show that CHFL greatly outperforms vanilla HFL that only uses common features and local learning that uses all features that each client has.

The advanced stereo 3D detectors can also accurately localize 3D objects. The gap in image-to-image generation for stereo views is much smaller than that in image-to-LiDAR generation. Motivated by this, we propose a Pseudo-Stereo 3D detection framework with three novel virtual view generation methods, including image-level generation, feature-level generation, and feature-clone, for detecting 3D objects from a single image. Our analysis of depth-aware learning shows that the depth loss is effective in only feature-level virtual view generation and the estimated depth map is effective in both image-level and feature-level in our framework. We propose a disparity-wise dynamic convolution with dynamic kernels sampled from the disparity feature map to filter the features adaptively from a single image for generating virtual image features, which eases the feature degradation caused by the depth estimation errors.

Our objective is to establish a comprehensive and consistent benchmark, to develop a repeatable evaluation procedure, and to measure the performance of a range of detection approaches so that the results can be compared soundly. A challenging dataset consisting of the manipulated samples generated by more than 13 different methods has been collected, and 11 popular detection approaches (9 algorithms) from the existing literature have been implemented and evaluated with 6 fair-minded and practical evaluation metrics.

To be specific. we formulate the dynamic grasping problem as a 'move-and-grasp' game, where the robot is to pick up the object on the mover and the adversarial mover is to find a path to escape it. Hence, the two agents play a min-max game and are trained by reinforcement learning. In this way, the mover can auto-generate diverse moving trajectories while training. And the robot trained with the adversarial trajectories can generalize to various motion patterns.

    "abstract": "The pervasiveness of offensive language on the social network has caused adverse effects on society, such as abusive behavior online. It is urgent to detect offensive language and curb its spread. Existing research shows that methods with community structure features effectively improve the performance of offensive language detection. However, the existing models deal with community structure independently, which seriously affects the effectiveness of detection models. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end method based on community structure and text features for offensive language detection (CT-OLD). Specifically, the community structure features are directly captured by the graph attention network layer, and the text embeddings are taken from the last hidden layer of BERT. Attention mechanisms and position encoding are used to fuse these features. Meanwhile, we add user opinion to the community structure for representing user features. The user opinion is represented by user historical behavior information, which outperforms that represented by text information. Besides the above point, the distribution of users and tweets is unbalanced in the popular datasets, which limits the generalization ability of the model. To address this issue, we construct and release a dataset with reasonable user distribution. Our method outperforms baselines with the F1 score of 89.94%. The results show that the end-to-end model effectively learns the potential information of community structure and text, and user historical behavior information is more suitable for user opinion representation.

In particular, there is the work of Kirschner et al. (2020), which bridges the existing literature of Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO) by casting the BO problem from the lens of DRO. While this work is pioneering, it admittedly suffers from various practical shortcomings such as finite contexts assumptions, leaving behind the main question Can one devise a computationally tractable algorithm for solving this DRO-BO problem? In this work, we tackle this question to a large degree of generality by considering robustness against data-shift in $\\phi$-divergences, which subsumes many popular choices, such as the $\\chi^2$-divergence, Total Variation, and the extant Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence. We show that the DRO-BO problem in this setting is equivalent to a finite-dimensional optimization problem which, even in the continuous context setting, can be easily implemented with provable sublinear regret bounds.

Yet, only a few LiDAR-based 3D object detection methods leverage segmentation information to further guide the detection process. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-task framework that jointly performs 3D object detection and panoptic segmentation. In our method, the 3D object detection backbone in Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) plane is augmented by the injection of Range-View (RV) feature maps from the 3D panoptic segmentation backbone. This enables the detection backbone to leverage multi-view information to address the shortcomings of each projection view. Furthermore, foreground semantic information is incorporated to ease the detection task by highlighting the locations of each object class in the feature maps. Finally, a new center density heatmap generated based on the instance-level information further guides the detection backbone by suggesting possible box center locations for objects. Our method works with any BEV-based 3D object detection method, and as shown by extensive experiments on the nuScenes dataset, it provides significant performance gains.

Based on the finding that learning for new emerging few-shot tasks often results in feature distributions that are incompatible with previous tasks' learned distributions, we propose a novel method based on embedding space regularization and data augmentation. Our method generalizes to new few-shot tasks and avoids catastrophic forgetting of previous tasks by enforcing extra constraints on the relational embeddings and by adding extra {relevant} data in a self-supervised manner.

    "abstract": "Training the multi-label image recognition models with partial labels, in which merely some labels are known while others are unknown for each image, is a considerably challenging and practical task. To address this task, current algorithms mainly depend on pre-training classification or similarity models to generate pseudo labels for the unknown labels. However, these algorithms depend on sufficient multi-label annotations to train the models, leading to poor performance especially with low known label proportion. In this work, we propose to blend category-specific representation across different images to transfer information of known labels to complement unknown labels, which can get rid of pre-training models and thus does not depend on sufficient annotations. To this end, we design a unified semantic-aware representation blending (SARB) framework that exploits instance-level and prototype-level semantic representation to complement unknown labels by two complementary modules: 1) an instance-level representation blending (ILRB) module blends the representations of the known labels in an image to the representations of the unknown labels in another image to complement these unknown labels. 2) a prototype-level representation blending (PLRB) module learns more stable representation prototypes for each category and blends the representation of unknown labels with the prototypes of corresponding labels to complement these labels. Extensive experiments on the MS-COCO, Visual Genome, Pascal VOC 2007 datasets show that the proposed SARB framework obtains superior performance over current leading competitors on all known label proportion settings, i.e., with the mAP improvement of 4.6%, 4.%, 2.2% on these three datasets when the known label proportion is 10%.

However, existing approaches are mainly designed for individual utterances or medical images rather than conversational data, which cannot exploit temporal and speaker information in conversations. To this end, we propose a novel framework for incomplete multimodal learning in conversations, called \"Graph Complete Network (GCNet)\", filling the gap of existing works. Our GCNet contains two well-designed graph neural network-based modules, \"Speaker GNN\" and \"Temporal GNN\", to capture temporal and speaker information in conversations. To make full use of complete and incomplete data in feature learning, we jointly optimize classification and reconstruction in an end-to-end manner. To verify the effectiveness of our method, we conduct experiments on three benchmark conversational datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that our GCNet is superior to existing state-of-the-art approaches in incomplete multimodal learning. ",

    "abstract": "Complete Multi-lingual Neural Machine Translation (C-MNMT) achieves superior performance against the conventional MNMT by constructing multi-way aligned corpus, i.e., aligning bilingual training examples from different language pairs when either their source or target sides are identical. However, since exactly identical sentences from different language pairs are scarce, the power of the multi-way aligned corpus is limited by its scale. To handle this problem, this paper proposes \"Extract and Generate\" (EAG), a two-step approach to construct large-scale and high-quality multi-way aligned corpus from bilingual data. Specifically, we first extract candidate aligned examples by pairing the bilingual examples from different language pairs with highly similar source or target sentences; and then generate the final aligned examples from the candidates with a well-trained generation model. With this two-step pipeline, EAG can construct a large-scale and multi-way aligned corpus whose diversity is almost identical to the original bilingual corpus. Experiments on two publicly available datasets i.e., WMT-5 and OPUS-100, show that the proposed method achieves significant improvements over strong baselines, with +1.1 and +1.4 BLEU points improvements on the two datasets respectively.

    "abstract": "This paper addresses poor cluster formation and frequent Cluster Head (CH) failure issues of underwater sensor networks by proposing an energy-efficient hierarchical topology-aware clustering routing (EEHTAC) protocol. In this paper, fault-tolerant backup clustering (FTBC) algorithms and multi-parameter cluster formation (MPCF) model were developed for the EEHTAC operation. The MPCF model tackles the issue of poor cluster formation performance by integrating multiple parameters to achieve effective clustering process. The FTBC algorithms tackle the issue of frequent CH failures to avoid interruption in data transmission. Performance of the MPCF model was evaluated using normal, high-fault, and high routing overhead network scenarios. Performance metrics employed for this analysis are temporal topology variation ratio (TTVR), CH load distribution (CLD), and cluster stability (STB). Obtained results show that operating with a CH retention period of 90s achieves better CH duty cycling per round and improves the MPCF process with values of 25.69%, 55.56%, and 60% for TTVR, CLD, and STB respectively. Performance of the FTBC-based EEHTAC was evaluated relative to Energy-balanced Unequal Layering Clustering (EULC) protocol. Performance indicators adopted for this evaluation are routing overhead ({\\Omega}), end to end delay ({\\Delta}), CH failures recovered (CFR), CH failures detected (CFD), received packets ({\\theta}), and energy consumption ({\\Sigma}). With reference to the best obtained values, EEHTAC demonstrated performance improvement of 58.40%, 29.94%, 81.33%, 28.02%, 86.65%, and 54.35% over EULC variants in terms of {\\Omega}, {\\Delta}, CFR, CFD, {\\theta}, and {\\Sigma} respectively. Obtained results displayed that the MPCF model is efficient for cluster formation performance and the FTBC-based EEHTAC protocol can perform effectively well against an existing CBR protocol. ",

    "abstract": "Monocular 3D object detection continues to attract attention due to the cost benefits and wider availability of RGB cameras. Despite the recent advances and the ability to acquire data at scale, annotation cost and complexity still limit the size of 3D object detection datasets in the supervised settings. Self-supervised methods, on the other hand, aim at training deep networks relying on pretext tasks or various consistency constraints. Moreover, other 3D perception tasks (such as depth estimation) have shown the benefits of temporal priors as a self-supervision signal. In this work, we argue that the temporal consistency on the level of object poses, provides an important supervision signal given the strong prior on physical motion. Specifically, we propose a self-supervised loss which uses this consistency, in addition to render-and-compare losses, to refine noisy pose predictions and derive high-quality pseudo labels. To assess the effectiveness of the proposed method, we finetune a synthetically trained monocular 3D object detection model using the pseudo-labels that we generated on real data. Evaluation on the standard KITTI3D benchmark demonstrates that our method reaches competitive performance compared to other monocular self-supervised and supervised methods. ",

With desirable characteristics, reconstruction autoencoder-based methods deal with this problem by using input reconstruction error as a metric of novelty vs. normality. We formulate the essence of such approach as a quadruplet domain translation with an intrinsic bias to only query for a proxy of conditional data uncertainty. Accordingly, an improvement direction is formalized as maximumly compressing the autoencoder's latent space while ensuring its reconstructive power for acting as a described domain translator. From it, strategies are introduced including semantic reconstruction, data certainty decomposition and normalized L2 distance to substantially improve original methods, which together establish state-of-the-art performance on various benchmarks, e.g., the FPR@95%TPR of CIFAR-100 vs. TinyImagenet-crop on Wide-ResNet is 0.2%.

In particular, the iPNet mimics the classic minimum mean-squared error (MMSE) precoding and approximates the matrix inversion in the design of the neural network architecture. Specifically, the proposed iPNet consists of a model-driven component network, responsible for augmenting the input channel state information (CSI), and a data-driven sub-network, responsible for precoding calculation from this augmented CSI. The latter data-driven module is explicitly interpreted as an unsupervised learner of the MMSE precoder. Simulation results show that by exploiting the augmented CSI, the proposed iPNet achieves noticeable performance gain over existing black-box designs and also exhibits enhanced generalizability against CSI mismatches.

Design: We implement the EXP-SEA to validate the proposed simulation framework, also conduct three experimental studies on the aggregate impact of electronic word-of-mouth, the competition level, and strategic bidding behaviors. EXP-SEA supports heterogeneous participants, various auction mechanisms, and also ranking and pricing algorithms. Findings: Findings from our three experiments show that (a) both the market profit and advertising indexes such as number of impressions and number of clicks are larger when the eWOM effect presents, meaning social media certainly has some effect on search engine advertising outcomes, (b) the competition level has a monotonic increasing effect on the market performance, thus search engines have an incentive to encourage both the eWOM among search users and competition among advertisers, and (c) given the market-level effect of the percentage of advertisers employing a dynamic greedy bidding strategy, there is a cut-off point for strategic bidding behaviors. Originality: This is one of the first research works to explore collective group decisions and resulting phenomena in the complex context of search engine advertising via developing and validating a simulation framework that supports assessments of various advertising strategies and estimations of the impact of mechanisms on the search market.

We demonstrate that this Neural SA with such a learnt proposal distribution, parametrised by small equivariant neural networks, outperforms SA baselines on a number of problems: Rosenbrock's function, the Knapsack problem, the Bin Packing problem, and the Travelling Salesperson problem. We also show that Neural SA scales well to large problems - generalising to significantly larger problems than the ones seen during training - while achieving comparable performance to popular off-the-shelf solvers and other machine learning methods in terms of solution quality and wall-clock time.

This task is challenging due to the presence of the large number of outliers, the unknown non-rigid deformations and the large sizes of point sets. To obtain strong robustness against outliers, we formulate the registration problem as a partial distribution matching (PDM) problem, where the goal is to partially match the distributions represented by point sets in a metric space. To handle large point sets, we propose a scalable PDM algorithm by utilizing the efficient partial Wasserstein-1 (PW) discrepancy. Specifically, we derive the Kantorovich-Rubinstein duality for the PW discrepancy, and show its gradient can be explicitly computed. Based on these results, we propose a partial Wasserstein adversarial network (PWAN), which is able to approximate the PW discrepancy by a neural network, and minimize it by gradient descent. In addition, it also incorporates an efficient coherence regularizer for non-rigid transformations to avoid unrealistic deformations. We evaluate PWAN on practical point set registration tasks, and show that the proposed PWAN is robust, scalable and performs more favorably than the state-of-the-art methods. ",

    "abstract": "Emotion Recognition in Conversations (ERC) has considerable prospects for developing empathetic machines. For multimodal ERC, it is vital to understand context and fuse modality information in conversations. Recent graph-based fusion methods generally aggregate multimodal information by exploring unimodal and cross-modal interactions in a graph. However, they accumulate redundant information at each layer, limiting the context understanding between modalities. In this paper, we propose a novel Multimodal Dynamic Fusion Network (MM-DFN) to recognize emotions by fully understanding multimodal conversational context. Specifically, we design a new graph-based dynamic fusion module to fuse multimodal contextual features in a conversation. The module reduces redundancy and enhances complementarity between modalities by capturing the dynamics of contextual information in different semantic spaces. Extensive experiments on two public benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of MM-DFN. ",

    "abstract": "Toxicity on the Internet, such as hate speech, offenses towards particular users or groups of people, or the use of obscene words, is an acknowledged problem. However, there also exist other types of inappropriate messages which are usually not viewed as toxic, e.g. as they do not contain explicit offences. Such messages can contain covered toxicity or generalizations, incite harmful actions (crime, suicide, drug use), provoke \"heated\" discussions. Such messages are often related to particular sensitive topics, e.g. on politics, sexual minorities, social injustice which more often than other topics, e.g. cars or computing, yield toxic emotional reactions. At the same time, clearly not all messages within such flammable topics are inappropriate. Towards this end, in this work, we present two text collections labelled according to binary notion of inapropriateness and a multinomial notion of sensitive topic. Assuming that the notion of inappropriateness is common among people of the same culture, we base our approach on human intuitive understanding of what is not acceptable and harmful. To objectivise the notion of inappropriateness, we define it in a data-driven way though crowdsourcing. Namely we run a large-scale annotation study asking workers if a given chatbot textual statement could harm reputation of a company created it. Acceptably high values of inter-annotator agreement suggest that the notion of inappropriateness exists and can be uniformly understood by different people. To define the notion of sensitive topics in an objective way we use on guidelines suggested commonly by specialists of legal and PR department of a large public company as potentially harmful. ",

However, the security of CDP in terms of their reproducibility by unauthorized parties or clonability remains largely unexplored. In this respect this paper addresses a problem of anti-counterfeiting of physical objects and aims at investigating the authentication aspects and the resistances to illegal copying of the modern CDP from machine learning perspectives. A special attention is paid to a reliable authentication under the real life verification conditions when the codes are printed on an industrial printer and enrolled via modern mobile phones under regular light conditions. The theoretical and empirical investigation of authentication aspects of CDP is performed with respect to four types of copy fakes from the point of view of (i) multi-class supervised classification as a baseline approach and (ii) one-class classification as a real-life application case. The obtained results show that the modern machine-learning approaches and the technical capacities of modern mobile phones allow to reliably authenticate CDP on end-user mobile phones under the considered classes of fakes.

Unlike state-of-the-art segmentation-based and point detection-based methods that typically require heuristics to either decode predictions or formulate a large sum of anchors, the curve-based methods can learn holistic lane representations naturally. To handle the optimization difficulties of existing polynomial curve methods, we propose to exploit the parametric B\\'ezier curve due to its ease of computation, stability, and high freedom degrees of transformations. In addition, we propose the deformable convolution-based feature flip fusion, for exploiting the symmetry properties of lanes in driving scenes. The proposed method achieves a new state-of-the-art performance on the popular LLAMAS benchmark. It also achieves favorable accuracy on the TuSimple and CULane datasets, while retaining both low latency (> 150 FPS) and small model size (< 10M). Our method can serve as a new baseline, to shed the light on the parametric curves modeling for lane detection.

The gap of down-scaling-by-2 is large and makes its FPN not fuse the features smoothly. This paper proposes a new SFPN (Synthetic Fusion Pyramid Network) arichtecture which creates various synthetic layers between layers of the original FPN to enhance the accuracy of light-weight CNN backones to extract objects' visual features more accurately.

How to accommodate heterogeneous medical coding systems across different hospitals? Standard approaches rely on existing medical code mapping tools, which have significant practical limitations. To tackle this problem, we propose AutoMap to automatically map the medical codes across different EHR systems in a coarse-to-fine manner: (1) Ontology-level Alignment: We leverage the ontology structure to learn a coarse alignment between the source and target medical coding systems; (2) Code-level Refinement: We refine the alignment at a fine-grained code level for the downstream tasks using a teacher-student framework. We evaluate AutoMap using several deep learning models with two real-world EHR datasets: eICU and MIMIC-III. Results show that AutoMap achieves relative improvements up to 3.9% (AUC-ROC) and 8.7% (AUC-PR) for mortality prediction, and up to 4.7% (AUC-ROC) and 3.7% (F1) for length-of-stay estimation. Further, we show that AutoMap can provide accurate mapping across coding systems. Lastly, we demonstrate that AutoMap can adapt to the two challenging scenarios: (1) mapping between completely different coding systems and (2) between completely different hospitals. ",

    "abstract": "In this paper we present a unified framework for constructing spectrally equivalent low-order-refined discretizations for the high-order finite element de Rham complex. This theory covers diffusion problems in $H^1$, $H({\\rm curl})$, and $H({\\rm div})$, and is based on combining a low-order discretization posed on a refined mesh with a high-order basis for N\\'ed\\'elec and Raviart-Thomas elements that makes use of the concept of polynomial histopolation (polynomial fitting using prescribed mean values over certain regions). This spectral equivalence, coupled with algebraic multigrid methods constructed using the low-order discretization, results in highly scalable matrix-free preconditioners for high-order finite element problems in the full de Rham complex. Additionally, a new lowest-order (piecewise constant) preconditioner is developed for high-order interior penalty discontinuous Galerkin (DG) discretizations, for which spectral equivalence results and convergence proofs for algebraic multigrid methods are provided. In all cases, the spectral equivalence results are independent of polynomial degree and mesh size; for DG methods, they are also independent of the penalty parameter. These new solvers are flexible and easy to use; any \"black-box\" preconditioner for low-order problems can be used to create an effective and efficient preconditioner for the corresponding high-order problem. A number of numerical experiments are presented, based on an implmentation in the finite element library MFEM. The theoretical properties of these preconditioners are corroborated, and the flexibility and scalability of the method are demonstrated on a range of challenging three-dimensional problems. ",

For benchmarking purposes, we compare solution quality and computational performances to those obtained using a commercial solver, Gurobi. We also compare clustering quality to the clusters obtained using the popular Louvain modularity maximization method. Our initial results clearly demonstrate the superiority of our problem formulations. They also establish the superiority of the Boltzmann machine over the traditional exact solver. In the case of smaller less complex graphs, Boltzmann machines provide the same solutions as Gurobi, but with solution times that are orders of magnitude lower. In the case of larger and more complex graphs, Gurobi fails to return meaningful results within a reasonable time frame. Finally, we also note that both our clustering formulations, the distance minimization and $K$-medoids, yield clusters of superior quality to those obtained with the Louvain algorithm. ",

Inter-user interference in an ultra-dense network offers additional challenges to provide a high data rate. Therefore, it is desirable to generate narrow beams to extend the coverage of a 5G network by increasing antenna gain and improve its capacity by reducing the inter-user interference. This fact leads us to address the use of large aperture uniform concentric circular antenna (UCCA) arrays for 5G beamforming in massive multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) technology. Our analysis demonstrates that a UCCA with a larger antenna element spacing is capable of generating a significantly narrower beam with a moderate side-lobe level than a rectangular planar antenna (RPA) array while operating with the same number of antenna elements. This capability of the UCCA is analyzed to discover the performance gain of a 5G network. ",

    "abstract": "Networks with hop-by-hop flow control occur in several contexts, from data centers to systems architectures (e.g., wormhole-routing networks on chip). A worst-case end-to-end delay in such networks can be computed using Network Calculus (NC), an algebraic theory where traffic and service guarantees are represented as curves in a Cartesian plane. NC uses transformation operations, e.g., the min-plus convolution, to model how the traffic profile changes with the traversal of network nodes. NC allows one to model flow-controlled systems, hence one can compute the end-to-end service curve describing the minimum service guaranteed to a flow traversing a tandem of flow-controlled nodes. However, while the algebraic expression of such an end-to-end service curve is quite compact, its computation is often untractable from an algorithmic standpoint: data structures tend to explode, making operations unfeasibly complex, even with as few as three hops. In this paper, we propose computational and algebraic techniques to mitigate the above problem. We show that existing techniques (such as reduction to compact domains) cannot be used in this case, and propose an arsenal of solutions, which include methods to mitigate the data representation space explosion as well as computationally efficient algorithms for the min-plus convolution operation. We show that our solutions allow a significant speedup, enable analysis of previously unfeasible case studies, and - since they do not rely on any approximation - still provide exact results. ",

We propose to remedy such a scenario by introducing a maximal radius constraint $r$ on the clusters formed by the centroids, i.e., samples from the same cluster should not be more than $2r$ apart in terms of $\\ell_2$ distance. We achieve this constraint by solving a semi-definite program, followed by a linear assignment problem with quadratic constraints.

However, analysing such clinical images \"in the wild\" is challenging, since subjects are scanned with highly variable protocols (MR contrast, resolution, orientation, etc.). Nevertheless, recent advances in convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and domain randomisation for image segmentation, best represented by the publicly available method SynthSeg, may enable morphometry of clinical MRI at scale. In this work, we first evaluate SynthSeg on an uncurated, heterogeneous dataset of more than 10,000 scans acquired at Massachusetts General Hospital. We show that SynthSeg is generally robust, but frequently falters on scans with low signal-to-noise ratio or poor tissue contrast. Next, we propose SynthSeg+, a novel method that greatly mitigates these problems using a hierarchy of conditional segmentation and denoising CNNs. We show that this method is considerably more robust than SynthSeg, while also outperforming cascaded networks and state-of-the-art segmentation denoising methods.

Traditional Object-Based codecs take advantage of this biological intuition, and are capable of non-uniform allocation of bits in favor of salient regions, at the expense of increased distortion the remaining areas: such a strategy allows a boost in perceptual quality under low rate constraints. Recently, several neural codecs have been introduced for video compression, yet they operate uniformly over all spatial locations, lacking the capability of ROI-based processing. In this paper, we introduce two models for ROI-based neural video coding. First, we propose an implicit model that is fed with a binary ROI mask and it is trained by de-emphasizing the distortion of the background. Secondly, we design an explicit latent scaling method, that allows control over the quantization binwidth for different spatial regions of latent variables, conditioned on the ROI mask. By extensive experiments, we show that our methods outperform all our baselines in terms of Rate-Distortion (R-D) performance in the ROI. Moreover, they can generalize to different datasets and to any arbitrary ROI at inference time. Finally, they do not require expensive pixel-level annotations during training, as synthetic ROI masks can be used with little to no degradation in performance. To the best of our knowledge, our proposals are the first solutions that integrate ROI-based capabilities into neural video compression models. ",

In this study, we propose an enhanced version of the physics-constrained deep neural network (PCDNN) approach [1] to provide high-accuracy voltage predictions in the vanadium redox flow batteries (VRFBs). The purpose of the PCDNN approach is to enforce the physics-based zero-dimensional (0D) VRFB model in a neural network to assure model generalization for various battery operation conditions. Limited by the simplifications of the 0D model, the PCDNN cannot capture sharp voltage changes in the extreme SOC regions. To improve the accuracy of voltage prediction at extreme ranges, we introduce a second (enhanced) DNN to mitigate the prediction errors carried from the 0D model itself and call the resulting approach enhanced PCDNN (ePCDNN). By comparing the model prediction with experimental data, we demonstrate that the ePCDNN approach can accurately capture the voltage response throughout the charge--discharge cycle, including the tail region of the voltage discharge curve. Compared to the standard PCDNN, the prediction accuracy of the ePCDNN is significantly improved. The loss function for training the ePCDNN is designed to be flexible by adjusting the weights of the physics-constrained DNN and the enhanced DNN. This allows the ePCDNN framework to be transferable to battery systems with variable physical model fidelity. ",

Existing cerebellum normalization methods are not reliable on postoperative scans, therefore current approaches to measure surgical damage rely on manual labelling. In this work, we develop a robust algorithm to automatically detect and measure cerebellum damage due to surgery using postoperative 3D T1 magnetic resonance imaging. In our proposed approach, normal brain tissues are first segmented using a Bayesian algorithm customized for postoperative scans. Next, the cerebellum is isolated by nonlinear registration of a whole brain template to the native space. The isolated cerebellum is then normalized into the spatially unbiased atlas (SUIT) space using anatomical information derived from the previous step. Finally, the damage is detected in the atlas space by comparing the normalized cerebellum and the SUIT template. We evaluated our damage detection tool on postoperative scans of 153 patients diagnosed with medulloblastoma based on inspection by human expects. We also designed a simulation to test the proposed approach without human intervention. Our results show that the proposed approach has superior performance on various scenarios. ",

    "abstract": "Medical image segmentation plays an irreplaceable role in computer-assisted diagnosis, treatment planning, and following-up. Collecting and annotating a large-scale dataset is crucial to training a powerful segmentation model, but producing high-quality segmentation masks is an expensive and time-consuming procedure. Recently, weakly-supervised learning that uses sparse annotations (points, scribbles, bounding boxes) for network training has achieved encouraging performance and shown the potential for annotation cost reduction. However, due to the limited supervision signal of sparse annotations, it is still challenging to employ them for networks training directly. In this work, we propose a simple yet efficient scribble-supervised image segmentation method and apply it to cardiac MRI segmentation. Specifically, we employ a dual-branch network with one encoder and two slightly different decoders for image segmentation and dynamically mix the two decoders' predictions to generate pseudo labels for auxiliary supervision. By combining the scribble supervision and auxiliary pseudo labels supervision, the dual-branch network can efficiently learn from scribble annotations end-to-end. Experiments on the public ACDC dataset show that our method performs better than current scribble-supervised segmentation methods and also outperforms several semi-supervised segmentation methods. ",

    "abstract": "The concept of sparsity has been extensively applied for regularization in image reconstruction. Typically, sparsifying transforms are either pre-trained on ground-truth images or adaptively trained during the reconstruction. Thereby, learning algorithms are designed to minimize some target function which encodes the desired properties of the transform. However, this procedure ignores the subsequently employed reconstruction algorithm as well as the physical model which is responsible for the image formation process. Iterative neural networks - which contain the physical model - can overcome these issues. In this work, we demonstrate how convolutional sparsifying filters can be efficiently learned by end-to-end training of iterative neural networks. We evaluated our approach on a non-Cartesian 2D cardiac cine MRI example and show that the obtained filters are better suitable for the corresponding reconstruction algorithm than the ones obtained by decoupled pre-training.

MANNER efficiently extracts three different representations from noisy speech and estimates high-quality clean speech.

Creating accurate separation signals to avoid the catastrophic error accumulation during SED model training is very important and challenging. In this study, we first propose a novel selective pseudo-labeling approach, termed SPL, to produce high confidence separated target events from blind sound separation outputs. These target events are then used to fine-tune the original SED model that pre-trained on the sound mixtures in a multi-objective learning style. Then, to further leverage the SSep outputs, a class-wise discriminative fusion is proposed to improve the final SED performances, by combining multiple frame-level event predictions of both sound mixtures and their separated signals. All experiments are performed on the public DCASE 2021 Task 4 dataset, and results show that our approaches significantly outperforms the official baseline, the collar-based F 1, PSDS1 and PSDS2 performances are improved from 44.3%, 37.3% and 54.9% to 46.5%, 44.5% and 75.4%, respectively.

    "abstract": "Speech enhancement in the time-frequency domain is often performed by estimating a multiplicative mask to extract clean speech. However, most neural network-based methods perform point estimation, i.e., their output consists of a single mask. In this paper, we study the benefits of modeling uncertainty in neural network-based speech enhancement. For this, our neural network is trained to map a noisy spectrogram to the Wiener filter and its associated variance, which quantifies uncertainty, based on the maximum a posteriori (MAP) inference of spectral coefficients. By estimating the distribution instead of the point estimate, one can model the uncertainty associated with each estimate. We further propose to use the estimated Wiener filter and its uncertainty to build an approximate MAP (A-MAP) estimator of spectral magnitudes, which in turn is combined with the MAP inference of spectral coefficients to form a hybrid loss function to jointly reinforce the estimation. Experimental results on different datasets show that the proposed method can not only capture the uncertainty associated with the estimated filters, but also yield a higher enhancement performance over comparable models that do not take uncertainty into account.

In this study, a new unified model termed as automated multi-objective Mixer (AutoMO-Mixer) model was developed, which utilized a recent developed multiple layer perceptron Mixer (MLP-Mixer) as base. To build a balanced model, sensitivity and specificity were considered as the objective functions simultaneously in training stage. Meanwhile, a new evidential reasoning based on entropy was developed to achieve a safe and robust model in testing stage. The experiment on an optical coherence tomography dataset demonstrated that AutoMO-Mixer can obtain safer, more balanced, and robust results compared with MLP-Mixer and other available models. ",

    "abstract": "Automated surface segmentation of retinal layer is important and challenging in analyzing optical coherence tomography (OCT). Recently, many deep learning based methods have been developed for this task and yield remarkable performance. However, due to large spatial gap and potential mismatch between the B-scans of OCT data, all of them are based on 2D segmentation of individual B-scans, which may loss the continuity information across the B-scans. In addition, 3D surface of the retina layers can provide more diagnostic information, which is crucial in quantitative image analysis. In this study, a novel framework based on hybrid 2D-3D convolutional neural networks (CNNs) is proposed to obtain continuous 3D retinal layer surfaces from OCT. The 2D features of individual B-scans are extracted by an encoder consisting of 2D convolutions. These 2D features are then used to produce the alignment displacement field and layer segmentation by two 3D decoders, which are coupled via a spatial transformer module. The entire framework is trained end-to-end. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that attempts 3D retinal layer segmentation in volumetric OCT images based on CNNs. Experiments on a publicly available dataset show that our framework achieves superior results to state-of-the-art 2D methods in terms of both layer segmentation accuracy and cross-B-scan 3D continuity, thus offering more clinical values than previous works.

Our results showed that the quantum approximate optimization algorithm approach offers competitive results with state-of-the-art methods and quantitative resilience to quantum noise.

We show that agents can learn the true hypothesis even if they do not discuss it, at rates comparable to traditional social learning. We also show that using one's own belief as a prior for estimating the neighbors' non-transmitted components might create opinion clusters that prevent learning with full confidence.
