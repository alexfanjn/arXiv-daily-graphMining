    "abstract": "For humans, our \"senses of touch\" have always been necessary for our ability to precisely and efficiently manipulate objects of all shapes in any environment, but until recently, not many works have been done to fully understand haptic feedback. This work proposed a novel method for getting a better shape descriptor than existing methods for classifying an object from multiple tactile data collected from a tactile glove. It focuses on improving previous works on object classification using tactile data. The major problem for object classification from multiple tactile data is to find a good way to aggregate features extracted from multiple tactile images. We propose a novel method, dubbed as Tactile-ViewGCN, that hierarchically aggregate tactile features considering relations among different features by using Graph Convolutional Network. Our model outperforms previous methods on the STAG dataset with an accuracy of 81.82%. ",

    "abstract": "In recent years, deep learning approaches have been proved good performance in traffic flow prediction, many complex models have been proposed to make traffic flow prediction more accurate. However, lacking transparency limits the domain experts on understanding when and where the input data mainly impact the results. Most urban experts and planners can only adjust traffic based on their own experience and can not react effectively toward the potential traffic jam. To tackle this problem, we adapt Shapley value and present a visualization analysis system , which can provide experts with the interpretation of traffic flow prediction. TrafPS consists of three layers, from data process to results computation and visualization. We design three visualization views in TrafPS to support the prediction analysis process. One demonstration shows that the TrafPS supports an effective analytical pipeline on interpreting the prediction flow to users and provides an intuitive visualization for decision making. ",

    "abstract": "Memory-augmented neural networks enhance a neural network with an external key-value memory whose complexity is typically dominated by the number of support vectors in the key memory. We propose a generalized key-value memory that decouples its dimension from the number of support vectors by introducing a free parameter that can arbitrarily add or remove redundancy to the key memory representation. In effect, it provides an additional degree of freedom to flexibly control the trade-off between robustness and the resources required to store and compute the generalized key-value memory. This is particularly useful for realizing the key memory on in-memory computing hardware where it exploits nonideal, but extremely efficient non-volatile memory devices for dense storage and computation. Experimental results show that adapting this parameter on demand effectively mitigates up to 44% nonidealities, at equal accuracy and number of devices, without any need for neural network retraining.

Our approach enables AOT source-to-source transformation of Python programs, driven by the inclusion of type hints for function parameters and return values. These hints can be supplied by the programmer or obtained by dynamic profiler tools; multi-version code generation guarantees the correctness of our AOT transformation in all cases. Our compilation framework performs automatic parallelization and sophisticated high-level code optimizations for the target distributed heterogeneous hardware platform. It includes extensions to the polyhedral framework that unify user-written loops and implicit loops present in matrix/tensor operators, as well as automated section of CPU vs. GPU code variants. Further, our polyhedral optimizations enable both intra-node and inter-node parallelism. Finally, the optimized output code is deployed using the Ray runtime for scheduling distributed tasks across multiple heterogeneous nodes in a cluster. Our empirical evaluation shows significant performance improvements relative to sequential Python in both single-node and multi-node experiments, with a performance improvement of over 20,000$\\times$ when using 24 nodes and 144 GPUs in the OLCF Summit supercomputer for the Space-Time Adaptive Processing (STAP) radar application.

In this paper, we provide an overview of the mediative role of AI-augmented agents for social interactions. First, we discuss the two-dimensional framework for classifying wellbeing AI: individual/group and analysis/intervention. Furthermore, wellbeing AI touches on intervening social relationships between human-human interactions since positive social relationships are key to human wellbeing.

    "abstract": "While deep learning surpasses human-level performance in narrow and specific vision tasks, it is fragile and over-confident in classification. For example, minor transformations in perspective, illumination, or object deformation in the image space can result in drastically different labeling, which is especially transparent via adversarial perturbations. On the other hand, human visual perception is orders of magnitude more robust to changes in the input stimulus. But unfortunately, we are far from fully understanding and integrating the underlying mechanisms that result in such robust perception. In this work, we introduce a novel method of incorporating temporal dynamics into static image understanding. We describe a neuro-inspired method that decomposes a single image into a series of coarse-to-fine images that simulates how biological vision integrates information over time. Next, we demonstrate how our novel visual perception framework can utilize this information \"over time\" using a biologically plausible algorithm with recurrent units, and as a result, significantly improving its accuracy and robustness over standard CNNs. We also compare our proposed approach with state-of-the-art models and explicitly quantify our adversarial robustness properties through multiple ablation studies. Our quantitative and qualitative results convincingly demonstrate exciting and transformative improvements over the standard computer vision and deep learning architectures used today. ",

In this paper, we propose \\textit{PillarGrid}, a novel cooperative perception method fusing information from multiple 3D LiDARs (both on-board and roadside), to enhance the situation awareness for connected and automated vehicles (CAVs). PillarGrid consists of four main phases: 1) cooperative preprocessing of point clouds, 2) pillar-wise voxelization and feature extraction, 3) grid-wise deep fusion of features from multiple sensors, and 4) convolutional neural network (CNN)-based augmented 3D object detection. A novel cooperative perception platform is developed for model training and testing. Extensive experimentation shows that PillarGrid outperforms the SOTA single-LiDAR-based 3D object detection methods with respect to both accuracy and range by a large margin. ",

    "abstract": "Website fingerprinting attack (WFA) aims to deanonymize the website a user is visiting through anonymous networks channels (e.g., Tor). Despite of remarkable progress in the past years, most existing methods make implicitly a couple of artificial assumptions that (1) only a single website (i.e., single-tab) is visited each time, and (2) website fingerprinting data are pre-trimmed into a single trace per website manually. In reality, a user often open multiple tabs for multiple websites spontaneously. Indeed, this multi-tab WFA (MT-WFA) setting has been studied in a few recent works, but all of them still fail to fully respect the real-world situations. In particular, the overlapping challenge between website fingerprinting has never been investigated in depth. In this work, we redefine the problem of MT-WFA as detecting multiple monitored traces, given a natural untrimmed traffic data including monitored traces, unmonitored traces, and potentially unconstrained overlapping between them. This eliminates the above assumptions, going beyond the conventional single website fingerprint classification perspective taken by all previous WFA methods. To tackle this realistic MT-WFA problem, we formulate a novel Website Fingerprint Detection (WFD) model capable of detecting accurately the start and end points of all the monitored traces and classifying them jointly, given long, untrimmed raw traffic data. WFD is end-to-end, with the trace localization and website classification integrated in a single unified pipeline. To enable quantitative evaluation in our MT-WFA setting, we introduce new performance metrics. Extensive experiments on several newly constructed benchmarks show that our WFD outperforms the state-of-the-art alternative methods in both accuracy and efficiency by a large margin, even with a very small training set.

    "abstract": "Referring expression comprehension (REC) aims to locate a certain object in an image referred by a natural language expression. For joint understanding of regions and expressions, existing REC works typically target on modeling the cross-modal relevance in each region-expression pair within each single image. In this paper, we explore a new but general REC-related problem, named Group-based REC, where the regions and expressions can come from different subject-related images (images in the same group), e.g., sets of photo albums or video frames. Different from REC, Group-based REC involves differentiated cross-modal relevances within each group and across different groups, which, however, are neglected in the existing one-line paradigm. To this end, we propose a novel relevance-guided multi-group self-paced learning schema (termed RMSL), where the within-group region-expression pairs are adaptively assigned with different priorities according to their cross-modal relevances, and the bias of the group priority is balanced via an across-group relevance constraint simultaneously. In particular, based on the visual and textual semantic features, RMSL conducts an adaptive learning cycle upon triplet ranking, where (1) the target-negative region-expression pairs with low within-group relevances are used preferentially in model training to distinguish the primary semantics of the target objects, and (2) an across-group relevance regularization is integrated into model training to balance the bias of group priority. The relevances, the pairs, and the model parameters are alternatively updated upon a unified self-paced hinge loss. ",

    "abstract": "Currently, for crowd counting, the fully supervised methods via density map estimation are the mainstream research directions. However, such methods need location-level annotation of persons in an image, which is time-consuming and laborious. Therefore, the weakly supervised method just relying upon the count-level annotation is urgently needed. Since CNN is not suitable for modeling the global context and the interactions between image patches, crowd counting with weakly supervised learning via CNN generally can not show good performance. The weakly supervised model via Transformer was sequentially proposed to model the global context and learn contrast features. However, the transformer directly partitions the crowd images into a series of tokens, which may not be a good choice due to each pedestrian being an independent individual, and the parameter number of the network is very large. Hence, we propose a Joint CNN and Transformer Network (JCTNet) via weakly supervised learning for crowd counting in this paper. JCTNet consists of three parts: CNN feature extraction module (CFM), Transformer feature extraction module (TFM), and counting regression module (CRM). In particular, the CFM extracts crowd semantic information features, then sends their patch partitions to TRM for modeling global context, and CRM is used to predict the number of people. Extensive experiments and visualizations demonstrate that JCTNet can effectively focus on the crowd regions and obtain superior weakly supervised counting performance on five mainstream datasets. The number of parameters of the model can be reduced by about 67%~73% compared with the pure Transformer works. We also tried to explain the phenomenon that a model constrained only by count-level annotations can still focus on the crowd regions. We believe our work can promote further research in this field.

In this work, we present a scalable and high-performance GNN framework GRAND+ for semi-supervised graph learning. To address the above issue, we develop a generalized forward push (GFPush) algorithm in GRAND+ to pre-compute a general propagation matrix and employ it to perform graph data augmentation in a mini-batch manner. We show that both the low time and space complexities of GFPush enable GRAND+ to efficiently scale to large graphs. Furthermore, we introduce a confidence-aware consistency loss into the model optimization of GRAND+, facilitating GRAND+'s generalization superiority. We conduct extensive experiments on seven public datasets of different sizes. The results demonstrate that GRAND+ 1) is able to scale to large graphs and costs less running time than existing scalable GNNs, and 2) can offer consistent accuracy improvements over both full-batch and scalable GNNs across all datasets.

Importing RDF datasets into these graph analysis engines provides access to the accumulated datasets through various application interfaces. However, the RDF model and the PG model are not interoperable. Here, we developed a framework based on the Graph to Graph Mapping Language (G2GML) for mapping RDF graphs to PGs to make the most of accumulated RDF data. Using this framework, accumulated graph data described in the RDF model can be converted to the PG model, which can then be loaded to graph database engines for further analysis. For supporting different graph database implementations, we redefined the PG model and proposed its exchangeable serialization formats. We demonstrate several use cases, where publicly available RDF data are extracted and converted to PGs.

    "title": "SIGMA: Semantic-complete Graph Matching for Domain Adaptive Object  Detection",
    "abstract": "Domain Adaptive Object Detection (DAOD) leverages a labeled domain to learn an object detector generalizing to a novel domain free of annotations. Recent advances align class-conditional distributions by narrowing down cross-domain prototypes (class centers). Though great success,they ignore the significant within-class variance and the domain-mismatched semantics within the training batch, leading to a sub-optimal adaptation. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel SemantIc-complete Graph MAtching (SIGMA) framework for DAOD, which completes mismatched semantics and reformulates the adaptation with graph matching. Specifically, we design a Graph-embedded Semantic Completion module (GSC) that completes mismatched semantics through generating hallucination graph nodes in missing categories. Then, we establish cross-image graphs to model class-conditional distributions and learn a graph-guided memory bank for better semantic completion in turn. After representing the source and target data as graphs, we reformulate the adaptation as a graph matching problem, i.e., finding well-matched node pairs across graphs to reduce the domain gap, which is solved with a novel Bipartite Graph Matching adaptor (BGM). In a nutshell, we utilize graph nodes to establish semantic-aware node affinity and leverage graph edges as quadratic constraints in a structure-aware matching loss, achieving fine-grained adaptation with a node-to-node graph matching. Extensive experiments verify that SIGMA outperforms existing works significantly. Our codes are available at https://github.com/CityU-AIM-Group/SIGMA. ",

    "title": "Kernel Proposal Network for Arbitrary Shape Text Detection",
    "abstract": "Segmentation-based methods have achieved great success for arbitrary shape text detection. However, separating neighboring text instances is still one of the most challenging problems due to the complexity of texts in scene images. In this paper, we propose an innovative Kernel Proposal Network (dubbed KPN) for arbitrary shape text detection. The proposed KPN can separate neighboring text instances by classifying different texts into instance-independent feature maps, meanwhile avoiding the complex aggregation process existing in segmentation-based arbitrary shape text detection methods. To be concrete, our KPN will predict a Gaussian center map for each text image, which will be used to extract a series of candidate kernel proposals (i.e., dynamic convolution kernel) from the embedding feature maps according to their corresponding keypoint positions. To enforce the independence between kernel proposals, we propose a novel orthogonal learning loss (OLL) via orthogonal constraints. Specifically, our kernel proposals contain important self-information learned by network and location information by position embedding. Finally, kernel proposals will individually convolve all embedding feature maps for generating individual embedded maps of text instances. In this way, our KPN can effectively separate neighboring text instances and improve the robustness against unclear boundaries. To our knowledge, our work is the first to introduce the dynamic convolution kernel strategy to efficiently and effectively tackle the adhesion problem of neighboring text instances in text detection. Experimental results on challenging datasets verify the impressive performance and efficiency of our method. The code and model are available at https://github.com/GXYM/KPN. ",

    "abstract": "Super-resolution of LiDAR range images is crucial to improving many downstream tasks such as object detection, recognition, and tracking. While deep learning has made a remarkable advances in super-resolution techniques, typical convolutional architectures limit upscaling factors to specific output resolutions in training. Recent work has shown that a continuous representation of an image and learning its implicit function enable almost limitless upscaling. However, the detailed approach, predicting values (depths) for neighbor pixels in the input and then linearly interpolating them, does not best fit the LiDAR range images since it does not fill the unmeasured details but creates a new image with regression in a high-dimensional space. In addition, the linear interpolation blurs sharp edges providing important boundary information of objects in 3-D points. To handle these problems, we propose a novel network, Implicit LiDAR Network (ILN), which learns not the values per pixels but weights in the interpolation so that the superresolution can be done by blending the input pixel depths but with non-linear weights. Also, the weights can be considered as attentions from the query to the neighbor pixels, and thus an attention module in the recent Transformer architecture can be leveraged. Our experiments with a novel large-scale synthetic dataset demonstrate that the proposed network reconstructs more accurately than the state-of-the-art methods, achieving much faster convergence in training.

Strong adversarial attacks are proposed by various authors for computer vision and Natural Language Processing (NLP). As a counter-effort, several defense mechanisms are also proposed to save these networks from failing. In contrast with image data, generating adversarial attacks and defending these models is not easy in NLP because of the discrete nature of the text data. However, numerous methods for adversarial defense are proposed of late, for different NLP tasks such as text classification, named entity recognition, natural language inferencing, etc. These methods are not just used for defending neural networks from adversarial attacks, but also used as a regularization mechanism during training, saving the model from overfitting. The proposed survey is an attempt to review different methods proposed for adversarial defenses in NLP in the recent past by proposing a novel taxonomy. This survey also highlights the fragility of the advanced deep neural networks in NLP and the challenges in defending them. ",

This idea of concentration offers insights into reinforcement learning of sophisticated Large-scale Multi-Agent Systems (LMAS) participated by hundreds of agents. In such an LMAS, each agent receives a long series of entity observations at each step, which can overwhelm existing aggregation networks such as graph attention networks and cause inefficiency. In this paper, we propose a concentration network called ConcNet. First, ConcNet scores the observed entities considering several motivational indices, e.g., expected survival time and state value of the agents, and then ranks, prunes, and aggregates the encodings of observed entities to extract features. Second, distinct from the well-known attention mechanism, ConcNet has a unique motivational subnetwork to explicitly consider the motivational indices when scoring the observed entities. Furthermore, we present a concentration policy gradient architecture that can learn effective policies in LMAS from scratch. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the presented architecture has excellent scalability and flexibility, and significantly outperforms existing methods on LMAS benchmarks. ",

In this work, we propose a novel pure Transformer-based SOD framework, namely Depth-supervised hierarchical feature Fusion TRansformer (DFTR), to further improve the accuracy of both RGB and RGB-D SOD. The proposed DFTR involves three primary improvements: 1) The backbone of feature encoder is switched from a convolutional neural network to a Swin Transformer for more effective feature extraction; 2) We propose a multi-scale feature aggregation (MFA) module to fully exploit the multi-scale features encoded by the Swin Transformer in a coarse-to-fine manner; 3) Following recent studies, we formulate an auxiliary task of depth map prediction and use the ground-truth depth maps as extra supervision signals for network learning. To enable bidirectional information flow between saliency and depth branches, a novel multi-task feature fusion (MFF) module is integrated into our DFTR. We extensively evaluate the proposed DFTR on ten benchmarking datasets. Experimental results show that our DFTR consistently outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods for both RGB and RGB-D SOD tasks. The code and model will be released. ",

Although existing methods achieve satisfying performance, they are mostly based on CNN and specialized for a single domain say associated with a particular anatomical region. In this work, we propose a universal model for multi-domain landmark detection by taking advantage of transformer for modeling long dependencies and develop a domain-adaptive transformer model, named as DATR, which is trained on multiple mixed datasets from different anatomies and capable of detecting landmarks of any image from those anatomies. The proposed DATR exhibits three primary features: (i) It is the first universal model which introduces transformer as an encoder for multi-anatomy landmark detection; (ii) We design a domain-adaptive transformer for anatomy-aware landmark detection, which can be effectively extended to any other transformer network; (iii) Following previous studies, we employ a light-weighted guidance network, which encourages the transformer network to detect more accurate landmarks. We carry out experiments on three widely used X-ray datasets for landmark detection, which have 1,588 images and 62 landmarks in total, including three different anatomies (head, hand, and chest). Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed DATR achieves state-of-the-art performances by most metrics and behaves much better than any previous convolution-based models.

    "abstract": "Learning to reason about relations and dynamics over multiple interacting objects is a challenging topic in machine learning. The challenges mainly stem from that the interacting systems are exponentially-compositional, symmetrical, and commonly geometrically-constrained. Current methods, particularly the ones based on equivariant Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), have targeted on the first two challenges but remain immature for constrained systems. In this paper, we propose Graph Mechanics Network (GMN) which is combinatorially efficient, equivariant and constraint-aware. The core of GMN is that it represents, by generalized coordinates, the forward kinematics information (positions and velocities) of a structural object. In this manner, the geometrical constraints are implicitly and naturally encoded in the forward kinematics. Moreover, to allow equivariant message passing in GMN, we have developed a general form of orthogonality-equivariant functions, given that the dynamics of constrained systems are more complicated than the unconstrained counterparts. Theoretically, the proposed equivariant formulation is proved to be universally expressive under certain conditions. Extensive experiments support the advantages of GMN compared to the state-of-the-art GNNs in terms of prediction accuracy, constraint satisfaction and data efficiency on the simulated systems consisting of particles, sticks and hinges, as well as two real-world datasets for molecular dynamics prediction and human motion capture.

Most deep learning-based approaches require high-resolution labels and work with fixed sensor locations, thus being restrictive in their scope. Also, doing Proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) on sparse data is nontrivial. To tackle these problems, we propose a technique with an implicit optimization layer and a physics-based loss function that can learn from sparse labels. It works by minimizing the energy of the neural network prediction, enabling it to work with a varying number of sensors at different locations. Based on this technique we present two models for discrete and continuous prediction in space. We demonstrate the performance using two high-dimensional fluid problems of Burgers' equation and Flow Past Cylinder for discrete model and using Allen Cahn equation and Convection-diffusion equations for continuous model. We show the models are also robust to noise in measurements. ",

First, a global graph is built upon all session data, from which the global item representations are learned in an unsupervised manner. Then, these representations are refined on session graphs under the graph networks, and a readout function is used to generate session representations for each session.

Solving this problem typically involves a two-stage scheme, consisting of the computation of a pairwise piece compatibility measure (CM), coupled with a subsequent puzzle reconstruction algorithm. Many effective CMs, which apply a simple distance measure, based merely on the information along the piece edges, have been proposed. However, the practicality of these classical methods is rather doubtful for problem instances harder than pure synthetic images. Specifically, these methods tend to break down in more realistic scenarios involving, e.g., monochromatic puzzles, eroded boundaries due to piece degradation over long time periods, missing pieces, etc. To overcome this significant deficiency, a few deep convolutional neural network (CNN)-based CMs have been recently introduced. Despite their promising accuracy, these models are very computationally intensive. Twin Embedding Networks (TEN), to represent a piece with respect to its boundary in a latent embedding space. Combining this latent representation with a simple distance measure, we then demonstrate a superior performance, in terms of accuracy, of our newly proposed pairwise CM, compared to that of various classical methods, for the problem domain of eroded tile boundaries, a testbed for a number of real-world JPP variants. Furthermore, we also demonstrate that TEN is faster by a few orders of magnitude, on average, than the recent NN models, i.e., it is as fast as the classical methods. In this regard, the paper makes a significant first attempt at bridging the gap between the relatively low accuracy (of classical methods) and the intensive computational complexity (of NN models), for practical, real-world puzzle-like problems.

Despite their application to complex processes such as social contagion and novel measures of centrality, not much is currently understood about the distributional properties of these complexes in communication networks. Furthermore, it is also an open question as to whether an established growth model, such as scale-free network growth with triad formation, is sophisticated enough to capture the distributional properties of simplicial complexes. In this paper, we use empirical data on five real-world communication networks to propose a functional form for the distributions of two important simplicial complex structures. We also show that, while the scale-free network growth model with triad formation captures the form of these distributions in networks evolved using the model, the best-fit parameters are significantly different between the real network and its simulated equivalent.

Long-Short-Term-Memory (LSTM) models have been developed for cloud workload prediction. Unfortunately, the state-of-the-art LSTM model leverages recurrences to predict, which naturally adds complexity and increases the inference overhead as input sequences grow longer.

    "abstract": "Continual/lifelong learning from a non-stationary input data stream is a cornerstone of intelligence. Despite their phenomenal performance in a wide variety of applications, deep neural networks are prone to forgetting their previously learned information upon learning new ones. This phenomenon is called \"catastrophic forgetting\" and is deeply rooted in the stability-plasticity dilemma. Overcoming catastrophic forgetting in deep neural networks has become an active field of research in recent years. In particular, gradient projection-based methods have recently shown exceptional performance at overcoming catastrophic forgetting. This paper proposes two biologically-inspired mechanisms based on sparsity and heterogeneous dropout that significantly increase a continual learner's performance over a long sequence of tasks. Our proposed approach builds on the Gradient Projection Memory (GPM) framework. We leverage K-winner activations in each layer of a neural network to enforce layer-wise sparse activations for each task, together with a between-task heterogeneous dropout that encourages the network to use non-overlapping activation patterns between different tasks. In addition, we introduce Continual Swiss Roll as a lightweight and interpretable -- yet challenging -- synthetic benchmark for continual learning. Lastly, we provide an in-depth analysis of our proposed method and demonstrate a significant performance boost on various benchmark continual learning problems. ",

The subpixel coordinate of each landmark is predicted independently based on the aggregated feature. Moreover, a coarse-to-fine framework is further introduced to incorporate with the SLPT, which enables the initial landmarks to gradually converge to the target facial landmarks using fine-grained features from dynamically resized local patches. Extensive experiments carried out on three popular benchmarks, including WFLW, 300W and COFW, demonstrate that the proposed method works at the state-of-the-art level with much less computational complexity by learning the inherent relation between facial landmarks.

    "abstract": "Mobile user profiling refers to the efforts of extracting users' characteristics from mobile activities. In order to capture the dynamic varying of user characteristics for generating effective user profiling, we propose an imitation-based mobile user profiling framework. Considering the objective of teaching an autonomous agent to imitate user mobility based on the user's profile, the user profile is the most accurate when the agent can perfectly mimic the user behavior patterns. The profiling framework is formulated into a reinforcement learning task, where an agent is a next-visit planner, an action is a POI that a user will visit next, and the state of the environment is a fused representation of a user and spatial entities. An event in which a user visits a POI will construct a new state, which helps the agent predict users' mobility more accurately. In the framework, we introduce a spatial Knowledge Graph (KG) to characterize the semantics of user visits over connected spatial entities. Additionally, we develop a mutual-updating strategy to quantify the state that evolves over time. Along these lines, we develop a reinforcement imitative graph learning framework for mobile user profiling. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate the superiority of our approach.

Deep learning-based instance segmentation enables real-time object identification from the radar detection points. In the conventional training process, accurate annotation is the key. However, high-quality annotations of radar detection points are challenging to achieve due to their ambiguity and sparsity. To address this issue, we propose a contrastive learning approach for implementing radar detection points-based instance segmentation. We define the positive and negative samples according to the ground-truth label, apply the contrastive loss to train the model first, and then perform training for the following downstream task. In addition, these two steps can be merged into one, and pseudo labels can be generated for the unlabeled data to improve the performance further. Thus, there are four different training settings for our method. Experiments show that when the ground-truth information is only available for 5% of the training data, our method still achieves a comparable performance to the approach trained in a supervised manner with 100% ground-truth information.

    "abstract": "In a model inversion attack, an adversary attempts to reconstruct the data records, used to train a target model, using only the model's output. In launching a contemporary model inversion attack, the strategies discussed are generally based on either predicted confidence score vectors, i.e., black-box attacks, or the parameters of a target model, i.e., white-box attacks. However, in the real world, model owners usually only give out the predicted labels; the confidence score vectors and model parameters are hidden as a defense mechanism to prevent such attacks. Unfortunately, we have found a model inversion method that can reconstruct the input data records based only on the output labels. We believe this is the attack that requires the least information to succeed and, therefore, has the best applicability. The key idea is to exploit the error rate of the target model to compute the median distance from a set of data records to the decision boundary of the target model. The distance, then, is used to generate confidence score vectors which are adopted to train an attack model to reconstruct the data records. The experimental results show that highly recognizable data records can be reconstructed with far less information than existing methods. ",

In this paper, we consider the black-box adversarial setting, where the adversary needs to craft adversarial examples without access to the gradients of a target model. Previous methods attempted to approximate the true gradient either by using the transfer gradient of a surrogate white-box model or based on the feedback of model queries. However, the existing methods inevitably suffer from low attack success rates or poor query efficiency since it is difficult to estimate the gradient in a high-dimensional input space with limited information. To address these problems and improve black-box attacks, we propose two prior-guided random gradient-free (PRGF) algorithms based on biased sampling and gradient averaging, respectively. Our methods can take the advantage of a transfer-based prior given by the gradient of a surrogate model and the query information simultaneously. Through theoretical analyses, the transfer-based prior is appropriately integrated with model queries by an optimal coefficient in each method. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, in comparison with the alternative state-of-the-arts, both of our methods require much fewer queries to attack black-box models with higher success rates. ",

    "abstract": "Transfer learning is an important approach that produces pre-trained teacher models which can be used to quickly build specialized student models. However, recent research on transfer learning has found that it is vulnerable to various attacks, e.g., misclassification and backdoor attacks. However, it is still not clear whether transfer learning is vulnerable to model inversion attacks. Launching a model inversion attack against transfer learning scheme is challenging. Not only does the student model hide its structural parameters, but it is also inaccessible to the adversary. Hence, when targeting a student model, both the white-box and black-box versions of existing model inversion attacks fail. White-box attacks fail as they need the target model's parameters. Black-box attacks fail as they depend on making repeated queries of the target model. However, they may not mean that transfer learning models are impervious to model inversion attacks. Hence, with this paper, we initiate research into model inversion attacks against transfer learning schemes with two novel attack methods. Both are black-box attacks, suiting different situations, that do not rely on queries to the target student model. In the first method, the adversary has the data samples that share the same distribution as the training set of the teacher model. In the second method, the adversary does not have any such samples. Experiments show that highly recognizable data records can be recovered with both of these methods. This means that even if a model is an inaccessible black-box, it can still be inverted. ",

However, with the increasing number of heterogeneous components included, the complexity of the hybrid energy system becomes more significant. And the complex system imposes a more stringent requirement of the contingency plan to enhance the overall system resilience. Among different strategies to ensure a reliable system, intentional islanding is commonly applied in practical applications for power systems and attracts abundant interest in the literature. In this study, we propose a hierarchical spectral clustering-based intentional islanding strategy at the transmission level with renewable generations. To incorporate the renewable generation that relies on the inverter technology, the frequency measurements are considered to represent the transient response. And it has been further used as embedded information in the clustering algorithm along with other important electrical information from the system to enrich the modeling capability of the proposed framework. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the islanding strategy, the modified IEEE-9 bus and IEEE-118 bus systems coupled with wind farms are considered as the test cases. ",

In these types of breaches, an adversary attempts to infer a data record's membership in a dataset or even reconstruct this data record using a confidence score vector predicted by the target model. However, most existing defense methods only protect against membership inference attacks. Methods that can combat both types of attacks require a new model to be trained, which may not be time-efficient. In this paper, we propose a differentially private defense method that handles both types of attacks in a time-efficient manner by tuning only one parameter, the privacy budget. The central idea is to modify and normalize the confidence score vectors with a differential privacy mechanism which preserves privacy and obscures membership and reconstructed data. Moreover, this method can guarantee the order of scores in the vector to avoid any loss in classification accuracy. The experimental results show the method to be an effective and timely defense against both membership inference and model inversion attacks with no reduction in accuracy. ",

Although voxel or point based methods are popular in 3D object detection, they usually involve time-consuming operations such as 3D convolutions on voxels or ball query among points, making the resulting network inappropriate for time critical applications. On the other hand, 2D view-based methods feature high computing efficiency while usually obtaining inferior performance than the voxel or point based methods. In this work, we present a real-time view-based single stage 3D object detector, namely CVFNet to fulfill this task. To strengthen the cross-view feature learning under the condition of demanding efficiency, our framework extracts the features of different views and fuses them in an efficient progressive way. We first propose a novel Point-Range feature fusion module that deeply integrates point and range view features in multiple stages. Then, a special Slice Pillar is designed to well maintain the 3D geometry when transforming the obtained deep point-view features into bird's eye view. To better balance the ratio of samples, a sparse pillar detection head is presented to focus the detection on the nonempty grids. We conduct experiments on the popular KITTI and NuScenes benchmark, and state-of-the-art performances are achieved in terms of both accuracy and speed. ",

    "abstract": "In high-stake scenarios like medical treatment and auto-piloting, it's risky or even infeasible to collect online experimental data to train the agent. Simulation-based training can alleviate this issue, but may suffer from its inherent mismatches from the simulator and real environment. It is therefore imperative to utilize the simulator to learn a robust policy for the real-world deployment. In this work, we consider policy learning for Robust Markov Decision Processes (RMDP), where the agent tries to seek a robust policy with respect to unexpected perturbations on the environments. Specifically, we focus on the setting where the training environment can be characterized as a generative model and a constrained perturbation can be added to the model during testing. Our goal is to identify a near-optimal robust policy for the perturbed testing environment, which introduces additional technical difficulties as we need to simultaneously estimate the training environment uncertainty from samples and find the worst-case perturbation for testing. To solve this issue, we propose a generic method which formalizes the perturbation as an opponent to obtain a two-player zero-sum game, and further show that the Nash Equilibrium corresponds to the robust policy. We prove that, with a polynomial number of samples from the generative model, our algorithm can find a near-optimal robust policy with a high probability. Our method is able to deal with general perturbations under some mild assumptions and can also be extended to more complex problems like robust partial observable Markov decision process, thanks to the game-theoretical formulation.

Such a model is agnostic of absolute similarity values and it penalizes the regression error at all ranges of similarity values at the same scale. However, to boost e-commerce platform's monetization, it is important to predict high-level similarity more accurately than low-level similarity, as highly similar queries retrieves items according to user-intents, whereas moderately similar item retrieves related items, which may not lead to a purchase. Regression models fail to customize its loss function to concentrate around the high-similarity band, resulting poor performance in query similarity prediction task. We address the above challenge by considering the query prediction as an ordinal regression problem, and thereby propose a model, ORDSIM (ORDinal Regression for SIMilarity Prediction). ORDSIM exploits variable-width buckets to model ordinal loss, which penalizes errors in high-level similarity harshly, and thus enable the regression model to obtain better prediction results for high similarity values. We evaluate ORDSIM on a dataset of over 10 millions e-commerce queries from eBay platform and show that ORDSIM achieves substantially smaller prediction error compared to the competing regression methods on this dataset.

Unfortunately, in medical literature, cause and effect phrases in a sentence are not simply nouns or noun phrases, rather they are complex phrases consisting of several words, and existing methods fail to correctly extract the cause and effect entities in such sentences. Partial extraction of cause and effect entities conveys poor quality, non informative, and often, contradictory facts, comparing to the one intended in the given sentence. In this work, we solve this problem by designing an unsupervised method for cause and effect phrase extraction, PatternCausality, which is specifically suitable for the medical literature. Our proposed approach first uses a collection of cause-effect dependency patterns as template to extract head words of cause and effect phrases and then it uses a novel phrase extraction method to obtain complete and meaningful cause and effect phrases from a sentence. Experiments on a cause-effect dataset built from sentences from PubMed articles show that for extracting cause and effect entities, PatternCausality is substantially better than the existing methods with an order of magnitude improvement in the F-score metric over the best of the existing methods.

Concretely, we divide the input point cloud into irregular point patches and randomly mask them at a high ratio.

However, dense 3D facial geometry (e.g. pixel-wise depth) is extremely important for this task as it is particularly beneficial for us to essentially generate accurate 3D face structures and distinguish noisy information from the possibly cluttered background. Nevertheless, dense 3D geometry annotations are prohibitively costly for videos and are typically not available for this video generation task. In this paper, we first introduce a self-supervised geometry learning method to automatically recover the dense 3D geometry (i.e.depth) from the face videos without the requirement of any expensive 3D annotation data. Based on the learned dense depth maps, we further propose to leverage them to estimate sparse facial keypoints that capture the critical movement of the human head. In a more dense way, the depth is also utilized to learn 3D-aware cross-modal (i.e. appearance and depth) attention to guide the generation of motion fields for warping source image representations. All these contributions compose a novel depth-aware generative adversarial network (DaGAN) for talking head generation.

    "abstract": "Adversarial training (AT) is always formulated as a minimax problem, of which the performance depends on the inner optimization that involves the generation of adversarial examples (AEs). Most previous methods adopt Projected Gradient Decent (PGD) with manually specifying attack parameters for AE generation. A combination of the attack parameters can be referred to as an attack strategy. Several works have revealed that using a fixed attack strategy to generate AEs during the whole training phase limits the model robustness and propose to exploit different attack strategies at different training stages to improve robustness. But those multi-stage hand-crafted attack strategies need much domain expertise, and the robustness improvement is limited. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for adversarial training by introducing the concept of \"learnable attack strategy\", dubbed LAS-AT, which learns to automatically produce attack strategies to improve the model robustness. Our framework is composed of a target network that uses AEs for training to improve robustness and a strategy network that produces attack strategies to control the AE generation. Experimental evaluations on three benchmark databases demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method. The code is released at https://github.com/jiaxiaojunQAQ/LAS-AT. ",

The ASHRAE Great Energy Predictor III (GEPIII) machine learning competition used an extensive meter data set to crowdsource the most accurate machine learning workflow for whole building energy prediction. A significant component of the winning solutions was the pre-processing phase to remove anomalous training data. Contemporary pre-processing methods focus on filtering statistical threshold values or deep learning methods requiring training data and multiple hyper-parameters. A recent method named ALDI (Automated Load profile Discord Identification) managed to identify these discords using matrix profile, but the technique still requires user-defined parameters. We develop ALDI++, a method based on the previous work that bypasses user-defined parameters and takes advantage of discord similarity. We evaluate ALDI++ against a statistical threshold, variational auto-encoder, and the original ALDI as baselines in classifying discords and energy forecasting scenarios. Our results demonstrate that while the classification performance improvement over the original method is marginal, ALDI++ helps achieve the best forecasting error improving 6% over the winning's team approach with six times less computation time.

However, such formulation is inevitably offline-data-hungry and, in practice, collecting a large offline dataset for one specific task over one specific environment is also costly and laborious. In this paper, we thus 1) formulate the offline dynamics adaptation by using (source) offline data collected from another dynamics to relax the requirement for the extensive (target) offline data, 2) characterize the dynamics shift problem in which prior offline methods do not scale well, and 3) derive a simple dynamics-aware reward augmentation (DARA) framework from both model-free and model-based offline settings. Specifically, DARA emphasizes learning from those source transition pairs that are adaptive for the target environment and mitigates the offline dynamics shift by characterizing state-action-next-state pairs instead of the typical state-action distribution sketched by prior offline RL methods. The experimental evaluation demonstrates that DARA, by augmenting rewards in the source offline dataset, can acquire an adaptive policy for the target environment and yet significantly reduce the requirement of target offline data. With only modest amounts of target offline data, our performance consistently outperforms the prior offline RL methods in both simulated and real-world tasks. ",

When a classifier is uncertain about the class label for a test instance, it can predict a set of classes instead of a single class. In this paper, we focus on hierarchical multi-class classification problems, where valid sets (typically) correspond to internal nodes of the hierarchy. We argue that this is a very strong restriction, and we propose a relaxation by introducing the notion of representation complexity for a predicted set. In combination with probabilistic classifiers, this leads to a challenging inference problem for which specific combinatorial optimization algorithms are needed. We propose three methods and evaluate them on benchmark datasets: a na\\\"ive approach that is based on matrix-vector multiplication, a reformulation as a knapsack problem with conflict graph, and a recursive tree search method. Experimental results demonstrate that the last method is computationally more efficient than the other two approaches, due to a hierarchical factorization of the conditional class distribution. ",

    "abstract": "Network intrusion detection systems (NIDS) are an essential defense for computer networks and the hosts within them. Machine learning (ML) nowadays predominantly serves as the basis for NIDS decision making, where models are tuned to reduce false alarms, increase detection rates, and detect known and unknown attacks. At the same time, ML models have been found to be vulnerable to adversarial examples that undermine the downstream task. In this work, we ask the practical question of whether real-world ML-based NIDS can be circumvented by crafted adversarial flows, and if so, how can they be created. We develop the generative adversarial network (GAN)-based attack algorithm NIDSGAN and evaluate its effectiveness against realistic ML-based NIDS. Two main challenges arise for generating adversarial network traffic flows: (1) the network features must obey the constraints of the domain (i.e., represent realistic network behavior), and (2) the adversary must learn the decision behavior of the target NIDS without knowing its model internals (e.g., architecture and meta-parameters) and training data. Despite these challenges, the NIDSGAN algorithm generates highly realistic adversarial traffic flows that evade ML-based NIDS. We evaluate our attack algorithm against two state-of-the-art DNN-based NIDS in whitebox, blackbox, and restricted-blackbox threat models and achieve success rates which are on average 99%, 85%, and 70%, respectively. We also show that our attack algorithm can evade NIDS based on classical ML models including logistic regression, SVM, decision trees and KNNs, with a success rate of 70% on average. Our results demonstrate that deploying ML-based NIDS without careful defensive strategies against adversarial flows may (and arguably likely will) lead to future compromises. ",

    "abstract": "Recently, transformer-based methods have demonstrated impressive results in various vision tasks, including image super-resolution (SR), by exploiting the self-attention (SA) for feature extraction. However, the computation of SA in most existing transformer based models is very expensive, while some employed operations may be redundant for the SR task. This limits the range of SA computation and consequently the SR performance. In this work, we propose an efficient long-range attention network (ELAN) for image SR. Specifically, we first employ shift convolution (shift-conv) to effectively extract the image local structural information while maintaining the same level of complexity as 1x1 convolution, then propose a group-wise multi-scale self-attention (GMSA) module, which calculates SA on non-overlapped groups of features using different window sizes to exploit the long-range image dependency. A highly efficient long-range attention block (ELAB) is then built by simply cascading two shift-conv with a GMSA module, which is further accelerated by using a shared attention mechanism. Without bells and whistles, our ELAN follows a fairly simple design by sequentially cascading the ELABs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ELAN obtains even better results against the transformer-based SR models but with significantly less complexity.

Frequently, people choose food ingredients without even knowing their names or pick up some food ingredients that are not obvious to them from a grocery store. Knowing which ingredients can be mixed to make a delicious food recipe is essential. Selecting the right recipe by choosing a list of ingredients is very difficult for a beginner cook. However, it can be a problem even for experts. One such example is recognising objects through image processing. Although this process is complex due to different food ingredients, traditional approaches will lead to an inaccuracy rate. These problems can be solved by machine learning and deep learning approaches. In this paper, we implemented a model for food ingredients recognition and designed an algorithm for recommending recipes based on recognised ingredients. We made a custom dataset consisting of 9856 images belonging to 32 different food ingredients classes. Convolution Neural Network (CNN) model was used to identify food ingredients, and for recipe recommendations, we have used machine learning. We achieved an accuracy of 94 percent, which is quite impressive. ",

We achieve such functionality through an adversarial sensing framework adapted from CryoGAN, which uses a discriminator network to match the distributions of captured and simulated measurements. Our framework builds on CryoGAN by (1) generalizing the forward measurement model to incorporate physically accurate and computationally efficient models for light propagation through anisoplanatic turbulence, (2) enabling adaptation to slightly misspecified forward models, and (3) leveraging domain-specific prior knowledge using pretrained generative networks, when available.

Our approach employs a BERT-based model to learn semantic representations of the sentences. The results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms existing baselines on a corpus of short stories with a new state-of-the-art performance in terms of Perfect Match Ratio (PMR) and Kendall's Tau (Tau) metrics. More precisely, our method increases PMR and Tau criteria by more than 5% and 4.3%, respectively.

Current approaches to sensitive information detection in such complex settings are based on keyword-based approaches or standard machine learning models. In this paper, we wish to explore whether pre-trained transformer models are well suited to detect complex sensitive information. Pre-trained transformers are typically trained on an enormous amount of text and therefore readily learn grammar, structure and other linguistic features, making them particularly attractive for this task.

To address this problem, this work studies no-regret learning in Markov games with adversarial opponents when competing against the best fixed policy in hindsight. Along this direction, we present a new complete set of positive and negative results: When the policies of the opponents are revealed at the end of each episode, we propose new efficient algorithms achieving $\\sqrt{K}$-regret bounds when either (1) the baseline policy class is small or (2) the opponent's policy class is small. This is complemented with an exponential lower bound when neither conditions are true. When the policies of the opponents are not revealed, we prove a statistical hardness result even in the most favorable scenario when both above conditions are true. Our hardness result is much stronger than the existing hardness results which either only involve computational hardness, or require further restrictions on the algorithms. ",

Specifically, we establish a triple-level framework to deduce registration network architectures and objectives with an auto-searching mechanism and cooperating optimization. We conduct image registration experiments on multi-site volume datasets and various registration tasks. Extensive results demonstrate that our AutoReg may automatically learn an optimal deep registration network for given volumes and achieve state-of-the-art performance, also significantly improving computation efficiency than the mainstream UNet architectures (from 0.558 to 0.270 seconds for a 3D image pair on the same configuration).

Crucially, if this defect is not addressed properly, it will adversely affect the fairness of the model and result in discrimination of certain sub-population unintentionally. Therefore, the objective of this work is to adopt metamorphic testing to examine the reliability of the selected deepfake detection model, and how the transformation of input variation places influence on the output. We have chosen MesoInception-4, a state-of-the-art deepfake detection model, as the target model and makeup as the anomalies. Makeups are applied through utilizing the Dlib library to obtain the 68 facial landmarks prior to filling in the RGB values. Metamorphic relations are derived based on the notion that realistic perturbations of the input images, such as makeup, involving eyeliners, eyeshadows, blushes, and lipsticks (which are common cosmetic appearance) applied to male and female images, should not alter the output of the model by a huge margin. Furthermore, we narrow down the scope to focus on revealing potential gender biases in DL and AI systems. Specifically, we are interested to examine whether MesoInception-4 model produces unfair decisions, which should be considered as a consequence of robustness issues. The findings from our work have the potential to pave the way for new research directions in the quality assurance and fairness in DL and AI systems. ",

    "abstract": "The target of space-time video super-resolution (STVSR) is to increase the spatial-temporal resolution of low-resolution (LR) and low frame rate (LFR) videos. Recent approaches based on deep learning have made significant improvements, but most of them only use two adjacent frames, that is, short-term features, to synthesize the missing frame embedding, which suffers from fully exploring the information flow of consecutive input LR frames. In addition, existing STVSR models hardly exploit the temporal contexts explicitly to assist high-resolution (HR) frame reconstruction. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose a deformable attention network called STDAN for STVSR. First, we devise a long-short term feature interpolation (LSTFI) module, which is capable of excavating abundant content from more neighboring input frames for the interpolation process through a bidirectional RNN structure. Second, we put forward a spatial-temporal deformable feature aggregation (STDFA) module, in which spatial and temporal contexts in dynamic video frames are adaptively captured and aggregated to enhance SR reconstruction. Experimental results on several datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art STVSR methods. ",

Based on a novel event function using a clock-like variable to determine the triggering time, we further introduce two new design parameters to improve control performance. Distinct from existing event-based control mechanisms, the inter-event times (IETs) derived from the above control framework are designable, meaning that the proposed ETM can be deployed on practical vehicle more easily and effectively. In addition, the improved IETs-designable ETM features a global robust event-separation property that is extremely required for practical lateral motion control of vehicle subject to diverse disturbances. Theoretical analysis proves the feasibility and stability of the proposed control strategy for trajectory tracking under bounded disturbances. Finally, simulation results verify the theoretical results and show the advantages of the proposed control strategy. ",

In this paper, we exploit the domain information present in computed tomography (CT) scans and propose a robust universal lesion detection (ULD) network that can detect lesions across all organs of the body by training on a single dataset, DeepLesion. We analyze CT-slices of varying intensities, generated using heuristically determined Hounsfield Unit(HU) windows that individually highlight different organs and are given as inputs to the deep network. The features obtained from the multiple intensity images are fused using a novel convolution augmented multi-head self-attention module and subsequently, passed to a Region Proposal Network (RPN) for lesion detection. In addition, we observed that traditional anchor boxes used in RPN for natural images are not suitable for lesion sizes often found in medical images. Therefore, we propose to use lesion-specific anchor sizes and ratios in the RPN for improving the detection performance. We use self-supervision to initialize weights of our network on the DeepLesion dataset to further imbibe domain knowledge. Our proposed Domain Knowledge augmented Multi-head Attention based Universal Lesion Detection Network DMKA-ULD produces refined and precise bounding boxes around lesions across different organs. We evaluate the efficacy of our network on the publicly available DeepLesion dataset which comprises of approximately 32K CT scans with annotated lesions across all organs of the body.

Additionally, they cannot fine-tune the model with an arbitrary set of electrocardiogram leads unless the models were pre-trained on the same set of leads. In this work, we propose an ECG pre-training method that learns both local and global contextual representations for better generalizability and performance on downstream tasks. In addition, we propose random lead masking as an ECG-specific augmentation method to make our proposed model robust to an arbitrary set of leads.

In addition, existing attacks are difficult to implement in reality due to the real-time of tracking and the re-initialization mechanism. To address these issues, we propose an offline universal adversarial attack called Efficient Universal Shuffle Attack. It takes only one perturbation to cause the tracker malfunction on all videos. To improve the computational efficiency and attack performance, we propose a greedy gradient strategy and a triple loss to efficiently capture and attack model-specific feature representations through the gradients.

In order to alleviate the negative impact of the suboptimum mixed-granularity annotation and long-tail effect problems, this paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Memory Learning (HML) framework to learn the model from simple to complex, which is similar to the human beings' hierarchical memory learning process. After the autonomous partition of coarse and fine predicates, the model is first trained on the coarse predicates and then learns the fine predicates. In order to realize this hierarchical learning pattern, this paper, for the first time, formulates the HML framework using the new Concept Reconstruction (CR) and Model Reconstruction (MR) constraints. It is worth noticing that the HML framework can be taken as one general optimization strategy to improve various SGG models, and significant improvement can be achieved on the SGG benchmark (i.e., Visual Genome).

We propose neural sparse linear solvers, a deep learning framework to learn approximate solvers for sparse symmetric linear systems. Our method relies on representing a sparse symmetric linear system as an undirected weighted graph. Such graph representation is inherently permutation-equivariant and scale-invariant, and it can become the input to a graph neural network trained to regress the solution. We test neural sparse linear solvers on static linear analysis problems from structural engineering. Our method is less accurate than classic algorithms, but it is hardware-independent, fast on GPUs, and applicable to generic sparse symmetric systems without any additional hypothesis. Although many limitations remain, this study shows a general approach to tackle problems involving sparse symmetric matrices using graph neural networks. ",

However, the success of popular SSL methods has limited on single-centric-object images like those in ImageNet and ignores the correlation among the scene and instances, as well as the semantic difference of instances in the scene. To address the above problems, we propose a Unified Self-supervised Visual Pre-training (UniVIP), a novel self-supervised framework to learn versatile visual representations on either single-centric-object or non-iconic dataset. The framework takes into account the representation learning at three levels: 1) the similarity of scene-scene, 2) the correlation of scene-instance, 3) the discrimination of instance-instance. During the learning, we adopt the optimal transport algorithm to automatically measure the discrimination of instances. Massive experiments show that UniVIP pre-trained on non-iconic COCO achieves state-of-the-art transfer performance on a variety of downstream tasks, such as image classification, semi-supervised learning, object detection and segmentation. Furthermore, our method can also exploit single-centric-object dataset such as ImageNet and outperforms BYOL by 2.5% with the same pre-training epochs in linear probing, and surpass current self-supervised object detection methods on COCO dataset, demonstrating its universality and potential.

Self-supervised denoisers, which learn only from single noisy images, solve the data collection problem. However, self-supervised denoising methods, especially blindspot-driven ones, suffer sizable information loss during input or network design. The absence of valuable information dramatically reduces the upper bound of denoising performance. In this paper, we propose a simple yet efficient approach called Blind2Unblind to overcome the information loss in blindspot-driven denoising methods. First, we introduce a global-aware mask mapper that enables global perception and accelerates training. The mask mapper samples all pixels at blind spots on denoised volumes and maps them to the same channel, allowing the loss function to optimize all blind spots at once. Second, we propose a re-visible loss to train the denoising network and make blind spots visible. The denoiser can learn directly from raw noise images without losing information or being trapped in identity mapping. We also theoretically analyze the convergence of the re-visible loss. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our approach compared to previous work.

    "abstract": "Contrastive learning between different views of the data achieves outstanding success in the field of self-supervised representation learning and the learned representations are useful in broad downstream tasks. Since all supervision information for one view comes from the other view, contrastive learning approximately obtains the minimal sufficient representation which contains the shared information and eliminates the non-shared information between views. Considering the diversity of the downstream tasks, it cannot be guaranteed that all task-relevant information is shared between views. Therefore, we assume the non-shared task-relevant information cannot be ignored and theoretically prove that the minimal sufficient representation in contrastive learning is not sufficient for the downstream tasks, which causes performance degradation. This reveals a new problem that the contrastive learning models have the risk of over-fitting to the shared information between views. To alleviate this problem, we propose to increase the mutual information between the representation and input as regularization to approximately introduce more task-relevant information, since we cannot utilize any downstream task information during training. Extensive experiments verify the rationality of our analysis and the effectiveness of our method. It significantly improves the performance of several classic contrastive learning models in downstream tasks. Our code is available at \\url{https://github.com/Haoqing-Wang/InfoCL}. ",

Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) show great promise in generating synthetic EHR data by learning underlying data distributions while achieving excellent performance and addressing these challenges. This work aims to review the major developments in various applications of GANs for EHRs and provides an overview of the proposed methodologies. For this purpose, we combine perspectives from healthcare applications and machine learning techniques in terms of source datasets and the fidelity and privacy evaluation of the generated synthetic datasets. We also compile a list of the metrics and datasets used by the reviewed works, which can be utilized as benchmarks for future research in the field. We conclude by discussing challenges in GANs for EHRs development and proposing recommended practices.

This work analyzes adversarial attacks from a different perspective.

We propose an algorithmic framework that leverages the advantages of the DNNs for data self-expression and task-specific predictions, to improve image classification. The framework jointly learns a DNN for attacking Variational Autoencoder (VAE) networks and a DNN for classification, coined as Attacking VAE for Improve Classification (AVIC).

In this work, we present SuperCone, our unified predicative segments system that addresses the above challenges. It builds on top of a flat concept representation that summarizes each user's heterogeneous digital footprints, and uniformly models each of the prediction task using an approach called \"super learning \", that is, combining prediction models with diverse architectures or learning method that are not compatible with each other or even completely unknown. Following this, we provide end to end deep learning architecture design that flexibly learns to attend to best suited heterogeneous experts while at the same time learns deep representations of the input concepts that augments the above experts by capturing unique signal. Experiments show that SuperCone can outperform state-of-the-art recommendation and ranking algorithms on a wide range of predicative segment tasks, as well as several public structured data learning benchmarks.

    "abstract": "Artificial Spiking Neural Networks (ASNNs) promise greater information processing efficiency because of discrete event-based (i.e., spike) computation. Several Machine Learning (ML) applications use biologically inspired plasticity mechanisms as unsupervised learning techniques to increase the robustness of ASNNs while preserving efficiency. Spike Time Dependent Plasticity (STDP) and Intrinsic Plasticity (IP) (i.e., dynamic spiking threshold adaptation) are two such mechanisms that have been combined to form an ensemble learning method. However, it is not clear how this ensemble learning should be regulated based on spiking activity. Moreover, previous studies have attempted threshold based synaptic pruning following STDP, to increase inference efficiency at the cost of performance in ASNNs. However, this type of structural adaptation, that employs individual weight mechanisms, does not consider spiking activity for pruning which is a better representation of input stimuli. We envisaged that plasticity-based spike-regulation and spike-based pruning will result in ASSNs that perform better in low resource situations. In this paper, a novel ensemble learning method based on entropy and network activation is introduced, which is amalgamated with a spike-rate neuron pruning technique, operated exclusively using spiking activity. Two electroencephalography (EEG) datasets are used as the input for classification experiments with a three-layer feed forward ASNN trained using one-pass learning. During the learning process, we observed neurons assembling into a hierarchy of clusters based on spiking rate. It was discovered that pruning lower spike-rate neuron clusters resulted in increased generalization or a predictable decline in performance. ",

First, we develop a state-feedback MPC scheme, based on input-state data, which guarantees closed-loop practical exponential stability and recursive feasibility as well as closed-loop constraint satisfaction. The scheme is extended by a suitable constraint tightening, which can also be constructed using only data. In order to control a priori unstable systems, the presented scheme contains a pre-stabilizing controller and an associated input constraint tightening. We first present the proposed data-driven MPC scheme for the case of full state measurements, and also provide extensions for obtaining similar closed-loop guarantees in case of output feedback.

    "abstract": "The knowledge of the users' electricity consumption pattern is an important coordinating mechanism between the utility company and the electricity consumers in terms of key decision makings. The load decomposition is therefore crucial to reveal the underlying relationship between the load consumption and its characteristics. However, load decomposition is conventionally performed on the residential and commercial loads, and adequate consideration has not been given to the high-energy-consuming industrial loads leading to inefficient results. This paper thus focuses on the load decomposition of the industrial park loads (IPL). The commonly used parameters in a conventional method are however inapplicable in high-energy-consuming industrial loads. Therefore, a more robust approach is developed comprising a three-algorithm model to achieve this goal on the IPL. First, the improved variational mode decomposition (IVMD) algorithm is introduced to denoise the training data of the IPL and improve its stability. Secondly, the convolutional neural network (CNN) and simple recurrent units (SRU) joint algorithms are used to achieve a non-intrusive and non-invasive decomposition process of the IPL using a double-layer deep learning network based on the IPL characteristics. Specifically, CNN is used to extract the IPL data characteristics while the improved long and short-term memory (LSTM) network, SRU, is adopted to develop the decomposition model and further train the load data. Through the robust decomposition process, the underlying relationship in the load consumption is extracted. The results obtained from the numerical examples show that this approach outperforms the state-of-the-art in the conventional decomposition process. ",

We compare the runtime of our approach against state-of-the-art verification algorithms for full-precision neural networks.

    "abstract": "The energy market relies on forecasting capabilities of both demand and power generation that need to be kept in dynamic balance. Today, when it comes to renewable energy generation, such decisions are increasingly made in a liberalized electricity market environment, where future power generation must be offered through contracts and auction mechanisms, hence based on forecasts. The increased share of highly intermittent power generation from renewable energy sources increases the uncertainty about the expected future power generation. Point forecast does not account for such uncertainties. To account for these uncertainties, it is possible to make probabilistic forecasts. This work first presents important concepts and approaches concerning probabilistic forecasts with deep learning. Then, deep learning models are used to make probabilistic forecasts of day-ahead power generation from a wind power plant located in Northern Norway. The performance in terms of obtained quality of the prediction intervals is compared for different deep learning models and sets of covariates. The findings show that the accuracy of the predictions improves when historical data on measured weather and numerical weather predictions (NWPs) were included as exogenous variables. This allows the model to auto-correct systematic biases in the NWPs using the historical measurement data. Using only NWPs, or only measured weather as exogenous variables, worse prediction performances were obtained. ",

Hence, for city planners, the crucial question is where to place charging stations so that they reach a large utilization. Here, we hypothesize that the utilization of EV charging stations is driven by the proximity to points-of-interest (POIs), as EV owners have a certain limited willingness to walk between charging stations and POIs. To address our research question, we propose the use of web mining: we characterize the influence of different POIs from OpenStreetMap on the utilization of charging stations. For this, we present a tailored interpretable model that takes into account the full spatial distributions of both the POIs and the charging stations. This allows us then to estimate the distance and magnitude of the influence of different POI types. We evaluate our model with data from approx. 300 charging stations and 4,000 POIs in Amsterdam, Netherlands. Our model achieves a superior performance over state-of-the-art baselines and, on top of that, is able to offer an unmatched level of interpretability. To the best of our knowledge, no previous paper has quantified the POI influence on charging station utilization from real-world usage data by estimating the spatial proximity in which POIs are relevant. As such, our findings help city planners in identifying effective locations for charging stations. ",

Recently, many methods have been developed to detect human activities with varying degree of success. Yet, the general human activity detection problem remains very challenging, especially when the methods need to work 'in the wild' (e.g., without having precise control over the imaging geometry). The thesis explores phase-based solutions for (i) detecting faces, (ii) back of the heads, (iii) joint detection of faces and back of the heads, and (iv) whether the head is looking to the left or the right, using standard video cameras without any control on the imaging geometry. The proposed phase-based approach is based on the development of simple and robust methods that rely on the use of Amplitude Modulation- Frequency Modulation (AM-FM) models. The approach is validated using video frames extracted from the Advancing Out-of-school Learning in Mathematics and Engineering (AOLME) project. The dataset consisted of 13,265 images from ten students looking at the camera, and 6,122 images from five students looking away from the camera. For the students facing the camera, the method was able to correctly classify 97.1% of them looking to the left and 95.9% of them looking to the right. For the students facing the back of the camera, the method was able to correctly classify 87.6% of them looking to the left and 93.3% of them looking to the right. The results indicate that AM-FM based methods hold great promise for analyzing human activity videos. ",

    "abstract": "Trajectory prediction has gained great attention and significant progress has been made in recent years. However, most works rely on a key assumption that each video is successfully preprocessed by detection and tracking algorithms and the complete observed trajectory is always available. However, in complex real-world environments, we often encounter miss-detection of target agents (e.g., pedestrian, vehicles) caused by the bad image conditions, such as the occlusion by other agents. In this paper, we address the problem of trajectory prediction from incomplete observed trajectory due to miss-detection, where the observed trajectory includes several missing data points. We introduce a two-block RNN model that approximates the inference steps of the Bayesian filtering framework and seeks the optimal estimation of the hidden state when miss-detection occurs. The model uses two RNNs depending on the detection result. One RNN approximates the inference step of the Bayesian filter with the new measurement when the detection succeeds, while the other does the approximation when the detection fails. Our experiments show that the proposed model improves the prediction accuracy compared to the three baseline imputation methods on publicly available datasets: ETH and UCY ($9\\%$ and $7\\%$ improvement on the ADE and FDE metrics). We also show that our proposed method can achieve better prediction compared to the baselines when there is no miss-detection. ",

    "abstract": "An actuator is a device that converts electricity into another form of energy, typically physical movement. They are absolutely essential for any system that needs to impact or modify the physical world, and are used in millions of systems of all sizes, all over the world, from cars and spacecraft to factory control systems and critical infrastructure. An actuator is a \"dumb device\" that is entirely controlled by the surrounding electronics, e.g., a microcontroller, and thus cannot authenticate its control signals or do any other form of processing. The problem we look at in this paper is how the wires that connect an actuator to its control electronics can act like antennas, picking up electromagnetic signals from the environment. This makes it possible for a remote attacker to wirelessly inject signals (energy) into these wires to bypass the controller and directly control the actuator. To detect such attacks, we propose a novel detection method that allows the microcontroller to monitor the control signal and detect attacks as a deviation from the intended value. We have managed to do this without requiring the microcontroller to sample the signal at a high rate or run any signal processing. That makes our defense mechanism practical and easy to integrate into existing systems. Our method is general and applies to any type of actuator (provided a few basic assumptions are met), and can deal with adversaries with arbitrarily high transmission power. We implement our detection method on two different practical systems to show its generality, effectiveness, and robustness. ",

This paper first studies the interaction paradigm in depth, where we find that its computation can be split into two terms, the interaction contents at different granularity and the matching function to distinguish pairs with the same semantics. We also observe that the single-vector representation and implicit intensive function substantially hinder the optimization. Based on these findings, we propose a disentangled framework to capture a sequential and hierarchical representation. Firstly, considering the natural sequential structure in both text and video inputs, a Weighted Token-wise Interaction (WTI) module is performed to decouple the content and adaptively exploit the pair-wise correlations. This interaction can form a better disentangled manifold for sequential inputs. Secondly, we introduce a Channel DeCorrelation Regularization (CDCR) to minimize the redundancy between the components of the compared vectors, which facilitate learning a hierarchical representation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the disentangled representation on various benchmarks, e.g., surpassing CLIP4Clip largely by +2.9%, +3.1%, +7.9%, +2.3%, +2.8% and +6.5% R@1 on the MSR-VTT, MSVD, VATEX, LSMDC, AcitivityNet, and DiDeMo, respectively.

    "abstract": "Temporal representation is the cornerstone of modern action detection techniques. State-of-the-art methods mostly rely on a dense anchoring scheme, where anchors are sampled uniformly over the temporal domain with a discretized grid, and then regress the accurate boundaries. In this paper, we revisit this foundational stage and introduce Recurrent Continuous Localization (RCL), which learns a fully continuous anchoring representation. Specifically, the proposed representation builds upon an explicit model conditioned with video embeddings and temporal coordinates, which ensure the capability of detecting segments with arbitrary length. To optimize the continuous representation, we develop an effective scale-invariant sampling strategy and recurrently refine the prediction in subsequent iterations. Our continuous anchoring scheme is fully differentiable, allowing to be seamlessly integrated into existing detectors, e.g., BMN and G-TAD. Extensive experiments on two benchmarks demonstrate that our continuous representation steadily surpasses other discretized counterparts by ~2% mAP. As a result, RCL achieves 52.92% mAP@0.5 on THUMOS14 and 37.65% mAP on ActivtiyNet v1.3, outperforming all existing single-model detectors. ",

    "title": "Neural Message Passing for Objective-Based Uncertainty Quantification  and Optimal Experimental Design",
    "abstract": "Real-world scientific or engineering applications often involve mathematical modeling of complex uncertain systems with a large number of unknown parameters. The complexity of such systems, and the enormous uncertainties therein, typically make accurate model identification from the available data infeasible. In such cases, it is desirable to represent the model uncertainty in a Bayesian paradigm, based on which we can design robust operators that maintain the best overall performance across all possible models and design optimal experiments that can effectively reduce uncertainty to maximally enhance the performance of such operators. While objective-based uncertainty quantification (objective-UQ) based on MOCU (mean objective cost of uncertainty) has been shown to provide effective means for quantifying and handling uncertainty in complex systems, a major drawback has been the high computational cost of estimating MOCU. In this work, we demonstrate for the first time that one can design accurate surrogate models for efficient objective-UQ via MOCU based on a data-driven approach. We adopt a neural message passing model for surrogate modeling, which incorporates a novel axiomatic constraint loss that penalizes an increase in the estimated system uncertainty. As an illustrative example, we consider the optimal experimental design (OED) problem for uncertain Kuramoto models, where the goal is to predict the experiments that can most effectively enhance the robust synchronization performance through uncertainty reduction. Through quantitative performance assessment, we show that our proposed approach can accelerate MOCU-based OED by four to five orders of magnitude, virtually without any visible loss of performance compared to the previous state-of-the-art. The proposed approach can be applied to general OED tasks, beyond the Kuramoto model. ",

    "abstract": "Biomedical research is increasingly employing real world evidence (RWE) to foster discoveries of novel clinical phenotypes and to better characterize long term effect of medical treatments. However, due to limitations inherent in the collection process, RWE often lacks key features of patients, particularly when these features cannot be directly encoded using data standards such as ICD-10. Here we propose a novel data-driven statistical machine learning approach, named Feature Imputation via Local Likelihood (FILL), designed to infer missing features by exploiting feature similarity between patients. We test our method using a particularly challenging problem: differentiating heart failure patients with reduced versus preserved ejection fraction (HFrEF and HFpEF respectively). The complexity of the task stems from three aspects: the two share many common characteristics and treatments, only part of the relevant diagnoses may have been recorded, and the information on ejection fraction is often missing from RWE datasets. Despite these difficulties, our method is shown to be capable of inferring heart failure patients with HFpEF with a precision above 80% when considering multiple scenarios across two RWE datasets containing 11,950 and 10,051 heart failure patients. This is an improvement when compared to classical approaches such as logistic regression and random forest which were only able to achieve a precision < 73%. Finally, this approach allows us to analyse which features are commonly associated with HFpEF patients. For example, we found that specific diagnostic codes for atrial fibrillation and personal history of long-term use of anticoagulants are often key in identifying HFpEF patients. ",

In this study, we investigate the effect of the amplitude and phase spectra of adversarial images on the robustness of CNN classifiers. Extensive experiments revealed that the images generated by combining the amplitude spectrum of adversarial images and the phase spectrum of clean images accommodates moderate and general perturbations, and training with these images equips a CNN classifier with more general robustness, performing well under both common corruptions and adversarial perturbations. We also found that two types of overfitting (catastrophic overfitting and robust overfitting) can be circumvented by the aforementioned spectrum recombination.

It is shown that in dynamic stochastic systems, filtering, which corresponds to marginalization of past variables, results in direct and hidden dependencies between variables not mutually monitored by the robots, which might lead to an overconfident fused estimate. The paper makes both theoretical and practical contributions by providing (i) a rigorous analysis of the origin of the dependencies and and (ii) a conservative filtering algorithm for heterogeneous data fusion in dynamic systems that can be integrated with existing fusion algorithms. This work uses factor graphs as an analysis tool and an inference engine. Each robot in the network maintains a local factor graph and communicates only relevant parts of it (a sub-graph) to its neighboring robot. We discuss the applicability to various multi-robot robotic applications and demonstrate the performance using a multi-robot multi-target tracking simulation, showing that the proposed algorithm produces conservative estimates at each robot.

Subsequently, we created and made publicly available a dataset for the detection of in-water plastic bags and bottles and trained our improved EfficientDets on this and another dataset for marine debris detection. Finally, we investigated how the detector performance is affected by low-light conditions and compared two low-light underwater image enhancement strategies both in terms of accuracy and latency.

Recently, some works have shown that robustness against adversarial attacks can also be distilled effectively to achieve good rates of robustness on mobile-friendly models. In this work, however, we take a different point of view, and show that knowledge distillation can be used directly to boost the performance of state-of-the-art models in adversarial robustness. In this sense, we present a thorough analysis and provide general guidelines to distill knowledge from a robust teacher and boost the clean and adversarial performance of a student model even further. To that end, we present Adversarial Knowledge Distillation (AKD), a new framework to improve a model's robust performance, consisting on adversarially training a student on a mixture of the original labels and the teacher outputs. Through carefully controlled ablation studies, we show that using early-stopping, model ensembles and weak adversarial training are key techniques to maximize performance of the student, and show that these insights generalize across different robust distillation techniques. Finally, we provide insights on the effect of robust knowledge distillation on the dynamics of the student network, and show that AKD mostly improves the calibration of the network and modify its training dynamics on samples that the model finds difficult to learn, or even memorize.

Compared with recent approaches that approximate scene lightings as the 2D environment map, NeILF is a fully 5D light field that is capable of modelling illuminations of any static scenes. In addition, occlusions and indirect lights can be handled naturally by the NeILF representation without requiring multiple bounces of ray tracing, making it possible to estimate material properties even for scenes with complex lightings and geometries. We also propose a smoothness regularization and a Lambertian assumption to reduce the material-lighting ambiguity during the optimization. Our method strictly follows the physically-based rendering equation, and jointly optimizes material and lighting through the differentiable rendering process. We have intensively evaluated the proposed method on our in-house synthetic dataset, the DTU MVS dataset, and real-world BlendedMVS scenes.

    "abstract": "With the rapid advances of autonomous driving, it becomes critical to equip its sensing system with more holistic 3D perception. However, existing works focus on parsing either the objects (e.g. cars and pedestrians) or scenes (e.g. trees and buildings) from the LiDAR sensor. In this work, we address the task of LiDAR-based panoptic segmentation, which aims to parse both objects and scenes in a unified manner. As one of the first endeavors towards this new challenging task, we propose the Dynamic Shifting Network (DS-Net), which serves as an effective panoptic segmentation framework in the point cloud realm. In particular, DS-Net has three appealing properties: 1) Strong backbone design. DS-Net adopts the cylinder convolution that is specifically designed for LiDAR point clouds. 2) Dynamic Shifting for complex point distributions. We observe that commonly-used clustering algorithms are incapable of handling complex autonomous driving scenes with non-uniform point cloud distributions and varying instance sizes. Thus, we present an efficient learnable clustering module, dynamic shifting, which adapts kernel functions on the fly for different instances. 3) Extension to 4D prediction. Furthermore, we extend DS-Net to 4D panoptic LiDAR segmentation by the temporally unified instance clustering on aligned LiDAR frames. To comprehensively evaluate the performance of LiDAR-based panoptic segmentation, we construct and curate benchmarks from two large-scale autonomous driving LiDAR datasets, SemanticKITTI and nuScenes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed DS-Net achieves superior accuracies over current state-of-the-art methods in both tasks. Notably, in the single frame version of the task, we outperform the SOTA method by 1.8% in terms of the PQ metric. In the 4D version of the task, we surpass 2nd place by 5.4% in terms of the LSTQ metric. ",

    "abstract": "The olive oil sector produces a substantial impact in the Mediterranean's economy and lifestyle. Many studies exist which try to optimize the different steps in the olive oil's production process. One of the main challenges for olive oil producers is the ability to asses and control the quality during the production cycle. For this purpose, several parameters need to be determined, such as the acidity, the UV absorption or the ethyl esters content. To achieve this, samples must be sent to an approved laboratory for chemical analysis. This approach is expensive and cannot be performed very frequently, making quality control of olive oil a real challenge. This work explores a new approach based on fluorescence spectroscopy and artificial intelligence (namely, 1-D convolutional neural networks) to predict the five chemical quality indicators of olive oil (acidity, peroxide value, UV spectroscopic parameters $K_{270}$ and $K_{232}$, and ethyl esters) from simple fluorescence spectra. Fluorescence spectroscopy is a very attractive optical technique since it does not require sample preparation, is non destructive, and, as shown in this work, can be easily implemented in small and cost-effective sensors. The results indicate that the proposed approach gives exceptional results in the quality determination and would make the continuous quality control of olive oil during and after the production process a reality. Additionally, this novel methodology presents potential applications as a support for quality specifications of olive oil, as defined by the European regulation. ",

We propose a framework for designing generative models for continuous time temporal networks. Assuming a first order Markov assumption on the edge-specific temporal point processes enables us to flexibly apply survival analysis models directly on the waiting time between events, while using time-varying history-based features as covariates for these predictions. This approach links the well-documented field of temporal networks analysis through multivariate point processes, with methodological tools adapted from survival analysis. We propose a fitting method for models within this framework, and an algorithm for simulating new temporal networks having desired properties.

The evaluation is performed with both digital patches added to the input images and printed patches positioned in the real world. The obtained results confirm that Z-Mask outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in terms of both detection accuracy and overall performance of the networks under attack.

    "abstract": "We propose a new video camouflaged object detection (VCOD) framework that can exploit both short-term dynamics and long-term temporal consistency to detect camouflaged objects from video frames. An essential property of camouflaged objects is that they usually exhibit patterns similar to the background and thus make them hard to identify from still images. Therefore, effectively handling temporal dynamics in videos becomes the key for the VCOD task as the camouflaged objects will be noticeable when they move. However, current VCOD methods often leverage homography or optical flows to represent motions, where the detection error may accumulate from both the motion estimation error and the segmentation error. On the other hand, our method unifies motion estimation and object segmentation within a single optimization framework. Specifically, we build a dense correlation volume to implicitly capture motions between neighbouring frames and utilize the final segmentation supervision to optimize the implicit motion estimation and segmentation jointly. Furthermore, to enforce temporal consistency within a video sequence, we jointly utilize a spatio-temporal transformer to refine the short-term predictions.

    "abstract": "Medical ultrasound (US) is one of the most widely used imaging modalities in clinical practice. However, its use presents unique challenges such as variable imaging quality. Deep learning (DL) can be used as an advanced medical US images analysis tool, while the performance of the DL model is greatly limited by the scarcity of big datasets. Here, we develop semi-supervised classification enhancement (SSCE) structures by constructing seven convolutional neural network (CNN) models and one of the most state-of-the-art generative adversarial network (GAN) models, StyleGAN2-ADA, to address this problem. A breast cancer dataset with 780 images is used as our base dataset. The results show that our SSCE structures obtain an accuracy of up to 97.9%, showing a maximum 21.6% improvement compared with utilizing CNN models alone and outperforming the previous methods using the same dataset by up to 23.9%. We believe our proposed state-of-the-art method can be regarded as a potential auxiliary tool for on-the-fly diagnoses of medical US images. ",

    "abstract": "Due to the high cost of manually annotating medical images, especially for large-scale datasets, anomaly detection has been explored through training models with only normal data. Lacking prior knowledge of true anomalies is the main reason for the limited application of previous anomaly detection methods, especially in the medical image analysis realm. In this work, we propose a one-shot anomaly detection framework, namely LesionPaste, that utilizes true anomalies from a single annotated sample and synthesizes artificial anomalous samples for anomaly detection. First, a lesion bank is constructed by applying augmentation to randomly selected lesion patches. Then, MixUp is adopted to paste patches from the lesion bank at random positions in normal images to synthesize anomalous samples for training. Finally, a classification network is trained using the synthetic abnormal samples and the true normal data. Extensive experiments are conducted on two publicly-available medical image datasets with different types of abnormalities. On both datasets, our proposed LesionPaste largely outperforms several state-of-the-art unsupervised and semi-supervised anomaly detection methods, and is on a par with the fully-supervised counterpart. To note, LesionPaste is even better than the fully-supervised method in detecting early-stage diabetic retinopathy. ",

First, we employ inner-recurrence module (IRM) to manage the long-ranged dependency in a sequence. IRM learns to keep track of the cell memory and provides complementary information to find the deblurred frames. Second, we adopt an attention-based temporal blending strategy to extract the necessary part of the information in the local neighborhood. The adpative temporal blending (ATB) can either attenuate or amplify the features by the spatial attention. Our extensive experimental results and analysis validate the effectiveness of IRM and ATB on various RNN architectures. ",

GATSBI reformulates the variational objective in an adversarial setting to learn implicit posterior distributions. Inference with GATSBI is amortised across observations, works in high-dimensional posterior spaces and supports implicit priors. We evaluate GATSBI on two SBI benchmark problems and on two high-dimensional simulators. On a model for wave propagation on the surface of a shallow water body, we show that GATSBI can return well-calibrated posterior estimates even in high dimensions. On a model of camera optics, it infers a high-dimensional posterior given an implicit prior, and performs better than a state-of-the-art SBI approach. We also show how GATSBI can be extended to perform sequential posterior estimation to focus on individual observations. Overall, GATSBI opens up opportunities for leveraging advances in GANs to perform Bayesian inference on high-dimensional simulation-based models. ",

    "abstract": "Benefited from the rapid and sustainable development of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) sensors, change detection from SAR images has received increasing attentions over the past few years. Existing unsupervised deep learning-based methods have made great efforts to exploit robust feature representations, but they consume much time to optimize parameters. Besides, these methods use clustering to obtain pseudo-labels for training, and the pseudo-labeled samples often involve errors, which can be considered as \"label noise\". To address these issues, we propose a Dual Path Denoising Network (DPDNet) for SAR image change detection. In particular, we introduce the random label propagation to clean the label noise involved in preclassification. We also propose the distinctive patch convolution for feature representation learning to reduce the time consumption. Specifically, the attention mechanism is used to select distinctive pixels in the feature maps, and patches around these pixels are selected as convolution kernels. Consequently, the DPDNet does not require a great number of training samples for parameter optimization, and its computational efficiency is greatly enhanced. Extensive experiments have been conducted on five SAR datasets to verify the proposed DPDNet. The experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms several state-of-the-art methods in change detection results. ",

    "abstract": "Contrast-enhanced T1 (T1ce) is one of the most essential magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) modalities for diagnosing and analyzing brain tumors, especially gliomas. In clinical practice, common MRI modalities such as T1, T2, and fluid attenuation inversion recovery are relatively easy to access while T1ce is more challenging considering the additional cost and potential risk of allergies to the contrast agent. Therefore, it is of great clinical necessity to develop a method to synthesize T1ce from other common modalities. Current paired image translation methods typically have the issue of requiring a large amount of paired data and do not focus on specific regions of interest, e.g., the tumor region, in the synthesization process. To address these issues, we propose a Difficulty-perceived common-to-T1ce Semi-Supervised multimodal MRI Synthesis network (DS3-Net), involving both paired and unpaired data together with dual-level knowledge distillation. DS3-Net predicts a difficulty map to progressively promote the synthesis task. Specifically, a pixelwise constraint and a patchwise contrastive constraint are guided by the predicted difficulty map. Through extensive experiments on the publiclyavailable BraTS2020 dataset, DS3-Net outperforms its supervised counterpart in each respect. Furthermore, with only 5% paired data, the proposed DS3-Net achieves competitive performance with state-of-theart image translation methods utilizing 100% paired data, delivering an average SSIM of 0.8947 and an average PSNR of 23.60.

A significant limitation of the GPCM is that it assumes a rapidly decaying spectrum: it can only model smooth signals. Moreover, inference in the GPCM currently requires (1) a mean-field assumption, resulting in poorly calibrated uncertainties, and (2) a tedious variational optimisation of large covariance matrices. We redesign the GPCM model to induce a richer distribution over the spectrum with relaxed assumptions about smoothness: the Causal Gaussian Process Convolution Model (CGPCM) introduces a causality assumption into the GPCM, and the Rough Gaussian Process Convolution Model (RGPCM) can be interpreted as a Bayesian nonparametric generalisation of the fractional Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. We also propose a more effective variational inference scheme, going beyond the mean-field assumption: we design a Gibbs sampler which directly samples from the optimal variational solution, circumventing any variational optimisation entirely. The proposed variations of the GPCM are validated in experiments on synthetic and real-world data, showing promising results. ",

Here, we use Forman-Ricci curvature applied on climate networks constructed from 2-meter air temperature data to distinguish regional links from teleconnections. Our results confirm that teleconnection patterns are strongly influenced by the El Ni\\~no type. EP events have primarily tropical teleconnections whereas CP events involve tropical-extratropical connections, particularly in the Pacific.

In the process, it is discovered that, interestingly, the influence of the combination policy on the transient behavior is insignificant, and thus it is more critical to employ policies that enhance the steady-state performance.

The current theoretical understanding behind the occurrence of this phenomenon is primarily based on linear and kernel regression models -- with informal parallels to neural networks via the Neural Tangent Kernel. Therefore such analyses do not adequately capture the mechanisms behind double descent in finite-width neural networks, as well as, disregard crucial components -- such as the choice of the loss function. We address these shortcomings by leveraging influence functions in order to derive suitable expressions of the population loss and its lower bound, while imposing minimal assumptions on the form of the parametric model. Our derived bounds bear an intimate connection with the spectrum of the Hessian at the optimum, and importantly, exhibit a double descent behaviour at the interpolation threshold. Building on our analysis, we further investigate how the loss function affects double descent -- and thus uncover interesting properties of neural networks and their Hessian spectra near the interpolation threshold.
