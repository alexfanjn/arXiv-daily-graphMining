    "abstract": "Robots often face situations where grasping a goal object is desirable but not feasible due to other present objects preventing the grasp action. We present a deep Reinforcement Learning approach to learn grasping and pushing policies for manipulating a goal object in highly cluttered environments to address this problem. In particular, a dual reinforcement learning model approach is proposed, which presents high resilience in handling complicated scenes, reaching 98% task completion using primitive objects in a simulation environment. To evaluate the performance of the proposed approach, we performed two extensive sets of experiments in packed objects and a pile of objects scenarios. Experimental results showed that the proposed method worked very well in both scenarios and outperformed the recent state-of-the-art approaches ",

    "abstract": "Network Function (NF) deployments on commodity servers have become ubiquitous in datacenters and enterprise settings. Many commonly used NFs such as firewalls, load balancers and NATs are shallow - i.e., they only examine the packet's header, despite the entire packet being transferred on and off the server. As a result, the gap between moved and inspected data when handling large packets exceeds 20x. At modern network rates, such excess data movement is detrimental to performance, hurting both the average and 90% tail latency of large packets by up to 1.7x. Our thorough performance analysis identifies high contention on the NIC-server PCIe interface and in the server's memory hierarchy as the main bottlenecks. We introduce NFSlicer, a data movement optimization implemented as a NIC extension to mitigate the bottlenecks stemming from data movement deluge in deployments of shallow NFs on commodity servers. NFSlicer only transfers the small portion of each packet that the deployed NFs actually inspect, by slicing the packet's payload and temporarily storing it in on-NIC memory. When the server later transmits the processed packet, NFSlicer splices it to its previously sliced payload. We develop a software-based emulation platform and demonstrate that NFSlicer effectively minimizes data movement between the NIC and the server, bridging the latency gap between small and large packet NF processing. On a range of shallow NFs handling 1518B packets, NFSlicer reduces average and 90% tail latency by up to 17% / 29%, respectively. ",

    "abstract": "Network Function Virtualization (NFV) has emerged as a disruptive networking architecture whose galloping evolution is prompting enterprises to outsource network functions to the cloud and ultimately harvest the fruits of cloud computing, including elasticity, pay-as-you-go billing model, and on-demand services provisioning. However, many reluctant enterprises oppose the benefits of this outsourcing to their critical and pressing concerns about security, trust, and compliance. The latter anticipate possible security and QoS policy violations stemming from dishonest behaviors by cloud providers, attacks by co-resident competitors, misconfiguration by cloud administrators, or implementations flaws by NFV developers. As a result, migrating sensitive workloads to the cloud requires enterprises to first assess risks by gaining knowledge of possible network services' anomalies and second, to build trust in the cloud by designing effective mechanisms to detect such anomalies. This survey provides scrutiny of network services anomalies that may occur in the NFV environments. We first present a taxonomy of network service anomalies and analyze their negative impacts on critical service attributes, including security and performance. Second, we compare and classify the existing anomalies' verification mechanisms from the literature. Finally, we point out the literature gap and identify future research directions for anomalies verification in NFV. ",

    "abstract": "Recently, the EAGL-I system was developed to rapidly create massive labeled datasets of plants intended to be commonly used by farmers and researchers to create AI-driven solutions in agriculture. As a result, a publicly available plant species recognition dataset composed of 40,000 images with different sizes consisting of 8 plant species was created with the system in order to demonstrate its capabilities. This paper proposes a novel method, called Variably Overlapping Time-Coherent Sliding Window (VOTCSW), that transforms a dataset composed of images with variable size to a 3D representation with fixed size that is suitable for convolutional neural networks, and demonstrates that this representation is more informative than resizing the images of the dataset to a given size. We theoretically formalized the use cases of the method as well as its inherent properties and we proved that it has an oversampling and a regularization effect on the data. By combining the VOTCSW method with the 3D extension of a recently proposed machine learning model called 1-Dimensional Polynomial Neural Networks, we were able to create a model that achieved a state-of-the-art accuracy of 99.9% on the dataset created by the EAGL-I system, surpassing well-known architectures such as ResNet and Inception. In addition, we created a heuristic algorithm that enables the degree reduction of any pre-trained N-Dimensional Polynomial Neural Network and which compresses it without altering its performance, thus making the model faster and lighter. Furthermore, we established that the currently available dataset could not be used for machine learning in its present form, due to a substantial class imbalance between the training set and the test set. Hence, we created a specific preprocessing and a model development framework that enabled us to improve the accuracy from 49.23% to 99.9%. ",

    "abstract": "A rising problem in the compression of Deep Neural Networks is how to reduce the number of parameters in convolutional kernels and the complexity of these layers by low-rank tensor approximation. Canonical polyadic tensor decomposition (CPD) and Tucker tensor decomposition (TKD) are two solutions to this problem and provide promising results. However, CPD often fails due to degeneracy, making the networks unstable and hard to fine-tune. TKD does not provide much compression if the core tensor is big. This motivates using a hybrid model of CPD and TKD, a decomposition with multiple Tucker models with small core tensor, known as block term decomposition (BTD). This paper proposes a more compact model that further compresses the BTD by enforcing core tensors in BTD identical. We establish a link between the BTD with shared parameters and a looped chain tensor network (TC). Unfortunately, such strongly constrained tensor networks (with loop) encounter severe numerical instability, as proved by y (Landsberg, 2012) and (Handschuh, 2015a). We study perturbation of chain tensor networks, provide interpretation of instability in TC, demonstrate the problem. We propose novel methods to gain the stability of the decomposition results, keep the network robust and attain better approximation. Experimental results will confirm the superiority of the proposed methods in compression of well-known CNNs, and TC decomposition under challenging scenarios ",

We obtain reasonable results on the AIFB, MUTAG and AM datasets.

To further improve audio-visual speech separation, the dense optical flow of lip motion is incorporated to strengthen the robustness of visual representation. The evaluation of the proposed work is performed on two public audio-visual speech separation benchmark datasets. The overall improvement of the performance has demonstrated that the additional motion network effectively enhances the visual representation of the combined lip images and audio signal, as well as outperforming the baseline in terms of all metrics with the proposed cross-modal fusion.

Real-world networks are usually with multiplex or having multi-view representations from different relations. Recently, there has been increasing interest in network embedding on multiplex data. However, most existing multiplex approaches assume that the data is complete in all views. But in real applications, it is often the case that each view suffers from the missing of some data and therefore results in partial multiplex data. In this paper, we present a novel Deep Partial Multiplex Network Embedding approach to deal with incomplete data. In particular, the network embeddings are learned by simultaneously minimizing the deep reconstruction loss with the autoencoder neural network, enforcing the data consistency across views via common latent subspace learning, and preserving the data topological structure within the same network through graph Laplacian. We further prove the orthogonal invariant property of the learned embeddings and connect our approach with the binary embedding techniques. Experiments on four multiplex benchmarks demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed approach over several state-of-the-art methods on node classification, link prediction and clustering tasks.

    "abstract": "The use of FPGAs for efficient graph processing has attracted significant interest. Recent memory subsystem upgrades including the introduction of HBM in FPGAs promise to further alleviate memory bottlenecks. However, modern multi-channel HBM requires much more processing pipelines to fully utilize its bandwidth potential. Existing designs do not scale well, resulting in underutilization of the HBM facilities even when all other resources are fully consumed. In this paper, we re-examined the graph processing workloads and found much diversity in processing. We also found that the diverse workloads can be easily classified into two types, namely dense and sparse partitions. This motivates us to propose a resource-efficient heterogeneous pipeline architecture. Our heterogeneous architecture comprises of two types of pipelines: Little pipelines to process dense partitions with good locality and Big pipelines to process sparse partitions with the extremely poor locality. Unlike traditional monolithic pipeline designs, the heterogeneous pipelines are tailored for more specific memory access patterns, and hence are more lightweight, allowing the architecture to scale up to more effectively with limited resources. In addition, we propose a model-guided task scheduling method that schedules partitions to the right pipeline types, generates the most efficient pipeline combination and balances workloads. Furthermore, we develop an automated open-source framework, called ReGraph, which automates the entire development process. ReGraph outperforms state-of-the-art FPGA accelerators by up to 5.9 times in terms of performance and 12times in terms of resource efficiency. ",

To combine the advantages of two vocoders, inspired by the traditional deterministic plus stochastic model, this paper proposes a novel neural vocoder named NeuralDPS which can retain high speech quality and acquire high synthesis efficiency and noise controllability. Firstly, this framework contains four modules: a deterministic source module, a stochastic source module, a neural V/UV decision module and a neural filter module. The input required by the vocoder is just the spectral parameter, which avoids the error caused by estimating additional parameters, such as F0. Secondly, to solve the problem that different frequency bands may have different proportions of deterministic components and stochastic components, a multiband excitation strategy is used to generate a more accurate excitation signal and reduce the neural filter's burden. Thirdly, a method to control noise components of speech is proposed. In this way, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of speech can be adjusted easily. Objective and subjective experimental results show that our proposed NeuralDPS vocoder can obtain similar performance with the WaveNet and it generates waveforms at least 280 times faster than the WaveNet vocoder. It is also 28% faster than WaveGAN's synthesis efficiency on a single CPU core. We have also verified through experiments that this method can effectively control the noise components in the predicted speech and adjust the SNR of speech.

    "abstract": "Cloud computing has been regarded as a successful paradigm for IT industry by providing benefits for both service providers and customers. In spite of the advantages, cloud computing also suffers from distinct challenges, and one of them is the inefficient resource provisioning for dynamic workloads. Accurate workload predictions for cloud computing can support efficient resource provisioning and avoid resource wastage. However, due to the high-dimensional and high-variable features of cloud workloads, it is difficult to predict the workloads effectively and accurately. The current dominant work for cloud workload prediction is based on regression approaches or recurrent neural networks, which fail to capture the long-term variance of workloads. To address the challenges and overcome the limitations of existing works, we proposed an efficient supervised learning-based Deep Neural Network (esDNN}) approach for cloud workload prediction. Firstly, we utilize a sliding window to convert the multivariate data into supervised learning time series that allow deep learning for processing. Then we apply a revised Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) to achieve accurate prediction. To show the effectiveness of esDNN, we also conduct comprehensive experiments based on realistic traces derived from Alibaba and Google cloud data centers. The experimental results demonstrate that esDNN can accurately and efficiently predict cloud workloads. Compared with the state-of-the-art baselines, esDNN can reduce the mean square errors significantly, e.g. 15% than the approach using GRU only. We also apply esDNN for machines auto-scaling, which illustrates that esDNN can reduce the number of active hosts efficiently, thus the costs of service providers can be optimized. ",

    "abstract": "The recently proposed camouflaged object detection (COD) attempts to segment objects that are visually blended into their surroundings, which is extremely complex and difficult in real-world scenarios. Apart from high intrinsic similarity between the camouflaged objects and their background, the objects are usually diverse in scale, fuzzy in appearance, and even severely occluded. To deal with these problems, we propose a mixed-scale triplet network, \\textbf{ZoomNet}, which mimics the behavior of humans when observing vague images, i.e., zooming in and out. Specifically, our ZoomNet employs the zoom strategy to learn the discriminative mixed-scale semantics by the designed scale integration unit and hierarchical mixed-scale unit, which fully explores imperceptible clues between the candidate objects and background surroundings. Moreover, considering the uncertainty and ambiguity derived from indistinguishable textures, we construct a simple yet effective regularization constraint, uncertainty-aware loss, to promote the model to accurately produce predictions with higher confidence in candidate regions. Without bells and whistles, our proposed highly task-friendly model consistently surpasses the existing 23 state-of-the-art methods on four public datasets. Besides, the superior performance over the recent cutting-edge models on the SOD task also verifies the effectiveness and generality of our model.

    "title": "DroidRL: Reinforcement Learning Driven Feature Selection for Android  Malware Detection",
    "abstract": "Due to the completely open-source nature of Android, the exploitable vulnerability of malware attacks is increasing. Machine learning has led to a great evolution in Android malware detection in recent years, which is typically applied in the classification phase. Applying neural networks to feature selection phase is another topic worth investigating, while the correlation between features could be ignored in some traditional ranking-based feature selection algorithms. And it is time-consuming for exploring all possible valid feature subsets when processing a large number of Android features using a wrapper-based approach. Attempting to tackle the problem of computational expense and the vulnerability of the syntax integrity of multi-source data, this paper proposed the DroidRL framework. The main idea is to apply Double DQN(DDQN) algorithm to select a subset of features that can be effectively used for malware classification. To select a better subset of features over a larger range, the exploration-exploitation policy is applied in the model training phase. The RNN is used as the decision network of DDQN to give the framework the ability to sequentially select features. Word embedding is applied for feature representation to enhance the framework's ability to find the semantic relevance of features. On one hand, The framework's feature selection exhibits high performance without any human intervention. On the other hand, the proposed framework can easily be ported to other feature selection tasks with some minor changes. The experiment results compared with different classifiers, decision networks, and related work showed a significant effect using the Random Forest classifier, reaching 95.6% accuracy with only 24 features selected.

    "title": "Consistent Representation Learning for Continual Relation Extraction",
    "abstract": "Continual relation extraction (CRE) aims to continuously train a model on data with new relations while avoiding forgetting old ones. Some previous work has proved that storing a few typical samples of old relations and replaying them when learning new relations can effectively avoid forgetting. However, these memory-based methods tend to overfit the memory samples and perform poorly on imbalanced datasets. To solve these challenges, a consistent representation learning method is proposed, which maintains the stability of the relation embedding by adopting contrastive learning and knowledge distillation when replaying memory. Specifically, supervised contrastive learning based on a memory bank is first used to train each new task so that the model can effectively learn the relation representation. Then, contrastive replay is conducted of the samples in memory and makes the model retain the knowledge of historical relations through memory knowledge distillation to prevent the catastrophic forgetting of the old task. The proposed method can better learn consistent representations to alleviate forgetting effectively. Extensive experiments on FewRel and TACRED datasets show that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and yield strong robustness on the imbalanced dataset. ",

Although the technique is mostly employed to deal with redundant information, i.e., regions composed of pixels with similar intensity, it can also be used for tampering images by inserting or removing relevant objects. Therefore, detecting such a process is of extreme importance regarding the image security domain. However, recognizing seam-carved images does not represent a straightforward task even for human eyes, and robust computation tools capable of identifying such alterations are very desirable. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end approach to cope with the problem of automatic seam carving detection that can obtain state-of-the-art results.

Most online service providers deploy audio CAPTCHAs as an alternative to text and image CAPTCHAs for visually impaired users. However, prior research investigating the security of audio CAPTCHAs found them highly vulnerable to automated attacks using Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems. To improve the robustness of audio CAPTCHAs against automated abuses, we present the design and implementation of an audio adversarial CAPTCHA (aaeCAPTCHA) system in this paper. The aaeCAPTCHA system exploits audio adversarial examples as CAPTCHAs to prevent the ASR systems from automatically solving them. Furthermore, we conducted a rigorous security evaluation of our new audio CAPTCHA design against five state-of-the-art DNN-based ASR systems and three commercial Speech-to-Text (STT) services. Our experimental evaluations demonstrate that aaeCAPTCHA is highly secure against these speech recognition technologies, even when the attacker has complete knowledge of the current attacks against audio adversarial examples. We also conducted a usability evaluation of the proof-of-concept implementation of the aaeCAPTCHA scheme. Our results show that it achieves high robustness at a moderate usability cost compared to normal audio CAPTCHAs. Finally, our extensive analysis highlights that aaeCAPTCHA can significantly enhance the security and robustness of traditional audio CAPTCHA systems while maintaining similar usability. ",

Additionally, such an improvement is partially explained due to the advent of deep learning techniques, i.e., stacks of simple architectures that end up in more complex models. Although both factors produce outstanding results, they also pose drawbacks regarding the learning process since training complex models denotes an expensive task and results are prone to overfit the training data. A supervised regularization technique called MaxDropout was recently proposed to tackle the latter, providing several improvements concerning traditional regularization approaches. In this paper, we present its improved version called MaxDropoutV2. Results considering two public datasets show that the model performs faster than the standard version and, in most cases, provides more accurate results. ",

To fulfill this need, we present Flurry, an end-to-end data pipeline which simulates cyberattacks, captures provenance data from these attacks at multiple system and application layers, converts audit logs from these attacks into data provenance graphs, and incorporates this data with a framework for training deep neural models that supports preconfigured or custom-designed models for analysis in real-world resilient systems. We showcase this pipeline by processing data from multiple system attacks and performing anomaly detection via graph classification using current benchmark graph representational learning frameworks.

Most work in this area has been restricted to computer vision and risk assessment. In this paper, we evaluate the impact of differential privacy on fairness across four tasks, focusing on how attempts to mitigate privacy violations and between-group performance differences interact: Does privacy inhibit attempts to ensure fairness? To this end, we train $(\\varepsilon,\\delta)$-differentially private models with empirical risk minimization and group distributionally robust training objectives. Consistent with previous findings, we find that differential privacy increases between-group performance differences in the baseline setting; but more interestingly, differential privacy reduces between-group performance differences in the robust setting.

To address these challenges, we formulate a novel part-aware instance segmentation pipeline. The key idea is to decompose industrial objects into correlated approximate convex parts and enhance the object-level segmentation with part-level segmentation. We design a part-aware network to predict part masks and part-to-part offsets, followed by a part aggregation module to assemble the recognized parts into instances. To guide the network learning, we also propose an automatic label decoupling scheme to generate ground-truth part-level labels from instance-level labels. Finally, we contribute the first instance segmentation dataset, which contains a variety of industrial objects that are thin and have non-trivial shapes. Extensive experimental results on various industrial objects demonstrate that our method can achieve the best segmentation results compared with the state-of-the-art approaches. ",

    "abstract": "A common challenge posed to robust semantic segmentation is the expensive data annotation cost. Existing semi-supervised solutions show great potential toward solving this problem. Their key idea is constructing consistency regularization with unsupervised data augmentation from unlabeled data for model training. The perturbations for unlabeled data enable the consistency training loss, which benefits semi-supervised semantic segmentation. However, these perturbations destroy image context and introduce unnatural boundaries, which is harmful for semantic segmentation. Besides, the widely adopted semi-supervised learning framework, i.e. mean-teacher, suffers performance limitation since the student model finally converges to the teacher model. In this paper, first of all, we propose a context friendly differentiable geometric warping to conduct unsupervised data augmentation; secondly, a novel adversarial dual-student framework is proposed to improve the Mean-Teacher from the following two aspects: (1) dual student models are learnt independently except for a stabilization constraint to encourage exploiting model diversities; (2) adversarial training scheme is applied to both students and the discriminators are resorted to distinguish reliable pseudo-label of unlabeled data for self-training. Effectiveness is validated via extensive experiments on PASCAL VOC2012 and Citescapes. Our solution significantly improves the performance and state-of-the-art results are achieved on both datasets. Remarkably, compared with fully supervision, our solution achieves comparable mIoU of 73.4% using only 12.5% annotated data on PASCAL VOC2012. ",

Compared to garbled circuits with quantized inputs, when computing individual nonlinear functions, our experiments show Tabula uses between $35 \\times$-$70 \\times$ less communication, is over $100\\times$ faster, and uses a comparable amount of storage. This leads to significant performance gains over garbled circuits with quantized inputs during secure inference on neural networks: Tabula reduces overall communication by up to $9 \\times$ and achieves a speedup of up to $50 \\times$, while imposing comparable storage costs.

In this study, we present comprehensive criteria to maximize global consistency in the pose graph using a new robust graph cut technique. Our key idea is to formulate the problem as a minimum-cost multi-cut that enables us to optimize not only landmark correspondences but also the number of landmarks while allowing for a varying number of landmarks. This makes our proposed approach invariant against the type of landmark measurement, graph topology, and metric information, such as the speed of the robot motion.

    "abstract": "Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation (WSSS) based on image-level labels has attracted much attention due to low annotation costs. Existing methods often rely on Class Activation Mapping (CAM) that measures the correlation between image pixels and classifier weight. However, the classifier focuses only on the discriminative regions while ignoring other useful information in each image, resulting in incomplete localization maps. To address this issue, we propose a Self-supervised Image-specific Prototype Exploration (SIPE) that consists of an Image-specific Prototype Exploration (IPE) and a General-Specific Consistency (GSC) loss. Specifically, IPE tailors prototypes for every image to capture complete regions, formed our Image-Specific CAM (IS-CAM), which is realized by two sequential steps. In addition, GSC is proposed to construct the consistency of general CAM and our specific IS-CAM, which further optimizes the feature representation and empowers a self-correction ability of prototype exploration. Extensive experiments are conducted on PASCAL VOC 2012 and MS COCO 2014 segmentation benchmark and results show our SIPE achieves new state-of-the-art performance using only image-level labels.

Many of interpretability methods attempt to quantify the importance of input features with respect to the class probabilities, and are called importance estimators or saliency maps. A popular approach to evaluate such interpretability methods is to perturb input features deemed important for predictions and observe the decrease in accuracy. However, perturbation-based evaluation methods may confound the sources of accuracy degradation. We conduct computational experiments that allow to empirically estimate the $\\textit{fidelity}$ of interpretability methods and the contribution of perturbation artifacts. All considered importance estimators clearly outperform a random baseline, which contradicts the findings of ROAR [arXiv:1806.10758].

Given that standard translation models make predictions on the condition of previous target contexts, we argue that the above statistical metrics ignore target context information and may assign inappropriate weights to target tokens. While one possible solution is to directly take target contexts into these statistical metrics, the target-context-aware statistical computing is extremely expensive, and the corresponding storage overhead is unrealistic. To solve the above issues, we propose a target-context-aware metric, named conditional bilingual mutual information (CBMI), which makes it feasible to supplement target context information for statistical metrics. Particularly, our CBMI can be formalized as the log quotient of the translation model probability and language model probability by decomposing the conditional joint distribution. Thus CBMI can be efficiently calculated during model training without any pre-specific statistical calculations and large storage overhead. Furthermore, we propose an effective adaptive training approach based on both the token- and sentence-level CBMI. Experimental results on WMT14 English-German and WMT19 Chinese-English tasks show our approach can significantly outperform the Transformer baseline and other related methods. ",

It is not only a more challenging task than regular VQA but also a vital step towards building a general VQA system. Most existing knowledge-based VQA systems process knowledge and image information similarly and ignore the fact that the knowledge base (KB) contains complete information about a triplet, while the extracted image information might be incomplete as the relations between two objects are missing or wrongly detected. In this paper, we propose a novel model named dynamic knowledge memory enhanced multi-step graph reasoning (DMMGR), which performs explicit and implicit reasoning over a key-value knowledge memory module and a spatial-aware image graph, respectively. Specifically, the memory module learns a dynamic knowledge representation and generates a knowledge-aware question representation at each reasoning step. Then, this representation is used to guide a graph attention operator over the spatial-aware image graph. Our model achieves new state-of-the-art accuracy on the KRVQR and FVQA datasets.

Yet, the BoN does not quantify the whole generated samples, resulting in an incomplete view of the model's prediction quality and performance. We propose a new metric, Average Mahalanobis Distance (AMD) to tackle this issue. AMD is a metric that quantifies how close the whole generated samples are to the ground truth. We also introduce the Average Maximum Eigenvalue (AMV) metric that quantifies the overall spread of the predictions. Our metrics are validated empirically by showing that the ADE/FDE is not sensitive to distribution shifts, giving a biased sense of accuracy, unlike the AMD/AMV metrics. We introduce the usage of Implicit Maximum Likelihood Estimation (IMLE) as a replacement for traditional generative models to train our model, Social-Implicit. IMLE training mechanism aligns with AMD/AMV objective of predicting trajectories that are close to the ground truth with a tight spread. Social-Implicit is a memory efficient deep model with only 5.8K parameters that runs in real time of about 580Hz and achieves competitive results.

    "abstract": "Attaching attributes (such as color, shape, state, action) to object categories is an important computer vision problem. Attribute prediction has seen exciting recent progress and is often formulated as a multi-label classification problem. Yet significant challenges remain in: 1) predicting diverse attributes over multiple categories, 2) modeling attributes-category dependency, 3) capturing both global and local scene context, and 4) predicting attributes of objects with low pixel-count. To address these issues, we propose a novel multi-category attribute prediction deep architecture named GlideNet, which contains three distinct feature extractors. A global feature extractor recognizes what objects are present in a scene, whereas a local one focuses on the area surrounding the object of interest. Meanwhile, an intrinsic feature extractor uses an extension of standard convolution dubbed Informed Convolution to retrieve features of objects with low pixel-count. GlideNet uses gating mechanisms with binary masks and its self-learned category embedding to combine the dense embeddings. Collectively, the Global-Local-Intrinsic blocks comprehend the scene's global context while attending to the characteristics of the local object of interest. Finally, using the combined features, an interpreter predicts the attributes, and the length of the output is determined by the category, thereby removing unnecessary attributes. GlideNet can achieve compelling results on two recent and challenging datasets -- VAW and CAR -- for large-scale attribute prediction. For instance, it obtains more than 5\\% gain over state of the art in the mean recall (mR) metric. GlideNet's advantages are especially apparent when predicting attributes of objects with low pixel counts as well as attributes that demand global context understanding. Finally, we show that GlideNet excels in training starved real-world scenarios. ",

A critical challenge for training human activity recognition models is data quality. Acquiring balanced datasets containing accurate activity labels requires humans to correctly annotate and potentially interfere with the subjects' normal activities in real-time. Despite the likelihood of incorrect annotation or lack thereof, there is often an inherent chronology to human behavior. For example, we take a shower after we exercise. This implicit chronology can be used to learn unknown labels and classify future activities. In this work, we propose HAR-GCCN, a deep graph CNN model that leverages the correlation between chronologically adjacent sensor measurements to predict the correct labels for unclassified activities that have at least one activity label. We propose a new training strategy enforcing that the model predicts the missing activity labels by leveraging the known ones. HAR-GCCN shows superior performance relative to previously used baseline methods, improving classification accuracy by about 25% and up to 68% on different datasets.

Using supervised data of real-world 9D poses is tedious and erroneous, and also fails to generalize to unseen scenarios. Besides, category-level pose estimation requires a method to be able to generalize to unseen objects at test time, which is also challenging. Drawing inspirations from traditional point pair features (PPFs), in this paper, we design a novel Category-level PPF (CPPF) voting method to achieve accurate, robust and generalizable 9D pose estimation in the wild. To obtain robust pose estimation, we sample numerous point pairs on an object, and for each pair our model predicts necessary SE(3)-invariant voting statistics on object centers, orientations and scales. A novel coarse-to-fine voting algorithm is proposed to eliminate noisy point pair samples and generate final predictions from the population. To get rid of false positives in the orientation voting process, an auxiliary binary disambiguating classification task is introduced for each sampled point pair. In order to detect objects in the wild, we carefully design our sim-to-real pipeline by training on synthetic point clouds only, unless objects have ambiguous poses in geometry. Under this circumstance, color information is leveraged to disambiguate these poses. Results on standard benchmarks show that our method is on par with current state of the arts with real-world training data. Extensive experiments further show that our method is robust to noise and gives promising results under extremely challenging scenarios. Our code is available on https://github.com/qq456cvb/CPPF. ",

The UAV users aim to optimize their locations to maximize the weighted sum rate. While most existing work considers simplified line-of-sight (LoS) or statistic air-to-ground (A2G) channel models, we exploit the location-specific channel knowledge map (CKM) to enhance the placement performance in practice. However, as the CKMs normally contain discrete site- and location-specific channel data without analytic model functions, the corresponding weighted sum rate function becomes non-differentiable in general. In this case, conventional optimization techniques relying on function derivatives are inapplicable to solve the resultant placement optimization problem. To address this issue, we propose a novel iterative algorithm based on the derivative-free optimization. In each iteration, we first construct a quadratic function to approximate the non-differentiable weighted sum rate under a set of interpolation conditions, and then update the UAVs' placement locations by maximizing the approximate quadratic function subject to a trust region constraint. Numerical results show the convergence of the proposed algorithm. It is also shown that the proposed algorithm achieves a weighted sum rate close to the optimal design based on exhaustive search with much lower implementation complexity, and it significantly outperforms the conventional optimization method based on simplified LoS channel models and the heuristic design with each UAV hovering above its associated GBS.

    "title": "Singular Value Perturbation and Deep Network Optimization",
    "abstract": "We develop new theoretical results on matrix perturbation to shed light on the impact of architecture on the performance of a deep network. In particular, we explain analytically what deep learning practitioners have long observed empirically: the parameters of some deep architectures (e.g., residual networks, ResNets, and Dense networks, DenseNets) are easier to optimize than others (e.g., convolutional networks, ConvNets). Building on our earlier work connecting deep networks with continuous piecewise-affine splines, we develop an exact local linear representation of a deep network layer for a family of modern deep networks that includes ConvNets at one end of a spectrum and ResNets and DenseNets at the other. For regression tasks that optimize the squared-error loss, we show that the optimization loss surface of a modern deep network is piecewise quadratic in the parameters, with local shape governed by the singular values of a matrix that is a function of the local linear representation. We develop new perturbation results for how the singular values of matrices of this sort behave as we add a fraction of the identity and multiply by certain diagonal matrices. A direct application of our perturbation results explains analytically why a ResNet is easier to optimize than a ConvNet: thanks to its more stable singular values and smaller condition number, the local loss surface of a ResNet or DenseNet is less erratic, less eccentric, and features local minima that are more accommodating to gradient-based optimization. Our results also shed new light on the impact of different nonlinear activation functions on a deep network's singular values, regardless of its architecture. ",

    "title": "HintNet: Hierarchical Knowledge Transfer Networks for Traffic Accident  Forecasting on Heterogeneous Spatio-Temporal Data",
    "abstract": "Traffic accident forecasting is a significant problem for transportation management and public safety. However, this problem is challenging due to the spatial heterogeneity of the environment and the sparsity of accidents in space and time. The occurrence of traffic accidents is affected by complex dependencies among spatial and temporal features. Recent traffic accident prediction methods have attempted to use deep learning models to improve accuracy. However, most of these methods either focus on small-scale and homogeneous areas such as populous cities or simply use sliding-window-based ensemble methods, which are inadequate to handle heterogeneity in large regions. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Knowledge Transfer Network (HintNet) model to better capture irregular heterogeneity patterns. HintNet performs a multi-level spatial partitioning to separate sub-regions with different risks and learns a deep network model for each level using spatio-temporal and graph convolutions. Through knowledge transfer across levels, HintNet archives both higher accuracy and higher training efficiency. Extensive experiments on a real-world accident dataset from the state of Iowa demonstrate that HintNet outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on spatially heterogeneous and large-scale areas. ",

    "abstract": "While deep face recognition (FR) systems have shown amazing performance in identification and verification, they also arouse privacy concerns for their excessive surveillance on users, especially for public face images widely spread on social networks. Recently, some studies adopt adversarial examples to protect photos from being identified by unauthorized face recognition systems. However, existing methods of generating adversarial face images suffer from many limitations, such as awkward visual, white-box setting, weak transferability, making them difficult to be applied to protect face privacy in reality. In this paper, we propose adversarial makeup transfer GAN (AMT-GAN), a novel face protection method aiming at constructing adversarial face images that preserve stronger black-box transferability and better visual quality simultaneously. AMT-GAN leverages generative adversarial networks (GAN) to synthesize adversarial face images with makeup transferred from reference images. In particular, we introduce a new regularization module along with a joint training strategy to reconcile the conflicts between the adversarial noises and the cycle consistence loss in makeup transfer, achieving a desirable balance between the attack strength and visual changes. Extensive experiments verify that compared with state of the arts, AMT-GAN can not only preserve a comfortable visual quality, but also achieve a higher attack success rate over commercial FR APIs, including Face++, Aliyun, and Microsoft.

    "abstract": "Neural architecture search (NAS) could help search for robust network architectures, where defining robustness evaluation metrics is the important procedure. However, current robustness evaluations in NAS are not sufficiently comprehensive and reliable. In particular, the common practice only considers adversarial noise and quantified metrics such as the Jacobian matrix, whereas, some studies indicated that the models are also vulnerable to other types of noises such as natural noise. In addition, existing methods taking adversarial noise as the evaluation just use the robust accuracy of the FGSM or PGD, but these adversarial attacks could not provide the adequately reliable evaluation, leading to the vulnerability of the models under stronger attacks. To alleviate the above problems, we propose a novel framework, called Auto Adversarial Attack and Defense (AAAD), where we employ neural architecture search methods, and four types of robustness evaluations are considered, including adversarial noise, natural noise, system noise and quantified metrics, thereby assisting in finding more robust architectures. Also, among the adversarial noise, we use the composite adversarial attack obtained by random search as the new metric to evaluate the robustness of the model architectures. The empirical results on the CIFAR10 dataset show that the searched efficient attack could help find more robust architectures. ",

Prior works either simply align the global features of an image with its associated class semantic vector or utilize unidirectional attention to learn the limited latent semantic representations, which could not effectively discover the intrinsic semantic knowledge e.g., attribute semantics) between visual and attribute features. To solve the above dilemma, we propose a Mutually Semantic Distillation Network (MSDN), which progressively distills the intrinsic semantic representations between visual and attribute features for ZSL. MSDN incorporates an attribute$\\rightarrow$visual attention sub-net that learns attribute-based visual features, and a visual$\\rightarrow$attribute attention sub-net that learns visual-based attribute features. By further introducing a semantic distillation loss, the two mutual attention sub-nets are capable of learning collaboratively and teaching each other throughout the training process. The proposed MSDN yields significant improvements over the strong baselines, leading to new state-of-the-art performances on three popular challenging benchmarks, i.e., CUB, SUN, and AWA2.

    "abstract": "Open Source Software (OSS) forms much of the fabric of our digital society, especially successful and sustainable ones. But many OSS projects do not become sustainable, resulting in abandonment and even risks for the world's digital infrastructure. Prior work has looked at the reasons for this mainly from two very different perspectives. In software engineering, the focus has been on understanding success and sustainability from the socio-technical perspective: the OSS programmers' day-to-day activities and the artifacts they create. In institutional analysis, on the other hand, emphasis has been on institutional designs (e.g., policies, rules, and norms) that structure governance. Even though each is necessary for a comprehensive understanding of OSS projects, the connection and interaction between the two approaches have been barely explored. In this paper, we make the first effort toward understanding OSS project sustainability using a dual-view analysis, by combining institutional analysis with socio-technical systems analysis. In particular, we (i) use linguistic approaches to extract institutional rules and norms from OSS contributors' communications to represent the evolution of their governance systems, and (ii) construct socio-technical networks based on longitudinal collaboration records to represent each project's organizational structure. We combined the two methods and applied them to a dataset of developer traces from 253 nascent OSS projects within the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) incubator. We find that the socio-technical and institutional features relate to each other, and provide complementary views into the progress of the ASF's OSS projects. Refining these combined analyses can help provide a more precise understanding of the synchronization between the evolution of institutional governance and organizational structure. ",

In this paper, we propose a novel graph-neural-network (GNN) based method to handle the aforementioned limitation.

Many in the semiconductor manufacturing community have reservations about the adoption of deep learning; they instead prefer other model-based approaches for some image regression problems, and according to the 2021 IEEE International Roadmap for Devices and Systems (IRDS) report on Metrology a SEMI standardization committee may endorse this philosophy. The semiconductor manufacturing community does, however, communicate a need for state-of-the-art statistical analyses to reduce measurement uncertainty. Prediction intervals which characterize the reliability of the predictive performance of regression models can impact decisions, build trust in machine learning, and be applied to other regression models. However, we are not aware of effective and sufficiently simple distribution-free approaches that offer valid coverage for important classes of image data, so we consider the distribution-free conformal prediction and conformalized quantile regression framework.The image regression problem that is the focus of this paper pertains to line edge roughness (LER) estimation from noisy scanning electron microscopy images. LER affects semiconductor device performance and reliability as well as the yield of the manufacturing process; the 2021 IRDS emphasizes the crucial importance of LER by devoting a white paper to it in addition to mentioning or discussing it in the reports of multiple international focus teams. It is not immediately apparent how to effectively use normalized conformal prediction and quantile regression for LER estimation. The modeling techniques we apply appear to be novel for finding distribution-free prediction intervals for image data and will be presented at the 2022 SEMI Advanced Semiconductor Manufacturing Conference.

We decompose the graph autoencoder-based one-step encoding into the two-stage encoding framework to adapt to the real-world big data system by reducing complexity from the original O(N^2) to O(N). At the same time, based on the advantages of GAER support module plug-and-play configuration and incremental community detection, we further propose a peer awareness based module for real-time large graphs, which can realize the new nodes community detection at a faster speed, and accelerate model inference with the 6.15 times - 14.03 times speed. Finally, we apply the GAER on multiple real-world datasets, including some large-scale networks.

We argue that this can be caused by a discrepancy between training and real-world testing. At training time, chatbot generates the response with the golden context, while it has to generate based on the context consisting of both user utterances and the model predicted utterances during real-world testing. With the growth of the number of utterances, this discrepancy becomes more serious in the multi-turn settings. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical sampling-based method consisting of both utterance-level sampling and semi-utterance-level sampling, to alleviate the discrepancy, which implicitly increases the dialogue coherence. We further adopt reinforcement learning and re-ranking methods to explicitly optimize the dialogue coherence during training and inference, respectively. Empirical experiments show the effectiveness of the proposed methods for improving the robustness of chatbots in real practice. ",

    "abstract": "Deep Siamese trackers have recently gained much attention in recent years since they can track visual objects at high speeds. Additionally, adaptive tracking methods, where target samples collected by the tracker are employed for online learning, have achieved state-of-the-art accuracy. However, single object tracking (SOT) remains a challenging task in real-world application due to changes and deformations in a target object's appearance. Learning on all the collected samples may lead to catastrophic forgetting, and thereby corrupt the tracking model. In this paper, SOT is formulated as an online incremental learning problem. A new method is proposed for dynamic sample selection and memory replay, preventing template corruption. In particular, we propose a change detection mechanism to detect gradual changes in object appearance and select the corresponding samples for online adaption. In addition, an entropy-based sample selection strategy is introduced to maintain a diversified auxiliary buffer for memory replay. Our proposed method can be integrated into any object tracking algorithm that leverages online learning for model adaptation. Extensive experiments conducted on the OTB-100, LaSOT, UAV123, and TrackingNet datasets highlight the cost-effectiveness of our method, along with the contribution of its key components. Results indicate that integrating our proposed method into state-of-art adaptive Siamese trackers can increase the potential benefits of a template update strategy, and significantly improve performance.

At each iteration, the player chooses an arm. Given the arm, the environment returns an uncorrupted reward with probability $1-\\varepsilon$ and an arbitrarily corrupted reward with probability $\\varepsilon$. In our setting, the uncorrupted reward might be heavy-tailed and the corrupted reward might be unbounded. We prove a lower bound on the regret indicating that the corrupted and heavy-tailed bandits are strictly harder than uncorrupted or light-tailed bandits. We observe that the environments can be categorised into hardness regimes depending on the suboptimality gap $\\Delta$, variance $\\sigma$, and corruption proportion $\\epsilon$. Following this, we design a UCB-type algorithm, namely HuberUCB, that leverages Huber's estimator for robust mean estimation. HuberUCB leads to tight upper bounds on regret in the proposed corrupted and heavy-tailed setting. To derive the upper bound, we prove a novel concentration inequality for Huber's estimator, which might be of independent interest. ",

Currently, most of these approaches are tailored for convolutional neural networks (CNNs). However, there is a tendency that transformers, with a completely different architecture, are starting to challenge the domination of CNNs in many computer vision tasks. Nevertheless, directly applying the previous KA methods to transformers leads to severe performance degradation. In this work, we explore a more effective KA scheme for transformer-based object detection models. Specifically, considering the architecture characteristics of transformers, we propose to dissolve the KA into two aspects: sequence-level amalgamation (SA) and task-level amalgamation (TA). In particular, a hint is generated within the sequence-level amalgamation by concatenating teacher sequences instead of redundantly aggregating them to a fixed-size one as previous KA works. Besides, the student learns heterogeneous detection tasks through soft targets with efficiency in the task-level amalgamation. Extensive experiments on PASCAL VOC and COCO have unfolded that the sequence-level amalgamation significantly boosts the performance of students, while the previous methods impair the students. Moreover, the transformer-based students excel in learning amalgamated knowledge, as they have mastered heterogeneous detection tasks rapidly and achieved superior or at least comparable performance to those of the teachers in their specializations.

This paper tests the generalization capability of these predictors on public mobility datasets, stratifying the datasets by whether the trajectories in the test set also appear fully or partially in the training set. We consistently discover a severe problem of trajectory overlapping in all analyzed datasets, highlighting that predictors memorize trajectories while having limited generalization capacities. We thus propose a methodology to rerank the outputs of the next-location predictors based on spatial mobility patterns. With these techniques, we significantly improve the predictors' generalization capability, with a relative improvement on the accuracy up to 96.15% on the trajectories that cannot be memorized (i.e., low overlap with the training set).

    "abstract": "The legacy mobility robustness optimization (MRO) in self-organizing networks aims at improving handover performance by optimizing cell-specific handover parameters. However, such solutions cannot satisfy the needs of next-generation network with network slicing, because it only guarantees the received signal strength but not the per-slice service quality. To provide the truly seamless mobility service, we propose a deep reinforcement learning-based slice-aware mobility robustness optimization (SAMRO) approach, which improves handover performance with per-slice service assurance by optimizing slice-specific handover parameters. Moreover, to allow safe and sample efficient online training, we develop a two-step transfer learning scheme: 1) regularized offline reinforcement learning, and 2) effective online fine-tuning with mixed experience replay. System-level simulations show that compared against the legacy MRO algorithms, SAMRO significantly improves slice-aware service continuation while optimizing the handover performance. ",

In this paper, as an alternative, we propose a novel approach to few-shot learning with pre-trained token-replaced detection models like ELECTRA. In this approach, we reformulate a classification or a regression task as a token-replaced detection problem. Specifically, we first define a template and label description words for each task and put them into the input to form a natural language prompt. Then, we employ the pre-trained token-replaced detection model to predict which label description word is the most original (i.e., least replaced) among all label description words in the prompt. A systematic evaluation on 16 datasets demonstrates that our approach outperforms few-shot learners with pre-trained masked language models in both one-sentence and two-sentence learning tasks. ",

However, researchers have extra difficulties while working with video games in multi-agent environments.

To address this issue, we propose a novel algorithm based on the actor-critic method, which adapts the hypergraph structure of agents and employs hypergraph convolution to complete information feature extraction and representation between agents, resulting in efficient collaboration. Based on distinct generating methods of hypergraph structure, HGAC and ATT-HGAC algorithms are given. We demonstrate the advantages of our approach over other existing methods.

    "abstract": "Deep neural networks achieve outstanding results in a large variety of tasks, often outperforming human experts. However, a known limitation of current neural architectures is the poor accessibility to understand and interpret the network response to a given input. This is directly related to the huge number of variables and the associated non-linearities of neural models, which are often used as black boxes. When it comes to critical applications as autonomous driving, security and safety, medicine and health, the lack of interpretability of the network behavior tends to induce skepticism and limited trustworthiness, despite the accurate performance of such systems in the given task. Furthermore, a single metric, such as the classification accuracy, provides a non-exhaustive evaluation of most real-world scenarios. In this paper, we want to make a step forward towards interpretability in neural networks, providing new tools to interpret their behavior. We present Agglomerator, a framework capable of providing a representation of part-whole hierarchies from visual cues and organizing the input distribution matching the conceptual-semantic hierarchical structure between classes. We evaluate our method on common datasets, such as SmallNORB, MNIST, FashionMNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100, providing a more interpretable model than other state-of-the-art approaches. ",

For providing easy message propagation primitives, the mutual-exclusive propagation (MEP) of one-bit messages is investigated with a simplified discrete system model. Inspired by natural propagation systems, efficient self-stabilizing periodic MEP processes are proposed with the MEP systems. For handling the worst-case scenarios, the MEP systems are generally analyzed with formal proofs upon arbitrarily connected networks. It shows that the MEP systems can be stabilized with arbitrary initial system states within a short bounded time. Meanwhile, the numeric simulation shows that the propagation errors can be significantly reduced if the message delays are randomly distributed. Propagation patterns are also discussed in further deriving finer propagation results in the MEP systems. It shows that bounded clock drifts and some benign faults can be well handled in the MEP systems. Featured by its very simple mechanism, the proposed MEP primitive can be employed as a practical building block of upper-layer self-stabilizing synchronous systems. ",

Usually this invariance is only encouraged implicitly by including a single augmented input during training. However, several works have recently shown that using multiple augmentations per input can improve generalisation or can be used to incorporate invariances more explicitly. In this work, we first empirically compare these recently proposed objectives that differ in whether they rely on explicit or implicit regularisation and at what level of the predictor they encode the invariances. We show that the predictions of the best performing method are also the most similar when compared on different augmentations of the same input. Inspired by this observation, we propose an explicit regulariser that encourages this invariance on the level of individual model predictions. Through extensive experiments on CIFAR-100 and ImageNet we show that this explicit regulariser (i) improves generalisation and (ii) equalises performance differences between all considered objectives. Our results suggest that objectives that encourage invariance on the level of the neural network itself generalise better than those that achieve invariance by averaging predictions of non-invariant models.

The output of our system is a dense per-pixel depth map of the frame. First we use a neural network to transform each pixel into a feature vector, which we call base functions. Then we pick out the known pixels' base functions and their depth values. We use a linear least square algorithm to fit the base functions and the depth values. Then we get the weights estimated from the least square algorithm. Finally, we apply the weights to the whole image and predict the final depth map. Our method is interpretable so it can generalize well. Experiments show that our results beat the state-of-the-art on NYU-Depth-V2 dataset both in accuracy and runtime.

The PNR framework has two components: (i) an Attenuation Prediction (AP) mechanism; and (ii) a Multi-Step Network Reconfiguration (MSNR) algorithm. The AP mechanism employs an encoder-decoder Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model to predict the sequence of future attenuation levels of each link. The MSNR algorithm leverages these predictions to dynamically optimize routing and admission control decisions aiming to maximize network utilization, while preserving max-min fairness among the base-stations sharing the network and preventing transient congestion that may be caused by re-routing. We train, validate, and evaluate the PNR framework using a dataset containing over 2 million measurements collected from a real-world city-scale backhaul network. The results show that the framework: (i) predicts attenuation with high accuracy, with an RMSE of less than 0.4 dB for a prediction horizon of 50 seconds; and (ii) can improve the instantaneous network utilization by more than 200% when compared to reactive network reconfiguration algorithms that cannot leverage information about future disturbances.

    "abstract": "Place recognition is an important capability for autonomously navigating vehicles operating in complex environments and under changing conditions. It is a key component for tasks such as loop closing in SLAM or global localization. In this paper, we address the problem of place recognition based on 3D LiDAR scans recorded by an autonomous vehicle. We propose a novel lightweight neural network exploiting the range image representation of LiDAR sensors to achieve fast execution with less than 4 ms per frame. Based on that, we design a yaw-rotation-invariant architecture exploiting a transformer network, which boosts the place recognition performance of our method. We evaluate our approach on the KITTI and Ford Campus datasets. The experimental results show that our method can effectively detect loop closures compared to the state-of-the-art methods and generalizes well across different environments. To further evaluate long-term place recognition performance, we provide a novel challenging Haomo dataset, which contains LiDAR sequences recorded by a mobile robot in repetitive places across seasons.

It is shown that the neural network sequence obtained by minimizing the regularization loss function converges to the unique solution to the interface problem in $H^2$ as the number of samples increases.

Its modularity allows it to be integrated with current univariate methods. Our approach allows to trade-off accuracy and computational efficiency gradually via offering on one extreme inference of a potentially fully-connected graph or on another extreme a bipartite graph. In the potentially fully-connected case we consider all pair-wise interactions among time-series which yields the best forecasting accuracy. Conversely, the bipartite case leverages the dependency structure by inter-communicating the N time series through a small set of K auxiliary nodes that we introduce. This reduces the time and memory complexity w.r.t. previous graph inference methods from O(N^2) to O(NK) with a small trade-off in accuracy. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our model in a variety of datasets where both of its variants perform better or very competitively to previous graph inference methods in terms of forecasting accuracy and time efficiency.

    "abstract": "Recent work has focused on data-driven learning of the evolution of unknown systems via deep neural networks (DNNs), with the goal of conducting long time prediction of the evolution of the unknown system. Training a DNN with low generalization error is a particularly important task in this case as error is accumulated over time. Because of the inherent randomness in DNN training, chiefly in stochastic optimization, there is uncertainty in the resulting prediction, and therefore in the generalization error. Hence, the generalization error can be viewed as a random variable with some probability distribution. Well-trained DNNs, particularly those with many hyperparameters, typically result in probability distributions for generalization error with low bias but high variance. High variance causes variability and unpredictably in the results of a trained DNN. This paper presents a computational technique which decreases the variance of the generalization error, thereby improving the reliability of the DNN model to generalize consistently. In the proposed ensemble averaging method, multiple models are independently trained and model predictions are averaged at each time step. A mathematical foundation for the method is presented, including results regarding the distribution of the local truncation error. In addition, three time-dependent differential equation problems are considered as numerical examples, demonstrating the effectiveness of the method to decrease variance of DNN predictions generally.

We show that, in the recently discovered Maximal Update Parametrization (muP), many optimal HPs remain stable even as model size changes. This leads to a new HP tuning paradigm we call muTransfer: parametrize the target model in muP, tune the HP indirectly on a smaller model, and zero-shot transfer them to the full-sized model, i.e., without directly tuning the latter at all. We verify muTransfer on Transformer and ResNet. For example, 1) by transferring pretraining HPs from a model of 13M parameters, we outperform published numbers of BERT-large (350M parameters), with a total tuning cost equivalent to pretraining BERT-large once; 2) by transferring from 40M parameters, we outperform published numbers of the 6.7B GPT-3 model, with tuning cost only 7% of total pretraining cost.

This is easily solved using the Lie group and known symbolic or numerical methods without any network parameters (weights and biases). The second part consists of an FNN with adjustable parameters. This is trained using the error back propagation method by minimizing an error (loss) function and updating the parameters. The method significantly reduces the number of the trainable parameters and can more quickly and accurately learn the real solution, compared to the existing similar methods.

These robots often rely on 2D occupancy maps for core tasks such as localisation and motion and task planning. However, reliable identification of structure and room segmentation from 2D occupancy maps is still an open problem due to clutter (e.g., furniture and movable object), occlusions, and partial coverage. We propose a method for the RObust StructurE identification and ROom SEgmentation (ROSE^2 ) of 2D occupancy maps, which may be cluttered and incomplete. ROSE^2 identifies the main directions of walls and is resilient to clutter and partial observations, allowing to extract a clean, abstract geometrical floor-plan-like description of the environment, which is used to segment, i.e., to identify rooms in, the original occupancy grid map. ROSE^2 is tested in several real-world publicly-available cluttered maps obtained in different conditions. The results show how it can robustly identify the environment structure in 2D occupancy maps suffering from clutter and partial observations, while significantly improving room segmentation accuracy. Thanks to the combination of clutter removal and robust room segmentation ROSE^2 consistently achieves higher performance than the state-of-the-art methods, against which it is compared. ",

    "abstract": "A core problem in the development and maintenance of crowd- sourced filter lists is that their maintainers cannot confidently predict whether (and where) a new filter list rule will break websites. This is a result of enormity of the Web, which prevents filter list authors from broadly understanding the impact of a new blocking rule before they ship it to millions of users. The inability of filter list authors to evaluate the Web compatibility impact of a new rule before shipping it severely reduces the benefits of filter-list-based content blocking: filter lists are both overly-conservative (i.e. rules are tailored narrowly to reduce the risk of breaking things) and error-prone (i.e. blocking tools still break large numbers of sites). To scale to the size and scope of the Web, filter list authors need an automated system to detect when a new filter rule breaks websites, before that breakage has a chance to make it to end users. In this work, we design and implement the first automated system for predicting when a filter list rule breaks a website. We build a classifier, trained on a dataset generated by a combination of compatibility data from the EasyList project and novel browser instrumentation, and find it is accurate to practical levels (AUC 0.88). Our open source system requires no human interaction when assessing the compatibility risk of a proposed privacy intervention.

    "abstract": "Social media can be an important source of information facilitating the detection of new safety signals in pharmacovigilance. Various approaches have investigated the analysis of social media data using AI such as NLP techniques for detecting adverse drug events. Existing approaches have focused on the extraction and identification of Adverse Drug Reactions, Drug-Drug Interactions and drug misuse. However, non of the works tackled the detection of potential safety signals by taking into account the evolution in time of relevant indicators. Moreover, despite the success of deep learning in various healthcare applications, it was not explored for this task. We propose an AI-based approach for the detection of potential pharmaceutical safety signals from patients' reviews that can be used as part of the pharmacovigilance surveillance process to flag the necessity of an in-depth pharmacovigilance investigation. We focus on the Levothyrox case in France which triggered huge attention from the media following the change of the medication formula, leading to an increase in the frequency of adverse drug reactions normally reported by patients. Our approach is two-fold. (1) We investigate various NLP-based indicators extracted from patients' reviews including words and n-grams frequency, semantic similarity, Adverse Drug Reactions mentions, and sentiment analysis. (2) We propose a deep learning architecture, named Word Cloud Convolutional Neural Network (WC-CNN) which trains a CNN on word clouds extracted from the patients comments. We study the effect of different time resolutions and different NLP pre-processing techniques on the model performance. Our results show that the proposed indicators could be used in the future to effectively detect new safety signals. The WC-CNN model trained on word clouds extracted at monthly resolution outperforms the others with an accuracy of 75%. ",

Therefore, the efficacy of these methods depends heavily on the quality and comprehensiveness of identity pairs. In this paper, we offer a two-step data augmentation process where (1) the former stage consists of a novel method for preparing a comprehensive list of identity pairs with word embeddings, and (2) the latter consists of leveraging prepared identity pairs list to enhance the training instances by applying three simple operations (namely identity pair replacement, identity term blindness, and identity pair swap).

    "abstract": "Momentive offers solutions in market research, customer experience, and enterprise feedback. The technology is gleaned from the billions of real responses to questions asked on the platform. However, people may create biased questions. A double-barreled question (DBQ) is a common type of biased question that asks two aspects in one question. For example, \"Do you agree with the statement: The food is yummy, and the service is great.\". This DBQ confuses survey respondents because there are two parts in a question. DBQs impact both the survey respondents and the survey owners. Momentive aims to detect DBQs and recommend survey creators to make a change towards gathering high quality unbiased survey data. Previous research work has suggested detecting DBQs by checking the existence of grammatical conjunction. While this is a simple rule-based approach, this method is error-prone because conjunctions can also exist in properly constructed questions. We present an end-to-end machine learning approach for DBQ classification in this work. We handled this imbalanced data using active learning, and compared state-of-the-art embedding algorithms to transform text data into vectors. Furthermore, we proposed a model interpretation technique propagating the vector-level SHAP values to a SHAP value for each word in the questions. We concluded that the word2vec subword embedding with maximum pooling is the optimal word embedding representation in terms of precision and running time in the offline experiments using the survey data at Momentive. The A/B test and production metrics indicate that this model brings a positive change to the business. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first machine learning framework for DBQ detection, and it successfully differentiates Momentive from the competitors. We hope our work sheds light on machine learning approaches for bias question detection. ",

Given a question, our model creates a small-scale relevant training graph to perform more accurate AS2. The nodes of the graphs are question-answer pairs, where the answers are also sentences. We train and apply state-of-the-art models for computing scores between question-question, question-answer, and answer-answer pairs. We apply thresholding to the relevance scores for creating edges between nodes. Finally, we apply Graph Neural Networks to the obtained graph to perform joint learning and inference for solving the AS2 task.

This work proposes a vertical federated learning architecture based on variational quantum circuits to demonstrate the competitive performance of a quantum-enhanced pre-trained BERT model for text classification. In particular, our proposed hybrid classical-quantum model consists of a novel random quantum temporal convolution (QTC) learning framework replacing some layers in the BERT-based decoder. Our experiments on intent classification show that our proposed BERT-QTC model attains competitive experimental results in the Snips and ATIS spoken language datasets. Particularly, the BERT-QTC boosts the performance of the existing quantum circuit-based language model in two text classification datasets by 1.57% and 1.52% relative improvements. Furthermore, BERT-QTC can be feasibly deployed on both existing commercial-accessible quantum computation hardware and CPU-based interface for ensuring data isolation. ",

    "abstract": "New COVID-19 epidemic strains like Delta and Omicron with increased transmissibility and pathogenicity emerge and spread across the whole world rapidly while causing high mortality during the pandemic period. Early prediction of possible variants (especially spike protein) of COVID-19 epidemic strains based on available mutated SARS-CoV-2 RNA sequences may lead to early prevention and treatment. Here, combining the advantage of quantum and quantum-inspired algorithms with the wide application of deep learning, we propose a development tool named DeepQuantum, and use this software to realize the goal of predicting spike protein variation structure of COVID-19 epidemic strains. In addition, this hybrid quantum-classical model for the first time achieves quantum-inspired blur convolution similar to classical depthwise convolution and also successfully applies quantum progressive training with quantum circuits, both of which guarantee that our model is the quantum counterpart of the famous style-based GAN. The results state that the fidelities of random generating spike protein variation structure are always beyond 96% for Delta, 94% for Omicron. The training loss curve is more stable and converges better with multiple loss functions compared with the corresponding classical algorithm. At last, evidences that quantum-inspired algorithms promote the classical deep learning and hybrid models effectively predict the mutant strains are strong. ",

    "abstract": "News Recommendation System(NRS) has become a fundamental technology to many online news services. Meanwhile, several studies show that recommendation systems(RS) are vulnerable to data poisoning attacks, and the attackers have the ability to mislead the system to perform as their desires. A widely studied attack approach, injecting fake users, can be applied on the NRS when the NRS is treated the same as the other systems whose items are fixed. However, in the NRS, as each item (i.e. news) is more informative, we propose a novel approach to poison the NRS, which is to perturb contents of some browsed news that results in the manipulation of the rank of the target news. Intuitively, an attack is useless if it is highly likely to be caught, i.e., exposed. To address this, we introduce a notion of the exposure risk and propose a novel problem of attacking a history news dataset by means of perturbations where the goal is to maximize the manipulation of the target news rank while keeping the risk of exposure under a given budget. We design a reinforcement learning framework, called TDP-CP, which contains a two-stage hierarchical model to reduce the searching space. Meanwhile, influence estimation is also applied to save the time on retraining the NRS for rewards. We test the performance of TDP-CP under three NRSs and on different target news. Our experiments show that TDP-CP can increase the rank of the target news successfully with a limited exposure budget. ",

    "abstract": "There has been a recent surge in learning generative models for graphs. While impressive progress has been made on static graphs, work on generative modeling of temporal graphs is at a nascent stage with significant scope for improvement. First, existing generative models do not scale with either the time horizon or the number of nodes. Second, existing techniques are transductive in nature and thus do not facilitate knowledge transfer. Finally, due to relying on one-to-one node mapping from source to the generated graph, existing models leak node identity information and do not allow up-scaling/down-scaling the source graph size. In this paper, we bridge these gaps with a novel generative model called TIGGER. TIGGER derives its power through a combination of temporal point processes with auto-regressive modeling enabling both transductive and inductive variants. Through extensive experiments on real datasets, we establish TIGGER generates graphs of superior fidelity, while also being up to 3 orders of magnitude faster than the state-of-the-art. ",

    "abstract": "Integrating different representations from complementary sensing modalities is crucial for robust scene interpretation in autonomous driving. While deep learning architectures that fuse vision and range data for 2D object detection have thrived in recent years, the corresponding modalities can degrade in adverse weather or lighting conditions, ultimately leading to a drop in performance. Although domain adaptation methods attempt to bridge the domain gap between source and target domains, they do not readily extend to heterogeneous data distributions. In this work, we propose an unsupervised domain adaptation framework, which adapts a 2D object detector for RGB and lidar sensors to one or more target domains featuring adverse weather conditions. Our proposed approach consists of three components. First, a data augmentation scheme that simulates weather distortions is devised to add domain confusion and prevent overfitting on the source data. Second, to promote cross-domain foreground object alignment, we leverage the complementary features of multiple modalities through a multi-scale entropy-weighted domain discriminator. Finally, we use carefully designed pretext tasks to learn a more robust representation of the target domain data. Experiments performed on the DENSE dataset show that our method can substantially alleviate the domain gap under the single-target domain adaptation (STDA) setting and the less explored yet more general multi-target domain adaptation (MTDA) setting.

    "abstract": "Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) have drawn tremendous attention in the past three years. Compared with other deep learning modalities, high-performance hardware acceleration of GCNs is as critical but even more challenging. The hurdles arise from the poor data locality and redundant computation due to the large size, high sparsity, and irregular non-zero distribution of real-world graphs. In this paper we propose a novel hardware accelerator for GCN inference, called I-GCN, that significantly improves data locality and reduces unnecessary computation. The mechanism is a new online graph restructuring algorithm we refer to as islandization. The proposed algorithm finds clusters of nodes with strong internal but weak external connections. The islandization process yields two major benefits. First, by processing islands rather than individual nodes, there is better on-chip data reuse and fewer off-chip memory accesses. Second, there is less redundant computation as aggregation for common/shared neighbors in an island can be reused. The parallel search, identification, and leverage of graph islands are all handled purely in hardware at runtime working in an incremental pipeline. This is done without any preprocessing of the graph data or adjustment of the GCN model structure. Experimental results show that I-GCN can significantly reduce off-chip accesses and prune 38% of aggregation operations, leading to performance speedups over CPUs, GPUs, the prior art GCN accelerators of 5549x, 403x, and 5.7x on average, respectively.

We establish these results using the PASCAL RAW image data set and through a combination of experiments using neural architecture search and a fixed three-layer network. The latter reveal that training on log-gradient images leads to higher filter similarity, making the CNN more prunable.

In addition, it provides a mechanism to learn a joint distribution of the latent variable and the sparsity. Thus, unlike other approaches, it can account for the full uncertainty in the latent space. Through a series of experiments using in-distribution and out-of-distribution learning scenarios on the MNIST and Fashion-MNIST data we show that the proposed approach improves the accuracy and robustness compared with the traditional fixed -imensional priors as well as other sparsity-induction mechanisms proposed in the literature.

Despite their successes in task generality, most of them consider little mathematical modeling behind specific applications. In this paper, we focus on the sparse feature segmentation task and make a task-oriented network design, in which the target objects are sparsely distributed and the background is hard to be mathematically modeled. We start from an image decomposition model with sparsity regularization, and propose a deep unfolding network, namely IDNet, based on an iterative solver, scaled alternating direction method of multipliers (scaled-ADMM). The IDNet splits raw inputs into double feature layers. Then a new task-oriented segmentation network is constructed, dubbed as IDmUNet, based on the proposed IDNets and a mini-UNet. Because of the sparsity prior and deep unfolding method in the structure design, this IDmUNet combines the advantages of mathematical modeling and data-driven approaches. Firstly, our approach has mathematical interpretability and can achieve favorable performance with far fewer learnable parameters. Secondly, our IDmUNet is robust in a simple end-to-end training with explainable behaviors. In the experiments of retinal vessel segmentation (RVS), IDmUNet produces the state-of-the-art results with only 0.07m parameters, whereas SA-UNet, one of the latest variants of UNet, contains 0.54m and the original UNet 31.04m. Moreover, the training procedure of our network converges faster without overfitting phenomenon. This decomposition-based network construction strategy can be generalized to other problems with mathematically clear targets and complicated unclear backgrounds. ",

In this short paper, we show that a naive baseline method based on the average weekly pattern and linear regression can achieve comparable results to many state-of-the-art deep learning approaches for spatio-temporal forecasting in transportation, or even outperform them on several datasets, thus contrasting the importance of stationarity and recurrent patterns in the data with the importance of spatial correlations. Furthermore, we establish 9 different reference benchmarks that can be used to compare new approaches for spatio-temporal forecasting, and provide a discussion on best practices and the direction that the field is taking.

    "abstract": "Verifying that input-output relationships of a neural network conform to prescribed operational specifications is a key enabler towards deploying these networks in safety-critical applications. Semidefinite programming (SDP)-based approaches to Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) network verification transcribe this problem into an optimization problem, where the accuracy of any such formulation reflects the level of fidelity in how the neural network computation is represented, as well as the relaxations of intractable constraints. While the literature contains much progress on improving the tightness of SDP formulations while maintaining tractability, comparatively little work has been devoted to the other extreme, i.e., how to most accurately capture the original verification problem before SDP relaxation. In this work, we develop an exact, convex formulation of verification as a completely positive program (CPP), and provide analysis showing that our formulation is minimal -- the removal of any constraint fundamentally misrepresents the neural network computation. We leverage our formulation to provide a unifying view of existing approaches, and give insight into the source of large relaxation gaps observed in some cases. ",

    "abstract": "An important problem in the field of graph signal processing is developing appropriate overcomplete dictionaries for signals defined on different families of graphs. The Cayley graph of the symmetric group has natural applications in ranked data analysis, as its vertices represent permutations, while the generating set formalizes a notion of distance between rankings. Taking advantage of the rich theory of representations of the symmetric group, we study a particular class of frames, called Frobenius-Schur frames, where every atom belongs to the coefficient space of only one irreducible representation of the symmetric group. We provide a characterization for all Frobenius-Schur frames on the group algebra of the symmetric group which are \"compatible\" with respect to the generating set. Such frames have been previously studied for the permutahedron, the Cayley graph of the symmetric group with the generating set of adjacent transpositions, and have proved to be capable of producing meaningful interpretation of the ranked data set via the analysis coefficients. Our results generalize frame constructions for the permutahedron to any inverse-closed generating set. ",

Generating such a large dataset from MD simulations is not ideal because of their high computation cost. In this study, we present a simple supervised ML method to predict the transport properties of materials. To simplify the model, an unsupervised ML method obtains an efficient representation of molecular movements. This method was applied to predict the viscosity of lubricant molecules in confinement with shear flow. Furthermore, simplicity facilitates the interpretation of the model to understand the molecular mechanics of viscosity. We revealed two types of molecular mechanisms that contribute to low viscosity.

Robust statistical arbitrage strategies refer to self-financing trading strategies that enable profitable trading under model ambiguity. The presented novel methodology does not suffer from the curse of dimensionality nor does it depend on the identification of cointegrated pairs of assets and is therefore applicable even on high-dimensional financial markets or in markets where classical pairs trading approaches fail. Moreover, we provide a method to build an ambiguity set of admissible probability measures that can be derived from observed market data. Thus, the approach can be considered as being model-free and entirely data-driven.

A typical workaround is to naively symmetrize the adjacency matrix of the directed graph, which can however lead to discarding valuable information carried by edge directionality. In this paper, we present a generalized spectral clustering framework that can address both directed and undirected graphs. Our approach is based on the spectral relaxation of a new functional that we introduce as the generalized Dirichlet energy of a graph function, with respect to an arbitrary positive regularizing measure on the graph edges. We also propose a practical parametrization of the regularizing measure constructed from the iterated powers of the natural random walk on the graph. We present theoretical arguments to explain the efficiency of our framework in the challenging setting of unbalanced classes. Experiments using directed K-NN graphs constructed from real datasets show that our graph partitioning method performs consistently well in all cases, while outperforming existing approaches in most of them.

Current audio-visual approaches for ASD typically rely on visually pre-extracted face tracks (sequences of consecutive face crops) and the respective monaural audio. However, their recall rate is often low as only the visible faces are included in the set of candidates. Monaural audio may successfully detect the presence of speech activity but fails in localizing the speaker due to the lack of spatial cues. Our solution extends the audio front-end using a microphone array. We train an audio convolutional neural network (CNN) in combination with beamforming techniques to regress the speaker's horizontal position directly in the video frames. We propose to generate weak labels using a pre-trained active speaker detector on pre-extracted face tracks. Our pipeline embraces the \"student-teacher\" paradigm, where a trained \"teacher\" network is used to produce pseudo-labels visually. The \"student\" network is an audio network trained to generate the same results. At inference, the student network can independently localize the speaker in the visual frames directly from the audio input. Experimental results on newly collected data prove that our approach significantly outperforms a variety of other baselines as well as the teacher network itself. It results in an excellent speech activity detector too. ",

Methods In this retrospective observational noninterventional study using administrative medical claims data from 1,463,089 patients, gradient-boosted decision trees were trained to detect likely NASH patients from an at-risk patient population with a history of obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), metabolic disorder, or nonalcoholic fatty liver (NAFL). Models were trained to detect likely NASH in all at-risk patients or in the subset without a prior NAFL diagnosis (non-NAFL at-risk patients). Models were trained and validated using retrospective medical claims data and assessed using area under precision recall and receiver operating characteristic curves (AUPRCs, AUROCs). Results The 6-month incidence of NASH in claims data was 1 per 1,437 at-risk patients and 1 per 2,127 non-NAFL at-risk patients. The model trained to detect NASH in all at-risk patients had an AUPRC of 0.0107 (95% CI 0.0104 - 0.011) and an AUROC of 0.84. At 10% recall, model precision was 4.3%, which is 60x above NASH incidence. The model trained to detect NASH in non-NAFL patients had an AUPRC of 0.003 (95% CI 0.0029 - 0.0031) and an AUROC of 0.78. At 10% recall, model precision was 1%, which is 20x above NASH incidence. Conclusion The low incidence of NASH in medical claims data corroborates the pattern of NASH underdiagnosis in clinical practice. Claims-based machine learning could facilitate the detection of probable NASH patients for diagnostic testing and disease management. ",

ROSA is computationally cheap and is shown to accurately predict a range of material properties. These simple and intuitive class of descriptors are generated from the energetics of a material at a low level of theory using an incomplete ab initio calculation. We demonstrate how the incorporation of ROSA descriptors in ML-based property prediction leads to accurate predictions over a wide range of crystals, amorphized crystals, metal-organic frameworks and molecules.

In this regard, deep learning based approaches have emerged as a useful tool for ASC problems. Conventional approaches to improving the classification accuracy include integrating auxiliary methods such as attention mechanism, pre-trained models and ensemble multiple sub-networks. However, due to the complexity of audio clips captured from different environments, it is difficult to distinguish their categories without using any auxiliary methods for existing deep learning models using only a single classifier. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for ASC using deep neural decision forest (DNDF). DNDF combines a fixed number of convolutional layers and a decision forest as the final classifier. The decision forest consists of a fixed number of decision tree classifiers, which have been shown to offer better classification performance than a single classifier in some datasets. In particular, the decision forest differs substantially from traditional random forests as it is stochastic, differentiable, and capable of using the back-propagation to update and learn feature representations in neural network. Experimental results on the DCASE2019 and ESC-50 datasets demonstrate that our proposed DNDF method improves the ASC performance in terms of classification accuracy and shows competitive performance as compared with state-of-the-art baselines.

To be able to detect manoeuvres, the main starting assumption is that the object under analysis has an orbit known with a sufficient degree of precision. Based on the precise (a posteriori) orbit and radar data, several manoeuvre detection methods are presented; one is based on unscented Kalman filtering, whereas two others algorithms are based on reachability analysis of the state, which correlates its prediction set with the next track from the radar. The filtering algorithm can be extended for several radar tracks, whereas the reachability-based methods are more precise in detecting manoeuvres. Then, to inherit the best properties of both classes of algorithms, a manoeuvre detection filter that combines both concepts is finally presented. Manoeuvre detection results are presented first for simulated scenarios -- for validation and calibration purposes -- and later for real data. Radar information comes from the Spanish Space Surveillance Radar (S3TSR), with real manoeuvre information and high-quality ephemerides. The results show promise, taking into account that a single surveillance radar is the only source of data, obtaining manoeuvre detection rates of more than 50% and false positive rates of less than 10%.
