    "title": "Learning through structure: towards deep neuromorphic knowledge graph  embeddings",
    "abstract": "Computing latent representations for graph-structured data is an ubiquitous learning task in many industrial and academic applications ranging from molecule synthetization to social network analysis and recommender systems. Knowledge graphs are among the most popular and widely used data representations related to the Semantic Web. Next to structuring factual knowledge in a machine-readable format, knowledge graphs serve as the backbone of many artificial intelligence applications and allow the ingestion of context information into various learning algorithms. Graph neural networks attempt to encode graph structures in low-dimensional vector spaces via a message passing heuristic between neighboring nodes. Over the recent years, a multitude of different graph neural network architectures demonstrated ground-breaking performances in many learning tasks. In this work, we propose a strategy to map deep graph learning architectures for knowledge graph reasoning to neuromorphic architectures. Based on the insight that randomly initialized and untrained (i.e., frozen) graph neural networks are able to preserve local graph structures, we compose a frozen neural network with shallow knowledge graph embedding models. We experimentally show that already on conventional computing hardware, this leads to a significant speedup and memory reduction while maintaining a competitive performance level. Moreover, we extend the frozen architecture to spiking neural networks, introducing a novel, event-based and highly sparse knowledge graph embedding algorithm that is suitable for implementation in neuromorphic hardware.

    "abstract": "Collaboration between interconnected cyber-physical systems is becoming increasingly pervasive. Time-delays in communication channels between such systems are known to induce catastrophic failure modes, like high frequency oscillations in robotic manipulators in bilateral teleoperation or string instability in platoons of autonomous vehicles. This paper considers nonlinear time-delay systems representing coupled robotic agents, and proposes controllers that are robust to time-varying communication delays. We introduce approximations that allow the delays to be considered as implicit control inputs themselves, and formulate the problem as a zero-sum differential game between the stabilizing controllers and the delays acting adversarially. The ensuing optimal control law is finally compared to known results from Lyapunov-Krasovskii based approaches via numerical experiments. ",

For a cascade network there are a number of experimental settings for which the dynamic systems within the network can be identified. We study the problem of choosing which excitation and measurement pattern delivers the most accurate parameter estimates for the whole network. The optimal experiment is based on the accuracy assessed through the asymptotic covariance matrix of the prediction error method, while the cost criterion is the number of excitations and measurements. We develop theoretical results under the assumptions that all dynamic systems are equal and with equal signal-to-noise ratio throughout the network. We show that there are experimental settings which result in equal overall precision and that there is an excitation and measurement pattern that yields more accurate results than others. From these results a guideline based on the topology of the network emerges for the choice of the experimental setting. We provide numerical results which attest that the principles behind this guideline are also valid for more general situations. ",

We argue that the three prevailing interpretations of the GM, namely $(\\varepsilon, \\delta)$-DP, f-DP and R\\'enyi DP can be expressed by using a single parameter $\\psi$, which we term the sensitivity index. $\\psi$ uniquely characterises the GM and its properties by encapsulating its two fundamental quantities: the sensitivity of the query and the magnitude of the noise perturbation. With strong links to the ROC curve and the hypothesis-testing interpretation of DP, $\\psi$ offers the practitioner a powerful method for interpreting, comparing and communicating the privacy guarantees of Gaussian mechanisms.

    "abstract": "Neural networks are increasingly used to estimate parameters in quantitative MRI, in particular in magnetic resonance fingerprinting. Their advantages over the gold standard non-linear least square fitting are their superior speed and their immunity to the non-convexity of many fitting problems. We find, however, that in heterogeneous parameter spaces, i.e. in spaces in which the variance of the estimated parameters varies considerably, good performance is hard to achieve and requires arduous tweaking of the loss function, hyper parameters, and the distribution of the training data in parameter space. Here, we address these issues with a theoretically well-founded loss function: the Cram\\'er-Rao bound (CRB) provides a theoretical lower bound for the variance of an unbiased estimator and we propose to normalize the squared error with respective CRB. With this normalization, we balance the contributions of hard-to-estimate and not-so-hard-to-estimate parameters and areas in parameter space, and avoid a dominance of the former in the overall training loss. Further, the CRB-based loss function equals one for a maximally-efficient unbiased estimator, which we consider the ideal estimator. Hence, the proposed CRB-based loss function provides an absolute evaluation metric. We compare a network trained with the CRB-based loss with a network trained with the commonly used means squared error loss and demonstrate the advantages of the former in numerical, phantom, and in vivo experiments.

Optimal noise calibration in this setting requires efficient Jacobian matrix computations and tight bounds on the L2-sensitivity. Our framework achieves these objectives by relying on a functional analysis-based method for sensitivity tracking, which we briefly outline. This approach interoperates naturally and seamlessly with static graph-based automatic differentiation, which enables order-of-magnitude improvements in compilation times compared to previous work. Moreover, we demonstrate that optimising the sensitivity of the entire computational graph at once yields substantially tighter estimates of the true sensitivity compared to interval bound propagation techniques. Our work naturally befits recent developments in DP such as individual privacy accounting, aiming to offer improved privacy-utility trade-offs, and represents a step towards the integration of accessible machine learning tooling with advanced privacy accounting systems.

However, while techniques such as individual R\\'enyi DP (RDP) allow for granular, per-person privacy accounting, few works have investigated the impact of each input feature on the individual's privacy loss. Here we extend the view of individual RDP by introducing a new concept we call partial sensitivity, which leverages symbolic automatic differentiation to determine the influence of each input feature on the gradient norm of a function. We experimentally evaluate our approach on queries over private databases, where we obtain a feature-level contribution of private attributes to the DP guarantee of individuals. Furthermore, we explore our findings in the context of neural network training on synthetic data by investigating the partial sensitivity of input pixels on an image classification task. ",

    "abstract": "With increasing world population and expanded use of forests as cohabited regions, interactions and conflicts with wildlife are increasing, leading to large-scale loss of lives (animal and human) and livelihoods (economic). While community knowledge is valuable, forest officials and conservation organisations can greatly benefit from predictive analysis of human-wildlife conflict, leading to targeted interventions that can potentially help save lives and livelihoods. However, the problem of prediction is a complex socio-technical problem in the context of limited data in low-resource regions. Identifying the \"right\" features to make accurate predictions of conflicts at the required spatial granularity using a sparse conflict training dataset} is the key challenge that we address in this paper. Specifically, we do an illustrative case study on human-wildlife conflicts in the Bramhapuri Forest Division in Chandrapur, Maharashtra, India. Most existing work has considered human-wildlife conflicts in protected areas and to the best of our knowledge, this is the first effort at prediction of human-wildlife conflicts in unprotected areas and using those predictions for deploying interventions on the ground.

    "abstract": "Underwater acoustic cameras are high potential devices for many applications in ecology, notably for fisheries management and monitoring. However how to extract such data into high value information without a time-consuming entire dataset reading by an operator is still a challenge. Moreover the analysis of acoustic imaging, due to its low signal-to-noise ratio, is a perfect training ground for experimenting with new approaches, especially concerning Deep Learning techniques. We present hereby a novel approach that takes advantage of both CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) and classical CV (Computer Vision) techniques, able to detect a generic class ''fish'' in acoustic video streams. The pipeline pre-treats the acoustic images to extract 2 features, in order to localise the signals and improve the detection performances. To ensure the performances from an ecological point of view, we propose also a two-step validation, one to validate the results of the trainings and one to test the method on a real-world scenario. The YOLOv3-based model was trained with data of fish from multiple species recorded by the two common acoustic cameras, DIDSON and ARIS, including species of high ecological interest, as Atlantic salmon or European eels. The model we developed provides satisfying results detecting almost 80% of fish and minimizing the false positive rate, however the model is much less efficient for eel detections on ARIS videos. The first CNN pipeline for fish monitoring exploiting video data from two models of acoustic cameras satisfies most of the required features. Many challenges are still present, such as the automation of fish species identification through a multiclass model. 1 However the results point a new solution for dealing with complex data, such as sonar data, which can also be reapplied in other cases where the signal-to-noise ratio is a challenge.

The aim is to find the smallest number of connections that is still capable of solving a given task with comparable accuracy, i.e. a simpler subnetwork. We achieve comparable performance for LeNet architectures on MNIST, and significantly higher parameter compression than state-of-the-art algorithms for VGG and ResNet architectures on CIFAR-10/100 and Tiny-ImageNet. Our approach also performs well for the two different optimizers considered -- Adam and SGD. The algorithm is not designed to minimize FLOPs when considering current hardware and software implementations, although it performs reasonably when compared to the state of the art. ",

The constant motion and deformation of the mollusc nervous system, however, impose a great challenge for a consistent identification of densely packed neurons in a behaving animal. Here, we propose a cascade solution for long-term and rapid recognition of head ganglion neurons in a freely moving \\textit{C. elegans}. First, potential neuronal regions from a stack of fluorescence images are detected by a deep learning algorithm. Second, 2 dimensional neuronal regions are fused into 3 dimensional neuron entities. Third, by exploiting the neuronal density distribution surrounding a neuron and relative positional information between neurons, a multi-class artificial neural network transforms engineered neuronal feature vectors into digital neuronal identities. Under the constraint of a small number (20-40 volumes) of training samples, our bottom-up approach is able to process each volume - $1024 \\times 1024 \\times 18$ in voxels - in less than 1 second and achieves an accuracy of $91\\%$ in neuronal detection and $74\\%$ in neuronal recognition.
