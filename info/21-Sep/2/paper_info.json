    "title": "Sense representations for Portuguese: experiments with sense embeddings  and deep neural language models",
    "abstract": "Sense representations have gone beyond word representations like Word2Vec, GloVe and FastText and achieved innovative performance on a wide range of natural language processing tasks. Although very useful in many applications, the traditional approaches for generating word embeddings have a strict drawback: they produce a single vector representation for a given word ignoring the fact that ambiguous words can assume different meanings. In this paper, we explore unsupervised sense representations which, different from traditional word embeddings, are able to induce different senses of a word by analyzing its contextual semantics in a text. The unsupervised sense representations investigated in this paper are: sense embeddings and deep neural language models. We present the first experiments carried out for generating sense embeddings for Portuguese. Our experiments show that the sense embedding model (Sense2vec) outperformed traditional word embeddings in syntactic and semantic analogies task, proving that the language resource generated here can improve the performance of NLP tasks in Portuguese. We also evaluated the performance of pre-trained deep neural language models (ELMo and BERT) in two transfer learning approaches: feature based and fine-tuning, in the semantic textual similarity task. Our experiments indicate that the fine tuned Multilingual and Portuguese BERT language models were able to achieve better accuracy than the ELMo model and baselines. ",

    "title": "Quantized convolutional neural networks through the lens of partial  differential equations",
    "abstract": "Quantization of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) is a common approach to ease the computational burden involved in the deployment of CNNs, especially on low-resource edge devices. However, fixed-point arithmetic is not natural to the type of computations involved in neural networks. In this work, we explore ways to improve quantized CNNs using PDE-based perspective and analysis. First, we harness the total variation (TV) approach to apply edge-aware smoothing to the feature maps throughout the network. This aims to reduce outliers in the distribution of values and promote piece-wise constant maps, which are more suitable for quantization. Secondly, we consider symmetric and stable variants of common CNNs for image classification, and Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) for graph node-classification. We demonstrate through several experiments that the property of forward stability preserves the action of a network under different quantization rates. As a result, stable quantized networks behave similarly to their non-quantized counterparts even though they rely on fewer parameters. We also find that at times, stability even aids in improving accuracy. These properties are of particular interest for sensitive, resource-constrained, low-power or real-time applications like autonomous driving. ",

    "abstract": "For many decades, research in speech technologies has focused upon improving reliability. With this now meeting user expectations for a range of diverse applications, speech technology is today omni-present. As result, a focus on security and privacy has now come to the fore. Here, the research effort is in its relative infancy and progress calls for greater, multidisciplinary collaboration with security, privacy, legal and ethical experts among others. Such collaboration is now underway. To help catalyse the efforts, this paper provides a high-level overview of some related research. It targets the non-speech audience and describes the benchmarking methodology that has spearheaded progress in traditional research and which now drives recent security and privacy initiatives related to voice biometrics. We describe: the ASVspoof challenge relating to the development of spoofing countermeasures; the VoicePrivacy initiative which promotes research in anonymisation for privacy preservation. ",

    "abstract": "The shift-enabled property of an underlying graph is essential in designing distributed filters. This article discusses when a random graph is shift-enabled. In particular, popular graph models ER, WS, BA random graph are used, weighted and unweighted, as well as signed graphs. Our results show that the considered unweighted connected random graphs are shift-enabled with high probability when the number of edges is moderately high. However, very dense graphs, as well as fully connected graphs, are not shift-enabled. Interestingly, this behaviour is not observed for weighted connected graphs, which are always shift-enabled unless the number of edges in the graph is very low. ",

    "abstract": "Many discrete optimization problems amount to select a feasible subgraph of least weight. We consider in this paper the context of spatial graphs where the positions of the vertices are uncertain and belong to known uncertainty sets. The objective is to minimize the sum of the distances in the chosen subgraph for the worst positions of the vertices in their uncertainty sets. We first prove that these problems are NP-hard even when the feasible subgraphs consist either of all spanning trees or of all s-t paths. In view of this, we propose en exact solution algorithm combining integer programming formulations with a cutting plane algorithm, identifying the cases where the separation problem can be solved efficiently. We also propose two types of polynomial-time approximation algorithms. The first one relies on solving a nominal counterpart of the problem considering pairwise worst-case distances. We study in details the resulting approximation ratio, which depends on the structure of the metric space and of the feasible subgraphs. The second algorithm considers the special case of s-t paths and leads to a fully-polynomial time approximation scheme. Our algorithms are numerically illustrated on a subway network design problem and a facility location problem. ",
