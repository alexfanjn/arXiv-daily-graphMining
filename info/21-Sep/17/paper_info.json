    "title": "Predicting the outcome of team movements -- Player time series analysis  using fuzzy and deep methods for representation learning",
    "abstract": "We extract and use player position time-series data, tagged along with the action types, to build a competent model for representing team tactics behavioral patterns and use this representation to predict the outcome of arbitrary movements. We provide a framework for the useful encoding of short tactics and space occupations in a more extended sequence of movements or tactical plans. We investigate game segments during a match in which the team in possession of the ball regularly attempts to reach a position where they can take a shot at goal for a single game. A carefully designed and efficient kernel is employed using a triangular fuzzy membership function to create multiple time series for players' potential of presence at different court regions. Unsupervised learning is then used for time series using triplet loss and deep neural networks with exponentially dilated causal convolutions for the derived multivariate time series. This works key contribution lies in its approach to model how short scenes contribute to other longer ones and how players occupies and creates new spaces in-game court. We discuss the effectiveness of the proposed approach for prediction and recognition tasks on the professional basketball SportVU dataset for the 2015-16 half-season. The proposed system demonstrates descent functionality even with relatively small data. ",

    "title": "Network representation learning systematic review: ancestors and current  development state",
    "abstract": "Real-world information networks are increasingly occurring across various disciplines including online social networks and citation networks. These network data are generally characterized by sparseness, nonlinearity and heterogeneity bringing different challenges to the network analytics task to capture inherent properties from network data. Artificial intelligence and machine learning have been recently leveraged as powerful systems to learn insights from network data and deal with presented challenges. As part of machine learning techniques, graph embedding approaches are originally conceived for graphs constructed from feature represented datasets, like image dataset, in which links between nodes are explicitly defined. These traditional approaches cannot cope with network data challenges. As a new learning paradigm, network representation learning has been proposed to map a real-world information network into a low-dimensional space while preserving inherent properties of the network. In this paper, we present a systematic comprehensive survey of network representation learning, known also as network embedding, from birth to the current development state. Through the undertaken survey, we provide a comprehensive view of reasons behind the emergence of network embedding and, types of settings and models used in the network embedding pipeline. Thus, we introduce a brief history of representation learning and word representation learning ancestor of network embedding. We provide also formal definitions of basic concepts required to understand network representation learning followed by a description of network embedding pipeline. Most commonly used downstream tasks to evaluate embeddings, their evaluation metrics and popular datasets are highlighted. Finally, we present the open-source libraries for network embedding. ",

    "abstract": "Neural embedding-based machine learning models have shown promise for predicting novel links in knowledge graphs. Unfortunately, their practical utility is diminished by their lack of interpretability. Recently, the fully interpretable, rule-based algorithm AnyBURL yielded highly competitive results on many general-purpose link prediction benchmarks. However, current approaches for aggregating predictions made by multiple rules are affected by redundancies. We improve upon AnyBURL by introducing the SAFRAN rule application framework, which uses a novel aggregation approach called Non-redundant Noisy-OR that detects and clusters redundant rules prior to aggregation. SAFRAN yields new state-of-the-art results for fully interpretable link prediction on the established general-purpose benchmarks FB15K-237, WN18RR and YAGO3-10. Furthermore, it exceeds the results of multiple established embedding-based algorithms on FB15K-237 and WN18RR and narrows the gap between rule-based and embedding-based algorithms on YAGO3-10. ",

    "abstract": "Since the emergence of COVID-19, deep learning models have been developed to identify COVID-19 from chest X-rays. With little to no direct access to hospital data, the AI community relies heavily on public data comprising numerous data sources. Model performance results have been exceptional when training and testing on open-source data, surpassing the reported capabilities of AI in pneumonia-detection prior to the COVID-19 outbreak. In this study impactful models are trained on a widely used open-source data and tested on an external test set and a hospital dataset, for the task of classifying chest X-rays into one of three classes: COVID-19, non-COVID pneumonia and no-pneumonia. Classification performance of the models investigated is evaluated through ROC curves, confusion matrices and standard classification metrics. Explainability modules are implemented to explore the image features most important to classification. Data analysis and model evaluations show that the popular open-source dataset COVIDx is not representative of the real clinical problem and that results from testing on this are inflated. Dependence on open-source data can leave models vulnerable to bias and confounding variables, requiring careful analysis to develop clinically useful/viable AI tools for COVID-19 detection in chest X-rays.

    "abstract": "Text detection in natural scene images for content analysis is an interesting task. The research community has seen some great developments for English/Mandarin text detection. However, Urdu text extraction in natural scene images is a task not well addressed. In this work, firstly, a new dataset is introduced for Urdu text in natural scene images. The dataset comprises of 500 standalone images acquired from real scenes. Secondly, the channel enhanced Maximally Stable Extremal Region (MSER) method is applied to extract Urdu text regions as candidates in an image. Two-stage filtering mechanism is applied to eliminate non-candidate regions. In the first stage, text and noise are classified based on their geometric properties. In the second stage, a support vector machine classifier is trained to discard non-text candidate regions. After this, text candidate regions are linked using centroid-based vertical and horizontal distances. Text lines are further analyzed by a different classifier based on HOG features to remove non-text regions. Extensive experimentation is performed on the locally developed dataset to evaluate the performance. The experimental results show good performance on test set images. The dataset will be made available for research use. To the best of our knowledge, the work is the first of its kind for the Urdu language and would provide a good dataset for free research use and serve as a baseline performance on the task of Urdu text extraction.

We find that generic multiplicative perturbations away from the photo-realistic point often lead to images which appear as \"artistic renditions\" of the corresponding objects. This demonstrates an emergence of aesthetic properties directly from the structure of the photo-realistic environment coupled with its neural network parametrization. Moreover, modifying a deep semantic part of the neural network encoding leads to the appearance of symbolic visual representations. ",

    "abstract": "Confidence measure is a performance index of particular importance for automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems deployed in real-world scenarios. In the present study, utterance-level neural confidence measure (NCM) in end-to-end automatic speech recognition (E2E ASR) is investigated. The E2E system adopts the joint CTC-attention Transformer architecture. The prediction of NCM is formulated as a task of binary classification, i.e., accept/reject the input utterance, based on a set of predictor features acquired during the ASR decoding process. The investigation is focused on evaluating and comparing the efficacies of predictor features that are derived from different internal and external modules of the E2E system. Experiments are carried out on children speech, for which state-of-the-art ASR systems show less than satisfactory performance and robust confidence measure is particularly useful. It is noted that predictor features related to acoustic information of speech play a more important role in estimating confidence measure than those related to linguistic information. N-best score features show significantly better performance than single-best ones. It has also been shown that the metrics of EER and AUC are not appropriate to evaluate the NCM of a mismatched ASR with significant performance gap. ",

    "abstract": "This paper considers the problem of modeling and estimating community memberships of nodes in a directed network where every row (column) node is associated with a vector determining its membership in each row (column) community. To model such directed network, we propose directed degree corrected mixed membership (DiDCMM) model by considering degree heterogeneity. DiDCMM is identifiable under popular conditions for mixed membership network when considering degree heterogeneity. Based on the cone structure inherent in the normalized version of the left singular vectors and the simplex structure inherent in the right singular vectors of the population adjacency matrix, we build an efficient algorithm called DiMSC to infer the community membership vectors for both row nodes and column nodes. By taking the advantage of DiMSC's equivalence algorithm which returns same estimations as DiMSC and the recent development on row-wise singular vector deviation, we show that the proposed algorithm is asymptotically consistent under mild conditions by providing error bounds for the inferred membership vectors of each row node and each column node under DiDCMM. The theory is supplemented by a simulation study. ",
