    "abstract": "We consider biochemical systems associated with a generalised class of Petri nets with possibly negative token numbers. We show that the existence of a structural polyhedral Lyapunov function for the biochemical system is equivalent to the boundedness of the associated Petri net evolution or, equivalently, to the finiteness of the number of states reachable from each initial condition. For networks that do not admit a polyhedral Lyapunov function, we investigate whether it is possible to enforce polyhedral structural stability by applying a strong negative feedback on some pinned nodes: in terms of the Petri net, this is equivalent to turning pinned nodes into black holes that clear any positive or negative incoming token. If such nodes are chosen so that the transformed Petri net has bounded discrete trajectories, then there exists a stabilising pinning control: the biochemical network becomes Lyapunov stable if a sufficiently strong local negative feedback is applied to the pinned nodes. These results allow us to structurally identify the critical nodes to be locally controlled so as to ensure the stability of the whole network. ",

    "title": "An empirical evaluation of attention-based multi-head models for  improved turbofan engine remaining useful life prediction",
    "abstract": "A single unit (head) is the conventional input feature extractor in deep learning architectures trained on multivariate time series signals. The importance of the fixed-dimensional vector representation generated by the single-head network has been demonstrated for industrial machinery condition monitoring and predictive maintenance. However, processing heterogeneous sensor signals with a single head may result in a model that cannot explicitly account for the diversity in time-varying multivariate inputs. This work extends the conventional single-head deep learning models to a more robust form by developing context-specific heads to independently capture the inherent pattern of each sensor reading in multivariate time series signals. Using the turbofan aircraft engine benchmark dataset (CMAPSS), an extensive experiment is performed to verify the effectiveness and benefits of multi-head fully connected neurons, recurrent networks, convolution network, the transformer-style stand-alone attention network, and their variants for remaining useful life estimation. Moreover, the effect of different attention mechanisms on the multi-head models is also evaluated. In addition, each architecture's relative advantage and computational overhead are analyzed. Results show that utilizing the attention layer is task-sensitive and model-dependent, as it does not provide consistent improvement across the models investigated. The result is further compared with five state-of-the-art models, and the comparison shows that a relatively simple multi-head architecture performs better than the state-of-the-art models. The results presented in this study demonstrate the importance of multi-head models and attention mechanisms to improved understanding of the remaining useful life of industrial assets. ",

More importantly, the explosion of e-commerce has led to a significant increase in text conversation between customers and agents. In this paper, we propose an approach to data mining the conversation intents behind the textual data. Using the customer service data set, we train unsupervised text representation models, and then develop an intent mapping model which would rank the predefined intents base on cosine similarity between sentences and intents. Topic-modeling techniques are used to define intents and domain experts are also involved to interpret topic modelling results. With this approach, we can get a good understanding of the user intentions behind the unlabelled customer service textual data. ",

    "abstract": "Catastrophic forgetting of previously learned knowledge while learning new tasks is a widely observed limitation of contemporary neural networks. Although many continual learning methods are proposed to mitigate this drawback, the main question remains unanswered: what is the root cause of catastrophic forgetting? In this work, we aim at answering this question by posing and validating a set of research hypotheses related to the specificity of representations built internally by neural models. More specifically, we design a set of empirical evaluations that compare the robustness of representations in discriminative and generative models against catastrophic forgetting. We observe that representations learned by discriminative models are more prone to catastrophic forgetting than their generative counterparts, which sheds new light on the advantages of developing generative models for continual learning. Finally, our work opens new research pathways and possibilities to adopt generative models in continual learning beyond mere replay mechanisms. ",

    "abstract": "There has been much recent work using machine learning to answer causal queries. Most focus on interventional queries, such as the conditional average treatment effect. However, as noted by Pearl, interventional queries only form part of a larger hierarchy of causal queries, with counterfactuals sitting at the top. Despite this, our community has not fully succeeded in adapting machine learning tools to answer counterfactual queries. This work addresses this challenge by showing how to implement twin network counterfactual inference -- an alternative to abduction, action, & prediction counterfactual inference -- with deep learning to estimate counterfactual queries. We show how the graphical nature of twin networks makes them particularly amenable to deep learning, yielding simple neural network architectures that, when trained, are capable of counterfactual inference. Importantly, we show how to enforce known identifiability constraints during training, ensuring the answer to each counterfactual query is uniquely determined. We demonstrate our approach by using it to accurately estimate the probabilities of causation -- important counterfactual queries that quantify the degree to which one event was a necessary or sufficient cause of another -- on both synthetic and real data.

We can extract information of complexity of the image and can detect a sub-image with a relatively high concentration of information from this Vietoris-Rips complex.

Countries and towns took various measures such as turning school and work to remote and prohibiting social relations via curfews. In order to estimate the impact of these lockdown scenarios, we propose a multi-layer undirected weighted network, where vertices are the individuals of a town that tend to interact locally. In this network, there are seven layers such as \"household\", \"work\", \"school\", and \"friends\". Edges in a layer represent interactions that can cause a disease to spread. Depending on the type and intensity of the interactions, transmission probabilities are assigned to edges. With this layered-architecture, various lock down scenarios can be simulated by adding or removing layers. Our simulations indicate that locking down \"friends\" layer has the highest impact. ",

TSCH offers a degree of large flexibility and can be tailored to the requirements of specific applications. Several performance aspects of TSCH have been investigated so far, such as the energy consumption, the reliability, scalability and many more. However, mobility in TSCH networks remains an aspect that has not been thoroughly explored. In this paper we examine how TSCH performs under mobility situations. We define two mobile scenarios: one where autonomous agriculture vehicles move on a predefined trail, and a warehouse logistics scenario, where autonomous robots/vehicles and workers move randomly. We examine how different TSCH scheduling approaches perform on these mobility patterns and when different number of nodes are operating. The results show that the current TSCH scheduling approaches are not able to handle mobile scenarios efficiently. Moreover, the results provide insights on how TSCH scheduling can be improved for mobile applications. ",

    "abstract": "The unprecedented global crisis brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic has sparked numerous efforts to create predictive models for the detection and prognostication of SARS-CoV-2 infections with the goal of helping health systems allocate resources. Machine learning models, in particular, hold promise for their ability to leverage patient clinical information and medical images for prediction. However, most of the published COVID-19 prediction models thus far have little clinical utility due to methodological flaws and lack of appropriate validation. In this paper, we describe our methodology to develop and validate multi-modal models for COVID-19 mortality prediction using multi-center patient data. The models for COVID-19 mortality prediction were developed using retrospective data from Madrid, Spain (N=2547) and were externally validated in patient cohorts from a community hospital in New Jersey, USA (N=242) and an academic center in Seoul, Republic of Korea (N=336). The models we developed performed differently across various clinical settings, underscoring the need for a guided strategy when employing machine learning for clinical decision-making. We demonstrated that using features from both the structured electronic health records and chest X-ray imaging data resulted in better 30-day-mortality prediction performance across all three datasets (areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves: 0.85 (95% confidence interval: 0.83-0.87), 0.76 (0.70-0.82), and 0.95 (0.92-0.98)). We discuss the rationale for the decisions made at every step in developing the models and have made our code available to the research community. We employed the best machine learning practices for clinical model development. Our goal is to create a toolkit that would assist investigators and organizations in building multi-modal models for prediction, classification and/or optimization. ",

Although various data-driven vulnerability detection methods have been proposed, the task remains challenging since the diversity and complexity of real-world vulnerable code in syntax and semantics make it difficult to extract vulnerable features with regular deep learning models, especially in analyzing a large program. Moreover, the fact that real-world vulnerable codes contain a lot of redundant information unrelated to vulnerabilities will further aggravate the above problem. To mitigate such challenges, we define a novel code representation named Slice Property Graph (SPG), and then propose VulSPG, a new vulnerability detection approach using the improved R-GCN model with triple attention mechanism to identify potential vulnerabilities in SPG. Our approach has at least two advantages over other methods. First, our proposed SPG can reflect the rich semantics and explicit structural information that may be relevance to vulnerabilities, while eliminating as much irrelevant information as possible to reduce the complexity of graph. Second, VulSPG incorporates triple attention mechanism in R-GCNs to achieve more effective learning of vulnerability patterns from SPG. We have extensively evaluated VulSPG on two large-scale datasets with programs from SARD and real-world projects. Experimental results prove the effectiveness and efficiency of VulSPG. ",

However, the computational tools to provide such information are global models designed to predict if or when a (survival) event will occur. When approaching the problem of explaining differences in survival behaviour, those approaches rely on (assumptions of) predictive features followed by risk stratification. In other words, they lack the ability to discover new information on factors related to survival. In contrast, we approach such a problem from the perspective of descriptive supervised pattern mining to discover local patterns associated with different survival behaviours. Hence, we introduce the EsmamDS algorithm: an Exceptional Model Mining framework to provide straightforward characterisations of subgroups presenting unusual survival models -- given by the Kaplan-Meier estimates. This work builds on the Esmam algorithm to address the problem of pattern redundancy and provide a more informative and diverse characterisation of survival behaviour. ",

    "abstract": "Glioma is a common malignant brain tumor that shows distinct survival among patients. The isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) gene mutation status provides critical diagnostic and prognostic value for glioma and is now accepted as the standard of care. A non-invasive prediction of IDH mutation based on the pre-treatment MRI has crucial clinical significance. Machine learning and deep learning models show reasonable performance in predicting IDH mutation status. However, most models neglect the systematic brain alterations caused by tumor invasion, where the infiltration along white matter tracts throughout the brain is identified as a hallmark of glioma. Structural brain network provides an effective tool to characterise brain organisation, which could be captured by the graph neural networks (GNN) for a more accurate prediction of IDH mutation status. Here we propose a method to predict the IDH mutation using GNN, based on the structural brain network of patients. Specifically, we firstly construct a network template of healthy subjects, which consists of atlases of edges (white matter tracts) and nodes (cortical and subcortical brain regions) to provide regions of interest (ROI). Next, we employ autoencoders to extract the latent multi-modal MRI features from the ROIs of the edge and node in patients. These features of edge and node of brain networks are used to train a GNN architecture in predicting IDH mutation status. The results show that the proposed method outperforms the baseline models using 3D-CNN and 3D-DenseNet. In addition, the model interpretation suggests its ability to identify the tracts infiltrated by tumor and corresponds to clinical prior knowledge. In conclusion, integrating brain networks with GNN offers a new avenue to study brain lesions using computational neuroscience and computer vision approaches. ",

Our approach is model-free but can also incorporate moments or any other important functions of covariates that the researcher desires to balance. We find that the causal optimal transport outperforms competitor methods when both the propensity score and outcome models are misspecified, indicating it is a robust alternative to common weighting methods.

Given a graph $G=(V,E)$ without isolated vertices, the Minimum Semitotal Domination problem is to find a minimum cardinality semitotal dominating set of $G$. The semitotal domination number, denoted by $\\gamma_{t2}(G)$, is the minimum cardinality of a semitotal dominating set of $G$. The decision version of the problem remains NP-complete even when restricted to chordal graphs, chordal bipartite graphs, and planar graphs. Galby et al. in [6] proved that the problem can be solved in polynomial time for bounded MIM-width graphs which includes many well known graph classes, but left the complexity of the problem in strongly chordal graphs unresolved.
