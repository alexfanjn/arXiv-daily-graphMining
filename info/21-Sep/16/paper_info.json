    "title": "A trainable monogenic ConvNet layer robust in front of large contrast  changes in image classification",
    "abstract": "Convolutional Neural Networks (ConvNets) at present achieve remarkable performance in image classification tasks. However, current ConvNets cannot guarantee the capabilities of the mammalian visual systems such as invariance to contrast and illumination changes. Some ideas to overcome the illumination and contrast variations usually have to be tuned manually and tend to fail when tested with other types of data degradation. In this context, we present a new bio-inspired {entry} layer, M6, which detects low-level geometric features (lines, edges, and orientations) which are similar to patterns detected by the V1 visual cortex. This new trainable layer is capable of coping with image classification even with large contrast variations. The explanation for this behavior is the monogenic signal geometry, which represents each pixel value in a 3D space using quaternions, a fact that confers a degree of explainability to the networks. We compare M6 with a conventional convolutional layer (C) and a deterministic quaternion local phase layer (Q9). The experimental setup {is designed to evaluate the robustness} of our M6 enriched ConvNet model and includes three architectures, four datasets, three types of contrast degradation (including non-uniform haze degradations). The numerical results reveal that the models with M6 are the most robust in front of any kind of contrast variations. This amounts to a significant enhancement of the C models, which usually have reasonably good performance only when the same training and test degradation are used, except for the case of maximum degradation. Moreover, the Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) is used to analyze and explain the robustness effect of the M6 feature maps under any kind of contrast degradations. ",

    "abstract": "Safe UAV navigation is challenging due to the complex environment structures, dynamic obstacles, and uncertainties from measurement noises and unpredictable moving obstacle behaviors. Although plenty of recent works achieve safe navigation in complex static environments with sophisticated mapping algorithms, such as occupancy map and ESDF map, these methods cannot reliably handle dynamic environments due to the mapping limitation from moving obstacles. To address the limitation, this paper proposes a trajectory planning framework to achieve safe navigation considering complex static environments with dynamic obstacles. To reliably handle dynamic obstacles, we divide the environment representation into static mapping and dynamic object representation, which can be obtained from computer vision methods. Our framework first generates a static trajectory based on the proposed iterative corridor shrinking algorithm. Then, reactive chance-constrained model predictive control with temporal goal tracking is applied to avoid dynamic obstacles with uncertainties. The simulation results in various environments demonstrate the ability of our algorithm to navigate safely in complex static environments with dynamic obstacles. ",

    "title": "Balancing detectability and performance of attacks on the control  channel of Markov Decision Processes",
    "abstract": "We investigate the problem of designing optimal stealthy poisoning attacks on the control channel of Markov decision processes (MDPs). This research is motivated by the recent interest of the research community for adversarial and poisoning attacks applied to MDPs, and reinforcement learning (RL) methods. The policies resulting from these methods have been shown to be vulnerable to attacks perturbing the observations of the decision-maker. In such an attack, drawing inspiration from adversarial examples used in supervised learning, the amplitude of the adversarial perturbation is limited according to some norm, with the hope that this constraint will make the attack imperceptible. However, such constraints do not grant any level of undetectability and do not take into account the dynamic nature of the underlying Markov process. In this paper, we propose a new attack formulation, based on information-theoretical quantities, that considers the objective of minimizing the detectability of the attack as well as the performance of the controlled process. We analyze the trade-off between the efficiency of the attack and its detectability. We conclude with examples and numerical simulations illustrating this trade-off. ",

    "abstract": "Neural network-based methods are the state of the art in negation scope resolution. However, they often use the unrealistic assumption that cue information is completely accurate. Even if this assumption holds, there remains a dependency on engineered features from state-of-the-art machine learning methods. The current study adopted a two-step negation resolving apporach to assess whether a Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory-based method can be used for cue detection as well, and how inaccurate cue predictions would affect the scope resolution performance. Results suggest that this method is not suitable for negation detection. Scope resolution performance is most robust against inaccurate information for models with a recurrent layer only, compared to extensions with a Conditional Random Fields layer or a post-processing algorithm. We advocate for more research into the application of deep learning on negation detection and the effect of imperfect information on scope resolution. ",

    "abstract": "In the recent years, cybersecurity has gained high relevance, converting the detection of attacks or intrusions into a key task. In fact, a small breach in a system, application, or network, can cause huge damage for the companies. However, when this attack detection encounters the Artificial Intelligence paradigm, it can be addressed using high-quality classifiers which often need high resource demands in terms of computation or memory usage. This situation has a high impact when the attack classifiers need to be used with limited resourced devices or without overloading the performance of the devices, as it happens for example in IoT devices, or in industrial systems. For overcoming this issue, NBcoded, a novel light attack classification tool is proposed in this work. NBcoded works in a pipeline combining the removal of noisy data properties of the encoders with the low resources and timing consuming obtained by the Naive Bayes classifier. This work compares three different NBcoded implementations based on three different Naive Bayes likelihood distribution assumptions (Gaussian, Complement and Bernoulli). Then, the best NBcoded is compared with state of the art classifiers like Multilayer Perceptron and Random Forest. Our implementation shows to be the best model reducing the impact of training time and disk usage, even if it is outperformed by the other two in terms of Accuracy and F1-score (~ 2%). ",

    "abstract": "One of the main components of an autonomous vehicle is the obstacle detection pipeline. Most prototypes, both from research and industry, rely on lidars for this task. Pointcloud information from lidar is usually combined with data from cameras and radars, but the backbone of the architecture is mainly based on 3D bounding boxes computed from lidar data. To retrieve an accurate representation, sensors with many planes, e.g., greater than 32 planes, are usually employed. The returned pointcloud is indeed dense and well defined, but high-resolution sensors are still expensive and often require powerful GPUs to be processed. Lidars with fewer planes are cheaper, but the returned data are not dense enough to be processed with state of the art deep learning approaches to retrieve 3D bounding boxes. In this paper, we propose two solutions based on occupancy grid and geometric refinement to retrieve a list of 3D bounding boxes employing lidar with a low number of planes (i.e., 16 and 8 planes). Our solutions have been validated on a custom acquired dataset with accurate ground truth to prove its feasibility and accuracy. ",

    "abstract": "Decisions and the underlying rules are indispensable for driving process execution during runtime, i.e., for routing process instances at alternative branches based on the values of process data. Decision rules can comprise unary data conditions, e.g., age > 40, binary data conditions where the relation between two or more variables is relevant, e.g. temperature1 < temperature2, and more complex conditions that refer to, for example, parts of a medical image. Decision discovery aims at automatically deriving decision rules from process event logs. Existing approaches focus on the discovery of unary, or in some instances binary data conditions. The discovered decision rules are usually evaluated using accuracy, but not with regards to their semantics and meaningfulness, although this is crucial for validation and the subsequent implementation/adaptation of the decision rules. Hence, this paper compares three decision mining approaches, i.e., two existing ones and one newly described approach, with respect to the meaningfulness of their results. For comparison, we use one synthetic data set for a realistic manufacturing case and the two real-world BPIC 2017/2020 logs. The discovered rules are discussed with regards to their semantics and meaningfulness. ",

    "abstract": "Neural network applications have become popular in both enterprise and personal settings. Network solutions are tuned meticulously for each task, and designs that can robustly resolve queries end up in high demand. As the commercial value of accurate and performant machine learning models increases, so too does the demand to protect neural architectures as confidential investments. We explore the vulnerability of neural networks deployed as black boxes across accelerated hardware through electromagnetic side channels. We examine the magnetic flux emanating from a graphics processing unit's power cable, as acquired by a cheap $3 induction sensor, and find that this signal betrays the detailed topology and hyperparameters of a black-box neural network model. The attack acquires the magnetic signal for one query with unknown input values, but known input dimensions. The network reconstruction is possible due to the modular layer sequence in which deep neural networks are evaluated. We find that each layer component's evaluation produces an identifiable magnetic signal signature, from which layer topology, width, function type, and sequence order can be inferred using a suitably trained classifier and a joint consistency optimization based on integer programming. We study the extent to which network specifications can be recovered, and consider metrics for comparing network similarity. We demonstrate the potential accuracy of this side channel attack in recovering the details for a broad range of network architectures, including random designs. We consider applications that may exploit this novel side channel exposure, such as adversarial transfer attacks. In response, we discuss countermeasures to protect against our method and other similar snooping techniques. ",

Precise simulation of photon transport is widely used to understand the probability of photon detection in liquid argon detectors. Traditional photon transport simulation, which tracks every photon using theGeant4simulation toolkit, is a major computational challenge for kilo-tonne-scale liquid argon detectors and GeV-level energy depositions. In this work, we propose a one-dimensional generative model which efficiently generates features using an OuterProduct-layer. This model bypasses photon transport simulation and predicts the number of photons detected by particular photon detectors at the same level of detail as theGeant4simulation. The application to simulating photon detection systems in kilo-tonne-scale liquid argon detectors demonstrates this novel generative model is able to reproduceGeant4simulation with good accuracy and 20 to 50 times faster. This generative model can be used to quickly predict photon detection probability in huge liquid argon detectors like ProtoDUNE or DUNE. ",

    "abstract": "Ultrasonic methods have great potential applications to detect and characterize defects in multi-layered bonded composites. However, it remains challenging to quantitatively reconstruct defects, such as disbonds and kissing bonds, that influence the integrity of adhesive bonds and seriously reduce the strength of assemblies. In this work, an ultrasonic method based on the supervised fully convolutional network (FCN) is proposed to quantitatively reconstruct defects hidden in multi-layered bonded composites. In the training process of this method, an FCN establishes a non-linear mapping from measured ultrasonic data to the corresponding velocity models of multi-layered bonded composites. In the predicting process, the trained network obtained from the training process is used to directly reconstruct the velocity models from the new measured ultrasonic data of adhesively bonded composites. The presented FCN-based inversion method can automatically extract useful features in multi-layered composites. Although this method is computationally expensive in the training process, the prediction itself in the online phase takes only seconds. The numerical results show that the FCN-based ultrasonic inversion method is capable to accurately reconstruct ultrasonic velocity models of the high contrast defects, which has great potential for online detection of adhesively bonded composites.

    "abstract": "Noise suppression is an essential step in any seismic processing workflow. A portion of this noise, particularly in land datasets, presents itself as random noise. In recent years, neural networks have been successfully used to denoise seismic data in a supervised fashion. However, supervised learning always comes with the often unachievable requirement of having noisy-clean data pairs for training. Using blind-spot networks, we redefine the denoising task as a self-supervised procedure where the network uses the surrounding noisy samples to estimate the noise-free value of a central sample. Based on the assumption that noise is statistically independent between samples, the network struggles to predict the noise component of the sample due to its randomnicity, whilst the signal component is accurately predicted due to its spatio-temporal coherency. Illustrated on synthetic examples, the blind-spot network is shown to be an efficient denoiser of seismic data contaminated by random noise with minimal damage to the signal; therefore, providing improvements in both the image domain and down-the-line tasks, such as inversion. To conclude the study, the suggested approach is applied to field data and the results are compared with two commonly used random denoising techniques: FX-deconvolution and Curvelet transform. By demonstrating that blind-spot networks are an efficient suppressor of random noise, we believe this is just the beginning of utilising self-supervised learning in seismic applications. ",

But the behavior of these neural network (NN) controllers is still not well understood. In this paper we use numerical simulations to demonstrate that typical test accuracy metrics do not effectively capture the ability of an NN controller to stabilize a system. In particular, some NNs with high test accuracy can fail to stabilize the dynamics. To address this we propose two NN architectures which locally approximate a linear quadratic regulator (LQR). Numerical simulations confirm our intuition that the proposed architectures reliably produce stabilizing feedback controllers without sacrificing performance. In addition, we introduce a preliminary theoretical result describing some stability properties of such NN-controlled systems. ",
