    "abstract": "How human behavior is influenced by a social network that they belong has been an interested topic in applied research. Existing methods often utilized scale-level behavioral data to estimate the influence of a social network on human behavior. This study proposes a novel approach to studying social influence by using item-level behavioral measures. Under the latent space modeling framework, we integrate the two latent spaces for respondents' social network data and item-level behavior measures. We then measure social influence as the impact of the latent space configuration contributed by the social network data on the behavior data. The performance and properties of the proposed approach are evaluated via simulation studies. We apply the proposed model to an empirical dataset to explain how students' friendship network influences their participation in school activities. ",

    "abstract": "An exact $(k,d)$-coloring of a graph $G$ is a coloring of its vertices with $k$ colors such that each vertex $v$ is adjacent to exactly $d$ vertices having the same color as $v$. The exact $d$-defective chromatic number, denoted $\\chi_d^=(G)$, is the minimum $k$ such that there exists an exact $(k,d)$-coloring of $G$. In an exact $(k,d)$-coloring, which for $d=0$ corresponds to a proper coloring, each color class induces a $d$-regular subgraph. We give basic properties for the parameter and determine its exact value for cycles, trees, and complete graphs. In addition, we establish bounds on $\\chi_d^=(G)$ for all relevant values of $d$ when $G$ is planar, chordal, or has bounded treewidth. We also give polynomial-time algorithms for finding certain types of exact $(k,d)$-colorings in cactus graphs and block graphs. Our main result is on the computational complexity of $d$-EXACT DEFECTIVE $k$-COLORING in which we are given a graph $G$ and asked to decide whether $\\chi_d^=(G) \\leq k$.

    "abstract": "Flow network models can capture the underlying physics and operational constraints of many networked systems including the power grid and transportation and water networks. However, analyzing reliability of systems using computationally expensive flow-based models faces substantial challenges, especially for rare events. Existing actively trained meta-models, which present a new promising direction in reliability analysis, are not applicable to networks due to the inability of these methods to handle high-dimensional problems as well as discrete or mixed variable inputs. This study presents the first adaptive surrogate-based Network Reliability Analysis using Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (ANR-BART). This approach integrates BART and Monte Carlo simulation (MCS) via an active learning method that identifies the most valuable training samples based on the credible intervals derived by BART over the space of predictor variables as well as the proximity of the points to the estimated limit state. Benchmark power grids including IEEE 30, 57, 118, and 300-bus systems and their power flow models for cascading failure analysis are considered to investigate ANR-BART, MCS, subset simulation, and passively-trained optimal deep neural networks and BART. Results indicate that ANR-BART is robust and yields accurate estimates of network failure probability, while significantly reducing the computational cost of reliability analysis. ",

    "abstract": "Variational phase-field methods have been shown powerful for the modeling of complex crack propagation without a priori knowledge of the crack path or ad hoc criteria. However, phase-field models suffer from their energy functional being non-linear and non-convex, while requiring a very fine mesh to capture the damage gradient. This implies a high computational cost, limiting concrete engineering applications of the method. In this work, we propose an efficient and robust fully monolithic solver for phase-field fracture using a modified Newton method with inertia correction and an energy line-search. To illustrate the gains in efficiency obtained with our approach, we compare it to two popular methods for phase-field fracture, namely the alternating minimization and the quasi-monolithic schemes. To facilitate the evaluation of the time step dependent quasi-monolithic scheme, we couple the latter with an extrapolation correction loop controlled by a damage-based criteria. Finally, we show through four benchmark tests that the modified Newton method we propose is straightforward, robust, and leads to identical solutions, while offering a reduction in computation time by factors of up to 12 and 6 when compared to the alternating minimization and quasi-monolithic schemes.

An ABS based anomaly classifier model is presented, incorporating elements of the AIS. In this way, a new model (R-ABS) is developed which includes the advantageous capabilities of an ABS plus the reactive capabilities of an AIS to overcome its weaknesses and disadvantages. The RABS model was tested using the well-known DARPA'98 dataset, plus a dataset built to carry out a greater number of experiments. The performance of the RABS model was compared to the performance of the ABS model based on classical sensitivity and specificity metrics, plus a response time metric to illustrate the rapid response of R-ABS relative to ABS. The results showed a better performance of R-ABS, especially in terms of detection time. ",

    "abstract": "One of the most common problems encountered in human-computer interaction is automatic facial expression recognition. Although it is easy for human observer to recognize facial expressions, automatic recognition remains difficult for machines. One of the methods that machines can recognize facial expression is analyzing the changes in face during facial expression presentation. In this paper, optical flow algorithm was used to extract deformation or motion vectors created in the face because of facial expressions. Then, these extracted motion vectors are used to be analyzed. Their positions and directions were exploited for automatic facial expression recognition using different data mining techniques. It means that by employing motion vector features used as our data, facial expressions were recognized. Some of the most state-of-the-art classification algorithms such as C5.0, CRT, QUEST, CHAID, Deep Learning (DL), SVM and Discriminant algorithms were used to classify the extracted motion vectors. Using 10-fold cross validation, their performances were calculated. To compare their performance more precisely, the test was repeated 50 times. Meanwhile, the deformation of face was also analyzed in this research. For example, what exactly happened in each part of face when a person showed fear? Experimental results on Extended Cohen-Kanade (CK+) facial expression dataset demonstrated that the best methods were DL, SVM and C5.0, with the accuracy of 95.3%, 92.8% and 90.2% respectively. ",

    "abstract": "Liver segmentation on images acquired using computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) plays an important role in clinical management of liver diseases. Compared to MRI, CT images of liver are more abundant and readily available. However, MRI can provide richer quantitative information of the liver compared to CT. Thus, it is desirable to achieve unsupervised domain adaptation for transferring the learned knowledge from the source domain containing labeled CT images to the target domain containing unlabeled MR images. In this work, we report a novel unsupervised domain adaptation framework for cross-modality liver segmentation via joint adversarial learning and self-learning. We propose joint semantic-aware and shape-entropy-aware adversarial learning with post-situ identification manner to implicitly align the distribution of task-related features extracted from the target domain with those from the source domain. In proposed framework, a network is trained with the above two adversarial losses in an unsupervised manner, and then a mean completer of pseudo-label generation is employed to produce pseudo-labels to train the next network (desired model). Additionally, semantic-aware adversarial learning and two self-learning methods, including pixel-adaptive mask refinement and student-to-partner learning, are proposed to train the desired model. To improve the robustness of the desired model, a low-signal augmentation function is proposed to transform MRI images as the input of the desired model to handle hard samples. Using the public data sets, our experiments demonstrated the proposed unsupervised domain adaptation framework outperformed four supervised learning methods with a Dice score 0.912 plus or minus 0.037 (mean plus or minus standard deviation).

Recently, the study of this problem has been extended in two directions. First, the problem of recoloring, that is computing an efficient transformation between two given colorings (instead of computing a new coloring), has been considered, both to model radio network updates, and as a useful subroutine for coloring. Second, as it appears that general graphs and bounded-degree graphs do not model real networks very well (with, respectively, pathological worst-case topologies and too strong assumptions), coloring has been studied in more specific graph classes. In this paper, we study the intersection of these two directions: distributed recoloring in two relevant graph classes, interval and chordal graphs. ",

    "abstract": "Universal identifiers and hashing have been widely adopted in computer science from distributed financial transactions to data science. This is a consequence of their capability to avoid many shortcomings of relative identifiers, such as limited scope and the need for central management. However, the current identifiers in use are isolated entities which cannot provide much information about the relationship between objects. As an example, if one has both the identifiers of an object and its transformed version, no information about how they are related can be obtained without resorting to some kind of authority or additionally appended information. Moreover, given an input object and an arbitrarily long sequence of costly steps, one cannot currently predict the identifier of the outcome without actually processing the entire sequence. The capability of predicting the resulting identifier and avoiding redundant calculations is highly desirable in an efficient unmanaged system. In this paper, we propose a new kind of unique identifier that is calculated from the list of events that can produce an object, instead of directly identifying it by content. This provides an identification scheme regardless of the object's current existence, thus allowing to inexpensively check for its content in a database and retrieve it when it has already been calculated before. These identifiers are proposed in the context of abstract algebra, where objects are represented by elements that can be operated according to useful properties, such as associativity, order sensitivity when desired, and reversibility, while simplicity of implementation and strong guarantees are given by well known group theory results.

    "abstract": "Zero-shot object detection (ZSD), the task that extends conventional detection models to detecting objects from unseen categories, has emerged as a new challenge in computer vision. Most existing approaches tackle the ZSD task with a strict mapping-transfer strategy, which may lead to suboptimal ZSD results: 1) the learning process of those models ignores the available unseen class information, and thus can be easily biased towards the seen categories; 2) the original visual feature space is not well-structured and lack of discriminative information. To address these issues, we develop a novel Semantics-Guided Contrastive Network for ZSD, named ContrastZSD, a detection framework that first brings contrastive learning mechanism into the realm of zero-shot detection. Particularly, ContrastZSD incorporates two semantics-guided contrastive learning subnets that contrast between region-category and region-region pairs respectively. The pairwise contrastive tasks take advantage of additional supervision signals derived from both ground truth label and pre-defined class similarity distribution. Under the guidance of those explicit semantic supervision, the model can learn more knowledge about unseen categories to avoid the bias problem to seen concepts, while optimizing the data structure of visual features to be more discriminative for better visual-semantic alignment. Extensive experiments are conducted on two popular benchmarks for ZSD, i.e., PASCAL VOC and MS COCO. Results show that our method outperforms the previous state-of-the-art on both ZSD and generalized ZSD tasks. ",

    "abstract": "The unprecedented success of deep learning (DL) makes it unchallenged when it comes to classification problems. However, it is well established that the current DL methodology produces universally unstable neural networks (NNs). The instability problem has caused an enormous research effort -- with a vast literature on so-called adversarial attacks -- yet there has been no solution to the problem. Our paper addresses why there has been no solution to the problem, as we prove the following mathematical paradox: any training procedure based on training neural networks for classification problems with a fixed architecture will yield neural networks that are either inaccurate or unstable (if accurate) -- despite the provable existence of both accurate and stable neural networks for the same classification problems. The key is that the stable and accurate neural networks must have variable dimensions depending on the input, in particular, variable dimensions is a necessary condition for stability. Our result points towards the paradox that accurate and stable neural networks exist, however, modern algorithms do not compute them. This yields the question: if the existence of neural networks with desirable properties can be proven, can one also find algorithms that compute them? There are cases in mathematics where provable existence implies computability, but will this be the case for neural networks? The contrary is true, as we demonstrate how neural networks can provably exist as approximate minimisers to standard optimisation problems with standard cost functions, however, no randomised algorithm can compute them with probability better than 1/2.

We quantify the mismatch between written and conversational text domains by comparing the joint distributions of punctuation and word cases, and by testing our model cross-domain.

Given variational autoencoder's (VAE) strength of reducing high dimensional data into few principal components, here we coin a new concept of \"VAE order parameter\". We propose that the Manhattan distance in the VAE latent space can serve as a generic order parameter for order-disorder phase transitions. The physical properties of the order parameter are quantitatively interpreted and demonstrated by multiple refractory high-entropy alloys. Assisted by it, a generally applicable alloy design concept is proposed by mimicking the nature mixing of elements.

These models generalize well on an external CRC cohort (0.97 AUC on PAIP) and improve transfer from one organ to another.

In this work, we generated synthetic time series gene expression data from a range of archetypal GRNs and we relied on a dual attention RNN to predict the gene temporal dynamics. We show that the prediction is extremely accurate for GRNs with different architectures. Next, we focused on the attention mechanism of the RNN and, using tools from graph theory, we found that its graph properties allow to hierarchically distinguish different architectures of the GRN. We show that the GRNs respond differently to the addition of noise in the prediction by the RNN and we relate the noise response to the analysis of the attention mechanism. In conclusion, this work provides a a way to understand and exploit the attention mechanism of RNN and it paves the way to RNN-based methods for time series prediction and inference of GRNs from gene expression data.
