    "title": "Object recognition for robotics from tactile time series data utilising  different neural network architectures",
    "abstract": "Robots need to exploit high-quality information on grasped objects to interact with the physical environment. Haptic data can therefore be used for supplementing the visual modality. This paper investigates the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) neural network architectures for object classification on Spatio-temporal tactile grasping data. Furthermore, we compared these methods using data from two different fingertip sensors (namely the BioTac SP and WTS-FT) in the same physical setup, allowing for a realistic comparison across methods and sensors for the same tactile object classification dataset. Additionally, we propose a way to create more training examples from the recorded data. The results show that the proposed method improves the maximum accuracy from 82.4% (BioTac SP fingertips) and 90.7% (WTS-FT fingertips) with complete time-series data to about 94% for both sensor types.

    "title": "A structure preserving numerical scheme for Fokker-Planck equations of  structured neural networks with learning rules",
    "abstract": "In this work, we are concerned with a Fokker-Planck equation related to the nonlinear noisy leaky integrate-and-fire model for biological neural networks which are structured by the synaptic weights and equipped with the Hebbian learning rule. The equation contains a small parameter $\\varepsilon$ separating the time scales of learning and reacting behavior of the neural system, and an asymptotic limit model can be derived by letting $\\varepsilon\\to 0$, where the microscopic quasi-static states and the macroscopic evolution equation are coupled through the total firing rate. To handle the endowed flux-shift structure and the multi-scale dynamics in a unified framework, we propose a numerical scheme for this equation that is mass conservative, unconditionally positivity preserving, and asymptotic preserving. We provide extensive numerical tests to verify the schemes' properties and carry out a set of numerical experiments to investigate the model's learning ability, and explore the solution's behavior when the neural network is excitatory.

    "abstract": "Although the values of individual soccer players have become astronomical, subjective judgments still play a big part in the player analysis. Recently, there have been new attempts to quantitatively grasp players' styles using video-based event stream data. However, they have some limitations in scalability due to high annotation costs and sparsity of event stream data. In this paper, we build a triplet network named 6MapNet that can effectively capture the movement styles of players using in-game GPS data. Without any annotation of soccer-specific actions, we use players' locations and velocities to generate two types of heatmaps. Our subnetworks then map these heatmap pairs into feature vectors whose similarity corresponds to the actual similarity of playing styles. The experimental results show that players can be accurately identified with only a small number of matches by our method. ",

    "abstract": "Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is a valuable tool for personalised, non-invasive evaluation of hemodynamics in arteries, but its complexity and time-consuming nature prohibit large-scale use in practice. Recently, the use of deep learning for rapid estimation of CFD parameters like wall shear stress (WSS) on surface meshes has been investigated. However, existing approaches typically depend on a hand-crafted re-parametrisation of the surface mesh to match convolutional neural network architectures. In this work, we propose to instead use mesh convolutional neural networks that directly operate on the same finite-element surface mesh as used in CFD. We train and evaluate our method on two datasets of synthetic coronary artery models with and without bifurcation, using a ground truth obtained from CFD simulation. We show that our flexible deep learning model can accurately predict 3D WSS vectors on this surface mesh. Our method processes new meshes in less than 5 [s], consistently achieves a normalised mean absolute error of $\\leq$ 1.6 [%], and peaks at 90.5 [%] median approximation accuracy over the held-out test set, comparing favorably to previously published work. This shows the feasibility of CFD surrogate modelling using mesh convolutional neural networks for hemodynamic parameter estimation in artery models. ",

Generative neural networks have emerged as a powerful approach to sample novel molecules from a learned distribution. Here, we propose a conditional generative neural network for 3d molecular structures with specified structural and chemical properties. This approach is agnostic to chemical bonding and enables targeted sampling of novel molecules from conditional distributions, even in domains where reference calculations are sparse. We demonstrate the utility of our method for inverse design by generating molecules with specified composition or motifs, discovering particularly stable molecules, and jointly targeting multiple electronic properties beyond the training regime.
