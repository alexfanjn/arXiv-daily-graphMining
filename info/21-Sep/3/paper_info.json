    "abstract": "Measuring the built and natural environment at a fine-grained scale is now possible with low-cost urban environmental sensor networks. However, fine-grained city-scale data analysis is complicated by tedious data cleaning including removing outliers and imputing missing data. While many methods exist to automatically correct anomalies and impute missing entries, challenges still exist on data with large spatial-temporal scales and shifting patterns. To address these challenges, we propose an online robust tensor recovery (OLRTR) method to preprocess streaming high-dimensional urban environmental datasets. A small-sized dictionary that captures the underlying patterns of the data is computed and constantly updated with new data. OLRTR enables online recovery for large-scale sensor networks that provide continuous data streams, with a lower computational memory usage compared to offline batch counterparts. In addition, we formulate the objective function so that OLRTR can detect structured outliers, such as faulty readings over a long period of time. We validate OLRTR on a synthetically degraded National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration temperature dataset, with a recovery error of 0.05, and apply it to the Array of Things city-scale sensor network in Chicago, IL, showing superior results compared with several established online and batch-based low rank decomposition methods.

    "abstract": "Recent advances in deep learning have expanded possibilities to generate music, but generating a customizable full piece of music with consistent long-term structure remains a challenge. This paper introduces MusicFrameworks, a hierarchical music structure representation and a multi-step generative process to create a full-length melody guided by long-term repetitive structure, chord, melodic contour, and rhythm constraints. We first organize the full melody with section and phrase-level structure. To generate melody in each phrase, we generate rhythm and basic melody using two separate transformer-based networks, and then generate the melody conditioned on the basic melody, rhythm and chords in an auto-regressive manner. By factoring music generation into sub-problems, our approach allows simpler models and requires less data. To customize or add variety, one can alter chords, basic melody, and rhythm structure in the music frameworks, letting our networks generate the melody accordingly. Additionally, we introduce new features to encode musical positional information, rhythm patterns, and melodic contours based on musical domain knowledge. A listening test reveals that melodies generated by our method are rated as good as or better than human-composed music in the POP909 dataset about half the time. ",

    "abstract": "With many frameworks based on message passing neural networks proposed to predict molecular and bulk properties, machine learning methods have tremendously shifted the paradigms of computational sciences underpinning physics, material science, chemistry, and biology. While existing machine learning models have yielded superior performances in many occasions, most of them model and process molecular systems in terms of homogeneous graph, which severely limits the expressive power for representing diverse interactions. In practice, graph data with multiple node and edge types is ubiquitous and more appropriate for molecular systems. Thus, we propose the heterogeneous relational message passing network (HermNet), an end-to-end heterogeneous graph neural networks, to efficiently express multiple interactions in a single model with {\\it ab initio} accuracy. HermNet performs impressively against many top-performing models on both molecular and extended systems. Specifically, HermNet outperforms other tested models in nearly 75\\%, 83\\% and 94\\% of tasks on MD17, QM9 and extended systems datasets, respectively. Finally, we elucidate how the design of HermNet is compatible with quantum mechanics from the perspective of the density functional theory. Besides, HermNet is a universal framework, whose sub-networks could be replaced by other advanced models. ",

    "abstract": "It is reported that the number of online payment users in China has reached 854 million; with the emergence of community e-commerce platforms, the trend of integration of e-commerce and social applications is increasingly intense. Community e-commerce is not a mature and sound comprehensive e-commerce with fewer categories and low brand value. To effectively retain community users and fully explore customer value has become an important challenge for community e-commerce operators. Given the above problems, this paper uses the data-driven method to study the prediction of community e-commerce customers' repurchase behaviour. The main research contents include 1. Given the complex problem of feature engineering, the classic model RFM in the field of customer relationship management is improved, and an improved model is proposed to describe the characteristics of customer buying behaviour, which includes five indicators. 2. In view of the imbalance of machine learning training samples in SMOTE-ENN, a training sample balance using SMOTE-ENN is proposed. The experimental results show that the machine learning model can be trained more effectively on balanced samples. 3. Aiming at the complexity of the parameter adjustment process, an automatic hyperparameter optimization method based on the TPE method was proposed. Compared with other methods, the model's prediction performance is improved, and the training time is reduced by more than 450%. 4. Aiming at the weak prediction ability of a single model, the soft voting based RF-LightgBM model was proposed. The experimental results show that the RF-LighTGBM model proposed in this paper can effectively predict customer repurchase behaviour, and the F1 value is 0.859, which is better than the single model and previous research results.

    "abstract": "Understanding the behaviors and intentions of pedestrians is still one of the main challenges for vehicle autonomy, as accurate predictions of their intentions can guarantee their safety and driving comfort of vehicles. In this paper, we address pedestrian crossing prediction in urban traffic environments by linking the dynamics of a pedestrian's skeleton to a binary crossing intention. We introduce TrouSPI-Net: a context-free, lightweight, multi-branch predictor. TrouSPI-Net extracts spatio-temporal features for different time resolutions by encoding pseudo-images sequences of skeletal joints' positions and processes them with parallel attention modules and atrous convolutions. The proposed approach is then enhanced by processing features such as relative distances of skeletal joints, bounding box positions, or ego-vehicle speed with U-GRUs. Using the newly proposed evaluation procedures for two large public naturalistic data sets for studying pedestrian behavior in traffic: JAAD and PIE, we evaluate TrouSPI-Net and analyze its performance. Experimental results show that TrouSPI-Net achieved 0.76 F1 score on JAAD and 0.80 F1 score on PIE, therefore outperforming current state-of-the-art while being lightweight and context-free. ",

    "abstract": "Recent work in scientific machine learning has developed so-called physics-informed neural network (PINN) models. The typical approach is to incorporate physical domain knowledge as soft constraints on an empirical loss function and use existing machine learning methodologies to train the model. We demonstrate that, while existing PINN methodologies can learn good models for relatively trivial problems, they can easily fail to learn relevant physical phenomena even for simple PDEs. In particular, we analyze several distinct situations of widespread physical interest, including learning differential equations with convection, reaction, and diffusion operators. We provide evidence that the soft regularization in PINNs, which involves differential operators, can introduce a number of subtle problems, including making the problem ill-conditioned. Importantly, we show that these possible failure modes are not due to the lack of expressivity in the NN architecture, but that the PINN's setup makes the loss landscape very hard to optimize. We then describe two promising solutions to address these failure modes. The first approach is to use curriculum regularization, where the PINN's loss term starts from a simple PDE regularization, and becomes progressively more complex as the NN gets trained. The second approach is to pose the problem as a sequence-to-sequence learning task, rather than learning to predict the entire space-time at once. Extensive testing shows that we can achieve up to 1-2 orders of magnitude lower error with these methods as compared to regular PINN training. ",

In addition to a continued focus upon logical and physical access tasks in which there are a number of advances compared to previous editions, ASVspoof 2021 introduces a new task involving deepfake speech detection. This paper describes all three tasks, the new databases for each of them, the evaluation metrics, four challenge baselines, the evaluation platform and a summary of challenge results. Despite the introduction of channel and compression variability which compound the difficulty, results for the logical access and deepfake tasks are close to those from previous ASVspoof editions. Results for the physical access task show the difficulty in detecting attacks in real, variable physical spaces. With ASVspoof 2021 being the first edition for which participants were not provided with any matched training or development data and with this reflecting real conditions in which the nature of spoofed and deepfake speech can never be predicated with confidence, the results are extremely encouraging and demonstrate the substantial progress made in the field in recent years.

    "abstract": "Breast cancer is the most prevalent cancer worldwide and over two million new cases are diagnosed each year. As part of the tumour grading process, histopathologists manually count how many cells are dividing, in a biological process called mitosis. Artificial intelligence (AI) methods have been developed to automatically detect mitotic figures, however these methods often perform poorly when applied to data from outside of the original (training) domain, i.e. they do not generalise well to histology images created using varied staining protocols or digitised using different scanners. Style transfer, a form of domain adaptation, provides the means to transform images from different domains to a shared visual appearance and have been adopted in various applications to mitigate the issue of domain shift. In this paper we train two mitosis detection models and two style transfer methods and evaluate the usefulness of the latter for improving mitosis detection performance in images digitised using different scanners. We found that the best of these models, U-Net without style transfer, achieved an F1-score of 0.693 on the MIDOG 2021 preliminary test set. ",

These evolve from a structure covering uniformly a continuous space towards an optimal design in terms of optimal transport theory. At convergence, the networks should optimize the way resources are transported through it. As the network structure shapes in time towards optimality, its topological properties also change with it. The question is how do these change as we reach optimality. We study the behavior of various network properties on a number of network sequences evolving towards optimal design and find that the transport cost function converges earlier than network properties and that these monotonically decrease. This suggests a mechanism for designing optimal networks by compressing dense structures. We find a similar behavior in networks extracted from real images of the networks designed by the body shape of a slime mold evolving in time. ",
