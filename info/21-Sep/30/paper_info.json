    "abstract": "In this work, we investigate the impact of two cooperative unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based jammers on the secrecy performance of a ground wireless network in the presence of an eavesdropper. For that purpose, we investigate the secrecy-area related metrics, Jamming Coverage and Jamming Efficiency. Moreover, we propose a hybrid metric, the so-called Weighted Secrecy Coverage (WSC) and a virtual distributed multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO)-based zero-forcing precoding scheme to avoid the jamming effects on the legitimate receiver. For evaluating these metrics, we derive a closed-form position-based metric, the secrecy improvement. Our mathematical derivations and comparative simulations show that the proposed zero-forcing scheme leads to an improvement on the secrecy performance in terms of the WSC, and provides conditions for improvement of Jamming Efficiency. They also show positioning trends on the UAVs over a fixed orbit around the legitimate transmitter as well as power allocation trends for optimal secrecy. ",

    "abstract": "Heat diffusion processes have found wide applications in modelling dynamical systems over graphs. In this paper, we consider the recovery of a $k$-bandlimited graph signal that is an initial signal of a heat diffusion process from its space-time samples. We propose three random space-time sampling regimes, termed dynamical sampling techniques, that consist in selecting a small subset of space-time nodes at random according to some probability distribution. We show that the number of space-time samples required to ensure stable recovery for each regime depends on a parameter called the spectral graph weighted coherence, that depends on the interplay between the dynamics over the graphs and sampling probability distributions. In optimal scenarios, no more than $\\mathcal{O}(k \\log(k))$ space-time samples are sufficient to ensure accurate and stable recovery of all $k$-bandlimited signals. In any case, dynamical sampling typically requires much fewer spatial samples than the static case by leveraging the temporal information. Then, we propose a computationally efficient method to reconstruct $k$-bandlimited signals from their space-time samples. We prove that it yields accurate reconstructions and that it is also stable to noise. Finally, we test dynamical sampling techniques on a wide variety of graphs. The numerical results support our theoretical findings and demonstrate the efficiency. ",

    "abstract": "Estimating out-of-distribution (OOD) uncertainty is a central challenge for safely deploying machine learning models in the open-world environment. Improved methods for OOD detection in multi-class classification have emerged, while OOD detection methods for multi-label classification remain underexplored and use rudimentary techniques. We propose JointEnergy, a simple and effective method, which estimates the OOD indicator scores by aggregating energy scores from multiple labels. We show that JointEnergy can be mathematically interpreted from a joint likelihood perspective. Our results show consistent improvement over previous methods that are based on the maximum-valued scores, which fail to capture joint information from multiple labels. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on three common multi-label classification benchmarks, including MS-COCO, PASCAL-VOC, and NUS-WIDE. We show that JointEnergy can reduce the FPR95 by up to 10.05% compared to the previous best baseline, establishing state-of-the-art performance. ",

    "abstract": "For nearly three decades, spatial games have produced a wealth of insights to the study of behavior and its relation to population structure. However, as different rules and factors are added or altered, the dynamics of spatial models often become increasingly complicated to interpret. To tackle this problem, we introduce persistent homology as a rigorous framework that can be used to both define and compute higher-order features of data in a manner which is invariant to parameter choices, robust to noise, and independent of human observation. Our work demonstrates its relevance for spatial games by showing how topological features of simulation data that persist over different spatial scales reflect the stability of strategies in 2D lattice games. To do so, we analyze the persistent homology of scenarios from two games: a Prisoner's Dilemma and a SIRS epidemic model. The experimental results show how the method accurately detects features that correspond to real aspects of the game dynamics. Unlike other tools that study dynamics of spatial systems, persistent homology can tell us something meaningful about population structure while remaining neutral about the underlying structure itself. Regardless of game complexity, since strategies either succeed or fail to conform to shapes of a certain topology there is much potential for the method to provide novel insights for a wide variety of spatially extended systems in biology, social science, and physics.

    "title": "Towards event aggregation for reducing the volume of logged events  during IKC stages of APT attacks",
    "abstract": "Nowadays, targeted attacks like Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) has become one of the major concern of many enterprise networks. As a common approach to counter these attacks, security staff deploy a variety of security and non-security sensors at different lines of defense (Network, Host, and Application) to track the attacker's behaviors during their kill chain. However, one of the drawbacks of this approach is the huge amount of events raised by heterogeneous security and non-security sensors which makes it difficult to analyze logged events for later processing i.e. event correlation for timely detection of APT attacks. Till now, some research papers have been published on event aggregation for reducing the volume of logged low-level events. However, most research works have been provided a method to aggregate the events of a single-type and homogeneous event source i.e. NIDS. In addition, their main focus is only on the degree to which the event volume is reduced, while the amount of security information lost during the event aggregation process is also very important. In this paper, we propose a three-phase event aggregation method to reduce the volume of logged heterogeneous events during APT attacks considering the lowest rate of loss of security information. To this aim, at first, low-level events of the sensors are clustered into some similar event groups and then, after filtering noisy event clusters, the remained clusters are summarized based on an Attribute-Oriented Induction (AOI) method in a controllable manner to reduce the unimportant or duplicated events. The method has been evaluated on the three publicly available datasets: SotM34, Bryant, and LANL. The experimental results show that the method is efficient enough in event aggregation and can reduce events volume up to 99.7\\% with an acceptable level of information loss ratio (ILR). ",

    "abstract": "Internet-of-things (IoT) devices are vulnerable to malicious operations by attackers, which can cause physical and economic harm to users; therefore, we previously proposed a sequence-based method that modeled user behavior as sequences of in-home events and a base home state to detect anomalous operations. However, that method modeled users' home states based on the time of day; hence, attackers could exploit the system to maximize attack opportunities. Therefore, we then proposed an estimation-based detection method that estimated the home state using not only the time of day but also the observable values of home IoT sensors and devices. However, it ignored short-term operational behaviors. Consequently, in the present work, we propose a behavior-modeling method that combines home state estimation and event sequences of IoT devices within the home to enable a detailed understanding of long- and short-term user behavior. We compared the proposed model to our previous methods using data collected from real homes. Compared with the estimation-based method, the proposed method achieved a 15.4% higher detection ratio with fewer than 10% misdetections. Compared with the sequence-based method, the proposed method achieved a 46.0% higher detection ratio with fewer than 10% misdetections. ",

Our approach is particularly tolerant to defects in the input, which is allowed to self-intersect, to be non-manifold, disconnected, and to contain surface holes and gaps. We guarantee that the input surface is exactly represented as the union of polygonal facets of the output volume mesh. Thanks to our algorithm, traditionally difficult solid modeling operations such as mesh booleans and Minkowski sums become surprisingly robust and easy to implement, even if the input has defects. Our technique leverages on the recent concept of indirect geometric predicate to provide an unprecedented combination of guaranteed robustness and speed, thus enabling the practical implementation of robust though flexible solid modeling systems. We have extensively tested our method on all the 10000 models of the Thingi10k dataset, and concluded that no existing method provides comparable robustness, precision and performances. ",

Numerical results show that, compared to the commonly used PINN with random initialization, the proposed PINN exhibits notable superiority in terms of convergence and accuracy and can achieve neuron based high-frequency wavefield solutions with a two-hidden-layer model.

    "abstract": "Detection and Classification Acoustic Scene and Events Challenge 2021 Task 4 uses a heterogeneous dataset that includes both recorded and synthetic soundscapes. Until recently only target sound events were considered when synthesizing the soundscapes. However, recorded soundscapes often contain a substantial amount of non-target events that may affect the performance. In this paper, we focus on the impact of these non-target events in the synthetic soundscapes. Firstly, we investigate to what extent using non-target events alternatively during the training or validation phase (or none of them) helps the system to correctly detect target events. Secondly, we analyze to what extend adjusting the signal-to-noise ratio between target and non-target events at training improves the sound event detection performance. The results show that using both target and non-target events for only one of the phases (validation or training) helps the system to properly detect sound events, outperforming the baseline (which uses non-target events in both phases). The paper also reports the results of a preliminary study on evaluating the system on clips that contain only non-target events. This opens questions for future work on non-target subset and acoustic similarity between target and non-target events which might confuse the system. ",

Reduced-form estimates find significant effects of the information treatment on a number of key outcomes such as efficiency, complementarity, and decentralization. To further understand the driving causes of these observed changes in behavior, we develop and estimate a discrete-choice framework, using computationally efficient panel methods to identify the structure of social preferences in this setting.
