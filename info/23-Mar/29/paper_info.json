To make the agent more robust in scenarios where a teacher may not always be available, the proposed training curriculum includes a mix of episodes with and without feedback. The results show that this approach improves the agent's performance, even in the absence of feedback. ",

    "abstract": "Artificial Intelligence has been used to help human complete difficult tasks in complicated environments by providing optimized strategies for decision-making or replacing the manual labour. In environments including multiple agents, such as football, the most common methods to train agents are Imitation Learning and Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL). However, the agents trained by Imitation Learning cannot outperform the expert demonstrator, which makes humans hardly get new insights from the learnt policy. Besides, MARL is prone to the credit assignment problem. In environments with sparse reward signal, this method can be inefficient. The objective of our research is to create a novel reward shaping method by embedding contextual information in reward function to solve the aforementioned challenges. We demonstrate this in the Google Research Football (GRF) environment. We quantify the contextual information extracted from game state observation and use this quantification together with original sparse reward to create the shaped reward. The experiment results in the GRF environment prove that our reward shaping method is a useful addition to state-of-the-art MARL algorithms for training agents in environments with sparse reward signal.

The proposed INRR is based on learned Dirichlet Energy (DE) that measures similarities between rows/columns of the matrix. The smoothness of the Laplacian matrix is further integrated by parameterizing DE with a tiny INR. INRR improves the generalization of INR in signal representation by perfectly integrating the signal's self-similarity with the smoothness of the Laplacian matrix. Through well-designed numerical experiments, the paper also reveals a series of properties derived from INRR, including momentum methods like convergence trajectory and multi-scale similarity.

On the other hand, symbolic methods enable exact reasoning on graphs. We propose KeGNN, a neuro-symbolic framework for learning on graph data that combines both paradigms and allows for the integration of prior knowledge into a graph neural network model. In essence, KeGNN consists of a graph neural network as a base on which knowledge enhancement layers are stacked with the objective of refining predictions with respect to prior knowledge.

    "abstract": "Railway operations involve different types of entities (stations, trains, etc.), making the existing graph/network models with homogenous nodes (i.e., the same kind of nodes) incapable of capturing the interactions between the entities. This paper aims to develop a heterogeneous graph neural network (HetGNN) model, which can address different types of nodes (i.e., heterogeneous nodes), to investigate the train delay evolution on railway networks. To this end, a graph architecture combining the HetGNN model and the GraphSAGE homogeneous GNN (HomoGNN), called SAGE-Het, is proposed. The aim is to capture the interactions between trains, trains and stations, and stations and other stations on delay evolution based on different edges. In contrast to the traditional methods that require the inputs to have constant dimensions (e.g., in rectangular or grid-like arrays) or only allow homogeneous nodes in the graph, SAGE-Het allows for flexible inputs and heterogeneous nodes. The data from two sub-networks of the China railway network are applied to test the performance and robustness of the proposed SAGE-Het model. The experimental results show that SAGE-Het exhibits better performance than the existing delay prediction methods and some advanced HetGNNs used for other prediction tasks; the predictive performances of SAGE-Het under different prediction time horizons (10/20/30 min ahead) all outperform other baseline methods; Specifically, the influences of train interactions on delay propagation are investigated based on the proposed model. The results show that train interactions become subtle when the train headways increase . This finding directly contributes to decision-making in the situation where conflict-resolution or train-canceling actions are needed. ",

We empirically observe that sparse convolution operation causes larger quantization errors than standard convolution. However, conventional network quantization methods directly binarize the weights and activations in sparse convolution, resulting in performance drop due to the significant quantization loss. On the contrary, we search the optimal subset of convolution operation that activates the sparse convolution at various locations for quantization error alleviation, and the performance gap between real-valued and binary sparse convolutional networks is closed without complexity overhead. Specifically, we first present the shifted sparse convolution that fuses the information in the receptive field for the active sites that match the pre-defined positions. Then we employ the differentiable search strategies to discover the optimal opsitions for active site matching in the shifted sparse convolution, and the quantization errors are significantly alleviated for efficient point cloud analysis. For fair evaluation of the proposed method, we empirically select the recently advances that are beneficial for sparse convolution network binarization to construct a strong baseline. The experimental results on Scan-Net and NYU Depth v2 show that our BSC-Net achieves significant improvement upon our srtong baseline and outperforms the state-of-the-art network binarization methods by a remarkable margin without additional computation overhead for binarizing sparse convolutional networks.

    "abstract": "Among the major public transportation systems in cities, bus transit has its problems, including more accuracy and reliability when estimating the bus arrival time for riders. This can lead to delays and decreased ridership, especially in cities where public transportation is heavily relied upon. A common issue is that the arrival times of buses do not match the schedules, resulting in latency for fixed schedules. According to the study in this paper on New York City bus data, there is an average delay of around eight minutes or 491 seconds mismatch between the bus arrivals and the actual scheduled time. This research paper presents a novel AI-based data-driven approach for estimating the arrival times of buses at each transit point (station). Our approach is based on a fully connected neural network and can predict the arrival time collectively across all bus lines in large metropolitan areas. Our neural-net data-driven approach provides a new way to estimate the arrival time of the buses, which can lead to a more efficient and smarter way to bring the bus transit to the general public. Our evaluation of the network bus system with more than 200 bus lines, and 2 million data points, demonstrates less than 40 seconds of estimated error for arrival times. The inference time per each validation set data point is less than 0.006 ms. ",

    "abstract": "Social Media (SM) has become a stage for people to share thoughts, emotions, opinions, and almost every other aspect of their daily lives. This abundance of human interaction makes SM particularly attractive for social sensing. Especially during polarizing events such as political elections or referendums, users post information and encourage others to support their side, using symbols such as hashtags to represent their attitudes. However, many users choose not to attach hashtags to their messages, use a different language, or show their position only indirectly. Thus, automatically identifying their opinions becomes a more challenging task. To uncover these implicit perspectives, we propose a collaborative filtering model based on Graph Convolutional Networks that exploits the textual content in messages and the rich connections between users and topics. Moreover, our approach only requires a small annotation effort compared to state-of-the-art solutions. Nevertheless, the proposed model achieves competitive performance in predicting individuals' stances. We analyze users' attitudes ahead of two constitutional referendums in Chile in 2020 and 2022. Using two large Twitter datasets, our model achieves improvements of 3.4% in recall and 3.6% in accuracy over the baselines. ",

The objective is to develop a multi-flow transmission strategy that routes flows across the wireless interference network to maximize the network utility. However, obtaining an optimal solution is computationally expensive due to the large state and action spaces involved. To tackle this challenge, we introduce a novel algorithm called Dual-stage Interference-Aware Multi-flow Optimization of Network Data-signals (DIAMOND). The design of DIAMOND allows for a hybrid centralized-distributed implementation, which is a characteristic of 5G and beyond technologies with centralized unit deployments. A centralized stage computes the multi-flow transmission strategy using a novel design of graph neural network (GNN) reinforcement learning (RL) routing agent. Then, a distributed stage improves the performance based on a novel design of distributed learning updates. We provide a theoretical analysis of DIAMOND and prove that it converges to the optimal multi-flow transmission strategy as time increases. We also present extensive simulation results over various network topologies (random deployment, NSFNET, GEANT2), demonstrating the superior performance of DIAMOND compared to existing methods. ",

We show that these problems can be solved in polynomial time, are NP-complete, or are PSPACE-complete in a variety of different settings, including when adjacent species just swap instead of arbitrary transformation (swap sCRNs), and when cells can change species a limited number of times (k-burnout). Most problems turn out to be at least NP-hard except with very few distinct species (2 or 3). ",

    "abstract": "Deep neural networks are vulnerable to backdoor attacks, where an adversary maliciously manipulates the model behavior through overlaying images with special triggers. Existing backdoor defense methods often require accessing a few validation data and model parameters, which are impractical in many real-world applications, e.g., when the model is provided as a cloud service. In this paper, we address the practical task of blind backdoor defense at test time, in particular for black-box models. The true label of every test image needs to be recovered on the fly from the hard label predictions of a suspicious model. The heuristic trigger search in image space, however, is not scalable to complex triggers or high image resolution. We circumvent such barrier by leveraging generic image generation models, and propose a framework of Blind Defense with Masked AutoEncoder (BDMAE). It uses the image structural similarity and label consistency between the test image and MAE restorations to detect possible triggers. The detection result is refined by considering the topology of triggers. We obtain a purified test image from restorations for making prediction. Our approach is blind to the model architectures, trigger patterns or image benignity. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets with different backdoor attacks validate its effectiveness and generalizability. Code is available at https://github.com/tsun/BDMAE. ",

However, complexity and possible continued on-line learning makes neural network control systems (NNCS) difficult or impossible to certify under the United States Military Airworthiness Certification Criteria defined in MIL-HDBK-516C. Run time assurance (RTA) is a control system architecture designed to maintain safety properties regardless of whether a primary control system is fully verifiable. This work examines how to satisfy compliance with MIL-HDBK-516C while using active set invariance filtering (ASIF), an advanced form of RTA not envisaged by the 516c committee. ASIF filters the commands from a primary controller, passing on safe commands while optimally modifying unsafe commands to ensure safety with minimal deviation from the desired control action. This work examines leveraging the core theory behind ASIF as assurance argument explaining novel satisfaction of 516C compliance criteria. The result demonstrates how to support compliance of novel technologies with 516C as well as elaborate how such standards might be updated for emerging technologies. ",

Adversarial attacks have disastrous consequences for deep learning-empowered critical applications. Existing defense and detection techniques both require extensive knowledge of the model, testing inputs, and even execution details. They are not viable for general deep learning implementations where the model internal is unknown, a common 'black-box' scenario for model users. Inspired by the fact that electromagnetic (EM) emanations of a model inference are dependent on both operations and data and may contain footprints of different input classes, we propose a framework, EMShepherd, to capture EM traces of model execution, perform processing on traces and exploit them for adversarial detection. Only benign samples and their EM traces are used to train the adversarial detector: a set of EM classifiers and class-specific unsupervised anomaly detectors. When the victim model system is under attack by an adversarial example, the model execution will be different from executions for the known classes, and the EM trace will be different. We demonstrate that our air-gapped EMShepherd can effectively detect different adversarial attacks on a commonly used FPGA deep learning accelerator for both Fashion MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets. It achieves a 100% detection rate on most types of adversarial samples, which is comparable to the state-of-the-art 'white-box' software-based detectors. ",

We observe that the driving scenario is symmetric to rotations on the ground plane. Therefore, rotation-equivariance could provide better generalization and more robust feature learning. Specifically, we review the object instance clustering strategies, and restate the centerness-based approach and the offset-based approach as the prediction of invariant scalar fields and equivariant vector fields. Other sub-tasks are also unified from this perspective, and different invariant and equivariant layers are designed to facilitate their predictions. Through evaluation on the standard 4D panoptic segmentation benchmark of SemanticKITTI, we show that our equivariant models achieve higher accuracy with lower computational costs compared to their non-equivariant counterparts.

    "abstract": "3D point cloud semantic segmentation aims to group all points into different semantic categories, which benefits important applications such as point cloud scene reconstruction and understanding. Existing supervised point cloud semantic segmentation methods usually require large-scale annotated point clouds for training and cannot handle new categories. While a few-shot learning method was proposed recently to address these two problems, it suffers from high computational complexity caused by graph construction and inability to learn fine-grained relationships among points due to the use of pooling operations. In this paper, we further address these problems by developing a new multi-layer transformer network for few-shot point cloud semantic segmentation. In the proposed network, the query point cloud features are aggregated based on the class-specific support features in different scales. Without using pooling operations, our method makes full use of all pixel-level features from the support samples. By better leveraging the support features for few-shot learning, the proposed method achieves the new state-of-the-art performance, with 15\\% less inference time, over existing few-shot 3D point cloud segmentation models on the S3DIS dataset and the ScanNet dataset.

Existing well-known models deal with this task by mainly focusing on representing knowledge graph triplets in the distance space or semantic space. However, they can not fully capture the information of head and tail entities, nor even make good use of hierarchical level information. Thus, in this paper, we propose a novel knowledge graph embedding model for the link prediction task, namely, HIE, which models each triplet (\\textit{h}, \\textit{r}, \\textit{t}) into distance measurement space and semantic measurement space, simultaneously. Moreover, HIE is introduced into hierarchical-aware space to leverage rich hierarchical information of entities and relations for better representation learning. Specifically, we apply distance transformation operation on the head entity in distance space to obtain the tail entity instead of translation-based or rotation-based approaches. Experimental results of HIE on four real-world datasets show that HIE outperforms several existing state-of-the-art knowledge graph embedding methods on the link prediction task and deals with complex relations accurately.

Existing robust and adaptive controllers, such as the ones based on MPC, can achieve impressive performance at the cost of heavy online onboard computations. Strategies that efficiently learn robust and onboard-deployable policies from MPC have emerged, but they still lack fundamental adaptation capabilities. In this work, we extend an existing efficient IL algorithm for robust policy learning from MPC with the ability to learn policies that adapt to challenging model/environment uncertainties. The key idea of our approach consists in modifying the IL procedure by conditioning the policy on a learned lower-dimensional model/environment representation that can be efficiently estimated online. We tailor our approach to the task of learning an adaptive position and attitude control policy to track trajectories under challenging disturbances on a multirotor. Our evaluation is performed in a high-fidelity simulation environment and shows that a high-quality adaptive policy can be obtained in about $1.3$ hours. We additionally empirically demonstrate rapid adaptation to in- and out-of-training-distribution uncertainties, achieving a $6.1$ cm average position error under a wind disturbance that corresponds to about $50\\%$ of the weight of the robot and that is $36\\%$ larger than the maximum wind seen during training.

Multi-behaviors are often taken in certain orders in real-world applications (e.g., click>cart>buy). In a behavior chain, a latter behavior usually exhibits a stronger signal of user preference than the former one does. Most existing multi-behavior models fail to capture such dependencies in a behavior chain for embedding learning. In this work, we propose a novel multi-behavior recommendation model with cascading graph convolution networks (named MB-CGCN). In MB-CGCN, the embeddings learned from one behavior are used as the input features for the next behavior's embedding learning after a feature transformation operation. In this way, our model explicitly utilizes the behavior dependencies in embedding learning. Experiments on two benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our model on exploiting multi-behavior data. It outperforms the best baseline by 33.7% and 35.9% on average over the two datasets in terms of Recall@10 and NDCG@10, respectively. ",

However, this solution is problematic as it forces users into bad connections and downtime before they are switched to a better access point. In this work, we use Machine Learning to identify patterns in user behaviors and predict user actions. This prediction is used to do proactive handovers, switching users to access points with better future transmission rates and a more stable environment based on the future state of the user. Results show that not only the proposal is effective at predicting channel data, but the use of such predictions improves system performance and avoids unnecessary handovers. ",

    "abstract": "Deep neural networks have achieved unprecedented success on diverse vision tasks. However, they are vulnerable to adversarial noise that is imperceptible to humans. This phenomenon negatively affects their deployment in real-world scenarios, especially security-related ones. To evaluate the robustness of a target model in practice, transfer-based attacks craft adversarial samples with a local model and have attracted increasing attention from researchers due to their high efficiency. The state-of-the-art transfer-based attacks are generally based on data augmentation, which typically augments multiple training images from a linear path when learning adversarial samples. However, such methods selected the image augmentation path heuristically and may augment images that are semantics-inconsistent with the target images, which harms the transferability of the generated adversarial samples. To overcome the pitfall, we propose the Path-Augmented Method (PAM). Specifically, PAM first constructs a candidate augmentation path pool. It then settles the employed augmentation paths during adversarial sample generation with greedy search. Furthermore, to avoid augmenting semantics-inconsistent images, we train a Semantics Predictor (SP) to constrain the length of the augmentation path. Extensive experiments confirm that PAM can achieve an improvement of over 4.8% on average compared with the state-of-the-art baselines in terms of the attack success rates. ",

In this work, we propose a scene text detector named Deformable Kernel Expansion (DKE), which incorporates the merits of both segmentation and contour-based detectors. DKE employs a segmentation module to segment the shrunken text region as the text kernel, then expands the text kernel contour to obtain text boundary by regressing the vertex-wise offsets. Generating the text kernel by segmentation enables DKE to inherit the arbitrary-shaped text region modeling capability of segmentation-based detectors. Regressing the kernel contour with some sampled vertices enables DKE to avoid the complicated pixel-level post-processing and better learn contour deformation as the contour-based detectors. Moreover, we propose an Optimal Bipartite Graph Matching Loss (OBGML) that measures the matching error between the predicted contour and the ground truth, which efficiently minimizes the global contour matching distance. Extensive experiments on CTW1500, Total-Text, MSRA-TD500, and ICDAR2015 demonstrate that DKE achieves a good tradeoff between accuracy and efficiency in scene text detection. ",

In this paper, we study a deep ReLU neural network in overparametrized cases and prove that the Bayesian free energy, which is equal to the minus log marginal likelihoodor the Bayesian stochastic complexity, is bounded even if the number of layers are larger than necessary to estimate an unknown data-generating function. Since the Bayesian generalization error is equal to the increase of the free energy as a function of a sample size, our result also shows that the Bayesian generalization error does not increase even if a deep ReLU neural network is designed to be sufficiently large or in an opeverparametrized state.

    "abstract": "Vision transformers (ViTs) have been successfully deployed in a variety of computer vision tasks, but they are still vulnerable to adversarial samples. Transfer-based attacks use a local model to generate adversarial samples and directly transfer them to attack a target black-box model. The high efficiency of transfer-based attacks makes it a severe security threat to ViT-based applications. Therefore, it is vital to design effective transfer-based attacks to identify the deficiencies of ViTs beforehand in security-sensitive scenarios. Existing efforts generally focus on regularizing the input gradients to stabilize the updated direction of adversarial samples. However, the variance of the back-propagated gradients in intermediate blocks of ViTs may still be large, which may make the generated adversarial samples focus on some model-specific features and get stuck in poor local optima. To overcome the shortcomings of existing approaches, we propose the Token Gradient Regularization (TGR) method. According to the structural characteristics of ViTs, TGR reduces the variance of the back-propagated gradient in each internal block of ViTs in a token-wise manner and utilizes the regularized gradient to generate adversarial samples. Extensive experiments on attacking both ViTs and CNNs confirm the superiority of our approach. Notably, compared to the state-of-the-art transfer-based attacks, our TGR offers a performance improvement of 8.8% on average. ",

Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT) is seen as the most applicable consensus mechanism in blockchain-enabled wireless networks.

Additionally, 6G communications will widely deploy high frequency signals such as millimeter wave (mmWave) and terahertz (THz), while the performance of PBFT is still unknown when these signals are transmitted in wireless PBFT networks. Therefore, it is urgent to study the performance of non-ideal wireless PBFT networks with mmWave and THz siganls, so as to better make PBFT play a role in 6G era. In this paper, we study and compare the performance of mmWave and THz signals in non-ideal wireless PBFT networks, considering Rayleigh Fading (RF) and close-in Free Space (FS) reference distance path loss. Performance is evaluated by consensus success rate and delay. Meanwhile, we find and derive that there is a maximum distance between two nodes that can make PBFT consensus inevitably successful, and it is named active distance of PBFT in this paper.

Despite success in structured, on-road settings, current end-to-end approaches for scene prediction have yet to be successfully adapted for complex outdoor terrain. To this end, we present TerrainNet, a vision-based terrain perception system for semantic and geometric terrain prediction for aggressive, off-road navigation. The approach relies on several key insights and practical considerations for achieving reliable terrain modeling. The network includes a multi-headed output representation to capture fine- and coarse-grained terrain features necessary for estimating traversability. Accurate depth estimation is achieved using self-supervised depth completion with multi-view RGB and stereo inputs. Requirements for real-time performance and fast inference speeds are met using efficient, learned image feature projections. Furthermore, the model is trained on a large-scale, real-world off-road dataset collected across a variety of diverse outdoor environments. We show how TerrainNet can also be used for costmap prediction and provide a detailed framework for integration into a planning module. We demonstrate the performance of TerrainNet through extensive comparison to current state-of-the-art baselines for camera-only scene prediction.

    "abstract": "Foundation models (e.g. ChatGPT, StableDiffusion) pervasively influence society, warranting immediate social attention. While the models themselves garner much attention, to accurately characterize their impact, we must consider the broader sociotechnical ecosystem. We propose Ecosystem Graphs as a documentation framework to transparently centralize knowledge of this ecosystem. Ecosystem Graphs is composed of assets (datasets, models, applications) linked together by dependencies that indicate technical (e.g. how Bing relies on GPT-4) and social (e.g. how Microsoft relies on OpenAI) relationships. To supplement the graph structure, each asset is further enriched with fine-grained metadata (e.g. the license or training emissions). We document the ecosystem extensively at https://crfm.stanford.edu/ecosystem-graphs/. As of March 16, 2023, we annotate 262 assets (64 datasets, 128 models, 70 applications) from 63 organizations linked by 356 dependencies. We show Ecosystem Graphs functions as a powerful abstraction and interface for achieving the minimum transparency required to address myriad use cases. Therefore, we envision Ecosystem Graphs will be a community-maintained resource that provides value to stakeholders spanning AI researchers, industry professionals, social scientists, auditors and policymakers.

    "abstract": "Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection aims to localize human-object pairs and recognize their interactions. Recently, Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) has shown great potential in providing interaction prior for HOI detectors via knowledge distillation. However, such approaches often rely on large-scale training data and suffer from inferior performance under few/zero-shot scenarios. In this paper, we propose a novel HOI detection framework that efficiently extracts prior knowledge from CLIP and achieves better generalization. In detail, we first introduce a novel interaction decoder to extract informative regions in the visual feature map of CLIP via a cross-attention mechanism, which is then fused with the detection backbone by a knowledge integration block for more accurate human-object pair detection. In addition, prior knowledge in CLIP text encoder is leveraged to generate a classifier by embedding HOI descriptions. To distinguish fine-grained interactions, we build a verb classifier from training data via visual semantic arithmetic and a lightweight verb representation adapter. Furthermore, we propose a training-free enhancement to exploit global HOI predictions from CLIP. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms the state of the art by a large margin on various settings, e.g. +4.04 mAP on HICO-Det.

    "abstract": "Face recognition is a prevailing authentication solution in numerous biometric applications. Physical adversarial attacks, as an important surrogate, can identify the weaknesses of face recognition systems and evaluate their robustness before deployed. However, most existing physical attacks are either detectable readily or ineffective against commercial recognition systems. The goal of this work is to develop a more reliable technique that can carry out an end-to-end evaluation of adversarial robustness for commercial systems. It requires that this technique can simultaneously deceive black-box recognition models and evade defensive mechanisms. To fulfill this, we design adversarial textured 3D meshes (AT3D) with an elaborate topology on a human face, which can be 3D-printed and pasted on the attacker's face to evade the defenses. However, the mesh-based optimization regime calculates gradients in high-dimensional mesh space, and can be trapped into local optima with unsatisfactory transferability. To deviate from the mesh-based space, we propose to perturb the low-dimensional coefficient space based on 3D Morphable Model, which significantly improves black-box transferability meanwhile enjoying faster search efficiency and better visual quality. Extensive experiments in digital and physical scenarios show that our method effectively explores the security vulnerabilities of multiple popular commercial services, including three recognition APIs, four anti-spoofing APIs, two prevailing mobile phones and two automated access control systems.

    "title": "Scaling Multi-Objective Security Games Provably via Space Discretization  Based Evolutionary Search",
    "abstract": "In the field of security, multi-objective security games (MOSGs) allow defenders to simultaneously protect targets from multiple heterogeneous attackers. MOSGs aim to simultaneously maximize all the heterogeneous payoffs, e.g., life, money, and crime rate, without merging heterogeneous attackers. In real-world scenarios, the number of heterogeneous attackers and targets to be protected may exceed the capability of most existing state-of-the-art methods, i.e., MOSGs are limited by the issue of scalability. To this end, this paper proposes a general framework called SDES based on many-objective evolutionary search to scale up MOSGs to large-scale targets and heterogeneous attackers. SDES consists of four consecutive key components, i.e., discretization, optimization, restoration and evaluation, and refinement. Specifically, SDES first discretizes the originally high-dimensional continuous solution space to the low-dimensional discrete one by the maximal indifference property in game theory. This property helps evolutionary algorithms (EAs) bypass the high-dimensional step function and ensure a well-convergent Pareto front. Then, a many-objective EA is used for optimization in the low-dimensional discrete solution space to obtain a well-spaced Pareto front. To evaluate solutions, SDES restores solutions back to the original space via bit-wisely optimizing a novel solution divergence. Finally, the refinement in SDES boosts the optimization performance with acceptable cost. Theoretically, we prove the optimization consistency and convergence of SDES. Experiment results show that SDES is the first linear-time MOSG algorithm for both large-scale attackers and targets. SDES is able to solve up to 20 attackers and 100 targets MOSG problems, while the state-of-the-art methods can only solve up to 8 attackers and 25 targets ones. Ablation study verifies the necessity of all components in SDES. ",

To alleviate the potentially catastrophic forgetting issue in multilingual models, we fix all pre-trained model parameters, insert the parameter-efficient structure adapter, and fine-tune it. Updating only 0.6\\% of the overall parameters compared to full-model fine-tuning for each programming language, adapter tuning yields consistent improvements on code search and summarization tasks, achieving state-of-the-art results. In addition, we experimentally show its effectiveness in cross-lingual and low-resource scenarios. Multilingual fine-tuning with 200 samples per programming language approaches the results fine-tuned with the entire dataset on code summarization. Our experiments on three probing tasks show that adapter tuning significantly outperforms full-model fine-tuning and effectively overcomes catastrophic forgetting. ",

    "abstract": "Successful analytics solutions that provide valuable insights often hinge on the connection of various data sources. While it is often feasible to generate larger data pools within organizations, the application of analytics within (inter-organizational) business networks is still severely constrained. As data is distributed across several legal units, potentially even across countries, the fear of disclosing sensitive information as well as the sheer volume of the data that would need to be exchanged are key inhibitors for the creation of effective system-wide solutions -- all while still reaching superior prediction performance. In this work, we propose a meta machine learning method that deals with these obstacles to enable comprehensive analyses within a business network. We follow a design science research approach and evaluate our method with respect to feasibility and performance in an industrial use case. First, we show that it is feasible to perform network-wide analyses that preserve data confidentiality as well as limit data transfer volume. Second, we demonstrate that our method outperforms a conventional isolated analysis and even gets close to a (hypothetical) scenario where all data could be shared within the network. Thus, we provide a fundamental contribution for making business networks more effective, as we remove a key obstacle to tap the huge potential of learning from data that is scattered throughout the network.

Existing query intent classification models either design more exquisite models to enhance the representation learning of queries or explore label-graph and multi-task to facilitate models to learn external information. However, these models cannot capture multi-granularity matching features from queries and categories, which makes them hard to mitigate the gap in the expression between informal queries and categories. This paper proposes a Multi-granularity Matching Attention Network (MMAN), which contains three modules: a self-matching module, a char-level matching module, and a semantic-level matching module to comprehensively extract features from the query and a query-category interaction matrix. In this way, the model can eliminate the difference in expression between queries and categories for query intent classification. We conduct extensive offline and online A/B experiments, and the results show that the MMAN significantly outperforms the strong baselines, which shows the superiority and effectiveness of MMAN. MMAN has been deployed in production and brings great commercial value for our company. ",

The advantage offered by this framework is twofold: all system uncertainties can be included from the very beginning of the design process; the validation and verification (V\\&V) process is improved by fast detection of worst-case configurations that could escape to a classical sample-based Monte Carlo simulation campaign. Before proceeding to the control synthesis and analysis, a proper uncertain plant model has to be available in order to push these techniques to their limits of performance. In this spirit, the Satellite Dynamics Toolbox Library (SDTlib) offers many features to model a spacecraft system in a multi-body fashion on SIMULINK. Parametric models can be easily built in a Linear Fractional Transformation (LFT) form by including uncertainties and varying parameters with minimal number of repetitions. Uncertain Linear Time Invariant (LTI) and uncertain Linear Parameter-Varying (LPV) controllers can then be synthesized and analyzed in a straightforward way.

To cater to these diverse applications, network slicing has become a popular tool for creating specialized virtual networks. However, resource fragmentation caused by uneven utilization of multidimensional resources can lead to reduced utilization of limited edge resources. To tackle this issue, this paper focuses on addressing the multidimensional resource fragmentation problem in virtual network embedding (VNE) in MEC systems with the aim of maximizing the profit of an infrastructure provider (InP). The VNE problem in MEC systems is transformed into a bilevel optimization problem, taking into account the interdependence between virtual node embedding (VNoE) and virtual link embedding (VLiE). To solve this problem, we propose a nested bilevel optimization approach named BiVNE. The VNoE is solved using the ant colony system (ACS) in the upper level, while the VLiE is solved using a combination of a shortest path algorithm and an exact-fit spectrum slot allocation method in the lower level. Evaluation results show that the BiVNE algorithm can effectively enhance the profit of the InP by increasing the acceptance ratio and avoiding resource fragmentation simultaneously. ",

The first one considers the period from the beginning to the first instant of synchronization, while the second phase covers the following time in which synchronization must be preserved. It is shown that a large coupling gain is adopted for the first phase, while the averaged coupling gain to preserve the synchronization in the second phase can be reduced significantly by using an offline optimized coupling law.

This strategy makes these algorithms inherently transductive, curtailing their ability to generate predictions for users that were unseen at training time. To address this issue, we propose a convolution-based algorithm, which is inductive from the user perspective, while at the same time, depending only on implicit user-item interaction data. We propose the construction of an item-item graph through a weighted projection of the bipartite interaction network and to employ convolution to inject higher order associations into item embeddings, while constructing user representations as weighted sums of the items with which they have interacted. Despite not training individual embeddings for each user our approach achieves state of-the-art recommendation performance with respect to transductive baselines on four real-world datasets, showing at the same time robust inductive performance.

    "abstract": "Recording surgery in operating rooms is an essential task for education and evaluation of medical treatment. However, recording the desired targets, such as the surgery field, surgical tools, or doctor's hands, is difficult because the targets are heavily occluded during surgery. We use a recording system in which multiple cameras are embedded in the surgical lamp, and we assume that at least one camera is recording the target without occlusion at any given time. As the embedded cameras obtain multiple video sequences, we address the task of selecting the camera with the best view of the surgery. Unlike the conventional method, which selects the camera based on the area size of the surgery field, we propose a deep neural network that predicts the camera selection probability from multiple video sequences by learning the supervision of the expert annotation. We created a dataset in which six different types of plastic surgery are recorded, and we provided the annotation of camera switching. Our experiments show that our approach successfully switched between cameras and outperformed three baseline methods. ",

However, standard temporal link prediction algorithms are ill-suited for computer network monitoring as they do not take account of the peculiar short-term dynamics of computer network activity, which exhibits sharp seasonal variations. In order to build a better model, we propose a source separation-inspired description of computer network activity: at each time step, the observed graph is a mixture of subgraphs representing various sources of activity, and short-term dynamics result from changes in the mixing coefficients.

    "abstract": "Road network digital twins (RNDTs) play a critical role in the development of next-generation intelligent transportation systems, enabling more precise traffic planning and control. To support just-in-time (JIT) decision making, RNDTs require a model that dynamically learns the traffic patterns from online sensor data and generates high-fidelity simulation results. Although current traffic prediction techniques based on graph neural networks have achieved state-of-the-art performance, these techniques only predict future traffic by mining correlations in historical traffic data, disregarding the causes of traffic generation, such as traffic demands and route selection. Therefore, their performance is unreliable for JIT decision making. To fill this gap, we introduce a novel deep learning framework called TraffNet that learns the causality of traffic volume from vehicle trajectory data. First, we use a heterogeneous graph to represent the road network, allowing the model to incorporate causal features of traffic volumes. Next, motivated by the traffic domain knowledge, we propose a traffic causality learning method to learn an embedding vector that encodes travel demands and path-level dependencies for each road segment. Then, we model temporal dependencies to match the underlying process of traffic generation. Finally, the experiments verify the utility of TraffNet.

The vast scale of IoT, diverse hardware and software, and being typically placed in uncontrolled environments make traditional IT security mechanisms such as signature-based intrusion detection and prevention systems challenging to integrate. They also struggle to cope with the rapidly evolving IoT threat landscape due to long delays between the analysis and publication of the detection rules. Machine learning methods have shown faster response to emerging threats; however, model training architectures like cloud or edge computing face multiple drawbacks in IoT settings, including network overhead and data isolation arising from the large scale and heterogeneity that characterizes these networks. This work presents an architecture for training unsupervised models for network intrusion detection in large, distributed IoT and Industrial IoT (IIoT) deployments. We leverage Federated Learning (FL) to collaboratively train between peers and reduce isolation and network overhead problems. We build upon it to include an unsupervised device clustering algorithm fully integrated into the FL pipeline to address the heterogeneity issues that arise in FL settings. The architecture is implemented and evaluated using a testbed that includes various emulated IoT/IIoT devices and attackers interacting in a complex network topology comprising 100 emulated devices, 30 switches and 10 routers. The anomaly detection models are evaluated on real attacks performed by the testbed's threat actors, including the entire Mirai malware lifecycle, an additional botnet based on the Merlin command and control server and other red-teaming tools performing scanning activities and multiple attacks targeting the emulated devices.

To overcome this challenge, in this paper, we advocate the integration of edge computing paradigm and parallel split learning (PSL), allowing multiple client devices to offload substantial training workloads to an edge server via layer-wise model split. By observing that existing PSL schemes incur excessive training latency and large volume of data transmissions, we propose an innovative PSL framework, namely, efficient parallel split learning (EPSL), to accelerate model training. To be specific, EPSL parallelizes client-side model training and reduces the dimension of local gradients for back propagation (BP) via last-layer gradient aggregation, leading to a significant reduction in server-side training and communication latency. Moreover, by considering the heterogeneous channel conditions and computing capabilities at client devices, we jointly optimize subchannel allocation, power control, and cut layer selection to minimize the per-round latency. Simulation results show that the proposed EPSL framework significantly decreases the training latency needed to achieve a target accuracy compared with the state-of-the-art benchmarks, and the tailored resource management and layer split strategy can considerably reduce latency than the counterpart without optimization.

This task is particularly challenging for two reasons. First, it suffers from a long-tail problem in its relation categories, making naive biased methods more inclined to high-frequency relations. Existing unbiased methods tackle the long-tail problem by data/loss rebalancing to favor low-frequency relations. Second, a subject-object pair can have two or more semantically overlapping relations. While existing methods favor one over the other, our proposed HiLo framework lets different network branches specialize on low and high frequency relations, enforce their consistency and fuse the results. To the best of our knowledge we are the first to propose an explicitly unbiased PSG method. In extensive experiments we show that our HiLo framework achieves state-of-the-art results on the PSG task. We also apply our method to the Scene Graph Generation task that predicts boxes instead of masks and see improvements over all baseline methods. ",

More recently, the application of such techniques on graph-structured data has achieved state-of-the-art performance in various domains and demonstrates promising results in learning more robust representations from malware. Yet, no literature review focusing on graph-based deep learning for malware detection exists. In this survey, we provide an in-depth literature review to summarize and unify existing works under the common approaches and architectures. We notably demonstrate that Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) reach competitive results in learning robust embeddings from malware represented as expressive graph structures, leading to an efficient detection by downstream classifiers.

The inclusion of the TD module allows for valuable information to be conveyed through the temporal flow. We also curate and benchmark three practical datasets for the joint problem of trajectory imputation and prediction. Extensive experiments verify the exceptional performance of our proposed method.

Specifically, for the Siamese network in the speaker verification system, we try to implant a universal identity in the model that can simulate any enrolled speaker and pass the verification. So the attacker does not need to know the victim, which makes the attack more flexible and stealthy. In addition, we design and compare three ways of selecting attacker utterances and two ways of poisoned training for the GE2E loss function in different scenarios. The results on the TIMIT and Voxceleb1 datasets show that our approach can achieve a high attack success rate while guaranteeing the normal verification accuracy.

However, multi-person scenario within untrimmed videos is also important for practical applications, which has not been well concerned yet. To address this, we shed light on this research field for the first time with essential contributions on dataset, theory, and practices. In particular, a large-scale dataset termed MPEblink that involves 686 untrimmed videos with 8748 eyeblink events is proposed under multi-person conditions. The samples are captured from unconstrained films to reveal \"in the wild\" characteristics. Meanwhile, a real-time multi-person eyeblink detection method is also proposed. Being different from the existing counterparts, our proposition runs in a one-stage spatio-temporal way with end-to-end learning capacity. Specifically, it simultaneously addresses the sub-tasks of face detection, face tracking, and human instance-level eyeblink detection. This paradigm holds 2 main advantages: (1) eyeblink features can be facilitated via the face's global context (e.g., head pose and illumination condition) with joint optimization and interaction, and (2) addressing these sub-tasks in parallel instead of sequential manner can save time remarkably to meet the real-time running requirement. Experiments on MPEblink verify the essential challenges of real-time multi-person eyeblink detection in the wild for untrimmed video.

    "abstract": "Recommender systems easily face the issue of user preference shifts. User representations will become out-of-date and lead to inappropriate recommendations if user preference has shifted over time. To solve the issue, existing work focuses on learning robust representations or predicting the shifting pattern. There lacks a comprehensive view to discover the underlying reasons for user preference shifts. To understand the preference shift, we abstract a causal graph to describe the generation procedure of user interaction sequences. Assuming user preference is stable within a short period, we abstract the interaction sequence as a set of chronological environments. From the causal graph, we find that the changes of some unobserved factors (e.g., becoming pregnant) cause preference shifts between environments. Besides, the fine-grained user preference over categories sparsely affects the interactions with different items. Inspired by the causal graph, our key considerations to handle preference shifts lie in modeling the interaction generation procedure by: 1) capturing the preference shifts across environments for accurate preference prediction, and 2) disentangling the sparse influence from user preference to interactions for accurate effect estimation of preference. To this end, we propose a Causal Disentangled Recommendation (CDR) framework, which captures preference shifts via a temporal variational autoencoder and learns the sparse influence from multiple environments. Specifically, an encoder is adopted to infer the unobserved factors from user interactions while a decoder is to model the interaction generation process. Besides, we introduce two learnable matrices to disentangle the sparse influence from user preference to interactions. Lastly, we devise a multi-objective loss to optimize CDR. Extensive experiments on three datasets show the superiority of CDR. ",

In this regard, the thermal problems, performance degradation and high energy consumption, can cause irreversible damage to the devices. We address the optimization of the whole memory subsystem with three approaches integrated as a single methodology. Firstly, the thermal impact of register file is analyzed and optimized. Secondly, the cache memory is addressed by optimizing cache configuration according to running applications and improving both performance and power consumption. Finally, we simplify the design and evaluation process of general-purpose and customized dynamic memory manager, in the main memory. To this aim, we apply different evolutionary algorithms in combination with memory simulators and profiling tools. This way, we are able to evaluate the quality of each candidate solution and take advantage of the exploration of solutions given by the optimization algorithm.We also provide an experimental experience where our proposal is assessed using well-known benchmark applications.

We develop two variants of WRA combined with CMA-ES and approximate gradient ascent as numerical solvers for the inner maximization problem. Numerical experiments show that our proposed approach outperforms several existing approaches when the objective function is a smooth strongly convex--concave function and the interaction between $x$ and $y$ is strong. We investigate the advantages of the proposed approach for problems where the objective function is not limited to smooth strongly convex--concave functions.

Current methods in anomaly detection rely on an underlying model to capture the usual or acceptable operating behaviour.

Recent examples have shown how transformer-based deep neural network models such as ALBERT can be used to enable the execution of natural language processing (NLP) inference on mobile systems-on-chip housing custom hardware accelerators. However, while these existing solutions are effective in alleviating the latency, energy, and area costs of running single NLP tasks, achieving multi-task inference requires running computations over multiple variants of the model parameters, which are tailored to each of the targeted tasks. This approach leads to either prohibitive on-chip memory requirements or paying the cost of off-chip memory access. This paper proposes adapter-ALBERT, an efficient model optimization for maximal data reuse across different tasks. The proposed model's performance and robustness to data compression methods are evaluated across several language tasks from the GLUE benchmark. Additionally, we demonstrate the advantage of mapping the model to a heterogeneous on-chip memory architecture by performing simulations on a validated NLP edge accelerator to extrapolate performance, power, and area improvements over the execution of a traditional ALBERT model on the same hardware platform.

Therefore, multimodal prediction can provide richer information than single-mode prediction enabling AVs to perform a better risk assessment. To this end, we propose a novel multimodal prediction framework that can predict multiple plausible behaviour modes and their likelihoods. The proposed framework includes a bespoke problem formulation for manoeuvre prediction, a novel transformer-based prediction model, and a tailored training method for multimodal manoeuvre and trajectory prediction. The performance of the framework is evaluated using two public benchmark highway driving datasets, namely NGSIM and highD.

Our results show that our F-GNN achieves state-of-art performance with significantly less computation time. Besides, F-GNN offers an excellent trade-off between performance and complexity compared to classical approaches. We further refine this trade-off by introducing a distance-based threshold for inclusion or exclusion of edges in the network. We show that an appropriately chosen threshold reduces required training time by roughly 20% with a relatively minor loss in performance. ",

Existing studies model each actor and scene relation to improve action recognition. However, the scene variations and background interference limit the effectiveness of this relation modeling. In this paper, we propose to select actor-related scene context, rather than directly leverage raw video scenario, to improve relation modeling. We develop a Cycle Actor-Context Relation network (CycleACR) where there is a symmetric graph that models the actor and context relations in a bidirectional form. Our CycleACR consists of the Actor-to-Context Reorganization (A2C-R) that collects actor features for context feature reorganizations, and the Context-to-Actor Enhancement (C2A-E) that dynamically utilizes reorganized context features for actor feature enhancement. Compared to existing designs that focus on C2A-E, our CycleACR introduces A2C-R for a more effective relation modeling. This modeling advances our CycleACR to achieve state-of-the-art performance on two popular action detection datasets (i.e., AVA and UCF101-24). We also provide ablation studies and visualizations as well to show how our cycle actor-context relation modeling improves video action detection.

Unlike rigid and articulated objects, 3D deformable objects have infinite degrees of freedom. Fully defining their state requires 3D deformation and stress fields, which are exceptionally difficult to analytically compute or experimentally measure. Thus, evaluating grasp candidates for grasp planning typically requires accurate, but slow 3D finite element method (FEM) simulation. Sampling-based grasp planning is often impractical, as it requires evaluation of a large number of grasp candidates. Gradient-based grasp planning can be more efficient, but requires a differentiable model to synthesize optimal grasps from initial candidates. Differentiable FEM simulators may fill this role, but are typically no faster than standard FEM. In this work, we propose learning a predictive graph neural network (GNN), DefGraspNets, to act as our differentiable model. We train DefGraspNets to predict 3D stress and deformation fields based on FEM-based grasp simulations. DefGraspNets not only runs up to 1500 times faster than the FEM simulator, but also enables fast gradient-based grasp optimization over 3D stress and deformation metrics. We design DefGraspNets to align with real-world grasp planning practices and demonstrate generalization across multiple test sets, including real-world experiments. ",

Deploying FL is not always feasible as it requires high computation and network communication resources. This paper evaluates five FL algorithms' performance and resource efficiency for Covid-19 detection. A decentralized setting with CNN networks is set up, and the performance of FL algorithms is compared with a centralized environment. We examined the algorithms with varying numbers of participants, federated rounds, and selection algorithms. Our results show that cyclic weight transfer can have better overall performance, and results are better with fewer participating hospitals. Our results demonstrate good performance for detecting COVID-19 patients and might be useful in deploying FL algorithms for covid-19 detection and medical image analysis in general. ",

As a result, they can introduce excessive overheads for ad-hoc EDA workloads due to their expensive optimization techniques. Instead, we identify program rewriting as a lightweight technique which can offer substantial speedups while also avoiding slowdowns. We implemented our techniques in Dias, which rewrites notebook cells to be more efficient for ad-hoc EDA workloads. We develop techniques for efficient rewrites in Dias, including dynamic checking of preconditions under which rewrites are correct and just-in-time rewrites for notebook environments. We show that Dias can rewrite individual cells to be 57$\\times$ faster compared to pandas and 1909$\\times$ faster compared to optimized systems such as modin.

A conceptual explanation behind label smoothing is that it helps prevent a neural model from becoming \"overconfident\" by forcing it to consider alternatives, even if only slightly. Label smoothing has been shown to help several areas of language generation, yet typically requires considerable tuning and testing to achieve the optimal results. This tuning and testing has not been reported for neural source code summarization - a growing research area in software engineering that seeks to generate natural language descriptions of source code behavior.

To address this problem, we propose a simple yet efficient method: \\textbf{H}ard Nominal \\textbf{E}xample-aware \\textbf{T}emplate \\textbf{M}utual \\textbf{M}atching (HETMM).

This is a significant advantage over most anomaly detectors that frequently fail to detect logical anomalies. Additionally, to meet the speed-accuracy demands, we further propose \\textbf{P}ixel-level \\textbf{T}emplate \\textbf{S}election (PTS) to streamline the original template set. \\textit{PTS} selects cluster centres and hard-nominal examples to form a tiny set, maintaining the original decision boundaries.

We put this hypothesis to test in a system of evolving foraging agents controlled by neural networks that can adapt agents' dynamical regime throughout evolution. Surprisingly, we find that all populations that discover solutions, evolve to be subcritical. By a resilience analysis, we find that there are still benefits of starting the evolution in the critical regime. Namely, initially critical agents maintain their fitness level under environmental changes (for example, in the lifespan) and degrade gracefully when their genome is perturbed. At the same time, initially subcritical agents, even when evolved to the same fitness, are often inadequate to withstand the changes in the lifespan and degrade catastrophically with genetic perturbations. Furthermore, we find the optimal distance to criticality depends on the task complexity. To test it we introduce a hard and simple task: for the hard task, agents evolve closer to criticality whereas more subcritical solutions are found for the simple task. We verify that our results are independent of the selected evolutionary mechanisms by testing them on two principally different approaches: a genetic algorithm and an evolutionary strategy. In summary, our study suggests that although optimal behaviour in the simple task is obtained in a subcritical regime, initializing near criticality is important to be efficient at finding optimal solutions for new tasks of unknown complexity.

    "abstract": "It is a longstanding conjecture that every simple drawing of a complete graph on $n\\geq 3$ vertices contains a crossing-free Hamiltonian cycle. We confirm this conjecture for cylindrical drawings, strongly $c$-monotone drawings, as well as $x$-bounded drawings. Moreover, we introduce the stronger question of whether a crossing-free Hamiltonian path between each pair of vertices always exists. ",

    "abstract": "Reducing the radiation dose in computed tomography (CT) is important to mitigate radiation-induced risks. One option is to employ a well-trained model to compensate for incomplete information and map sparse-view measurements to the CT reconstruction. However, reconstruction from sparsely sampled measurements is insufficient to uniquely characterize an object in CT, and a learned prior model may be inadequate for unencountered cases. Medical modal translation from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to CT is an alternative but may introduce incorrect information into the synthesized CT images in addition to the fact that there exists no explicit transformation describing their relationship. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework called the denoising diffusion model for medical image synthesis (DDMM-Synth) to close the performance gaps described above. This framework combines an MRI-guided diffusion model with a new CT measurement embedding reverse sampling scheme. Specifically, the null-space content of the one-step denoising result is refined by the MRI-guided data distribution prior, and its range-space component derived from an explicit operator matrix and the sparse-view CT measurements is directly integrated into the inference stage. DDMM-Synth can adjust the projection number of CT a posteriori for a particular clinical application and its modified version can even improve the results significantly for noisy cases. Our results show that DDMM-Synth outperforms other state-of-the-art supervised-learning-based baselines under fair experimental conditions. ",

    "abstract": "Digital image correlation (DIC) has become a valuable tool in the evaluation of mechanical experiments, particularly fatigue crack growth experiments. The evaluation requires accurate information of the crack path and crack tip position, which is difficult to obtain due to inherent noise and artefacts. Machine learning models have been extremely successful in recognizing this relevant information given labelled DIC displacement data. For the training of robust models, which generalize well, big data is needed. However, data is typically scarce in the field of material science and engineering because experiments are expensive and time-consuming. We present a method to generate synthetic DIC displacement data using generative adversarial networks with a physics-guided discriminator. To decide whether data samples are real or fake, this discriminator additionally receives the derived von Mises equivalent strain. We show that this physics-guided approach leads to improved results in terms of visual quality of samples, sliced Wasserstein distance, and geometry score. ",

    "title": "ASCNet-ECG: Deep Autoencoder based Attention aware Skip Connection  network for ECG filtering",
    "abstract": "Currently, the telehealth monitoring field has gained huge attention due to its noteworthy use in day-to-day life. This advancement has led to an increase in the data collection of electrophysiological signals. Due to this advancement, electrocardiogram (ECG) signal monitoring has become a leading task in the medical field. ECG plays an important role in the medical field by analysing cardiac physiology and abnormalities. However, these signals are affected due to numerous varieties of noises, such as electrode motion, baseline wander and white noise etc., which affects the diagnosis accuracy. Therefore, filtering ECG signals became an important task. Currently, deep learning schemes are widely employed in signal-filtering tasks due to their efficient architecture of feature learning. This work presents a deep learning-based scheme for ECG signal filtering, which is based on the deep autoencoder module. According to this scheme, the data is processed through the encoder and decoder layer to reconstruct by eliminating noises. The proposed deep learning architecture uses a modified ReLU function to improve the learning of attributes because standard ReLU cannot adapt to huge variations. Further, a skip connection is also incorporated in the proposed architecture, which retains the key feature of the encoder layer while mapping these features to the decoder layer. Similarly, an attention model is also included, which performs channel and spatial attention, which generates the robust map by using channel and average pooling operations, resulting in improving the learning performance. The proposed approach is tested on a publicly available MIT-BIH dataset where different types of noise, such as electrode motion, baseline water and motion artifacts, are added to the original signal at varied SNR levels.

    "abstract": "The growth of market capitalisation and the number of altcoins (cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin) provide investment opportunities and complicate the prediction of their price movements. A significant challenge in this volatile and relatively immature market is the problem of predicting cryptocurrency prices which needs to identify the factors influencing these prices. The focus of this study is to investigate the factors influencing altcoin prices, and these factors have been investigated from a causal analysis perspective using Bayesian networks. In particular, studying the nature of interactions between five leading altcoins, traditional financial assets including gold, oil, and S\\&P 500, and social media is the research question. To provide an answer to the question, we create causal networks which are built from the historic price data of five traditional financial assets, social media data, and price data of altcoins. The ensuing networks are used for causal reasoning and diagnosis, and the results indicate that social media (in particular Twitter data in this study) is the most significant influencing factor of the prices of altcoins. Furthermore, it is not possible to generalise the coins' reactions against the changes in the factors. Consequently, the coins need to be studied separately for a particular price movement investigation. ",
