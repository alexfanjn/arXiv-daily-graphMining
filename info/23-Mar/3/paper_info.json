    "abstract": "Despite a great deal of research, it is still not well-understood why trained neural networks are highly vulnerable to adversarial examples. In this work we focus on two-layer neural networks trained using data which lie on a low dimensional linear subspace. We show that standard gradient methods lead to non-robust neural networks, namely, networks which have large gradients in directions orthogonal to the data subspace, and are susceptible to small adversarial $L_2$-perturbations in these directions. Moreover, we show that decreasing the initialization scale of the training algorithm, or adding $L_2$ regularization, can make the trained network more robust to adversarial perturbations orthogonal to the data.

    "abstract": "This paper explores learned-context neural networks. It is a multi-task learning architecture based on a fully shared neural network and an augmented input vector containing trainable task parameters. The architecture is interesting due to its powerful task adaption mechanism, which facilitates a low-dimensional task parameter space. Theoretically, we show that a scalar task parameter is sufficient for universal approximation of all tasks, which is not necessarily the case for more common architectures. Evidence towards the practicality of such a small task parameter space is given empirically. The task parameter space is found to be well-behaved, and simplifies workflows related to updating models as new data arrives, and training new tasks when the shared parameters are frozen. Additionally, the architecture displays robustness towards cases with few data points. The architecture's performance is compared to similar neural network architectures on ten datasets. ",

Even for English, despite a vast amount of available training data, systems perform worse for non-native speakers. In this work, we improve an accent-conversion model (ACM) which transforms native US-English speech into accented pronunciation. We include phonetic knowledge in the ACM training to provide accurate feedback about how well certain pronunciation patterns were recovered in the synthesized waveform. Furthermore, we investigate the feasibility of learned accent representations instead of static embeddings. Generated data was then used to train two state-of-the-art ASR systems. We evaluated our approach on native and non-native English datasets and found that synthetically accented data helped the ASR to better understand speech from seen accents. This observation did not translate to unseen accents, and it was not observed for a model that had been pre-trained exclusively with native speech. ",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a planning framework to generate a defense strategy against an attacker who is working in an environment where a defender can operate without the attacker's knowledge. The objective of the defender is to covertly guide the attacker to a trap state from which the attacker cannot achieve their goal. Further, the defender is constrained to achieve its goal within K number of steps, where K is calculated as a pessimistic lower bound within which the attacker is unlikely to suspect a threat in the environment. Such a defense strategy is highly useful in real world systems like honeypots or honeynets, where an unsuspecting attacker interacts with a simulated production system while assuming it is the actual production system. Typically, the interaction between an attacker and a defender is captured using game theoretic frameworks. Our problem formulation allows us to capture it as a much simpler infinite horizon discounted MDP, in which the optimal policy for the MDP gives the defender's strategy against the actions of the attacker. Through empirical evaluation, we show the merits of our problem formulation. ",

    "abstract": "The development of Internet technology enables an analysis on the whole population rather than a certain number of samples, and leads to increasing requirement for privacy protection. Local differential privacy (LDP) is an effective standard of privacy measurement; however, its large variance of mean estimation causes challenges in application. To address this problem, this paper presents a new LDP approach, an improved Christofides mechanism. It compared four statistical survey methods for conducting surveys on sensitive topics -- modified Warner, Simmons, Christofides, and the improved Christofides mechanism. Specifically, Warner, Simmons and Christofides mechanisms have been modified to draw a sample from the population without replacement, to decrease variance. Furthermore, by drawing cards without replacement based on modified Christofides mechanism, we introduce a new mechanism called the improved Christofides mechanism, which is found to have the smallest variance under certain assumption when using LDP as a measurement of privacy leakage. The assumption is do satisfied usually in the real world. Actually, we decrease the variance to 28.7% of modified Christofides mechanism's variance in our experiment based on the HCOVANY dataset -- a real world dataset of IPUMS USA. This means our method gets a more accurate estimate by using LDP as a measurement of privacy leakage. This is the first time the improved Christofides mechanism is proposed for LDP framework based on comparative analysis of four mechanisms using LDP as the same measurement of privacy leakage. ",

    "abstract": "Processing giga-pixel whole slide histopathology images (WSI) is a computationally expensive task. Multiple instance learning (MIL) has become the conventional approach to process WSIs, in which these images are split into smaller patches for further processing. However, MIL-based techniques ignore explicit information about the individual cells within a patch. In this paper, by defining the novel concept of shared-context processing, we designed a multi-modal Graph Transformer (AMIGO) that uses the celluar graph within the tissue to provide a single representation for a patient while taking advantage of the hierarchical structure of the tissue, enabling a dynamic focus between cell-level and tissue-level information. We benchmarked the performance of our model against multiple state-of-the-art methods in survival prediction and showed that ours can significantly outperform all of them including hierarchical Vision Transformer (ViT). More importantly, we show that our model is strongly robust to missing information to an extent that it can achieve the same performance with as low as 20% of the data. Finally, in two different cancer datasets, we demonstrated that our model was able to stratify the patients into low-risk and high-risk groups while other state-of-the-art methods failed to achieve this goal. We also publish a large dataset of immunohistochemistry images (InUIT) containing 1,600 tissue microarray (TMA) cores from 188 patients along with their survival information, making it one of the largest publicly available datasets in this context.

However, the lack of the semantic prior in metrics and the semantic-independent variation in 3D medical images make it challenging to get a reliable measurement for the inter-image similarity, hindering the learning of consistent representation for same semantics. We investigate the challenging problem of this task, i.e., learning a consistent representation between images for a clustering effect of same semantic features. We propose a novel visual similarity learning paradigm, Geometric Visual Similarity Learning, which embeds the prior of topological invariance into the measurement of the inter-image similarity for consistent representation of semantic regions. To drive this paradigm, we further construct a novel geometric matching head, the Z-matching head, to collaboratively learn the global and local similarity of semantic regions, guiding the efficient representation learning for different scale-level inter-image semantic features. Our experiments demonstrate that the pre-training with our learning of inter-image similarity yields more powerful inner-scene, inter-scene, and global-local transferring ability on four challenging 3D medical image tasks.

In this study, we use social media data (Twitter, Weibo) to build a dynamic ontological model in two separate areas: Beijing, China and San Diego, the U.S.A. Three spatial analytics methods are utilized to generate the place name ontology: 1) Kernel Density Estimation (KDE); 2) Dynamic Method Density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN); 3) hierarchal clustering. We identified feature types of place name ontologies from geotagged social media data and classified them by comparing their default search radius of KDE of geo-tagged points. By tracing the seasonal changes of highly dynamic non-administrative places, seasonal variation patterns were observed, which illustrates the dynamic changes in place ontology caused by the change in human activities and conversation over time and space. We also investigate the semantic meaning of each place name by examining Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI) scores and word clouds. The major contribution of this research is to link and analyze the associations between place, space, and their attributes in the field of geography. Researchers can use crowd-sourced data to study the ontology of places rather than relying on traditional gazetteers. The dynamic ontology in this research can provide bright insight into urban planning and re-zoning and other related industries. ",

    "abstract": "Anonymity in social media platforms keeps users hidden behind a keyboard. This absolves users of responsibility, allowing them to engage in online rage, hate speech, and other text-based toxicity that harms online well-being. Recent research in the field of Digital Emotion Regulation (DER) has revealed that indulgence in online toxicity can be a result of ineffective emotional regulation (ER). This, we believe, can be reduced by educating users about the consequences of their actions. Prior DER research has primarily focused on exploring digital emotion regulation practises, identifying emotion regulation using multimodal sensors, and encouraging users to act responsibly in online conversations. While these studies provide valuable insights into how users consciously utilise digital media for emotion regulation, they do not capture the contextual dynamics of emotion regulation online. Through interaction design, this work provides an intervention for the delivery of ER support. It introduces a novel technique for identifying the need for emotional regulation in online conversations and delivering information to users in a way that integrates didactic learning into their daily life. By fostering self-reflection in periods of intensified emotional expression, we present a graph-based framework for on-the-spot emotion regulation support in online conversations. Our findings suggest that using this model in a conversation can help identify its influential threads/nodes to locate where toxicity is concentrated and help reduce it by up to 12\\%. This is the first study in the field of DER that focuses on learning transfer by inducing self-reflection and implicit emotion regulation. ",

    "abstract": "Photovoltaic (PV) panel surface-defect detection technology is crucial for the PV industry to perform smart maintenance. Using computer vision technology to detect PV panel surface defects can ensure better accuracy while reducing the workload of traditional worker field inspections. However, multiple tiny defects on the PV panel surface and the high similarity between different defects make it challenging to {accurately identify and detect such defects}. This paper proposes an approach named Ghost convolution with BottleneckCSP and a tiny target prediction head incorporating YOLOv5 (GBH-YOLOv5) for PV panel defect detection. To ensure better accuracy on multiscale targets, the BottleneckCSP module is introduced to add a prediction head for tiny target detection to alleviate tiny defect misses, using Ghost convolution to improve the model inference speed and reduce the number of parameters. First, the original image is compressed and cropped to enlarge the defect size physically. Then, the processed images are input into GBH-YOLOv5, and the depth features are extracted through network processing based on Ghost convolution, the application of the BottleneckCSP module, and the prediction head of tiny targets. Finally, the extracted features are classified by a Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) and a Path Aggregation Network (PAN) structure. Meanwhile, we compare our method with state-of-the-art methods to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. The proposed PV panel surface-defect detection network improves the mAP performance by at least 27.8%. ",

    "abstract": "Social media studies often collect data retrospectively to analyze public opinion. Social media data may decay over time and such decay may prevent the collection of the complete dataset. As a result, the collected dataset may differ from the complete dataset and the study may suffer from data persistence bias. Past research suggests that the datasets collected retrospectively are largely representative of the original dataset in terms of textual content. However, no study analyzed the impact of data persistence bias on social media studies such as those focusing on controversial topics. In this study, we analyze the data persistence and the bias it introduces on the datasets of three types: controversial topics, trending topics, and framing of issues. We report which topics are more likely to suffer from data persistence among these datasets. We quantify the data persistence bias using the change in political orientation, the presence of potentially harmful content and topics as measures. We found that controversial datasets are more likely to suffer from data persistence and they lean towards the political left upon recollection. The turnout of the data that contain potentially harmful content is significantly lower on non-controversial datasets. Overall, we found that the topics promoted by right-aligned users are more likely to suffer from data persistence. Account suspensions are the primary factor contributing to data removals, if not the only one. Our results emphasize the importance of accounting for the data persistence bias by collecting the data in real time when the dataset employed is vulnerable to data persistence bias. ",

For this, parameter sharing across multiple agents has widely been used since it reduces the training time by decreasing the number of parameters and increasing the sample efficiency. However, using the same parameters across agents limits the representational capacity of the joint policy and consequently, the performance can be degraded in multi-agent tasks that require different behaviors for different agents. In this paper, we propose a simple method that adopts structured pruning for a deep neural network to increase the representational capacity of the joint policy without introducing additional parameters. We evaluate the proposed method on several benchmark tasks, and numerical results show that the proposed method significantly outperforms other parameter-sharing methods. ",

Same as other models evolved by metaheuristic algorithms, premature convergence, trapping in local minima, and failure to converge in a reasonable time are three defects MFO confronts in solving problems with high-dimension search space. Spiral flying is the key component of the MFO as it determines how the moths adjust their positions in relation to flames; thereby, the shape of spiral motions can regulate the transition behavior between the exploration and exploitation phases. Therefore, this chapter investigates the efficiency of seven spiral motions with different curvatures and slopes in the performance of the MFO, especially for underwater target classification tasks. To assess the performance of the customized model, in addition to benchmark Sejnowski & Gorman's dataset, two experimental sonar datasets, i.e., the passive sonar and active datasets, are exploited. The results of MFO and its modifications are compared to four novel nature-inspired algorithms, including Heap-Based Optimizer (HBO), Chimp Optimization Algorithm (ChOA), Ant Lion Optimization (ALO), Stochastic Fractals Search (SFS), as well as the classic Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). The results confirm that the customized MFO shows better performance than the other state-of-the-art models so that the classification rates are increased 1.5979, 0.9985, and 2.0879 for Sejnowski & Gorman, passive, and active datasets, respectively. The results also approve that time complexity is not significantly increased by using different spiral motions. ",

With the large volume of reviews and their uneven quality, the problem of detecting helpful reviews has drawn much attention lately. Existing methods for identifying helpful reviews primarily focus on review text and ignore the two key factors of (1) who post the reviews and (2) when the reviews are posted. Moreover, the helpfulness votes suffer from scarcity for less popular products and recently submitted (a.k.a., cold-start) reviews. To address these challenges, we introduce a dataset and develop a model that integrates the reviewer's expertise, derived from the past review history of the reviewers, and the temporal dynamics of the reviews to automatically assess review helpfulness. We conduct experiments on our dataset to demonstrate the effectiveness of incorporating these factors and report improved results compared to several well-established baselines. ",

Our approach, called QuickCent, is inspired by so-called fast and frugal heuristics, which are heuristics initially proposed to model some human decision and inference processes. The centrality index that we estimate is the harmonic centrality, which is a measure based on shortest-path distances, so infeasible to compute on large networks. We compare QuickCent with known machine learning algorithms on synthetic data generated with preferential attachment, and some empirical networks. Our experiments show that QuickCent is able to make estimates that are competitive in accuracy with the best alternative methods tested, either on synthetic scale-free networks or empirical networks. QuickCent has the feature of achieving low error variance estimates, even with a small training set. Moreover, QuickCent is comparable in efficiency -- accuracy and time cost -- to those produced by more complex methods. We discuss and provide some insight into how QuickCent exploits the fact that in some networks, such as those generated by preferential attachment, local density measures such as the in-degree, can be a proxy for the size of the network region to which a node has access, opening up the possibility of approximating centrality indices based on size such as the harmonic centrality. Our initial results show that simple heuristics and biologically inspired computational methods are a promising line of research in the context of network measure estimations. ",

    "abstract": "Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are biologically inspired alternatives to conventional Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). Despite promising preliminary results, the trade-offs in the training of SNNs in a distributed scheme are not well understood. Here, we consider SNNs in a federated learning setting where a high-quality global model is created by aggregating multiple local models from the clients without sharing any data. We investigate federated learning for training multiple SNNs at clients when two mechanisms reduce the uplink communication cost: i) random masking of the model updates sent from the clients to the server; and ii) client dropouts where some clients do not send their updates to the server. We evaluated the performance of the SNNs using a subset of the Spiking Heidelberg digits (SHD) dataset. The results show that a trade-off between the random masking and the client drop probabilities is crucial to obtain a satisfactory performance for a fixed number of clients. ",

    "abstract": "One of the main obstacles of adopting digital pathology is the challenge of efficient processing of hyperdimensional digitized biopsy samples, called whole slide images (WSIs). Exploiting deep learning and introducing compact WSI representations are urgently needed to accelerate image analysis and facilitate the visualization and interpretability of pathology results in a postpandemic world. In this paper, we introduce a new evolutionary approach for WSI representation based on large-scale multi-objective optimization (LSMOP) of deep embeddings. We start with patch-based sampling to feed KimiaNet , a histopathology-specialized deep network, and to extract a multitude of feature vectors. Coarse multi-objective feature selection uses the reduced search space strategy guided by the classification accuracy and the number of features. In the second stage, the frequent features histogram (FFH), a novel WSI representation, is constructed by multiple runs of coarse LSMOP. Fine evolutionary feature selection is then applied to find a compact (short-length) feature vector based on the FFH and contributes to a more robust deep-learning approach to digital pathology supported by the stochastic power of evolutionary algorithms. We validate the proposed schemes using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) images in terms of WSI representation, classification accuracy, and feature quality. Furthermore, a novel decision space for multicriteria decision making in the LSMOP field is introduced. Finally, a patch-level visualization approach is proposed to increase the interpretability of deep features. The proposed evolutionary algorithm finds a very compact feature vector to represent a WSI (almost 14,000 times smaller than the original feature vectors) with 8% higher accuracy compared to the codes provided by the state-of-the-art methods.

The thesis presents this ongoing research work with the following contributions from this study: (1) We propose a novel ANN training method, LIIT, based on the large deviations theory where additional dimensionality reduction is not needed to study high dimensional data. (2) The LIIT approach uses a Modified Training Sample (MTS) that is generated and iteratively updated using a LAD anomaly score based sampling strategy. (3) The MTS sample is designed to be well representative of the training data by including most anomalous of the observations in each class.

However, highly correlated user channels could drastically impede the spectral efficiency that multi-user beamforming can achieve. As such, it is critical for the base station to schedule a suitable group of users in each transmission interval to achieve maximum spectral efficiency while adhering to fairness constraints among the users. User scheduling is an NP-hard problem, with complexity growing exponentially with the number of users. In this paper, we consider the user scheduling problem for massive MIMO systems. Inspired by recent achievements in deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to solve problems with large action sets, we propose \\name{}, a dynamic scheduler for massive MIMO based on the state-of-the-art Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) DRL model and the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm. Through comprehensive simulations using realistic massive MIMO channel models as well as real-world datasets from channel measurement experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model in various channel conditions. Our results show that our proposed model performs very close to the optimal proportionally fair (PF) scheduler in terms of spectral efficiency and fairness with more than one order of magnitude lower computational complexity in medium network sizes where PF is computationally feasible. Our results also show the feasibility and high performance of our proposed scheduler in networks with a large number of users. ",

Considering direct impact on revenues, companies identify the factors that increases the customer churn rate. Here, key objective of the paper is to develop a unique Customer churn prediction model which can help to predict potential customers who are most likely to churn and such early warnings can help to take corrective measures to retain them.

We propose a model to formalize multistakeholder fairness in recommender systems as a two stage social choice problem. In particular, we express recommendation fairness as a novel combination of an allocation and an aggregation problem, which integrate both fairness concerns and personalized recommendation provisions, and derive new recommendation techniques based on this formulation.

Previous methods achieved promising results empirically by filter-level pruning. In this paper, we both study this problem theoretically and propose an effective algorithm aligning well with our theoretical results. First, we propose the finetune convexity hypothesis to explain why recent few-shot compression algorithms do not suffer from overfitting problems. Based on it, a theory is further established to explain these methods for the first time. Compared to naively finetuning a pruned network, feature mimicking is proved to achieve a lower variance of parameters and hence enjoys easier optimization. With our theoretical conclusions, we claim dropping blocks is a fundamentally superior few-shot compression scheme in terms of more convex optimization and a higher acceleration ratio. To choose which blocks to drop, we propose a new metric, recoverability, to effectively measure the difficulty of recovering the compressed network. Finally, we propose an algorithm named PRACTISE to accelerate networks using only tiny training sets. PRACTISE outperforms previous methods by a significant margin. For 22% latency reduction, it surpasses previous methods by on average 7 percentage points on ImageNet-1k. It also works well under data-free or out-of-domain data settings.

However, real-life recommendation scenarios usually involve heterogeneous relationships (e.g., social-aware user influence, knowledge-aware item dependency) which contains fruitful information to enhance the user preference learning. In this paper, we study the problem of heterogeneous graph-enhanced relational learning for recommendation. Recently, contrastive self-supervised learning has become successful in recommendation. In light of this, we propose a Heterogeneous Graph Contrastive Learning (HGCL), which is able to incorporate heterogeneous relational semantics into the user-item interaction modeling with contrastive learning-enhanced knowledge transfer across different views. However, the influence of heterogeneous side information on interactions may vary by users and items. To move this idea forward, we enhance our heterogeneous graph contrastive learning with meta networks to allow the personalized knowledge transformer with adaptive contrastive augmentation. The experimental results on three real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of HGCL over state-of-the-art recommendation methods. Through ablation study, key components in HGCL method are validated to benefit the recommendation performance improvement.

Infusion of many new types of services is anticipated with future adoption of 6G networks, and sometimes these services will be defined by applications that are external to the network. An RL agent trained for managing the needs of a specific service type may not be ideal for managing a different service type without domain adaptation. We provide a simple heuristic for evaluating a measure of proximity between a new service and existing services, and show that the RL agent of the most proximal service rapidly adapts to the new service type through a well defined process of domain adaptation. Our approach enables a trained source policy to adapt to new situations with changed dynamics without retraining a new policy, thereby achieving significant computing and cost-effectiveness. Such domain adaptation techniques may soon provide a foundation for more generalized RL-based service management under the face of rapidly evolving service types. ",

Maximum and minimum lifts over sensitive features quantify the adversary's knowledge gain and should be bounded to protect privacy. We demonstrate that max and min lifts have a distinct range of values and probability of appearance in the dataset, referred to as \\emph{lift asymmetry}. We propose asymmetric local information privacy (ALIP) as a compatible privacy notion with lift asymmetry, where different bounds can be applied to min and max lifts. We use ALIP in the watchdog and optimal random response (ORR) mechanisms, the main methods to achieve lift-based privacy. It is shown that ALIP enhances utility in these methods compared to existing local information privacy, which ensures the same (symmetric) bounds on both max and min lifts. We propose subset merging for the watchdog mechanism to improve data utility and subset random response for the ORR to reduce complexity. We then investigate the related lift-based measures, including $\\ell_1$-norm, $\\chi^2$-privacy criterion, and $\\alpha$-lift. We reveal that they can only restrict max-lift, resulting in significant min-lift leakage. To overcome this problem, we propose corresponding lift-inverse measures to restrict the min-lift. We apply these lift-based and lift-inverse measures in the watchdog mechanism. We show that they can be considered as relaxations of ALIP, where a higher utility can be achieved by bounding only average max and min lifts. ",

To depict the dynamic model of SAGIN, we propose the reconfigurable time extension graph. Then, an optimization problem is formulated to maximize the number of completed tasks, i.e., the successful deployed SFC. It is a mixed integer linear programming problem, which is hard to solve in limited time complexity. Hence, we transform it as a many-to-one two-sided matching game problem.

For this reason, anomaly-based intrusion detection systems tend to suffer from a high false positive rate (FPR). To overcome this, we propose a two-step collaborative anomaly detection method which first uses an autoencoder to differentiate frequent (`benign') and infrequent (possibly `malicious') traffic flows. Clustering is then used to analyze only the infrequent flows and classify them as either known ('rare yet benign') or unknown (`malicious'). Our method is collaborative, in that (1) normal behaviors are characterized more robustly, as they take into account a variety of user interactions and network topologies, and (2) several features are computed based on a pool of identical devices rather than just the inspected device. We evaluated our method empirically, using 21 days of real-world traffic data that emanated from eight identical IoT devices deployed on various networks, one of which was located in our controlled lab where we implemented two popular IoT-related cyber-attacks. Our collaborative anomaly detection method achieved a macro-average area under the precision-recall curve of 0.841, an F1 score of 0.929, and an FPR of only 0.014. These promising results were obtained by using labeled traffic data from our lab as the test set, while training the models on the traffic of devices deployed outside the lab, and thus demonstrate a high level of generalizability. In addition to its high generalizability and promising performance, our proposed method also offers benefits such as privacy preservation, resource savings, and model poisoning mitigation.

We also design a decoder with learnable bases to enable non-local graph convolution. Importantly, Specformer is equivariant to permutation. By stacking multiple Specformer layers, one can build a powerful spectral GNN. On synthetic datasets, we show that our Specformer can better recover ground-truth spectral filters than other spectral GNNs.

This strategy can encourage varied consistency of time-series representations depending on the positive pair selection and contrastive loss. We propose a new time-series representation learning method by combining the advantages of self-supervised tasks related to contextual, temporal, and transformation consistency. It allows the network to learn general representations for various downstream tasks and domains. Specifically, we first adopt data preprocessing to generate positive and negative pairs for each self-supervised task. The model then performs contextual, temporal, and transformation contrastive learning and is optimized jointly using their contrastive losses. We further investigate an uncertainty weighting approach to enable effective multi-task learning by considering the contribution of each consistency. We evaluate the proposed framework on three downstream tasks: time-series classification, forecasting, and anomaly detection.

In light of this, we propose Neural Intrinsic Embedding (NIE) to embed each vertex into a high-dimensional space in a way that respects the intrinsic structure. Based upon NIE, we further present a weakly-supervised learning framework for non-rigid point cloud registration. Unlike the prior works, we do not require expansive and sensitive off-line basis construction (e.g., eigen-decomposition of Laplacians), nor do we require ground-truth correspondence labels for supervision. We empirically show that our framework performs on par with or even better than the state-of-the-art baselines, which generally require more supervision and/or more structural geometric input. ",

    "abstract": "Temporal sentence localization in videos (TSLV) aims to retrieve the most interested segment in an untrimmed video according to a given sentence query. However, almost of existing TSLV approaches suffer from the same limitations: (1) They only focus on either frame-level or object-level visual representation learning and corresponding correlation reasoning, but fail to integrate them both; (2) They neglect to leverage the rich semantic contexts to further benefit the query reasoning. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose a novel Hierarchical Visual- and Semantic-Aware Reasoning Network (HVSARN), which enables both visual- and semantic-aware query reasoning from object-level to frame-level. Specifically, we present a new graph memory mechanism to perform visual-semantic query reasoning: For visual reasoning, we design a visual graph memory to leverage visual information of video; For semantic reasoning, a semantic graph memory is also introduced to explicitly leverage semantic knowledge contained in the classes and attributes of video objects, and perform correlation reasoning in the semantic space. Experiments on three datasets demonstrate that our HVSARN achieves a new state-of-the-art performance. ",

    "abstract": "Classification and localization are two main sub-tasks in object detection. Nonetheless, these two tasks have inconsistent preferences for feature context, i.e., localization expects more boundary-aware features to accurately regress the bounding box, while more semantic context is preferred for object classification. Exsiting methods usually leverage disentangled heads to learn different feature context for each task. However, the heads are still applied on the same input features, which leads to an imperfect balance between classifcation and localization. In this work, we propose a novel Task-Specific COntext DEcoupling (TSCODE) head which further disentangles the feature encoding for two tasks. For classification, we generate spatially-coarse but semantically-strong feature encoding. For localization, we provide high-resolution feature map containing more edge information to better regress object boundaries. TSCODE is plug-and-play and can be easily incorperated into existing detection pipelines. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method stably improves different detectors by over 1.0 AP with less computational cost. Our code and models will be publicly released. ",

In this paper, we propose a way of delving into the unexpected vulnerability in adversarially trained networks from a causal perspective, namely adversarial instrumental variable (IV) regression. By deploying it, we estimate the causal relation of adversarial prediction under an unbiased environment dissociated from unknown confounders. Our approach aims to demystify inherent causal features on adversarial examples by leveraging a zero-sum optimization game between a casual feature estimator (i.e., hypothesis model) and worst-case counterfactuals (i.e., test function) disturbing to find causal features. Through extensive analyses, we demonstrate that the estimated causal features are highly related to the correct prediction for adversarial robustness, and the counterfactuals exhibit extreme features significantly deviating from the correct prediction. In addition, we present how to effectively inoculate CAusal FEatures (CAFE) into defense networks for improving adversarial robustness. ",

Higher-order complex beam PDEs are efficiently solved for forward problems to compute the transverse displacements and cross-sectional rotations with less than 1e-3 percent error. Furthermore, inverse problems are robustly solved to determine the unknown dimensionless model parameters and applied force in the entire space-time domain, even in the case of noisy data.

The recent development of deep learning techniques especially pre-training models make the code generation task achieve promising performance. In this paper, we systematically review the current work on deep learning-based code generation and classify the current deep learning-based code generation methods into three categories: methods based on code features, methods incorporated with retrieval, and methods incorporated with post-processing. The first category refers to the methods that use deep learning algorithms for code generation based on code features, and the second and third categories of methods improve the performance of the methods in the first category. In this paper, the existing research results of each category of methods are systematically reviewed, summarized and commented. The paper then summarizes and analyzes the corpus and the popular evaluation metrics used in the existing code generation work.

To this aim, we propose an optimization problem, including an adversarial loss term and a similarity term. We use gradient projection in the embedding space to craft an adversarial sentence. Experimental results show that our attack outperforms Seq2Sick, the other targeted adversarial attack against NMT models, in terms of success rate and decrease in translation quality. Our attack succeeds in inserting a keyword into the translation for more than 75% of sentences while similarity with the original sentence stays preserved. ",

To this end, we introduce HAMBO, which builds on an uncertainty-aware learned model of the transition dynamics. To form a conservative estimate of the policy's performance, HAMBO hallucinates worst-case trajectories that the policy may take, within the margin of the models' epistemic confidence regions. We prove that the resulting COPE estimates are valid lower bounds, and, under regularity conditions, show their convergence to the true expected return. Finally, we discuss scalable variants of our approach based on Bayesian Neural Networks and empirically demonstrate that they yield reliable and tight lower bounds in various continuous control environments.

Recently, various unbiased strategies have been proposed by designing novel loss functions and data balancing strategies. Unfortunately, these unbiased methods fail to emphasize language priors in feature refinement perspective. Inspired by the fact that predicates are highly correlated with semantics hidden in subject-object pair and global context, we propose LANDMARK (LANguage-guiDed representationenhanceMent frAmewoRK) that learns predicate-relevant representations from language-vision interactive patterns, global language context and pair-predicate correlation. Specifically, we first project object labels to three distinctive semantic embeddings for different representation learning. Then, Language Attention Module (LAM) and Experience Estimation Module (EEM) process subject-object word embeddings to attention vector and predicate distribution, respectively. Language Context Module (LCM) encodes global context from each word embed-ding, which avoids isolated learning from local information. Finally, modules outputs are used to update visual representations and SGG model's prediction. All language representations are purely generated from object categories so that no extra knowledge is needed. This framework is model-agnostic and consistently improves performance on existing SGG models. Besides, representation-level unbiased strategies endow LANDMARK the advantage of compatibility with other methods. Code is available at https://github.com/rafa-cxg/PySGG-cxg. ",

    "abstract": "Depth perception is considered an invaluable source of information in the context of 3D mapping and various robotics applications. However, point cloud maps acquired using consumer-level light detection and ranging sensors (lidars) still suffer from bias related to local surface properties such as measuring beam-to-surface incidence angle, distance, texture, reflectance, or illumination conditions. This fact has recently motivated researchers to exploit traditional filters, as well as the deep learning paradigm, in order to suppress the aforementioned depth sensors error while preserving geometric and map consistency details. Despite the effort, depth correction of lidar measurements is still an open challenge mainly due to the lack of clean 3D data that could be used as ground truth. In this paper, we introduce two novel point cloud map consistency losses, which facilitate self-supervised learning on real data of lidar depth correction models. Specifically, the models exploit multiple point cloud measurements of the same scene from different view-points in order to learn to reduce the bias based on the constructed map consistency signal. Complementary to the removal of the bias from the measurements, we demonstrate that the depth correction models help to reduce localization drift. Additionally, we release a data set that contains point cloud data captured in an indoor corridor environment with precise localization and ground truth mapping information. ",

However, it is exceedingly costly because it requires resources and inference latency proportional to the number of models, which remains the bottleneck for production. Our work aims to transfer the ensemble knowledge of heterogeneous teachers to a lightweight student model using knowledge distillation (KD), to reduce the huge inference costs while retaining high accuracy. Through an empirical study, we find that the efficacy of distillation severely drops when transferring knowledge from heterogeneous teachers. Nevertheless, we show that an important signal to ease the difficulty can be obtained from the teacher's training trajectory. This paper proposes a new KD framework, named HetComp, that guides the student model by transferring easy-to-hard sequences of knowledge generated from the teachers' trajectories. To provide guidance according to the student's learning state, HetComp uses dynamic knowledge construction to provide progressively difficult ranking knowledge and adaptive knowledge transfer to gradually transfer finer-grained ranking information. Our comprehensive experiments show that HetComp significantly improves the distillation quality and the generalization of the student model. ",

There are approaches that can train neural networks where such domain requirements are enforced as constraints, but they either cannot guarantee that the constraint will be satisfied by all possible predictions (even on unseen data) or they are limited in the type of constraints that can be enforced. In this paper, we present an approach to train neural networks which can enforce a wide variety of constraints and guarantee that the constraint is satisfied by all possible predictions. The approach builds on earlier work where learning linear models is formulated as a constraint satisfaction problem (CSP). To make this idea applicable to neural networks, two crucial new elements are added: constraint propagation over the network layers, and weight updates based on a mix of gradient descent and CSP solving. Evaluation on various machine learning tasks demonstrates that our approach is flexible enough to enforce a wide variety of domain constraints and is able to guarantee them in neural networks. ",

In this work, we propose a new path planning algorithm that explicitly accounts for such erroneous prediction. The key idea is the probabilistic fusion of distinctive ML models for terrain type classification and slip prediction into a single distribution. This gives us a multimodal slip distribution accounting for heterogeneous terrains and further allows statistical risk assessment to be applied to derive risk-aware traversing costs for path planning. Extensive simulation experiments have demonstrated that the proposed method is able to generate more feasible paths on heterogeneous terrains compared to existing methods. ",

We achieve this by comparing two models pre-trained with the same self-supervised pre-training objective. The first model is trained on language pairs with different word-orders, and the second model is trained on the same language pairs with source language re-ordered to match the word-order of the target language. Ideally, UNMT approaches which are robust to word-order divergence should exhibit no visible performance difference between the two configurations. In this paper, we investigate two such self-supervised pre-training based UNMT approaches, namely Masked Sequence-to-Sequence Pre-Training, (MASS) (which does not have shuffling noise) and Denoising AutoEncoder (DAE), (which has shuffling noise). We experiment with five English$\\rightarrow$Indic language pairs, i.e., en-hi, en-bn, en-gu, en-kn, and en-ta) where word-order of the source language is SVO (Subject-Verb-Object), and the word-order of the target languages is SOV (Subject-Object-Verb). We observed that for these language pairs, DAE-based UNMT approach consistently outperforms MASS in terms of translation accuracies. Moreover, bridging the word-order gap using reordering improves the translation accuracy of MASS-based UNMT models, while it cannot improve the translation accuracy of DAE-based UNMT models. This observation indicates that DAE-based UNMT is more robust to word-order divergence than MASS-based UNMT. Word-shuffling noise in DAE approach could be the possible reason for the approach being robust to word-order divergence. ",

    "abstract": "Time-series prediction has drawn considerable attention during the past decades fueled by the emerging advances of deep learning methods. However, most neural network based methods lack interpretability and fail in extracting the hidden mechanism of the targeted physical system. To overcome these shortcomings, an interpretable sparse system identification method without any prior knowledge is proposed in this study. This method adopts the Fourier transform to reduces the irrelevant items in the dictionary matrix, instead of indiscriminate usage of polynomial functions in most system identification methods. It shows an interpretable system representation and greatly reduces computing cost. With the adoption of $l_1$ norm in regularizing the parameter matrix, a sparse description of the system model can be achieved. Moreover, Three data sets including the water conservancy data, global temperature data and financial data are used to test the performance of the proposed method. Although no prior knowledge was known about the physical background, experimental results show that our method can achieve long-term prediction regardless of the noise and incompleteness in the original data more accurately than the widely-used baseline data-driven methods. This study may provide some insight into time-series prediction investigations, and suggests that an white-box system identification method may extract the easily overlooked yet inherent periodical features and may beat neural-network based black-box methods on long-term prediction tasks.

The proposed model leverages prior scene knowledge such as object shape and texture similar to single-image depth inference methods, whilst also constraining the motion and geometry from a sequence of input images. Apart from the transformer architecture, one of the main contributions with respect to prior works lies in the objective function that enforces spatio-temporal consistency across a sequence of output frames rather than a single output frame. As will be shown, this results in more accurate and robust depth sequence forecasting. The model achieves highly accurate depth forecasting results that outperform existing baselines on the KITTI benchmark. Extensive ablation studies were performed to assess the effectiveness of the proposed techniques. One remarkable result of the proposed model is that it is implicitly capable of forecasting the motion of objects in the scene, rather than requiring complex models involving multi-object detection, segmentation and tracking.

    "abstract": "Detecting Out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs have been a critical issue for neural networks in the open world. However, the unstable behavior of OOD detection along the optimization trajectory during training has not been explored clearly. In this paper, we first find the performance of OOD detection suffers from overfitting and instability during training: 1) the performance could decrease when the training error is near zero, and 2) the performance would vary sharply in the final stage of training. Based on our findings, we propose Average of Pruning (AoP), consisting of model averaging and pruning, to mitigate the unstable behaviors. Specifically, model averaging can help achieve a stable performance by smoothing the landscape, and pruning is certified to eliminate the overfitting by eliminating redundant features. Comprehensive experiments on various datasets and architectures are conducted to verify the effectiveness of our method. ",

For FSD, some fine-grained information is very important, such as spectrogram defects, mute segments, and so on, which are often perceived by shallow networks. However, shallow networks have much noise, which can not capture this very well. To address this problem, we propose using the deepest network instruct shallow network for enhancing shallow networks. Specifically, the networks of FSD are divided into several segments, the deepest network being used as the teacher model, and all shallow networks become multiple student models by adding classifiers. Meanwhile, the distillation path between the deepest network feature and shallow network features is used to reduce the feature difference. A series of experimental results on the ASVspoof 2019 LA and PA datasets show the effectiveness of the proposed method, with significant improvements compared to the baseline. ",

    "abstract": "Object detection is a fundamental problem in computer vision, aiming at locating and classifying objects in image. Although current devices can easily take very high-resolution images, current approaches of object detection seldom consider detecting tiny object or the large scale variance problem in high resolution images. In this paper, we introduce a simple yet efficient approach that improves accuracy of object detection especially for small objects and large scale variance scene while reducing the computational cost in high resolution image. Inspired by observing that overall detection accuracy is reduced if the image is properly down-sampled but the recall rate is not significantly reduced. Besides, small objects can be better detected by inputting high-resolution images even if using lightweight detector. We propose a cluster-based coarse-to-fine object detection framework to enhance the performance for detecting small objects while ensure the accuracy of large objects in high-resolution images. For the first stage, we perform coarse detection on the down-sampled image and center localization of small objects by lightweight detector on high-resolution image, and then obtains image chips based on cluster region generation method by coarse detection and center localization results, and further sends chips to the second stage detector for fine detection. Finally, we merge the coarse detection and fine detection results. Our approach can make good use of the sparsity of the objects and the information in high-resolution image, thereby making the detection more efficient. Experiment results show that our proposed approach achieves promising performance compared with other state-of-the-art detectors. ",

To fill these gaps, we introduce BikeDNA, an open-source tool for reproducible quality assessment tailored to bicycle infrastructure data with a focus on network structure and connectivity. BikeDNA performs either a standalone analysis of one data set or a comparative analysis between OpenStreetMap and a reference data set, including feature matching. Data quality metrics are considered both globally for the entire study area and locally on grid cell level, thus exposing spatial variation in data quality. Interactive maps and HTML/PDF reports are generated to facilitate the visual exploration and communication of results.

Existing techniques for generating adversarial examples are typically driven by deterministic heuristic rules that are agnostic to the optimal adversarial examples, a strategy that often results in attack failures. To this end, this research proposes Fraud's Bargain Attack (FBA) which utilizes a novel randomization mechanism to enlarge the search space and enables high-quality adversarial examples to be generated with high probabilities. FBA applies the Metropolis-Hasting sampler, a member of Markov Chain Monte Carlo samplers, to enhance the selection of adversarial examples from all candidates proposed by a customized stochastic process that we call the Word Manipulation Process (WMP). WMP perturbs one word at a time via insertion, removal or substitution in a contextual-aware manner.

Achieving near-ML performance is very challenging especially for short block lengths. Polar codes are a promising candidate and already part of the 5G standard. The Successive Cancellation List (SCL) decoding algorithm provides very good error correction performance but at the cost of high computational decoding complexity resulting in large latency and low area and energy efficiency. Recently, Automorphism Ensemble Decoding (AED) gained a lot of attention to improve the error correction capability. In contrast to SCL, AED performs several low-complexity (e.g., SC) decoding in parallel. However, it is an open question whether AED can compete with sophisticated SCL decoders, especially from an implementation perspective in state of the art silicon technologies. In this paper we present an elaborated AED architecture that uses an advanced path metric based candidate selection to reduce the implementation complexity and compare it to state of the art SCL decoders in a 12nm FinFET technology. Our AED implementation outperform state of the art SCL decoders by up to 4.4x in latency, 8.9x in area efficiency and 4.6x in energy efficiency, while providing the same or even better error correction performance.

In this paper, we propose to recognize apparent personality recognition approach which first trains a person-specific network for each subject, modelling multi-scale long-term person-specific behavior evolution of the subject. Consequently, we hypothesize that the weights of the network contain the person-specific facial behavior-related cues of the subject. Then, we propose to encode the weights of the person-specific network to a graph representation, as the personality representation for the subject, allowing them to be processed by standard Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for personality traits recognition. The experimental results show that our novel network weights-based approach achieved superior performance than most traditional latent feature-based approaches, and has comparable performance to the state-of-the-art method. Importantly, the produced graph representations produce robust results when using different GNNs. This paper further validated that person-specific network's weights are correlated to the subject's personality. ",

Nevertheless, the rise of those networks in modern computing has been accompanied by concerns regarding their vulnerability to adversarial attacks. In this work, we propose a novel gradient-free, gray box, incremental attack that targets the training process of neural networks. The proposed attack, which implicitly poisons the intermediate data structures that retain the training instances between training epochs acquires its high-risk property from attacking data structures that are typically unobserved by professionals. Hence, the attack goes unnoticed despite the damage it can cause. Moreover, the attack can be executed without the attackers' knowledge of the neural network structure or training data making it more dangerous. The attack was tested under a sensitive application of secure cognitive cities, namely, biometric authentication. The conducted experiments showed that the proposed attack is effective and stealthy. Finally, the attack effectiveness property was concluded from the fact that it was able to flip the sign of the loss gradient in the conducted experiments to become positive, which indicated noisy and unstable training. Moreover, the attack was able to decrease the inference probability in the poisoned networks compared to their unpoisoned counterparts by 15.37%, 14.68%, and 24.88% for the Densenet, VGG, and Xception, respectively. Finally, the attack retained its stealthiness despite its high effectiveness. This was demonstrated by the fact that the attack did not cause a notable increase in the training time, in addition, the Fscore values only dropped by an average of 1.2%, 1.9%, and 1.5% for the poisoned Densenet, VGG, and Xception, respectively.

Recent studies find that GNNs are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. However, effective backdoor attacks on graphs are still an open problem. In particular, backdoor attack poisons the graph by attaching triggers and the target class label to a set of nodes in the training graph. The backdoored GNNs trained on the poisoned graph will then be misled to predict test nodes to target class once attached with triggers. Though there are some initial efforts in graph backdoor attacks, our empirical analysis shows that they may require a large attack budget for effective backdoor attacks and the injected triggers can be easily detected and pruned. Therefore, in this paper, we study a novel problem of unnoticeable graph backdoor attacks with limited attack budget. To fully utilize the attack budget, we propose to deliberately select the nodes to inject triggers and target class labels in the poisoning phase. An adaptive trigger generator is deployed to obtain effective triggers that are difficult to be noticed. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets against various defense strategies demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method in conducting effective unnoticeable backdoor attacks. ",

To resolve the discontinuous information transmission problem, we propose a control principle to supervise representation learning by leveraging the prototypes (i.e., class centers) of labeled data. Treating graph learning as a discrete dynamic process and the prototypes of labeled data as \"desired\" class representations, we borrow the pinning control idea from automatic control theory to design learning feedback controllers for the feature learning process, attempting to minimize the differences between message passing derived features and the class prototypes in every round so as to generate class-relevant features. Specifically, we equip every node with an optimal controller in each round through learning the matching relationships between nodes and the class prototypes, enabling nodes to rectify the aggregated information from incompatible neighbors in a graph with strong heterophily. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed PCGCN model achieves better performances than deep GNNs and other competitive heterophily-oriented methods, especially when the graph has very few labels and strong heterophily.

This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the metrics used for the evaluation of time series anomaly detection methods, and also defines a taxonomy of these based on how they are calculated. By defining a set of properties for evaluation metrics and a set of specific case studies and experiments, twenty metrics are analyzed and discussed in detail, highlighting the unique suitability of each for specific tasks.

Existing communication compression techniques mainly focus on traditional DNN training, whose bottleneck lies in synchronizing gradients and parameters. We find they do not work well in distributed GNN training as the barrier is the layer-wise communication of features during the forward pass & feature gradients during the backward pass. To this end, we propose an efficient distributed GNN training framework Sylvie, which employs one-bit quantization technique in GNNs and further pipelines the curtailed communication with computation to enormously shrink the overhead while maintaining the model quality. In detail, Sylvie provides a lightweight Low-bit Module to quantize the sent data and dequantize the received data back to full precision values in each layer. Additionally, we propose a Bounded Staleness Adaptor to control the introduced staleness to achieve further performance enhancement. We conduct theoretical convergence analysis and extensive experiments on various models & datasets to demonstrate Sylvie can considerably boost the training throughput by up to 28.1x. ",

A key aspect of our approach is a new technique for uncertainty estimation in image-based neural rendering, which guides measurement acquisition at the most uncertain view among view candidates, thus maximising the information value during data collection. By incrementally adding new measurements into our image collection, our approach efficiently explores an unknown scene in a mapless manner. We show that our uncertainty estimation is generalisable and valuable for view planning in unknown scenes. Our planning experiments using synthetic and real-world data verify that our uncertainty-guided approach finds informative images leading to more accurate scene representations when compared against baselines.

    "abstract": "The optical neural network (ONN) has been considered as a promising candidate for next-generation neurocomputing due to its high parallelism, low latency, and low energy consumption, with significant potential to release unprecedented computational capability. Large-scale ONNs could process more neural information and improve the prediction performance. However, previous ONN architectures based on matrix multiplication are difficult to scale up due to manufacturing limitations, resulting in limited scalability and small input data volumes. To address this challenge, we propose a compact and scalable photonic computing architecture based on temporal photoelectric multiplication and accumulate (MAC) operations, allowing direct processing of large-scale matrix computations in the time domain. By employing a temporal computing unit composed of cascaded modulators and time-integrator, we conduct a series of proof-of-principle experiments including image edge detection, optical neural networks-based recognition tasks, and sliding-window method-based multi-target detection. Thanks to its intrinsic scalability, the demonstrated photonic computing architecture could be easily integrated on a single chip toward large-scale photonic neural networks with ultrahigh computation throughputs.

    "abstract": "Recent works have shown that self-supervised learning can achieve remarkable robustness when integrated with adversarial training (AT). However, the robustness gap between supervised AT (sup-AT) and self-supervised AT (self-AT) remains significant. Motivated by this observation, we revisit existing self-AT methods and discover an inherent dilemma that affects self-AT robustness: either strong or weak data augmentations are harmful to self-AT, and a medium strength is insufficient to bridge the gap. To resolve this dilemma, we propose a simple remedy named DYNACL (Dynamic Adversarial Contrastive Learning). In particular, we propose an augmentation schedule that gradually anneals from a strong augmentation to a weak one to benefit from both extreme cases. Besides, we adopt a fast post-processing stage for adapting it to downstream tasks. Through extensive experiments, we show that DYNACL can improve state-of-the-art self-AT robustness by 8.84% under Auto-Attack on the CIFAR-10 dataset, and can even outperform vanilla supervised adversarial training for the first time.

Currently, the Recommender Systems area includes a large number of subfields in which accuracy and beyond accuracy quality measures are continuously improved. To feed this research variety, it is necessary and convenient to reinforce the existing datasets with synthetic ones. This paper proposes a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)-based method to generate collaborative filtering datasets in a parameterized way, by selecting their preferred number of users, items, samples, and stochastic variability. This parameterization cannot be made using regular GANs. Our GAN model is fed with dense, short, and continuous embedding representations of items and users, instead of sparse, large, and discrete vectors, to make an accurate and quick learning, compared to the traditional approach based on large and sparse input vectors. The proposed architecture includes a DeepMF model to extract the dense user and item embeddings, as well as a clustering process to convert from the dense GAN generated samples to the discrete and sparse ones, necessary to create each required synthetic dataset. The results of three different source datasets show adequate distributions and expected quality values and evolutions on the generated datasets compared to the source ones.

Most previous works address this problem in a goal-conditioned way and adapt the goal image to specify a task, which is not practical or efficient. Thus, we adapted natural language specification and proposed a language-conditioned deformable object manipulation policy learning framework. We first design a unified Transformer-based architecture to understand multi-modal data and output picking and placing action. Besides, we have introduced the visible connectivity graph to tackle nonlinear dynamics and complex configuration of the deformable object in the manipulation process. Both simulated and real experiments have demonstrated that the proposed method is general and effective in language-conditioned deformable object manipulation policy learning. Our method achieves much higher success rates on various language-conditioned deformable object manipulation tasks (87.3% on average) than the state-of-the-art method in simulation experiments. Besides, our method is much lighter and has a 75.6% shorter inference time than state-of-the-art methods. We also demonstrate that our method performs well in real-world applications.

One generalizable and scalable strategy for HOI detection is to use weak supervision, learning from image-level annotations only. This is inherently challenging due to ambiguous human-object associations, large search space of detecting HOIs and highly noisy training signal. A promising strategy to address those challenges is to exploit knowledge from large-scale pretrained models (e.g., CLIP), but a direct knowledge distillation strategy~\\citep{liao2022gen} does not perform well on the weakly-supervised setting. In contrast, we develop a CLIP-guided HOI representation capable of incorporating the prior knowledge at both image level and HOI instance level, and adopt a self-taught mechanism to prune incorrect human-object associations. Experimental results on HICO-DET and V-COCO show that our method outperforms the previous works by a sizable margin, showing the efficacy of our HOI representation. ",

These modules are being used to acquire information about the surroundings and identify obstacles. Hence, accurate detection and classification are essential to reach appropriate decisions and take appropriate and safe actions at all times. Current studies have demonstrated that \"printed adversarial attacks\", known as physical adversarial attacks, can successfully mislead perception models such as object detectors and image classifiers. However, most of these physical attacks are based on noticeable and eye-catching patterns for generated perturbations making them identifiable/detectable by human eye or in test drives. In this paper, we propose a camera-based inconspicuous adversarial attack (\\textbf{AdvRain}) capable of fooling camera-based perception systems over all objects of the same class. Unlike mask based fake-weather attacks that require access to the underlying computing hardware or image memory, our attack is based on emulating the effects of a natural weather condition (i.e., Raindrops) that can be printed on a translucent sticker, which is externally placed over the lens of a camera. To accomplish this, we provide an iterative process based on performing a random search aiming to identify critical positions to make sure that the performed transformation is adversarial for a target classifier. Our transformation is based on blurring predefined parts of the captured image corresponding to the areas covered by the raindrop. We achieve a drop in average model accuracy of more than $45\\%$ and $40\\%$ on VGG19 for ImageNet and Resnet34 for Caltech-101, respectively, using only $20$ raindrops. ",

    "abstract": "When analyzing complex networks, an important task is the identification of those nodes which play a leading role for the overall communicability of the network. In the context of modifying networks (or making them robust against targeted attacks or outages), it is also relevant to know how sensitive the network's communicability reacts to changes in certain nodes or edges. Recently, the concept of total network sensitivity was introduced in [O. De la Cruz Cabrera, J. Jin, S. Noschese, L. Reichel, Communication in complex networks, Appl. Numer. Math., 172, pp. 186-205, 2022], which allows to measure how sensitive the total communicability of a network is to the addition or removal of certain edges. One shortcoming of this concept is that sensitivities are extremely costly to compute when using a straight-forward approach (orders of magnitude more expensive than the corresponding communicability measures). In this work, we present computational procedures for estimating network sensitivity with a cost that is essentially linear in the number of nodes for many real-world complex networks. Additionally, we extend the sensitivity concept such that it also covers sensitivity of subgraph centrality and the Estrada index, and we discuss the case of node removal. We propose a priori bounds for these sensitivities which capture the qualitative behavior well and give insight into the general behavior of matrix function based network indices under perturbations. These bounds are based on decay results for Fr\\'echet derivatives of matrix functions with structured, low-rank direction terms which might be of independent interest also for other applications than network analysis.

    "abstract": "In recent years, monocular depth estimation (MDE) has witnessed a substantial performance improvement due to convolutional neural networks (CNNs). However, CNNs are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, which pose serious concerns for safety-critical and security-sensitive systems. Specifically, adversarial attacks can have catastrophic impact on MDE given its importance for scene understanding in applications like autonomous driving and robotic navigation. To physically assess the vulnerability of CNN-based depth prediction methods, recent work tries to design adversarial patches against MDE. However, these methods are not powerful enough to fully fool the vision system in a systemically threatening manner. In fact, their impact is partial and locally limited; they mislead the depth prediction of only the overlapping region with the input image regardless of the target object size, shape and location. In this paper, we investigate MDE vulnerability to adversarial patches in a more comprehensive manner. We propose a novel adaptive adversarial patch (APARATE) that is able to selectively jeopardize MDE by either corrupting the estimated distance, or simply manifesting an object as disappeared for the autonomous system. Specifically, APARATE is optimized to be shape and scale-aware, and its impact adapts to the target object instead of being limited to the immediate neighborhood. Our proposed patch achieves more than $14~meters$ mean depth estimation error, with $99\\%$ of the target region being affected. We believe this work highlights the threat of adversarial attacks in the context of MDE, and we hope it would alert the community to the real-life potential harm of this attack and motivate investigating more robust and adaptive defenses for autonomous robots.

To tackle this problem, we introduce an $\\textit{a contrario}$ decision criterion into the learning process to take into account the unexpectedness of small objects. This statistic criterion enhances the feature map responses while controlling the number of false alarms (NFA) and can be integrated into any semantic segmentation neural network.

However, when applied to high magnification datasets, problems emerge due to the large number of instances and the weak supervisory learning signal. To address this problem, we propose to additionally train transformers with a novel Bag Embedding Loss (BEL). BEL forces the model to learn a discriminative bag-level representation by minimizing the distance between bag embeddings of the same class and maximizing the distance between different classes. We evaluate BEL with the Transformer architecture TransMIL on two publicly available histopathology datasets, BRACS and CAMELYON17. We show that with BEL, TransMIL outperforms the baseline models on both datasets, thus contributing to the clinically highly relevant AI-based tumor classification of histological patient material.

Using a dual approach to community detection, in this study we extend the concept of link communities to hypergraphs, allowing us to extract informative clusters of highly related hyperedges. We analyze the dendrograms obtained by applying hierarchical clustering to distance matrices among hyperedges on a variety of real-world data, showing that hyperlink communities naturally highlight the hierarchical and multiscale structure of higher-order networks. Moreover, by using hyperlink communities, we are able to extract overlapping memberships from nodes, overcoming limitations of traditional hard clustering methods. Finally, we introduce higher-order network cartography as a practical tool for categorizing nodes into different structural roles based on their interaction patterns and community participation. This approach helps identify different types of individuals in a variety of real-world social systems.

This setting is different from traditional ride-sharing marketplaces because of the absence of the supply side (drivers). However, it has far-reaching consequences because in addition to pricing, players now have to make decisions on how to distribute fleets across network locations and re-balance vehicles in order to serve future demand. In this paper, we explore a duopoly setting in the ride-sharing marketplace where the players have fully autonomous fleets. Each ride-service provider (rsp)'s prices depends on the prices and the supply of the other player. We formulate their decision-making problems using a game-theoretic setup where each player seeks to find the optimal prices and supplies at each node while considering the decisions of the other player. This leads to a scenario where the players' optimization problems are coupled and it is challenging to solve for the equilibrium. We characterize the types of demand functions (e.g.: linear) for which this game admits an exact potential function and can be solved efficiently. For other types of demand functions, we propose an iterative heuristic to compute the equilibrium. We conclude by providing numerical insights into how different kinds of equilibria would play out in the market when the players are asymmetric or when there are regulations in place. ",

In the recently proposed continuous settings (continuous VLN), the agent must act in a free 3D space and faces tougher challenges like real-time execution, complex instruction understanding, and long action sequence prediction. For a better performance in continuous VLN, we design a multi-level instruction understanding procedure and propose a novel model, Multi-Level Attention Network (MLANet). The first step of MLANet is to generate sub-instructions efficiently. We design a Fast Sub-instruction Algorithm (FSA) to segment the raw instruction into sub-instructions and generate a new sub-instruction dataset named ``FSASub\". FSA is annotation-free and faster than the current method by 70 times, thus fitting the real-time requirement in continuous VLN. To solve the complex instruction understanding problem, MLANet needs a global perception of the instruction and observations. We propose a Multi-Level Attention (MLA) module to fuse vision, low-level semantics, and high-level semantics, which produce features containing a dynamic and global comprehension of the task. MLA also mitigates the adverse effects of noise words, thus ensuring a robust understanding of the instruction. To correctly predict actions in long trajectories, MLANet needs to focus on what sub-instruction is being executed every step. We propose a Peak Attention Loss (PAL) to improve the flexible and adaptive selection of the current sub-instruction. PAL benefits the navigation agent by concentrating its attention on the local information, thus helping the agent predict the most appropriate actions. We train and test MLANet in the standard benchmark. Experiment results show MLANet outperforms baselines by a significant margin. ",

Feldman and Langberg [STOC'11] have shown that for $k$-clustering of $n$ points in general metrics, it is possible to obtain coresets whose size depends logarithmically in $n$. Moreover, such a dependency in $n$ is inevitable in general metrics. A significant amount of recent work in the area is devoted to obtaining coresests whose sizes are independent of $n$ (i.e., ``small'' coresets) for special metrics, like $d$-dimensional Euclidean spaces, doubling metrics, metrics of graphs of bounded treewidth, or those excluding a fixed minor. In this paper, we provide the first constructions of small coresets for $k$-clustering in the metrics induced by geometric intersection graphs, such as Euclidean-weighted Unit Disk/Square Graphs. These constructions follow from a general theorem that identifies two canonical properties of a graph metric sufficient for obtaining small coresets. The proof of our theorem builds on the recent work of Cohen-Addad, Saulpic, and Schwiegelshohn [STOC '21], which ensures small-sized coresets conditioned on the existence of an interesting set of centers, called ``centroid set''. The main technical contribution of our work is the proof of the existence of such a small-sized centroid set for graphs that satisfy the two canonical geometric properties. The new coreset construction helps to design the first $(1+\\epsilon)$-approximation for center-based clustering problems in UDGs and USGs, that is fixed-parameter tractable in $k$ and $\\epsilon$ (FPT-AS).

The remarkable flexibility of modern Machine Learning (ML) methods is perfectly suited to this task. However, data-driven hyperparameter tuning of ML methods requires effective model evaluation to avoid large errors in causal estimates, a task made more challenging because causal inference involves unavailable counterfactuals. Multiple performance-validation metrics have recently been proposed such that practitioners now not only have to make complex decisions about which causal estimators, ML learners and hyperparameters to choose, but also about which evaluation metric to use. This paper, motivated by unclear recommendations, investigates the interplay between the four different aspects of model evaluation for causal effect estimation. We develop a comprehensive experimental setup that involves many commonly used causal estimators, ML methods and evaluation approaches and apply it to four well-known causal inference benchmark datasets. Our results suggest that optimal hyperparameter tuning of ML learners is enough to reach state-of-the-art performance in effect estimation, regardless of estimators and learners. We conclude that most causal estimators are roughly equivalent in performance if tuned thoroughly enough. We also find hyperparameter tuning and model evaluation are much more important than causal estimators and ML methods. Finally, from the significant gap we find in estimation performance of popular evaluation metrics compared with optimal model selection choices, we call for more research into causal model evaluation to unlock the optimum performance not currently being delivered even by state-of-the-art procedures.

It scales to (at least) 8192 cores while achieving partitioning quality comparable to widely used sequential and shared-memory graph partitioners. In comparison, previous distributed graph partitioners scale only in more restricted scenarios and often induce a considerable quality penalty compared to non-distributed partitioners. When partitioning into a large number of blocks, they even produce infeasible solution that violate the balancing constraint. dKaMinPar achieves its robustness by a scalable distributed implementation of the deep-multilevel scheme for graph partitioning. Crucially, this includes new algorithms for balancing during refinement and coarsening. ",

In this work, we present and examine ArtPlanner, the navigation planner used by team CERBERUS during the Finals. It is based on a sampling-based method that determines valid poses with a reachability abstraction and uses learned foothold scores to restrict areas considered safe for stepping. The resulting planning graph is assigned learned motion costs by a neural network trained in simulation to minimize traversal time and limit the risk of failure. Our method achieves real-time performance with a bounded computation time. We present extensive experimental results gathered during the Finals event of the DARPA Subterranean Challenge, where this method contributed to team CERBERUS winning the competition.

    "abstract": "We focus on robot navigation in crowded environments. To navigate safely and efficiently within crowds, robots need models for crowd motion prediction. Building such models is hard due to the high dimensionality of multiagent domains and the challenge of collecting or simulating interaction-rich crowd-robot demonstrations. While there has been important progress on models for offline pedestrian motion forecasting, transferring their performance on real robots is nontrivial due to close interaction settings and novelty effects on users. In this paper, we investigate the utility of a recent state-of-the-art motion prediction model (S-GAN) for crowd navigation tasks. We incorporate this model into a model predictive controller (MPC) and deploy it on a self-balancing robot which we subject to a diverse range of crowd behaviors in the lab. We demonstrate that while S-GAN motion prediction accuracy transfers to the real world, its value is not reflected on navigation performance, measured with respect to safety and efficiency; in fact, the MPC performs indistinguishably even when using a simple constant-velocity prediction model, suggesting that substantial model improvements might be needed to yield significant gains for crowd navigation tasks.

    "abstract": "Software clones are often introduced when developers reuse code fragments to implement similar functionalities in the same or different software systems. Many high-performing clone detection tools today are based on deep learning techniques and are mostly used for detecting clones written in the same programming language, whereas clone detection tools for detecting cross-language clones are also emerging rapidly. The popularity of deep learning-based clone detection tools creates an opportunity to investigate how known strategies that boost the performances of deep learning models could be further leveraged to improve clone detection tools. In this paper, we investigate such a strategy, data augmentation, which has not yet been explored for cross-language clone detection as opposed to single-language clone detection. We show how the existing knowledge on transcompilers (source-to-source translators) can be used for data augmentation to boost the performance of cross-language clone detection models, as well as to adapt single-language clone detection models to create cross-language clone detection pipelines. To demonstrate the performance boost for cross-language clone detection through data augmentation, we exploit Transcoder, which is a pre-trained source-to-source translator. To show how to extend single-language models for cross-language clone detection, we extend a popular single-language model, Graph Matching Network (GMN) in a combination with the transcompilers. We evaluated our models on popular benchmark datasets. Our experimental results showed improvements in F1 scores (sometimes up to 3%) for the cutting-edge cross-language clone detection models. Even when extending GMN for cross-language clone detection, the models built leveraging data augmentation outperformed the baseline with scores of 0.90, 0.92, and 0.91 for precision, recall, and F1 score, respectively.

Our results hold even in cases where the network has many more parameters than training examples. Despite the potential for harmful overfitting in such overparameterized settings, we prove that the implicit bias of gradient flow prevents it.

Then we are able to find a first-order formula {\\phi}' that has the same property, but additionally is finitary: there is finite bound k such that in every graph G in C, different choices of parameters give only at most k different relations R that can be defined using {\\phi}'. We use the Finitary Substitute Lemma to derive two corollaries about the existence of certain canonical decompositions in classes of well-structured graphs. - We prove that in the Splitter game, which characterizes nowhere dense graph classes, and in the Flipper game, which characterizes monadically stable graph classes, there is a winning strategy for Splitter, respectively Flipper, that can be defined in first-order logic from the game history.

    "abstract": "Plasticity, the ability of a neural network to quickly change its predictions in response to new information, is essential for the adaptability and robustness of deep reinforcement learning systems. Deep neural networks are known to lose plasticity over the course of training even in relatively simple learning problems, but the mechanisms driving this phenomenon are still poorly understood. This paper conducts a systematic empirical analysis into plasticity loss, with the goal of understanding the phenomenon mechanistically in order to guide the future development of targeted solutions. We find that loss of plasticity is deeply connected to changes in the curvature of the loss landscape, but that it typically occurs in the absence of saturated units or divergent gradient norms. Based on this insight, we identify a number of parameterization and optimization design choices which enable networks to better preserve plasticity over the course of training. We validate the utility of these findings in larger-scale learning problems by applying the best-performing intervention, layer normalization, to a deep RL agent trained on the Arcade Learning Environment.

    "abstract": "One-to-one matching is a crucial design in DETR-like object detection frameworks. It enables the DETR to perform end-to-end detection. However, it also faces challenges of lacking positive sample supervision and slow convergence speed. Several recent works proposed the one-to-many matching mechanism to accelerate training and boost detection performance. We revisit these methods and model them in a unified format of augmenting the object queries. In this paper, we propose two methods that realize one-to-many matching from a different perspective of augmenting images or image features. The first method is One-to-many Matching via Data Augmentation (denoted as DataAug-DETR). It spatially transforms the images and includes multiple augmented versions of each image in the same training batch. Such a simple augmentation strategy already achieves one-to-many matching and surprisingly improves DETR's performance. The second method is One-to-many matching via Feature Augmentation (denoted as FeatAug-DETR). Unlike DataAug-DETR, it augments the image features instead of the original images and includes multiple augmented features in the same batch to realize one-to-many matching. FeatAug-DETR significantly accelerates DETR training and boosts detection performance while keeping the inference speed unchanged. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach on DETR variants, including DAB-DETR, Deformable-DETR, and H-Deformable-DETR. Without extra training data, FeatAug-DETR shortens the training convergence periods of Deformable-DETR to 24 epochs and achieves 58.3 AP on COCO val2017 set with Swin-L as the backbone. ",

However, due to the complicated wireless propagation environment and large-scale antenna arrays, precise channel estimation for massive MIMO systems is significantly challenging and costs an enormous training overhead. Considerable time-frequency resources are consumed to acquire sufficient accuracy of CSI, which thus severely degrades systems' spectral and energy efficiencies. In this paper, we propose a dual-attention-based channel estimation network (DACEN) to realize accurate channel estimation via low-density pilots, by decoupling the spatial-temporal domain features of massive MIMO channels with the temporal attention module and the spatial attention module. To further improve the estimation accuracy, we propose a parameter-instance transfer learning approach based on the DACEN to transfer the channel knowledge learned from the high-density pilots pre-acquired during the training dataset collection period. Experimental results on a publicly available dataset reveal that the proposed DACEN-based method with low-density pilots ($\\rho_L=6/52$) achieves better channel estimation performance than the existing methods even with higher-density pilots ($\\rho_H=26/52$). Additionally, with the proposed transfer learning approach, the DACEN-based method with ultra-low-density pilots ($\\rho_L^\\prime=2/52$) achieves higher estimation accuracy than the existing methods with low-density pilots, thereby demonstrating the effectiveness and the superiority of the proposed method.

    "abstract": "For the one billion sufferers of respiratory disease, managing their disease with inhalers crucially influences their quality of life. Generic treatment plans could be improved with the aid of computational models that account for patient-specific features such as breathing pattern, lung pathology and morphology. Therefore, we aim to develop and validate an automated computational framework for patient-specific deposition modelling. To that end, an image processing approach is proposed that could produce 3D patient respiratory geometries from 2D chest X-rays and 3D CT images. We evaluated the airway and lung morphology produced by our image processing framework, and assessed deposition compared to in vivo data. The 2D-to-3D image processing reproduces airway diameter to 9% median error compared to ground truth segmentations, but is sensitive to outliers of up to 33% due to lung outline noise. Predicted regional deposition gave 5% median error compared to in vivo measurements. The proposed framework is capable of providing patient-specific deposition measurements for varying treatments, to determine which treatment would best satisfy the needs imposed by each patient (such as disease and lung/airway morphology). Integration of patient-specific modelling into clinical practice as an additional decision-making tool could optimise treatment plans and lower the burden of respiratory diseases. ",

    "abstract": "Abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) are progressive dilatations of the abdominal aorta that, if left untreated, can rupture with lethal consequences. Imaging-based patient monitoring is required to select patients eligible for surgical repair. In this work, we present a model based on implicit neural representations (INRs) to model AAA progression. We represent the AAA wall over time as the zero-level set of a signed distance function (SDF), estimated by a multilayer perception that operates on space and time. We optimize this INR using automatically extracted segmentation masks in longitudinal CT data. This network is conditioned on spatiotemporal coordinates and represents the AAA surface at any desired resolution at any moment in time. Using regularization on spatial and temporal gradients of the SDF, we ensure proper interpolation of the AAA shape. We demonstrate the network's ability to produce AAA interpolations with average surface distances ranging between 0.72 and 2.52 mm from images acquired at highly irregular intervals. The results indicate that our model can accurately interpolate AAA shapes over time, with potential clinical value for a more personalised assessment of AAA progression. ",

    "title": "A Notion of Feature Importance by Decorrelation and Detection of Trends  by Random Forest Regression",
    "abstract": "In many studies, we want to determine the influence of certain features on a dependent variable. More specifically, we are interested in the strength of the influence -- i.e., is the feature relevant? -- and, if so, how the feature influences the dependent variable. Recently, data-driven approaches such as \\emph{random forest regression} have found their way into applications (Boulesteix et al., 2012). These models allow to directly derive measures of feature importance, which are a natural indicator of the strength of the influence. For the relevant features, the correlation or rank correlation between the feature and the dependent variable has typically been used to determine the nature of the influence. More recent methods, some of which can also measure interactions between features, are based on a modeling approach. In particular, when machine learning models are used, SHAP scores are a recent and prominent method to determine these trends (Lundberg et al., 2017). In this paper, we introduce a novel notion of feature importance based on the well-studied Gram-Schmidt decorrelation method. Furthermore, we propose two estimators for identifying trends in the data using random forest regression, the so-called absolute and relative transversal rate. We empirically compare the properties of our estimators with those of well-established estimators on a variety of synthetic and real-world datasets. ",

    "abstract": "Despite evidence for the existence of engrams as memory support structures in our brains, there is no consensus framework in neuroscience as to what their physical implementation might be. Here we propose how we might design a computer system to implement engrams using neural networks, with the main aim of exploring new ideas using machine learning techniques, guided by challenges in neuroscience. Building on autoencoders, we propose latent neural spaces as indexes for storing and retrieving information in a compressed format. We consider this technique as a first step towards predictive learning: autoencoders are designed to compare reconstructed information with the original information received, providing a kind of predictive ability, which is an attractive evolutionary argument. We then consider how different states in latent neural spaces corresponding to different types of sensory input could be linked by synchronous activation, providing the basis for a sparse implementation of memory using concept neurons. Finally, we list some of the challenges and questions that link neuroscience and data science and that could have implications for both fields, and conclude that a more interdisciplinary approach is needed, as many scientists have already suggested.

    "abstract": "Precise ischemic lesion segmentation plays an essential role in improving diagnosis and treatment planning for ischemic stroke, one of the prevalent diseases with the highest mortality rate. While numerous deep neural network approaches have recently been proposed to tackle this problem, these methods require large amounts of annotated regions during training, which can be impractical in the medical domain where annotated data is scarce. As a remedy, we present a prototypical few-shot segmentation approach for ischemic lesion segmentation using only one annotated sample during training. The proposed approach leverages a novel self-supervised training mechanism that is tailored to the task of ischemic stroke lesion segmentation by exploiting color-coded parametric maps generated from Computed Tomography Perfusion scans. We illustrate the benefits of our proposed training mechanism, leading to considerable improvements in performance in the few-shot setting. Given a single annotated patient, an average Dice score of 0.58 is achieved for the segmentation of ischemic lesions. ",

    "abstract": "Resting-state EEG (rs-EEG) has been demonstrated to aid in Parkinson's disease (PD) diagnosis. In particular, the power spectral density (PSD) of low-frequency bands ({\\delta} and {\\theta}) and high-frequency bands ({\\alpha} and \\b{eta}) has been shown to be significantly different in patients with PD as compared to subjects without PD (non-PD). However, rs-EEG feature extraction and the interpretation thereof can be time-intensive and prone to examiner variability. Machine learning (ML) has the potential to automatize the analysis of rs-EEG recordings and provides a supportive tool for clinicians to ease their workload. In this work, we use rs-EEG recordings of 84 PD and 85 non-PD subjects pooled from four datasets obtained at different centers. We propose an end-to-end pipeline consisting of preprocessing, extraction of PSD features from clinically validated frequency bands, and feature selection before evaluating the classification ability of the features via ML algorithms to stratify between PD and non-PD subjects. Further, we evaluate the effect of feature harmonization, given the multi-center nature of the datasets. Our validation results show, on average, an improvement in PD detection ability (69.6% vs. 75.5% accuracy) by logistic regression when harmonizing the features and performing univariate feature selection (k = 202 features). Our final results show an average global accuracy of 72.2% with balanced accuracy results for all the centers included in the study: 60.6%, 68.7%, 77.7%, and 82.2%, respectively. ",
