    "title": "Backdoor for Debias: Mitigating Model Bias with Backdoor Attack-based  Artificial Bias",
    "abstract": "With the swift advancement of deep learning, state-of-the-art algorithms have been utilized in various social situations. Nonetheless, some algorithms have been discovered to exhibit biases and provide unequal results. The current debiasing methods face challenges such as poor utilization of data or intricate training requirements. In this work, we found that the backdoor attack can construct an artificial bias similar to the model bias derived in standard training. Considering the strong adjustability of backdoor triggers, we are motivated to mitigate the model bias by carefully designing reverse artificial bias created from backdoor attack. Based on this, we propose a backdoor debiasing framework based on knowledge distillation, which effectively reduces the model bias from original data and minimizes security risks from the backdoor attack. The proposed solution is validated on both image and structured datasets, showing promising results. This work advances the understanding of backdoor attacks and highlights its potential for beneficial applications.

    "title": "Defending against Adversarial Audio via Diffusion Model",
    "abstract": "Deep learning models have been widely used in commercial acoustic systems in recent years. However, adversarial audio examples can cause abnormal behaviors for those acoustic systems, while being hard for humans to perceive. Various methods, such as transformation-based defenses and adversarial training, have been proposed to protect acoustic systems from adversarial attacks, but they are less effective against adaptive attacks. Furthermore, directly applying the methods from the image domain can lead to suboptimal results because of the unique properties of audio data. In this paper, we propose an adversarial purification-based defense pipeline, AudioPure, for acoustic systems via off-the-shelf diffusion models. Taking advantage of the strong generation ability of diffusion models, AudioPure first adds a small amount of noise to the adversarial audio and then runs the reverse sampling step to purify the noisy audio and recover clean audio. AudioPure is a plug-and-play method that can be directly applied to any pretrained classifier without any fine-tuning or re-training. We conduct extensive experiments on speech command recognition task to evaluate the robustness of AudioPure. Our method is effective against diverse adversarial attacks (e.g. $\\mathcal{L}_2$ or $\\mathcal{L}_\\infty$-norm). It outperforms the existing methods under both strong adaptive white-box and black-box attacks bounded by $\\mathcal{L}_2$ or $\\mathcal{L}_\\infty$-norm (up to +20\\% in robust accuracy). Besides, we also evaluate the certified robustness for perturbations bounded by $\\mathcal{L}_2$-norm via randomized smoothing. Our pipeline achieves a higher certified accuracy than baselines. ",

    "title": "Feature Perturbation Augmentation for Reliable Evaluation of Importance  Estimators",
    "abstract": "Post-hoc explanation methods attempt to make the inner workings of deep neural networks more interpretable. However, since a ground truth is in general lacking, local post-hoc interpretability methods, which assign importance scores to input features, are challenging to evaluate. One of the most popular evaluation frameworks is to perturb features deemed important by an interpretability method and to measure the change in prediction accuracy. Intuitively, a large decrease in prediction accuracy would indicate that the explanation has correctly quantified the importance of features with respect to the prediction outcome (e.g., logits). However, the change in the prediction outcome may stem from perturbation artifacts, since perturbed samples in the test dataset are out of distribution (OOD) compared to the training dataset and can therefore potentially disturb the model in an unexpected manner. To overcome this challenge, we propose feature perturbation augmentation (FPA) which creates and adds perturbed images during the model training. Through extensive computational experiments, we demonstrate that FPA makes deep neural networks (DNNs) more robust against perturbations. Furthermore, training DNNs with FPA demonstrate that the sign of importance scores may explain the model more meaningfully than has previously been assumed. Overall, FPA is an intuitive data augmentation technique that improves the evaluation of post-hoc interpretability methods. ",

To the best of our knowledge, our proposed approach is the first attempt to investigate gain competition attacks as a security threat in optical NoCs. We model the attack and analyze its effects on optical NoC performance. We also propose potential attack detection techniques and countermeasures to mitigate the attack.

Group-equivariant convolutions are a popular approach to obtain equivariant representations. The desired corresponding invariance is then imposed using pooling operations. For rotations, it has been shown that using invariant integration instead of pooling further improves the sample complexity. In this contribution, we first expand invariant integration beyond rotations to flips and scale transformations. We then address the problem of incorporating multiple desired invariances into a single network. For this purpose, we propose a multi-stream architecture, where each stream is invariant to a different transformation such that the network can simultaneously benefit from multiple invariances. We demonstrate our approach with successful experiments on Scaled-MNIST, SVHN, CIFAR-10 and STL-10. ",

    "abstract": "As the size of real-world graphs increases, training Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) has become time-consuming and requires acceleration. While previous works have demonstrated the potential of utilizing FPGA for accelerating GNN training, few works have been carried out to accelerate GNN training with multiple FPGAs due to the necessity of hardware expertise and substantial development effort. To this end, we propose HitGNN, a framework that enables users to effortlessly map GNN training workloads onto a CPU-Multi-FPGA platform for acceleration. In particular, HitGNN takes the user-defined synchronous GNN training algorithm, GNN model, and platform metadata as input, determines the design parameters based on the platform metadata, and performs hardware mapping onto the CPU+Multi-FPGA platform, automatically. HitGNN consists of the following building blocks: (1) high-level application programming interfaces (APIs) that allow users to specify various synchronous GNN training algorithms and GNN models with only a handful of lines of code; (2) a software generator that generates a host program that performs mini-batch sampling, manages CPU-FPGA communication, and handles workload balancing among the FPGAs; (3) an accelerator generator that generates GNN kernels with optimized datapath and memory organization. We show that existing synchronous GNN training algorithms such as DistDGL and PaGraph can be easily deployed on a CPU+Multi-FPGA platform using our framework, while achieving high training throughput. Compared with the state-of-the-art frameworks that accelerate synchronous GNN training on a multi-GPU platform, HitGNN achieves up to 27.21x bandwidth efficiency, and up to 4.26x speedup using much less compute power and memory bandwidth than GPUs. In addition, HitGNN demonstrates good scalability to 16 FPGAs on a CPU+Multi-FPGA platform. ",

    "abstract": "We present DejaVu, a novel framework which leverages conditional image regeneration as additional supervision during training to improve deep networks for dense prediction tasks such as segmentation, depth estimation, and surface normal prediction. First, we apply redaction to the input image, which removes certain structural information by sparse sampling or selective frequency removal. Next, we use a conditional regenerator, which takes the redacted image and the dense predictions as inputs, and reconstructs the original image by filling in the missing structural information. In the redacted image, structural attributes like boundaries are broken while semantic context is largely preserved. In order to make the regeneration feasible, the conditional generator will then require the structure information from the other input source, i.e., the dense predictions. As such, by including this conditional regeneration objective during training, DejaVu encourages the base network to learn to embed accurate scene structure in its dense prediction. This leads to more accurate predictions with clearer boundaries and better spatial consistency. When it is feasible to leverage additional computation, DejaVu can be extended to incorporate an attention-based regeneration module within the dense prediction network, which further improves accuracy. Through extensive experiments on multiple dense prediction benchmarks such as Cityscapes, COCO, ADE20K, NYUD-v2, and KITTI, we demonstrate the efficacy of employing DejaVu during training, as it outperforms SOTA methods at no added computation cost.

However, a deployed ML model may suffer from out-of-distribution (OOD) issues due to distribution shifts in the real-world data. Though many algorithms have been proposed to detect OOD data from text corpora, there is still a lack of interactive tool support for ML developers. In this work, we propose DeepLens, an interactive system that helps users detect and explore OOD issues in massive text corpora. Users can efficiently explore different OOD types in DeepLens with the help of a text clustering method. Users can also dig into a specific text by inspecting salient words highlighted through neuron activation analysis. In a within-subjects user study with 24 participants, participants using DeepLens were able to find nearly twice more types of OOD issues accurately with 22% more confidence compared with a variant of DeepLens that has no interaction or visualization support.

However, the effect of each pretext task is not well studied or compared in the literature. In this paper, we study the contribution of augmentation operators on the performance of self supervised learning algorithms in a constrained settings. We propose an evolutionary search method for optimization of data augmentation pipeline in pretext tasks and measure the impact of augmentation operators in several SOTA SSL algorithms. By encoding different combination of augmentation operators in chromosomes we seek the optimal augmentation policies through an evolutionary optimization mechanism. We further introduce methods for analyzing and explaining the performance of optimized SSL algorithms. Our results indicate that our proposed method can find solutions that outperform the accuracy of classification of SSL algorithms which confirms the influence of augmentation policy choice on the overall performance of SSL algorithms.

Specifically, we consider the challenge of forming balanced clusters in the graph of a sparse matrix for use in algebraic multigrid, although the algorithm has general applicability. Based on an extension of the Bellman-Ford algorithm, we generalize Lloyd's algorithm for partitioning subsets of Rn to balance the number of nodes in each cluster; this is accompanied by a rebalancing algorithm that reduces the overall energy in the system. The algorithm provides control over the number of clusters and leads to \"well centered\" partitions of the graph. Theoretical results are provided to establish linear complexity and numerical results in the context of algebraic multigrid highlight the benefits of improved clustering. ",

    "abstract": "Self-supervised learning (SSL) strategies have demonstrated remarkable performance in various recognition tasks. However, both our preliminary investigation and recent studies suggest that they may be less effective in learning representations for fine-grained visual recognition (FGVR) since many features helpful for optimizing SSL objectives are not suitable for characterizing the subtle differences in FGVR. To overcome this issue, we propose learning an additional screening mechanism to identify discriminative clues commonly seen across instances and classes, dubbed as common rationales in this paper. Intuitively, common rationales tend to correspond to the discriminative patterns from the key parts of foreground objects. We show that a common rationale detector can be learned by simply exploiting the GradCAM induced from the SSL objective without using any pre-trained object parts or saliency detectors, making it seamlessly to be integrated with the existing SSL process. Specifically, we fit the GradCAM with a branch with limited fitting capacity, which allows the branch to capture the common rationales and discard the less common discriminative patterns. At the test stage, the branch generates a set of spatial weights to selectively aggregate features representing an instance. Extensive experimental results on four visual tasks demonstrate that the proposed method can lead to a significant improvement in different evaluation settings. ",

    "abstract": "Pipeline parallelism has been demonstrated to be a remarkable approach to improve throughput for training deep neural networks with billions of parameters over heterogeneous clusters. The 1F1B scheduling plan is a widely adopted strategy for memory and performance optimization, which interchanges the forward and backward stage computations of different micro-batches. On the other hand, a common issue in using the 1F1B scheduling is that stage computation is delayed due to the data transfer when network resources are preempted by other tasks, even with the minimum communication between stages. The exclusive access of these network resources cannot be guaranteed in cloud offerings. We present a general scheduling technique to accommodate pipeline parallelism to preempted network environments at the expense of a certain amount of memory pressure. The core concept is to extend 1F1B schedule scheme to kFkB, which groups k micro-batches, and alternately executes k forward and backward computations. We propose Ada-Grouper, an adaptive kFkB scheduler which regularly adjusts the number of group members k to maintain an optimal balance between communication and computation efficiency correspond to changes in a changing network environment under the memory limit. Experimental results demonstrate that our design maintain stable performance for pipeline parallelism, yielding a performance increase of up from 4% to 30%, compared with 1F1B in preempted network scenarios.

    "abstract": "Deep learning (DL) has proven to be effective in detecting sophisticated malware that is constantly evolving. Even though deep learning has alleviated the feature engineering problem, finding the most optimal DL model, in terms of neural architecture search (NAS) and the model's optimal set of hyper-parameters, remains a challenge that requires domain expertise. In addition, many of the proposed state-of-the-art models are very complex and may not be the best fit for different datasets. A promising approach, known as Automated Machine Learning (AutoML), can reduce the domain expertise required to implement a custom DL model. AutoML reduces the amount of human trial-and-error involved in designing DL models, and in more recent implementations can find new model architectures with relatively low computational overhead. This work provides a comprehensive analysis and insights on using AutoML for static and online malware detection. For static, our analysis is performed on two widely used malware datasets: SOREL-20M to demonstrate efficacy on large datasets; and EMBER-2018, a smaller dataset specifically curated to hinder the performance of machine learning models. In addition, we show the effects of tuning the NAS process parameters on finding a more optimal malware detection model on these static analysis datasets. Further, we also demonstrate that AutoML is performant in online malware detection scenarios using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for cloud IaaS. We compare an AutoML technique to six existing state-of-the-art CNNs using a newly generated online malware dataset with and without other applications running in the background during malware execution.In general, our experimental results show that the performance of AutoML based static and online malware detection models are on par or even better than state-of-the-art models or hand-designed models presented in literature.

In this work, we explore leveraging the implicit neural representation (INR) and propose a novel image Harmonization method based on Implicit neural Networks (HINet), which to the best of our knowledge, is the first dense pixel-to-pixel method applicable to HR images without any hand-crafted filter design. Inspired by the Retinex theory, we decouple the MLPs into two parts to respectively capture the content and environment of composite images. A Low-Resolution Image Prior (LRIP) network is designed to alleviate the Boundary Inconsistency problem, and we also propose new designs for the training and inference process.

Therefore, we propose a novel black-box optimization algorithm where the black-box function is modeled using a neural network. Our algorithm does not need a Bayesian neural network to estimate predictive uncertainty and is therefore computationally favorable.

    "abstract": "Multi-view 3D object detection (MV3D-Det) in Bird-Eye-View (BEV) has drawn extensive attention due to its low cost and high efficiency. Although new algorithms for camera-only 3D object detection have been continuously proposed, most of them may risk drastic performance degradation when the domain of input images differs from that of training. In this paper, we first analyze the causes of the domain gap for the MV3D-Det task. Based on the covariate shift assumption, we find that the gap mainly attributes to the feature distribution of BEV, which is determined by the quality of both depth estimation and 2D image's feature representation. To acquire a robust depth prediction, we propose to decouple the depth estimation from the intrinsic parameters of the camera (i.e. the focal length) through converting the prediction of metric depth to that of scale-invariant depth and perform dynamic perspective augmentation to increase the diversity of the extrinsic parameters (i.e. the camera poses) by utilizing homography. Moreover, we modify the focal length values to create multiple pseudo-domains and construct an adversarial training loss to encourage the feature representation to be more domain-agnostic. Without bells and whistles, our approach, namely DG-BEV, successfully alleviates the performance drop on the unseen target domain without impairing the accuracy of the source domain. Extensive experiments on various public datasets, including Waymo, nuScenes, and Lyft, demonstrate the generalization and effectiveness of our approach. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first systematic study to explore a domain generalization method for MV3D-Det. ",

We evaluate our approaches using well-known multi-objective evolutionary algorithms GSEMO and NSGA-II.

The algorithm is given feedback on the outcomes of each day, including the cost of its prediction and the cost of the expert predictions, and the goal is to make a prediction with the minimum cost, specifically compared to the best expert in the set. Recent work by Srinivas, Woodruff, Xu, and Zhou (STOC 2022) introduced the study of the online learning with experts problem under memory constraints. However, often the predictions made by experts or algorithms at some time influence future outcomes, so that the input is adaptively chosen. Whereas deterministic algorithms would be robust to adaptive inputs, existing algorithms all crucially use randomization to sample a small number of experts. In this paper, we study deterministic and robust algorithms for the experts problem. We first show a space lower bound of $\\widetilde{\\Omega}\\left(\\frac{nM}{RT}\\right)$ for any deterministic algorithm that achieves regret $R$ when the best expert makes $M$ mistakes. Our result shows that the natural deterministic algorithm, which iterates through pools of experts until each expert in the pool has erred, is optimal up to polylogarithmic factors. On the positive side, we give a randomized algorithm that is robust to adaptive inputs that uses $\\widetilde{O}\\left(\\frac{n}{R\\sqrt{T}}\\right)$ space for $M=O\\left(\\frac{R^2 T}{\\log^2 n}\\right)$, thereby showing a smooth space-regret trade-off.

In this paper, we explore and analyze two notions of local hyperbolicity, describing the underlying local geometry: geometric (Gromov) and model-based, to determine the preferred space of embedding for each node. The two hyperbolicities' distributions are aligned using the Wasserstein metric such that the calculated geometric hyperbolicity guides the choice of the learned model hyperbolicity. As such our model Joint Space Graph Neural Network (JSGNN) can leverage both Euclidean and hyperbolic spaces during learning by allowing node-specific geometry space selection. We evaluate our model on both node classification and link prediction tasks and observe promising performance compared to baseline models. ",

We prove that if $e$ is the number of edges of the CDAWG for string $T$, then the number of new edges added to the CDAWG after an left-edit operation on $T$ is less than $e$.

However, these approaches are computationally intensive and do not always converge to natural looking patterns. In this paper, we propose a novel lightweight framework that systematically generates naturalistic adversarial patches without using GANs. To illustrate the proposed approach, we generate adversarial art (AdvART), which are patches generated to look like artistic paintings while maintaining high attack efficiency. In fact, we redefine the optimization problem by introducing a new similarity objective. Specifically, we leverage similarity metrics to construct a similarity loss that is added to the optimized objective function.

Volumetric approaches provide a solution for modeling occlusions through the explicit 3D representation of the camera frustum. Multi-plane Images (MPI) are volumetric methods that represent the scene using front-parallel planes at distinct depths but suffer from depth discretization leading to a 2.D scene representation. Another line of approach relies on implicit 3D scene representations. Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) utilize neural networks for encapsulating the continuous 3D scene structure within the network weights achieving photorealistic synthesis results, however, methods are constrained to per-scene optimization settings which are inefficient in practice. Multi-plane Neural Radiance Fields (MINE) open the door for combining implicit and explicit scene representations. It enables continuous 3D scene representations, especially in the depth dimension, while utilizing the input image features to avoid per-scene optimization. The main drawback of the current literature work in this domain is being constrained to single-view input, limiting the synthesis ability to narrow viewpoint ranges. In this work, we thoroughly examine the performance, generalization, and efficiency of single-view multi-plane neural radiance fields. In addition, we propose a new multiplane NeRF architecture that accepts multiple views to improve the synthesis results and expand the viewing range. Features from the input source frames are effectively fused through a proposed attention-aware fusion module to highlight important information from different viewpoints. Experiments show the effectiveness of attention-based fusion and the promising outcomes of our proposed method when compared to multi-view NeRF and MPI techniques. ",

    "abstract": "Deepfake techniques have been used maliciously, resulting in strong research interests in developing Deepfake detection methods. Deepfake often manipulates the video content by tampering with some facial parts. However, this manipulation usually breaks the consistency among facial parts, e.g., Deepfake may change smiling lips to upset, but the eyes are still smiling. Existing works propose to spot inconsistency on some specific facial parts (e.g., lips), but they may perform poorly if new Deepfake techniques focus on the specific facial parts used by the detector. Thus, this paper proposes a new Deepfake detection model, DeepfakeMAE, which can utilize the consistencies among all facial parts. Specifically, given a real face image, we first pretrain a masked autoencoder to learn facial part consistency by randomly masking some facial parts and reconstructing missing areas based on the remaining facial parts. Furthermore, to maximize the discrepancy between real and fake videos, we propose a novel model with dual networks that utilize the pretrained encoder and decoder, respectively. 1) The pretrained encoder is finetuned for capturing the overall information of the given video. 2) The pretrained decoder is utilized for distinguishing real and fake videos based on the motivation that DeepfakeMAE's reconstruction should be more similar to a real face image than a fake one. Our extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that DeepfakeMAE is highly effective and especially outperforms the previous state-of-the-art method by 3.1% AUC on average in cross-dataset detection.

A set $D \\subseteq V$ called a total dominating set of $G$ if every vertex $v\\in V$ is totally dominated by some vertex in $D$. The minimum cardinality of a total dominating set is the total domination number of $G$ and is denoted by $\\gamma_t(G)$. A total dominator coloring of graph $G$ is a proper coloring of vertices of $G$, so that each vertex totally dominates some color class. The total dominator chromatic number $\\chi_{td}(G)$ of $G$ is the least number of colors required for a total dominator coloring of $G$. The Total Dominator Coloring problem is to find a total dominator coloring of $G$ using the minimum number of colors.

We further study the Total Dominator Coloring problem for various graph classes, including trees, cographs and chain graphs. First, we characterize the trees having $\\chi_{td}(T)=\\gamma_t(T)+1$, which completes the characterization of trees achieving all possible values of $\\chi_{td}(T)$. Also, we show that for a cograph $G$, $\\chi_{td}(G)$ can be computed in linear-time. Moreover, we show that $2 \\le \\chi_{td}(G) \\le 4$ for a chain graph $G$ and give characterization of chain graphs for every possible value of $\\chi_{td}(G)$ in linear-time. ",

    "abstract": "The availability of digital devices operated by voice is expanding rapidly. However, the applications of voice interfaces are still restricted. For example, speaking in public places becomes an annoyance to the surrounding people, and secret information should not be uttered. Environmental noise may reduce the accuracy of speech recognition. To address these limitations, a system to detect a user's unvoiced utterance is proposed. From internal information observed by an ultrasonic imaging sensor attached to the underside of the jaw, our proposed system recognizes the utterance contents without the user's uttering voice. Our proposed deep neural network model is used to obtain acoustic features from a sequence of ultrasound images. We confirmed that audio signals generated by our system can control the existing smart speakers. We also observed that a user can adjust their oral movement to learn and improve the accuracy of their voice recognition. ",

    "abstract": "Predicting natural and diverse 3D hand gestures from the upper body dynamics is a practical yet challenging task in virtual avatar creation. Previous works usually overlook the asymmetric motions between two hands and generate two hands in a holistic manner, leading to unnatural results. In this work, we introduce a novel bilateral hand disentanglement based two-stage 3D hand generation method to achieve natural and diverse 3D hand prediction from body dynamics. In the first stage, we intend to generate natural hand gestures by two hand-disentanglement branches. Considering the asymmetric gestures and motions of two hands, we introduce a Spatial-Residual Memory (SRM) module to model spatial interaction between the body and each hand by residual learning. To enhance the coordination of two hand motions wrt. body dynamics holistically, we then present a Temporal-Motion Memory (TMM) module. TMM can effectively model the temporal association between body dynamics and two hand motions. The second stage is built upon the insight that 3D hand predictions should be non-deterministic given the sequential body postures. Thus, we further diversify our 3D hand predictions based on the initial output from the stage one. Concretely, we propose a Prototypical-Memory Sampling Strategy (PSS) to generate the non-deterministic hand gestures by gradient-based Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art models on the B2H dataset and our newly collected TED Hands dataset. ",

We heuristically analyze how ISGD overcome stiffness in the gradient flow dynamics of PINNs, especially for problems with multi-scale solutions. We theoretically prove that for two-layer fully connected neural networks with large hidden nodes, randomly initialized ISGD converges to a globally optimal solution for the quadratic loss function. Empirical results demonstrate that ISGD works well in practice and compares favorably to other gradient-based optimization methods such as SGD and Adam, while can also effectively address the numerical stiffness in training dynamics via gradient descent.

Although significant advances have been made to overcome the challenges in the academic area, such as missing counterfactual outcomes and selection bias, they only focus on source-specific and stationary observational data, which is unrealistic in most industrial applications. In this paper, we investigate a new industrial problem of causal effect estimation from incrementally available observational data and present three new evaluation criteria accordingly, including extensibility, adaptability, and accessibility. We propose a Continual Causal Effect Representation Learning method for estimating causal effects with observational data, which are incrementally available from non-stationary data distributions. Instead of having access to all seen observational data, our method only stores a limited subset of feature representations learned from previous data. Combining selective and balanced representation learning, feature representation distillation, and feature transformation, our method achieves the continual causal effect estimation for new data without compromising the estimation capability for original data. Extensive experiments demonstrate the significance of continual causal effect estimation and the effectiveness of our method. ",

In this paper, we investigate new ways to learn such coordinated behaviors of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) aimed at keeping track of multiple evasive targets. Within a Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) framework, we specifically propose a variant of the Multi-Agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (MADDPG) method. Our approach addresses multi-target pursuit-evasion scenarios within non-stationary and unknown environments with random obstacles. In addition, given the critical role played by collective exploration in terms of detecting possible targets, we implement heterogeneous roles for the pursuers for enhanced exploratory actions balanced by exploitation (i.e. tracking) of previously identified targets. Our proposed role-based MADDPG algorithm is not only able to track multiple targets, but also is able to explore for possible targets by means of the proposed Voronoi-based rewarding policy. We implemented, tested and validated our approach in a simulation environment prior to deploying a real-world multi-robot system comprising of Crazyflie drones. Our results demonstrate that a multi-agent pursuit team has the ability to learn highly efficient coordinated control policies in terms of target tracking and exploration even when confronted with multiple fast evasive targets in complex environments.

We for the first time observe that existing bounding box regression methods tend to produce distorted gradients for small objects and result in less accurate localization. To address this issue, we present a novel Confidence-driven Bounding Box Localization (C-BBL) method to rectify the gradients. C-BBL quantizes continuous labels into grids and formulates two-hot ground truth labels. In prediction, the bounding box head generates a confidence distribution over the grids. Unlike the bounding box regression paradigms in conventional detectors, we introduce a classification-based localization objective through cross entropy between ground truth and predicted confidence distribution, generating confidence-driven gradients. Additionally, C-BBL describes a uncertainty loss based on distribution entropy in labels and predictions to further reduce the uncertainty in small object localization. The method is evaluated on multiple detectors using three object detection benchmarks and consistently improves baseline detectors, achieving state-of-the-art performance. We also demonstrate the generalizability of C-BBL to different label systems and effectiveness for high resolution detection, which validates its prospect as a general solution. ",

We believe our scoring method can help researchers select more appropriate point clouds for subsequent completion and reconstruction and avoid manual parameter adjustment. Moreover, our evaluation model is fast and straightforward and can be directly inserted into any model's training or use process to facilitate the automatic selection and post-processing of point clouds. We propose a complete dataset construction and model evaluation method based on ShapeNet. We verify our network using detection and flow estimation tasks on KITTI, a real-world dataset for autonomous driving. The experimental results show that our model can effectively distinguish the quality of point clouds and help in practical tasks. ",

In this paper, we present a novel recycled FPGA detection method by examining the symmetry information of the RO frequency using unsupervised anomaly detection method. Due to the symmetrical array structure of the FPGA, some adjacent logic blocks on an FPGA have comparable RO frequencies, hence our method simply analyzes the RO frequencies of those blocks to determine how similar they are. The proposed approach efficiently categorizes recycled FPGAs by utilizing direct density ratio estimation through outliers detection. Experiments using Xilinx Artix-7 FPGAs demonstrate that the proposed method accurately classifies recycled FPGAs from 10 fresh FPGAs by x fewer computations compared with the conventional method. ",

However, unlike in OSNs, the privacy concerns and practices of SCP users have not been extensively explored nor documented in the current literature. In this work, we present the preliminary results of an online survey (N=105) addressing developers' concerns and perceptions about privacy threats steaming from SCPs. Our results suggest that, although users express concern about social and organisational privacy threats, they often feel safe sharing personal and project-related information on these platforms. Moreover, attacks targeting the inference of sensitive attributes are considered more likely than those seeking to re-identify source-code contributors. Based on these findings, we propose a set of recommendations for future investigations addressing privacy and identity management in SCPs. ",

    "abstract": "Autonomous mobile agents require low-power/energy-efficient machine learning (ML) algorithms to complete their ML-based tasks while adapting to diverse environments, as mobile agents are usually powered by batteries. These requirements can be fulfilled by Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) as they offer low power/energy processing due to their sparse computations and efficient online learning with bio-inspired learning mechanisms for adapting to different environments. Recent works studied that the energy consumption of SNNs can be optimized by reducing the computation time of each neuron for processing a sequence of spikes (timestep). However, state-of-the-art techniques rely on intensive design searches to determine fixed timestep settings for only inference, thereby hindering SNNs from achieving further energy efficiency gains in both training and inference. These techniques also restrict SNNs from performing efficient online learning at run time. Toward this, we propose TopSpark, a novel methodology that leverages adaptive timestep reduction to enable energy-efficient SNN processing in both training and inference, while keeping its accuracy close to the accuracy of SNNs without timestep reduction. The ideas of TopSpark include analyzing the impact of different timesteps on the accuracy; identifying neuron parameters that have a significant impact on accuracy in different timesteps; employing parameter enhancements that make SNNs effectively perform learning and inference using less spiking activity; and developing a strategy to trade-off accuracy, latency, and energy to meet the design requirements. The results show that, TopSpark saves the SNN latency by 3.9x as well as energy consumption by 3.5x for training and 3.3x for inference on average, across different network sizes, learning rules, and workloads, while maintaining the accuracy within 2% of SNNs without timestep reduction.

Through these controls, users gain greater authority over the collection, utilisation, and dissemination of their personal information by the services. However, these controls may be buried deep within menus or settings, making them difficult for a user to access. Additionally, the terminology used to describe privacy controls can sometimes be confusing or technical, further complicating the user's ability to understand and use them effectively. This is especially true for health websites, as users often share sensitive information about their health and well-being. While many privacy controls have been proposed to protect user data on these sites, existing research focuses on individual controls (e.g., privacy policies or cookie opt-outs) rather than providing a comprehensive overview of the privacy landscape. In addition, many studies concentrate on the technical aspects of privacy controls without considering the usability of these features from a user's perspective. This paper aims to fill the gaps in the existing work by analysing four privacy controls, namely privacy nudge, privacy notice, privacy policy, and privacy setting, and evaluating their usability on the top 100 most visited health websites. First, we define usability attributes for each privacy control in three website visit scenarios; the guest, registering, and log-in visits. These attributes include awareness, efficiency, comprehension, functionality, and choice. Then, we design a survey template based on these attributes and scenarios and collect data about privacy controls. Next, we analyse the availability and usability of each privacy control on health websites. Finally, we provide suggestions for improving the design of these privacy controls based on the data analysis results. ",

General-purpose audio embeddings (GPAEs) are dense representations of audio signals that allow lightweight, shallow classifiers to tackle various audio tasks. The idea is that a single complex feature extractor would extract dense GPAEs, while shallow MLPs can produce task-specific predictions. If the extracted dense representations are general enough to allow the simple downstream classifiers to generalize to a variety of tasks in the audio domain, a single costly forward pass suffices to solve multiple tasks in parallel.

We use efficient MobileNets trained on AudioSet using Knowledge Distillation from a Transformer ensemble as efficient GPAE extractors.

To enhance the model's generalization ability, most existing domain generalization methods learn domain invariant features by suppressing domain sensitive features. Different from them, we propose a Domain Projection and Contrastive Learning (DPCL) approach for generalized semantic segmentation, which includes two modules: Self-supervised Source Domain Projection (SSDP) and Multi-level Contrastive Learning (MLCL). SSDP aims to reduce domain gap by projecting data to the source domain, while MLCL is a learning scheme to learn discriminative and generalizable features on the projected data. During test time, we first project the target data by SSDP to mitigate domain shift, then generate the segmentation results by the learned segmentation network based on MLCL. At test time, we can update the projected data by minimizing our proposed pixel-to-pixel contrastive loss to obtain better results. Extensive experiments for semantic segmentation demonstrate the favorable generalization capability of our method on benchmark datasets. ",

Because it is costly to develop and optimize a neural network for every single environment, there is a line of research to search neural networks for multiple target environments efficiently. However, existing works for such a situation still suffer from requiring many GPUs and expensive costs. Motivated by this, we propose a novel neural network optimization framework named Bespoke for low-cost deployment. Our framework searches for a lightweight model by replacing parts of an original model with randomly selected alternatives, each of which comes from a pretrained neural network or the original model. In the practical sense, Bespoke has two significant merits. One is that it requires near zero cost for designing the search space of neural networks. The other merit is that it exploits the sub-networks of public pretrained neural networks, so the total cost is minimal compared to the existing works. We conduct experiments exploring Bespoke's the merits, and the results show that it finds efficient models for multiple targets with meager cost. ",

Existing certified defenses against adversarial point clouds suffer from a key limitation: their certified robustness guarantees are probabilistic, i.e., they produce an incorrect certified robustness guarantee with some probability. In this work, we propose a general framework, namely PointCert, that can transform an arbitrary point cloud classifier to be certifiably robust against adversarial point clouds with deterministic guarantees. PointCert certifiably predicts the same label for a point cloud when the number of arbitrarily added, deleted, and/or modified points is less than a threshold. Moreover, we propose multiple methods to optimize the certified robustness guarantees of PointCert in three application scenarios. We systematically evaluate PointCert on ModelNet and ScanObjectNN benchmark datasets. Our results show that PointCert substantially outperforms state-of-the-art certified defenses even though their robustness guarantees are probabilistic. ",

Although there has been steep progress in the supervised methods on the synthetic point cloud completion task, it is hardly applicable in real-world scenarios due to the domain gap between the synthetic and real-world datasets or the requirement of prior information. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel self-supervised framework ACL-SPC for point cloud completion to train and test on the same data. ACL-SPC takes a single partial input and attempts to output the complete point cloud using an adaptive closed-loop (ACL) system that enforces the output same for the variation of an input. We evaluate our proposed ACL-SPC on various datasets to prove that it can successfully learn to complete a partial point cloud as the first self-supervised scheme. Results show that our method is comparable with unsupervised methods and achieves superior performance on the real-world dataset compared to the supervised methods trained on the synthetic dataset.

The development of JE-SSL methods was driven primarily by the search for ever increasing downstream classification accuracies, using huge computational resources, and typically built upon insights and intuitions inherited from a close parent JE-SSL method. This has led unwittingly to numerous pre-conceived ideas that carried over across methods e.g. that SimCLR requires very large mini batches to yield competitive accuracies; that strong and computationally slow data augmentations are required. In this work, we debunk several such ill-formed a priori ideas in the hope to unleash the full potential of JE-SSL free of unnecessary limitations. In fact, when carefully evaluating performances across different downstream tasks and properly optimizing hyper-parameters of the methods, we most often -- if not always -- see that these widespread misconceptions do not hold. For example we show that it is possible to train SimCLR to learn useful representations, while using a single image patch as negative example, and simple Gaussian noise as the only data augmentation for the positive pair. Along these lines, in the hope to democratize JE-SSL and to allow researchers to easily make more extensive evaluations of their methods, we introduce an optimized PyTorch library for SSL. ",

However, due to the limitations of LiDAR sensors, object shapes suffer from deterioration in occluded and distant areas, which creates a fundamental challenge to 3D perception. Existing methods estimate specific 3D shapes and achieve remarkable performance. However, these methods rely on extensive computation and memory, causing imbalances between accuracy and real-time performance. To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel LiDAR-based 3D object detection model named BSH-Det3D, which applies an effective way to enhance spatial features by estimating complete shapes from a bird's eye view (BEV). Specifically, we design the Pillar-based Shape Completion (PSC) module to predict the probability of occupancy whether a pillar contains object shapes. The PSC module generates a BEV shape heatmap for each scene. After integrating with heatmaps, BSH-Det3D can provide additional information in shape deterioration areas and generate high-quality 3D proposals. We also design an attention-based densification fusion module (ADF) to adaptively associate the sparse features with heatmaps and raw points. The ADF module integrates the advantages of points and shapes knowledge with negligible overheads. Extensive experiments on the KITTI benchmark achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in terms of accuracy and speed, demonstrating the efficiency and flexibility of BSH-Det3D.

Unfortunately, existing privacy frameworks (e.g., differential privacy, anonymization) do not adequately address such concerns. In this paper, we propose summary statistic privacy, a framework for analyzing and protecting these summary statistic privacy concerns. We propose a class of quantization mechanisms that can be tailored to various data distributions and statistical secrets, and analyze their privacy-distortion trade-offs under our framework. We prove corresponding lower bounds on the privacy-utility tradeoff, which match the tradeoffs of the quantization mechanism under certain regimes, up to small constant factors.

The sharp increase in VC usage has been accompanied by various newly emerging privacy and security challenges. VC meetings became a target for various security attacks, such as Zoombombing. Other VC-related challenges also emerged. For example, during COVID lockdowns, educators had to teach in online environments struggling with keeping students engaged for extended periods. In parallel, the amount of available VC videos has grown exponentially. Thus, users and companies are limited in finding abnormal segments in VC meetings within the converging volumes of data. Such abnormal events that affect most meeting participants may be indicators of interesting points in time, including security attacks or other changes in meeting climate, like someone joining a meeting or sharing a dramatic content. Here, we present a novel algorithm for detecting abnormal events in VC data. We curated VC publicly available recordings, including meetings with interruptions. We analyzed the videos using our algorithm, extracting time windows where abnormal occurrences were detected. Our algorithm is a pipeline that combines multiple methods in several steps to detect users' faces in each video frame, track face locations during the meeting and generate vector representations of a facial expression for each face in each frame. Vector representations are used to monitor changes in facial expressions throughout the meeting for each participant. The overall change in meeting climate is quantified using those parameters across all participants, and translating them into event anomaly detection. This is the first open pipeline for automatically detecting anomaly events in VC meetings. Our model detects abnormal events with 92.3% precision over the collected dataset. ",

When the robot starts moving in an environment, we assume it has no knowledge about it, and it estimates an online situational graph representation (S-Graph) of its surroundings. We develop a novel graph-to-graph matching method, in order to relate the S-Graph estimated online from the robot sensors and the A-Graph extracted from the building plans. Note the challenge in this, as the S-Graph may show a partial view of the full A-Graph, their nodes are heterogeneous and their reference frames are different. After the matching, both graphs are aligned and merged, resulting in what we denote as an informed Situational Graph (iS-Graph), with which we achieve global robot localization and exploitation of prior knowledge from the building plans. Our experiments show that our pipeline shows a higher robustness and a significantly lower pose error than several LiDAR localization baselines. ",

Specifically, we introduce a method to consistently attack both the sensors measurements and camera images over time, in order to cause control performance degradation (e.g., by failing the mission) while remaining stealthy (i.e., undetected by the deployed anomaly detector). Unlike existing attacks that mainly rely on vulnerability of deep neural networks to small input perturbations (e.g., by adding small patches and/or noise to the images), we show that stealthy yet effective attacks can be designed by changing images of the ground vehicle's landing markers as well as suitably falsifying sensing data.

    "abstract": "Sparse Neural Networks (SNNs) have received voluminous attention predominantly due to growing computational and memory footprints of consistently exploding parameter count in large-scale models. Similar to their dense counterparts, recent SNNs generalize just as well and are equipped with numerous favorable benefits (e.g., low complexity, high scalability, and robustness), sometimes even better than the original dense networks. As research effort is focused on developing increasingly sophisticated sparse algorithms, it is startling that a comprehensive benchmark to evaluate the effectiveness of these algorithms has been highly overlooked. In absence of a carefully crafted evaluation benchmark, most if not all, sparse algorithms are evaluated against fairly simple and naive tasks (eg. CIFAR, ImageNet, GLUE, etc.), which can potentially camouflage many advantages as well unexpected predicaments of SNNs. In pursuit of a more general evaluation and unveiling the true potential of sparse algorithms, we introduce \"Sparsity May Cry\" Benchmark (SMC-Bench), a collection of carefully-curated 4 diverse tasks with 10 datasets, that accounts for capturing a wide range of domain-specific and sophisticated knowledge. Our systemic evaluation of the most representative sparse algorithms reveals an important obscured observation: the state-of-the-art magnitude- and/or gradient-based sparse algorithms seemingly fail to perform on SMC-Bench when applied out-of-the-box, sometimes at significantly trivial sparsity as low as 5%. By incorporating these well-thought and diverse tasks, SMC-Bench is designed to favor and encourage the development of more scalable and generalizable sparse algorithms. ",

I present a hybrid of expectation propagation called Variational Expectation Propagation approach (VEP) for approximate integration over the posterior distribution of the weights, the hierarchical scale parameters of the priors and zeta. Using a factorized posterior approximation I derive a computationally efficient algorithm, whose complexity scales similarly to an ensemble of independent sparse logistic models. The approach can be extended beyond standard activation functions and NN model structures to form flexible nonlinear binary predictors from multiple sparse linear models. I consider a hierarchical Bayesian model with logistic regression likelihood and a Gaussian prior distribution over the parameters called weights and hyperparameters. I work in the perspective of E step and M step for computing the approximating posterior and updating the parameters using the computed posterior respectively. ",

The architecture creates a set of higher-level representations which correspond to tracks and assigns spacepoints to these tracks, allowing disconnected spacepoints to be assigned to the same track, as well as multiple tracks to share the same spacepoint. We propose a novel learnable pooling algorithm called GMPool to generate these higher-level representations called \"super-nodes\", as well as a new loss function designed for tracking problems and HGNN specifically. On a standard tracking problem, we show that, compared with previous ML-based tracking algorithms, the HGNN has better tracking efficiency performance, better robustness against inefficient input graphs, and better convergence compared with traditional GNNs.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we study scheduling of a queueing system with zero knowledge of instantaneous network conditions. We consider a one-hop single-server queueing system consisting of $K$ queues, each with time-varying and non-stationary arrival and service rates. Our scheduling approach builds on an innovative combination of adversarial bandit learning and Lyapunov drift minimization, without knowledge of the instantaneous network state (the arrival and service rates) of each queue. We then present two novel algorithms \\texttt{SoftMW} (SoftMaxWeight) and \\texttt{SSMW} (Sliding-window SoftMaxWeight), both capable of stabilizing systems that can be stablized by some (possibly unknown) sequence of randomized policies whose time-variation satisfies a mild condition. We further generalize our results to the setting where arrivals and departures only have bounded moments instead of being deterministically bounded and propose \\texttt{SoftMW+} and \\texttt{SSMW+} that are capable of stabilizing the system. As a building block of our new algorithms, we also extend the classical \\texttt{EXP3.S} (Auer et al., 2002) algorithm for multi-armed bandits to handle unboundedly large feedback signals, which can be of independent interest.

    "abstract": "Medical imaging plays a significant role in detecting and treating various diseases. However, these images often happen to be of too poor quality, leading to decreased efficiency, extra expenses, and even incorrect diagnoses. Therefore, we propose a retinal image enhancement method using a vision transformer and convolutional neural network. It builds a cycle-consistent generative adversarial network that relies on unpaired datasets. It consists of two generators that translate images from one domain to another (e.g., low- to high-quality and vice versa), playing an adversarial game with two discriminators. Generators produce indistinguishable images for discriminators that predict the original images from generated ones. Generators are a combination of vision transformer (ViT) encoder and convolutional neural network (CNN) decoder. Discriminators include traditional CNN encoders. The resulting improved images have been tested quantitatively using such evaluation metrics as peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), structural similarity index measure (SSIM), and qualitatively, i.e., vessel segmentation. The proposed method successfully reduces the adverse effects of blurring, noise, illumination disturbances, and color distortions while significantly preserving structural and color information. Experimental results show the superiority of the proposed method. Our testing PSNR is 31.138 dB for the first and 27.798 dB for the second dataset. Testing SSIM is 0.919 and 0.904, respectively. ",

These universal coding principles lead to the establishment of lasting brain signatures of perceptual experience in all living species, from aplysiae to primates. They are revisited in this paper here on the basis of examples drawn from the original code and from some of the most recent related empirical findings on contextual modulation in the brain, highlighting the potential of Grossberg's pioneering insights and groundbreaking theoretical work for intelligent solutions in the domain of developmental and cognitive robotics.

By extending Equivariant Imaging (EI) to volumetric single-photon data, we propose a self-supervised learning framework for the SPISR task. Particularly, using the Poisson unbiased Kullback-Leibler risk estimator and equivariance, our method is able to learn from noisy measurements without ground truths. Comprehensive experiments on simulated and real-world dataset demonstrate that the proposed method achieves comparable performance with supervised learning and outperforms interpolation-based methods.

    "title": "TRUSformer: Improving Prostate Cancer Detection from Micro-Ultrasound  Using Attention and Self-Supervision",
    "abstract": "A large body of previous machine learning methods for ultrasound-based prostate cancer detection classify small regions of interest (ROIs) of ultrasound signals that lie within a larger needle trace corresponding to a prostate tissue biopsy (called biopsy core). These ROI-scale models suffer from weak labeling as histopathology results available for biopsy cores only approximate the distribution of cancer in the ROIs. ROI-scale models do not take advantage of contextual information that are normally considered by pathologists, i.e. they do not consider information about surrounding tissue and larger-scale trends when identifying cancer. We aim to improve cancer detection by taking a multi-scale, i.e. ROI-scale and biopsy core-scale, approach. Methods: Our multi-scale approach combines (i) an \"ROI-scale\" model trained using self-supervised learning to extract features from small ROIs and (ii) a \"core-scale\" transformer model that processes a collection of extracted features from multiple ROIs in the needle trace region to predict the tissue type of the corresponding core. Attention maps, as a byproduct, allow us to localize cancer at the ROI scale. We analyze this method using a dataset of micro-ultrasound acquired from 578 patients who underwent prostate biopsy, and compare our model to baseline models and other large-scale studies in the literature. Results and Conclusions: Our model shows consistent and substantial performance improvements compared to ROI-scale-only models. It achieves 80.3% AUROC, a statistically significant improvement over ROI-scale classification. We also compare our method to large studies on prostate cancer detection, using other imaging modalities. Our code is publicly available at www.github.com/med-i-lab/TRUSFormer ",
