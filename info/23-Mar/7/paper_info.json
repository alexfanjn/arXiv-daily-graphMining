    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have taken the scientific world by storm, changing the landscape of natural language processing and human-computer interaction. These powerful tools can answer complex questions and, surprisingly, perform challenging creative tasks (e.g., generate code and applications to solve problems, write stories, pieces of music, etc.). In this paper, we present a collaborative design framework that combines interactive evolution and large language models to simulate the typical human design process. We use the former to exploit users' feedback for selecting the most promising ideas and large language models for a very complex creative task -- the recombination and variation of ideas. In our framework, the process starts with a brief and a set of candidate designs, either generated using a language model or proposed by the users. Next, users collaborate on the design process by providing feedback to an interactive genetic algorithm that selects, recombines, and mutates the most promising designs. We evaluated our framework on three game design tasks with human designers who collaborated remotely. ",

    "abstract": "The rapid advances in Vision Transformer (ViT) refresh the state-of-the-art performances in various vision tasks, overshadowing the conventional CNN-based models. This ignites a few recent striking-back research in the CNN world showing that pure CNN models can achieve as good performance as ViT models when carefully tuned. While encouraging, designing such high-performance CNN models is challenging, requiring non-trivial prior knowledge of network design. To this end, a novel framework termed Mathematical Architecture Design for Deep CNN (DeepMAD) is proposed to design high-performance CNN models in a principled way. In DeepMAD, a CNN network is modeled as an information processing system whose expressiveness and effectiveness can be analytically formulated by their structural parameters. Then a constrained mathematical programming (MP) problem is proposed to optimize these structural parameters. The MP problem can be easily solved by off-the-shelf MP solvers on CPUs with a small memory footprint. In addition, DeepMAD is a pure mathematical framework: no GPU or training data is required during network design. The superiority of DeepMAD is validated on multiple large-scale computer vision benchmark datasets. Notably on ImageNet-1k, only using conventional convolutional layers, DeepMAD achieves 0.7% and 1.5% higher top-1 accuracy than ConvNeXt and Swin on Tiny level, and 0.8% and 0.9% higher on Small level.

    "abstract": "This vision paper proposes KGNet, an on-demand graph machine learning (GML) as a service on top of RDF engines to support GML-enabled SPARQL queries. KGNet automates the training of GML models on a KG by identifying a task-specific subgraph. This helps reduce the task-irrelevant KG structure and properties for better scalability and accuracy. While training a GML model on KG, KGNet collects metadata of trained models in the form of an RDF graph called KGMeta, which is interlinked with the relevant subgraphs in KG. Finally, all trained models are accessible via a SPARQL-like query. We call it a GML-enabled query and refer to it as SPARQLML. KGNet supports SPARQLML on top of existing RDF engines as an interface for querying and inferencing over KGs using GML models. The development of KGNet poses research opportunities in several areas, including meta-sampling for identifying task-specific subgraphs, GML pipeline automation with computational constraints, such as limited time and memory budget, and SPARQLML query optimization. KGNet supports different GML tasks, such as node classification, link prediction, and semantic entity matching. We evaluated KGNet using two real KGs of different application domains. Compared to training on the entire KG, KGNet significantly reduced training time and memory usage while maintaining comparable or improved accuracy.

    "abstract": "Causality has the potential to truly transform the way we solve a large number of real-world problems. Yet, so far, its potential remains largely unlocked since most work so far requires strict assumptions which do not hold true in practice. To address this challenge and make progress in solving real-world problems, we propose a new way of thinking about causality - we call this causal deep learning. The framework which we propose for causal deep learning spans three dimensions: (1) a structural dimension, which allows incomplete causal knowledge rather than assuming either full or no causal knowledge; (2) a parametric dimension, which encompasses parametric forms which are typically ignored; and finally, (3) a temporal dimension, which explicitly allows for situations which capture exposure times or temporal structure. Together, these dimensions allow us to make progress on a variety of real-world problems by leveraging (sometimes incomplete) causal knowledge and/or combining diverse causal deep learning methods. This new framework also enables researchers to compare systematically across existing works as well as identify promising research areas which can lead to real-world impact. ",

There is no widely accepted augmentation technique that works well across tasks and model architectures. In this paper we explore data augmentation techniques in the context of text classification using two social media datasets. We explore popular varieties of data augmentation, starting with oversampling, Easy Data Augmentation (Wei and Zou, 2019) and Back-Translation (Sennrich et al., 2015). We also consider Greyscaling, a relatively unexplored data augmentation technique that seeks to mitigate the intensity of adjectives in examples. Finally, we consider a few-shot learning approach: Pattern-Exploiting Training (PET) (Schick et al., 2020). For the experiments we use a BERT transformer architecture. Results show that augmentation techniques provide only minimal and inconsistent improvements. Synonym replacement provided evidence of some performance improvement and adjective scales with Grayscaling is an area where further exploration would be valuable. Few-shot learning experiments show consistent improvement over supervised training, and seem very promising when classes are easily separable but further exploration would be valuable. ",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in 3D object detection (3DOD) have obtained remarkably strong results for LiDAR-based models. In contrast, surround-view 3DOD models based on multiple camera images underperform due to the necessary view transformation of features from perspective view (PV) to a 3D world representation which is ambiguous due to missing depth information. This paper introduces X$^3$KD, a comprehensive knowledge distillation framework across different modalities, tasks, and stages for multi-camera 3DOD. Specifically, we propose cross-task distillation from an instance segmentation teacher (X-IS) in the PV feature extraction stage providing supervision without ambiguous error backpropagation through the view transformation. After the transformation, we apply cross-modal feature distillation (X-FD) and adversarial training (X-AT) to improve the 3D world representation of multi-camera features through the information contained in a LiDAR-based 3DOD teacher. Finally, we also employ this teacher for cross-modal output distillation (X-OD), providing dense supervision at the prediction stage. We perform extensive ablations of knowledge distillation at different stages of multi-camera 3DOD. Our final X$^3$KD model outperforms previous state-of-the-art approaches on the nuScenes and Waymo datasets and generalizes to RADAR-based 3DOD.

    "abstract": "In recent years, we have witnessed a growing interest in data science not only from academia but particularly from companies investing in data science platforms to analyze large amounts of data. In this process, a myriad of data science artifacts, such as datasets and pipeline scripts, are created. Yet, there has so far been no systematic attempt to holistically exploit the collected knowledge and experiences that are implicitly contained in the specification of these pipelines, e.g., compatible datasets, cleansing steps, ML algorithms, parameters, etc. Instead, data scientists still spend a considerable amount of their time trying to recover relevant information and experiences from colleagues, trial and error, lengthy exploration, etc. In this paper, we, therefore, propose a scalable system (KGLiDS) that employs machine learning to extract the semantics of data science pipelines and captures them in a knowledge graph, which can then be exploited to assist data scientists in various ways. This abstraction is the key to enabling Linked Data Science since it allows us to share the essence of pipelines between platforms, companies, and institutions without revealing critical internal information and instead focusing on the semantics of what is being processed and how. Our comprehensive evaluation uses thousands of datasets and more than thirteen thousand pipeline scripts extracted from data discovery benchmarks and the Kaggle portal and shows that KGLiDS significantly outperforms state-of-the-art systems on related tasks, such as dataset recommendation and pipeline classification.

These attacks can cause the global model to misbehave on specific inputs while appearing normal in other cases.

    "abstract": "Machine learning methods, particularly recent advances in equivariant graph neural networks (GNNs), have been investigated as surrogate models to expensive ab initio quantum mechanics (QM) approaches for molecular potential predictions. However, building accurate and transferable potential models using GNNs remains challenging, as the quality and quantity of data are greatly limited by QM calculations, especially for large and complex molecular systems. In this work, we propose denoise pre-training on non-equilibrium molecular conformations to achieve more accurate and transferable GNN potential predictions. Specifically, GNNs are pre-trained by predicting the random noises added to atomic coordinates of sampled non-equilibrium conformations. Rigorous experiments on multiple benchmarks reveal that pre-training significantly improves the accuracy of neural potentials. Furthermore, we show that the proposed pre-training approach is model-agnostic, as it improves the performance of different invariant and equivariant GNNs. Notably, our models pre-trained on small molecules demonstrate remarkable transferability, improving performance when fine-tuned on diverse molecular systems, including different elements, charged molecules, biomolecules, and larger systems. These results highlight the potential for leveraging denoise pre-training approaches to build more generalizable neural potentials for complex molecular systems. ",

We analyze a Perceptron-type algorithm called GLM-tron (Kakade et al., 2011), and provide its dimension-free risk upper bounds for high-dimensional ReLU regression in both well-specified and misspecified settings. Our risk bounds recover several existing results as special cases. Moreover, in the well-specified setting, we also provide an instance-wise matching risk lower bound for GLM-tron. Our upper and lower risk bounds provide a sharp characterization of the high-dimensional ReLU regression problems that can be learned via GLM-tron. On the other hand, we provide some negative results for stochastic gradient descent (SGD) for ReLU regression with symmetric Bernoulli data: if the model is well-specified, the excess risk of SGD is provably no better than that of GLM-tron ignoring constant factors, for each problem instance; and in the noiseless case, GLM-tron can achieve a small risk while SGD unavoidably suffers from a constant risk in expectation. These results together suggest that GLM-tron might be preferable than SGD for high-dimensional ReLU regression. ",

    "abstract": "Implicit layer deep learning techniques, like Neural Differential Equations, have become an important modeling framework due to their ability to adapt to new problems automatically. Training a neural differential equation is effectively a search over a space of plausible dynamical systems. However, controlling the computational cost for these models is difficult since it relies on the number of steps the adaptive solver takes. Most prior works have used higher-order methods to reduce prediction timings while greatly increasing training time or reducing both training and prediction timings by relying on specific training algorithms, which are harder to use as a drop-in replacement due to strict requirements on automatic differentiation. In this manuscript, we use internal cost heuristics of adaptive differential equation solvers at stochastic time points to guide the training toward learning a dynamical system that is easier to integrate. We \"close the black-box\" and allow the use of our method with any adjoint technique for gradient calculations of the differential equation solution. We perform experimental studies to compare our method to global regularization to show that we attain similar performance numbers without compromising the flexibility of implementation on ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and stochastic differential equations (SDEs). We develop two sampling strategies to trade off between performance and training time. Our method reduces the number of function evaluations to 0.556-0.733x and accelerates predictions by 1.3-2x. ",

Recently, dataset distillation has been explored in order to improve the efficiency and scalability of FL by creating a smaller, synthetic dataset that retains the performance of a model trained on the local private datasets. We discover that using distilled local datasets can amplify the heterogeneity issue in FL. To address this, we propose a new method, called Federated Virtual Learning on Heterogeneous Data with Local-Global Distillation (FEDLGD), which trains FL using a smaller synthetic dataset (referred as virtual data) created through a combination of local and global distillation. Specifically, to handle synchronization and class imbalance, we propose iterative distribution matching to allow clients to have the same amount of balanced local virtual data; to harmonize the domain shifts, we use federated gradient matching to distill global virtual data that are shared with clients without hindering data privacy to rectify heterogeneous local training via enforcing local-global feature similarity. We experiment on both benchmark and real-world datasets that contain heterogeneous data from different sources.

    "abstract": "This article studies the reliability of multi-hop routing in a multi-tier hybrid satellite-terrestrial relay network (HSTRN). We evaluate the reliability of multi-hop routing by introducing interruption probability, which is the probability that no relay device (ground gateway or satellite) is available during a hop. The single-hop interruption probability is derived and extended to the multi-hop interruption probability using a stochastic geometry-based approach. Since the interruption probability in HSTRN highly depends on the priority of selecting communication devices at different tiers, we propose three priority strategies: (i) stationary optimal priority strategy, (ii) single-hop interruption probability inspired strategy, and (iii) density inspired strategy. Among them, the interruption probability under the stationary optimal priority strategy can approach the ideal lower bound. However, when analyzing an HSTRN with a large number of tiers, the stationary optimal priority strategy is computationally expensive. The single-hop interruption probability inspired strategy is expected to be a low-complexity but less reliable alternative to the stationary optimal priority strategy. In numerical results, we study the complementarity between terrestrial devices and satellites. Furthermore, analytical results for reliability are also applicable to the analysis of satellite availability, coverage probability, and ultra-reliable and low latency communications (URLLC) rate. Finally, we extend our original routing strategy into a multi-flow one with dynamic priority strategy. ",

To evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, a navigation problem involving a car-like robot under different noise distributions is used as a numerical example. The results demonstrate that DROC combined with the proposed data-driven approaches, what we call D3ROC, provide robust and efficient control policies that outperform the traditional iterative linear quadratic Gaussian (iLQG) control approach. Moreover, it shows the effectiveness of our proposed approach in handling different noise distributions. Overall, the proposed approach offers a promising solution to real-world DROC problems where the noise distribution and KL divergence bounds may not be known a priori, increasing the practicality and applicability of the DROC framework.

    "abstract": "Recently, virtual/pseudo-point-based 3D object detection that seamlessly fuses RGB images and LiDAR data by depth completion has gained great attention. However, virtual points generated from an image are very dense, introducing a huge amount of redundant computation during detection. Meanwhile, noises brought by inaccurate depth completion significantly degrade detection precision. This paper proposes a fast yet effective backbone, termed VirConvNet, based on a new operator VirConv (Virtual Sparse Convolution), for virtual-point-based 3D object detection. VirConv consists of two key designs: (1) StVD (Stochastic Voxel Discard) and (2) NRConv (Noise-Resistant Submanifold Convolution). StVD alleviates the computation problem by discarding large amounts of nearby redundant voxels. NRConv tackles the noise problem by encoding voxel features in both 2D image and 3D LiDAR space. By integrating VirConv, we first develop an efficient pipeline VirConv-L based on an early fusion design. Then, we build a high-precision pipeline VirConv-T based on a transformed refinement scheme. Finally, we develop a semi-supervised pipeline VirConv-S based on a pseudo-label framework. On the KITTI car 3D detection test leaderboard, our VirConv-L achieves 85% AP with a fast running speed of 56ms. Our VirConv-T and VirConv-S attains a high-precision of 86.3% and 87.2% AP, and currently rank 2nd and 1st, respectively. The code is available at https://github.com/hailanyi/VirConv. ",

The goal of counterfactually fair anomaly detection is to ensure that the detection outcome of an individual in the factual world is the same as that in the counterfactual world where the individual had belonged to a different group. To this end, we propose a counterfactually fair anomaly detection (CFAD) framework which consists of two phases, counterfactual data generation and fair anomaly detection.

Many transportation decisions can be informed based on an accurate pedestrian network, its interactions, and connectivity with the road networks of other modes of travel. A connected pedestrian path network is vital to transportation activities, as sidewalks and crossings connect pedestrians to other modes of transportation. However, information about these paths' location and connectivity is often missing or inaccurate in city planning systems and wayfinding applications, causing severe information gaps and errors for planners and pedestrians. This work begins to address this problem at scale by introducing a novel dataset of aerial satellite imagery, street map imagery, and rasterized annotations of sidewalks, crossings, and corner bulbs in urban cities. The dataset spans $2,700 km^2$ land area, covering select regions from $6$ different cities. It can be used for various learning tasks related to segmenting and understanding pedestrian environments. We also present an end-to-end process for inferring a connected pedestrian path network map using street network information and our proposed dataset. The process features the use of a multi-input segmentation network trained on our dataset to predict important classes in the pedestrian environment and then generate a connected pedestrian path network. Our results demonstrate that the dataset is sufficiently large to train common segmentation models yielding accurate, robust pedestrian path networks. ",

    "abstract": "Study patterns that models have learned has long been a focus of pattern recognition research. Explaining what patterns are discovered from training data, and how patterns are generalized to unseen data are instrumental to understanding and advancing the pattern recognition methods. Unfortunately, the vast majority of the application domains deal with continuous data (i.e. statistical in nature) out of which extracted patterns can not be formally defined. For example, in image classification, there does not exist a principle definition for a label of cat or dog. Even in natural language, the meaning of a word can vary with the context it is surrounded by. Unlike the aforementioned data format, programs are a unique data structure with a well-defined syntax and semantics, which creates a golden opportunity to formalize what models have learned from source code. This paper presents the first formal definition of patterns discovered by code summarization models (i.e. models that predict the name of a method given its body), and gives a sound algorithm to infer a context-free grammar (CFG) that formally describes the learned patterns. We realize our approach in PATIC which produces CFGs for summarizing the patterns discovered by code summarization models. In particular, we pick two prominent instances, code2vec and code2seq, to evaluate PATIC. PATIC shows that the patterns extracted by each model are heavily restricted to local, and syntactic code structures with little to none semantic implication. Based on these findings, we present two example uses of the formal definition of patterns: a new method for evaluating the robustness and a new technique for improving the accuracy of code summarization models. Our work opens up this exciting, new direction of studying what models have learned from source code. ",

Previous research in robotic fluid manipulation mostly consider fluids governed by an ideal, Newtonian model in simple task settings (e.g., pouring). However, the vast majority of real-world fluid systems manifest their complexities in terms of the fluid's complex material behaviors and multi-component interactions, both of which were well beyond the scope of the current literature. To evaluate robot learning algorithms on understanding and interacting with such complex fluid systems, a comprehensive virtual platform with versatile simulation capabilities and well-established tasks is needed. In this work, we introduce FluidLab, a simulation environment with a diverse set of manipulation tasks involving complex fluid dynamics. These tasks address interactions between solid and fluid as well as among multiple fluids. At the heart of our platform is a fully differentiable physics simulator, FluidEngine, providing GPU-accelerated simulations and gradient calculations for various material types and their couplings. We identify several challenges for fluid manipulation learning by evaluating a set of reinforcement learning and trajectory optimization methods on our platform. To address these challenges, we propose several domain-specific optimization schemes coupled with differentiable physics, which are empirically shown to be effective in tackling optimization problems featured by fluid system's non-convex and non-smooth properties. Furthermore, we demonstrate reasonable sim-to-real transfer by deploying optimized trajectories in real-world settings. ",

    "abstract": "High-resolution (HR) images are usually downscaled to low-resolution (LR) ones for better display and afterward upscaled back to the original size to recover details. Recent work in image rescaling formulates downscaling and upscaling as a unified task and learns a bijective mapping between HR and LR via invertible networks. However, in real-world applications (e.g., social media), most images are compressed for transmission. Lossy compression will lead to irreversible information loss on LR images, hence damaging the inverse upscaling procedure and degrading the reconstruction accuracy. In this paper, we propose the Self-Asymmetric Invertible Network (SAIN) for compression-aware image rescaling. To tackle the distribution shift, we first develop an end-to-end asymmetric framework with two separate bijective mappings for high-quality and compressed LR images, respectively. Then, based on empirical analysis of this framework, we model the distribution of the lost information (including downscaling and compression) using isotropic Gaussian mixtures and propose the Enhanced Invertible Block to derive high-quality/compressed LR images in one forward pass. Besides, we design a set of losses to regularize the learned LR images and enhance the invertibility. Extensive experiments demonstrate the consistent improvements of SAIN across various image rescaling datasets in terms of both quantitative and qualitative evaluation under standard image compression formats (i.e., JPEG and WebP).

Then, we examine a leader selection guaranteeing network SSC by ensuring the accuracy of the zero forcing process, despite $k$ misbehaving nodes/edges. Our main result shows that a network is resilient to $k$ misbehaving nodes/edges under one threat model if and only if it is resilient to the same number of failures under the other threat models. Thus, resilience against one threat model implies resilience against the other models.

We demonstrate our approach in two (multi-)sensor-placement experiments in three static scenes and one experiment in a dynamic scene. The occupancy representation allow to compare the effectiveness of various sensor setups.

Other methods such as using public social media data can therefore help augment current approaches to surveilling pandemics. This study evaluated the effectiveness of using social media data as a data source for tracking public health pandemics. There have been several attempts at using social media data from platforms like Twitter for analyzing the COVID-19 pandemic. While these provide a multitude of useful insights, new platforms like Venmo, a popular U.S. mobile social payment app often used during in-person activities, remain understudied. We developed unique computational methods (combining Venmo- and Facebook- derived data) to classify post content, including the location where the content was likely posted. This approach enabled geotemporal COVID-19-related infoveillance. By examining 135M publicly available Venmo transactions from 22.1M unique users, we found significant spikes in the use of COVID-19 related keywords in March 2020. Using Facebook-based geotags for 9K users along with transaction geo-parsing (i.e., parsing text to detect place names), we identified 38K location-based clusters. Within these groups, we found a strong correlation (0.81) between the use of COVID-19 keywords in a region and the number of reported COVID-19 cases as well as an aggregate decrease in transactions during lockdowns and an increase when lockdowns are lifted. Surprisingly, we saw a weak negative correlation between the number of transactions and reported cases over time (-0.49).

NeuDA maintains the hierarchical anchor grids where each vertex stores a 3D position (or anchor) instead of the direct embedding (or feature). We optimize the anchor grids such that different local geometry structures can be adaptively encoded. Besides, we dig into the frequency encoding strategies and introduce a simple hierarchical positional encoding method for the hierarchical anchor structure to flexibly exploit the properties of high-frequency and low-frequency geometry and appearance. Experiments on both the DTU and BlendedMVS datasets demonstrate that NeuDA can produce promising mesh surfaces. ",

    "abstract": "Deep Neural Networks provide state-of-the-art accuracy for vision tasks but they require significant resources for training. Thus, they are trained on cloud servers far from the edge devices that acquire the data. This issue increases communication cost, runtime and privacy concerns. In this study, a novel hierarchical training method for deep neural networks is proposed that reduces the communication cost, training runtime, and privacy concerns by dividing the architecture between edge and cloud workers using early exits. The method proposes a brand-new use case for early exits to separate the backward pass of neural networks between the edge and the cloud during the training phase. We address the issues of most available hierarchical training methods that due to the sequential nature of the training phase, cannot train the levels of hierarchy at the same time or they do it with the cost of privacy. In contrast to these schemes, our method can use both edge and cloud workers simultaneously, does not share the raw input data with the cloud, and does not require communication during the backward pass. Several simulations and on-device experiments for different neural network architectures are done to demonstrate the effectiveness of this method. It is shown that the method reduces 29% and 61% runtime in CIFAR-10 classification experiment for VGG-16 and ResNet-18 when the communication with the cloud is done over the 3G protocol. This gain in the runtime is achieved whilst the accuracy drop is negligible. This method can be inspirational to provide online learning of high-accuracy deep neural networks on low-resource devices such as mobile phones or robots as a part of an edge-cloud system, making them more flexible in facing new tasks and classes of data in the future.

We present an improved granular-ball computing method to represent the image as a graph, in which each node expresses a structural block in the image and each edge represents the association between two nodes. Specifically:(1) We design a gradient-based strategy for the adaptive reorganization of all pixels in the image into numerous rectangular regions, each of which can be regarded as one node. (2) Each node has a connection edge with the nodes with which it shares regions. (3) We design a low-dimensional vector as the attribute of each node. All nodes and their corresponding edges form a graphical representation of a digital image. In the experiments, our proposed graph representation is applied to benchmark datasets for image classification tasks, and the efficiency and good understandability demonstrate that our proposed method offers significant potential in artificial intelligence theory and application.

However, the lack of explicit features in sequence data makes it difficult for machine learning models. While Neural Network (NN) models address this with learning features automatically, they are limited to capturing adjacent structural connections and ignore global, higher-order information between the sequences. To address these challenges in the sequence classification problems, we propose a novel Hypergraph Attention Network model, namely Seq-HyGAN. To capture the complex structural similarity between sequence data, we first create a hypergraph where the sequences are depicted as hyperedges and subsequences extracted from sequences are depicted as nodes. Additionally, we introduce an attention-based Hypergraph Neural Network model that utilizes a two-level attention mechanism. This model generates a sequence representation as a hyperedge while simultaneously learning the crucial subsequences for each sequence. We conduct extensive experiments on four data sets to assess and compare our model with several state-of-the-art methods. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed Seq-HyGAN model can effectively classify sequence data and significantly outperform the baselines. We also conduct case studies to investigate the contribution of each module in Seq-HyGAN. ",

By simultaneously learning the affordance text and the point feature, OpenAD successfully exploits the semantic relationships between affordances. Therefore, our proposed method enables zero-shot detection and can detect previously unseen affordances without a single annotation example. Intensive experimental results show that OpenAD works effectively on a wide range of affordance detection setups and outperforms other baselines by a large margin.

However, it is challenging to explore multi-behavior data due to the unbalanced data distribution and sparse target behavior, which lead to the inadequate modeling of high-order relations when treating multi-behavior data ''as features'' and gradient conflict in multitask learning when treating multi-behavior data ''as labels''. In this paper, we propose CIGF, a Compressed Interaction Graph based Framework, to overcome the above limitations. Specifically, we design a novel Compressed Interaction Graph Convolution Network (CIGCN) to model instance-level high-order relations explicitly. To alleviate the potential gradient conflict when treating multi-behavior data ''as labels'', we propose a Multi-Expert with Separate Input (MESI) network with separate input on the top of CIGCN for multi-task learning. Comprehensive experiments on three large-scale real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of CIGF. Ablation studies and in-depth analysis further validate the effectiveness of our proposed model in capturing high-order relations and alleviating gradient conflict.

Such a problem involves the interplay among the operations that leads to NP-hard problems with complex constraints. Hence, existing methods for AGH are usually designed with massive domain knowledge but still fail to yield high-quality solutions efficiently. In this paper, we aim to enhance the solution quality and computation efficiency for solving AGH. Particularly, we first model AGH as a multiple-fleet vehicle routing problem (VRP) with miscellaneous constraints including precedence, time windows, and capacity. Then we propose a construction framework that decomposes AGH into sub-problems (i.e., VRPs) in fleets and present a neural method to construct the routing solutions to these sub-problems. In specific, we resort to deep learning and parameterize the construction heuristic policy with an attention-based neural network trained with reinforcement learning, which is shared across all sub-problems. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms classic meta-heuristics, construction heuristics and the specialized methods for AGH. Besides, we empirically verify that our neural method generalizes well to instances with large numbers of flights or varying parameters, and can be readily adapted to solve real-time AGH with stochastic flight arrivals.

Existing literature mainly focus on selecting a subgraph, through combinatorial optimization, to provide faithful explanations.

We enhance on this through a different approach: by proposing a generative structure -- GFlowNets-based GNN Explainer (GFlowExplainer), we turn the optimization problem into a step-by-step generative problem. Our GFlowExplainer aims to learn a policy that generates a distribution of subgraphs for which the probability of a subgraph is proportional to its' reward. The proposed approach eliminates the influence of node sequence and thus does not need any pre-training strategies. We also propose a new cut vertex matrix to efficiently explore parent states for GFlowNets structure, thus making our approach applicable in a large-scale setting. We conduct extensive experiments on both synthetic and real datasets, and both qualitative and quantitative results show the superiority of our GFlowExplainer. ",

    "abstract": "Binary Neural Networks (BNNs) are compact and efficient by using binary weights instead of real-valued weights. Current BNNs use latent real-valued weights during training, where several training hyper-parameters are inherited from real-valued networks. The interpretation of several of these hyperparameters is based on the magnitude of the real-valued weights. For BNNs, however, the magnitude of binary weights is not meaningful, and thus it is unclear what these hyperparameters actually do. One example is weight-decay, which aims to keep the magnitude of real-valued weights small. Other examples are latent weight initialization, the learning rate, and learning rate decay, which influence the magnitude of the real-valued weights. The magnitude is interpretable for real-valued weights, but loses its meaning for binary weights. In this paper we offer a new interpretation of these magnitude-based hyperparameters based on higher-order gradient filtering during network optimization. Our analysis makes it possible to understand how magnitude-based hyperparameters influence the training of binary networks which allows for new optimization filters specifically designed for binary neural networks that are independent of their real-valued interpretation. Moreover, our improved understanding reduces the number of hyperparameters, which in turn eases the hyperparameter tuning effort which may lead to better hyperparameter values for improved accuracy.

This paper presents a novel fixed-time adaptive neural control methodology for handling time-varying workspace constraints that occur in physical human-robot collaboration while also guaranteeing compliance during intended force interactions. The proposed methodology combines the benefits of compliance control, time-varying integral barrier Lyapunov function (TVIBLF) and fixed-time techniques, which not only achieve compliance during physical contact with human operators but also guarantee time-varying workspace constraints and fast tracking error convergence without any restriction on the initial conditions. Furthermore, a neural adaptive control law is designed to compensate for the unknown dynamics and disturbances of the robot manipulator such that the proposed control framework is overall fixed-time converged and capable of online learning without any prior knowledge of robot dynamics and disturbances. The proposed approach is finally validated on a simulated two-link robot manipulator. Simulation results show that the proposed controller is superior in the sense of both tracking error and convergence time compared with the existing barrier Lyapunov functions based controllers, while simultaneously guaranteeing compliance and safety.

Our project traces 712294 scientists' publications related to COVID 19 for two years, from January 2020 to December 2021, to detect the dynamic evolution patterns of the COVID 19 collaboration network over time. By studying the collaboration network of COVID 19 scientists, we observe how a new scientific community has been built in preparation for a sudden shock. The number of newcomers grows incrementally, and the connectivity of the collaboration network shifts from loose to tight promptly. Even though every scientist has an equal opportunity to start a study, collaboration disparity still exists. Following the scale-free distribution, only a few top authors are highly connected with other authors. These top authors are more likely to attract newcomers and work with each other. As the collaboration network evolves, the increase rate in the probability of attracting newcomers for authors with higher degrees increases, whereas the increase rates in the likelihood of forming new links among authors with higher degrees decreases. This highlights the interesting trend that the COVID pandemic alters the research collaboration trends that star scientists are starting to collaborate more with newcomers but less with existing collaborators, which, in a certain way, reduces the collaboration disparity.

They differ drastically in each individual input/output format and dataset size. It has been common to design a task-specific model and fine-tune it independently from a pre-trained V+L model (e.g., CLIP). This results in parameter inefficiency and inability to exploit inter-task relatedness. To address such issues, we propose a novel FAshion-focused Multi-task Efficient learning method for Vision-and-Language tasks (FAME-ViL) in this work. Compared with existing approaches, FAME-ViL applies a single model for multiple heterogeneous fashion tasks, therefore being much more parameter-efficient. It is enabled by two novel components: (1) a task-versatile architecture with cross-attention adapters and task-specific adapters integrated into a unified V+L model, and (2) a stable and effective multi-task training strategy that supports learning from heterogeneous data and prevents negative transfer. Extensive experiments on four fashion tasks show that our FAME-ViL can save 61.5% of parameters over alternatives, while significantly outperforming the conventional independently trained single-task models.

To introduce a \"real\" open-world detector, in this paper, we propose a novel method named CapDet to either predict under a given category list or directly generate the category of predicted bounding boxes. Specifically, we unify the open-world detection and dense caption tasks into a single yet effective framework by introducing an additional dense captioning head to generate the region-grounded captions. Besides, adding the captioning task will in turn benefit the generalization of detection performance since the captioning dataset covers more concepts. Experiment results show that by unifying the dense caption task, our CapDet has obtained significant performance improvements (e.g., +2.1% mAP on LVIS rare classes) over the baseline method on LVIS (1203 classes). Besides, our CapDet also achieves state-of-the-art performance on dense captioning tasks, e.g., 15.44% mAP on VG V1.2 and 13.98% on the VG-COCO dataset. ",

While concerted research efforts in this direction have been notable in recent years, findings have shown that the canonical learning objective, empirical risk minimization (ERM), is unable to achieve optimal imbalance learning in deep neural networks given its bias to the majority class. An alternative learning objective, group distributionally robust optimization (gDRO), is investigated in this study for imbalance learning, focusing on tabular imbalanced data as against image data that has dominated deep imbalance learning research. Contrary to minimizing average per instance loss as in ERM, gDRO seeks to minimize the worst group loss over the training data. Experimental findings in comparison with ERM and classical imbalance methods using four popularly used evaluation metrics in imbalance learning across several benchmark imbalance binary tabular data of varying imbalance ratios reveal impressive performance of gDRO, outperforming other compared methods in terms of g-mean and roc-auc.

    "abstract": "Hate speech in social media is a growing phenomenon, and detecting such toxic content has recently gained significant traction in the research community. Existing studies have explored fine-tuning language models (LMs) to perform hate speech detection, and these solutions have yielded significant performance. However, most of these studies are limited to detecting hate speech only in English, neglecting the bulk of hateful content that is generated in other languages, particularly in low-resource languages. Developing a classifier that captures hate speech and nuances in a low-resource language with limited data is extremely challenging. To fill the research gap, we propose HateMAML, a model-agnostic meta-learning-based framework that effectively performs hate speech detection in low-resource languages. HateMAML utilizes a self-supervision strategy to overcome the limitation of data scarcity and produces better LM initialization for fast adaptation to an unseen target language (i.e., cross-lingual transfer) or other hate speech datasets (i.e., domain generalization). Extensive experiments are conducted on five datasets across eight different low-resource languages. The results show that HateMAML outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines by more than 3% in the cross-domain multilingual transfer setting. We also conduct ablation studies to analyze the characteristics of HateMAML. ",

However, prior active learning approaches with deep neural networks assume offline access to the entire dataset ahead of time. This paper proposes VeSSAL, a new algorithm for batch active learning with deep neural networks in streaming settings, which samples groups of points to query for labels at the moment they are encountered. Our approach trades off between uncertainty and diversity of queried samples to match a desired query rate without requiring any hand-tuned hyperparameters. Altogether, we expand the applicability of deep neural networks to realistic active learning scenarios, such as applications relevant to HCI and large, fractured datasets. ",

    "abstract": "Causal abstraction is a promising theoretical framework for explainable artificial intelligence that defines when an interpretable high-level causal model is a faithful simplification of a low-level deep learning system. However, existing causal abstraction methods have two major limitations: they require a brute-force search over alignments between the high-level model and the low-level one, and they presuppose that variables in the high-level model will align with disjoint sets of neurons in the low-level one. In this paper, we present distributed alignment search (DAS), which overcomes these limitations. In DAS, we find the alignment between high-level and low-level models using gradient descent rather than conducting a brute-force search, and we allow individual neurons to play multiple distinct roles by analyzing representations in non-standard bases-distributed representations. Our experiments show that DAS can discover internal structure that prior approaches miss. Overall, DAS removes previous obstacles to conducting causal abstraction analyses and allows us to find conceptual structure in trained neural nets. ",

    "abstract": "Nonsmooth dynamic behaviour of systems containing multiple contact points is an interesting topic. Accurately simulating the repeated nonsmooth/discontinuous dynamic behaviour is challenging. This study presents a new numerical approach for solving nonsmooth friction-induced vibration or friction-involved vibration (FIV) problems by using the physics-informed neural network (PINN). The neural network training is guided by physics laws or governing equations. Four kinds of high-accuracy PINN-based methods are proposed: (1) single PINN; (2) dual PINN; (3) advanced single PINN; (4) advanced dual PINN. The single PINN uses the nonsmooth dynamic formulations for multibody systems as physical constraints, which is able to substitute the time iteration method in the conventional dynamic analysis. For the dual PINN strategy, in conjunction with the single PINN, a new PINN is proposed as an alternative to traditional numerical methods for solving the linear complementary problems (LCP). The advanced single/dual PINN approaches improve the corresponding single/dual PINN frameworks by incorporating an interpolation technique during the training process. The success of the proposed PINN frameworks in predicting the nonlinear vibration of two typical nonsmooth dynamics problems are verified: one is a 1-dimensional system with direct rigid contact considering stick-slip oscillation, and the other is a 2-dimensional system with spring contact considering separation-reattachment and stick-slip oscillation. Overall, the developed PINN frameworks are accurate in predicting the nonsmooth dynamic behaviour, which do not require a tiny time step like the conventional time-stepping methods. ",

Large-scale systems are currently equipped with multiple GPU accelerators per compute node and are expected to incorporate more specialized hardware.

This work introduces a runtime framework that enables effortless programming for heterogeneous systems while efficiently utilizing hardware resources. The framework is integrated within a distributed and scalable runtime system to facilitate performance portability across heterogeneous nodes. Along with the design, this paper describes the implementation and optimizations performed, achieving up to 300% improvement on a single device and linear scalability on a node equipped with four GPUs. The framework in a distributed memory environment offers portable abstractions that enable efficient inter-node communication among devices with varying capabilities. It delivers superior performance compared to MPI+CUDA by up to 20% for large messages while keeping the overheads for small messages within 10%. Furthermore, the results of our performance evaluation in a distributed Jacobi proxy application demonstrate that our software imposes minimal overhead and achieves a performance improvement of up to 40%.

A practice for expedited deployment is to use pre-trained deep neural networks (PTNNs), often from model zoos -- collections of PTNNs; yet, the reliability of model zoos remains unexamined. In the absence of an industry standard for the implementation and performance of PTNNs, engineers cannot confidently incorporate them into production systems. As a first step, discovering potential discrepancies between PTNNs across model zoos would reveal a threat to model zoo reliability. Prior works indicated existing variances in deep learning systems in terms of accuracy. However, broader measures of reliability for PTNNs from model zoos are unexplored. This work measures notable discrepancies between accuracy, latency, and architecture of 36 PTNNs across four model zoos. Among the top 10 discrepancies, we find differences of 1.23%-2.62% in accuracy and 9%-131% in latency. We also fnd mismatches in architecture for well-known DNN architectures (e.g., ResNet and AlexNet).

CAMEL utilizes a topology metric defined on the Riemannian manifold, and a unique Riemannian metric for both distance and curvature to enhance its expressibility. The method also employs a smooth partition of unity operator on the Riemannian manifold to convert localized orthogonal projection to global embedding, which captures both the overall topological structure and local similarity simultaneously. The local orthogonal vectors provide a physical interpretation of the significant characteristics of clusters. Therefore, CAMEL not only provides a low-dimensional embedding but also interprets the physics behind this embedding.

The method's distinct benefits are its high expressibility, interpretability, and scalability.

According to Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP), CRLF vulnerabilities are among the top 10 vulnerabilities and are a type of injection attack. Automated testing can help to quickly identify CRLF vulnerabilities, and is particularly useful for companies to test their applications before releasing them. However, CRLF vulnerabilities foster a better approach to mitigate CRLF vulnerabilities in the early stage and help secure applications against high-risk known vulnerabilities. There has been less research on CRLF vulnerabilities and how to detect them with automated testing. There is room for further research to be done on this subject matter in order to develop creative solutions to problems. It will also help to reduce false positive alerts by checking the header response of each request. Security automation is an important issue for companies trying to protect themselves against security threats. Automated alerts from security systems can provide a quicker and more accurate understanding of potential vulnerabilities and can help to reduce false positive alerts.

We view time-associated disease prediction as classification tasks at multiple time points. Such closely-related classification tasks are an excellent candidate for model-based meta learning. To address the sparsity problem after task splitting, TAML employs a temporal information sharing strategy to augment the number of positive samples and include the prediction of related phenotypes or events in the meta-training phase. We demonstrate the effectiveness of TAML on multiple clinical datasets, where it consistently outperforms a range of strong baselines.

    "abstract": "Deformable linear objects, such as rods, cables, and ropes, play important roles in daily life. However, manipulation of DLOs is challenging as large geometrically nonlinear deformations may occur during the manipulation process. This problem is made even more difficult as the different deformation modes (e.g., stretching, bending, and twisting) may result in elastic instabilities during manipulation. In this paper, we formulate a physics-guided data-driven method to solve a challenging manipulation task -- accurately deploying a DLO (an elastic rod) onto a rigid substrate along various prescribed patterns. Our framework combines machine learning, scaling analysis, and physics-based simulations to develop a physically informed neural controller for deployment. We explore the complex interplay between the gravitational and elastic energies of the manipulated DLO and obtain a control method for DLO deployment that is robust against friction and material properties. Out of the numerous geometrical and material properties of the rod and substrate, we show that only three non-dimensional parameters are needed to describe the deployment process with physical analysis. Therefore, the essence of the controlling law for the manipulation task can be constructed with a low-dimensional model, drastically increasing the computation speed. The effectiveness of our optimal control scheme is shown through a comprehensive robotic case study comparing against a heuristic control method for deploying rods for a wide variety of patterns. In addition to this, we also showcase the practicality of our control scheme by having a robot accomplish challenging high-level tasks such as mimicking human handwriting and tying knots. ",

Nevertheless, the effectiveness of such methods under the context of data augmentation, which has been considered a common strategy to improve learning under low data regimes, has not be studied. In this paper, we examine several popular task-agnostic data augmentation techniques, i.e., EDA, Back Translation, and Mixup, when using prefix tuning under data scarcity. We show that data augmentation can be used to boost the performance of prefix tuning models, but the effectiveness of each technique varies and certain methods can lead to a notable degradation in performance, particularly when using larger models and on harder tasks. To help understand the above behaviour, we run experiments which reveal how prefix tuning generally presents a limited ability to separate the sentence embeddings from different classes of augmented data, and displays poorer performance on heavily altered data in particular. We also demonstrate that by adding a simple contrastive loss we can help mitigate such issues for prefix tuning, resulting in an improvement to augmented data performance. ",

From the perspective of approximation theory, SRNO first embeds the LR input into a higher-dimensional latent representation space, trying to capture sufficient basis functions, and then iteratively approximates the implicit image function with a kernel integral mechanism, followed by a final dimensionality reduction step to generate the RGB representation at the target coordinates. The key characteristics distinguishing SRNO from prior continuous SR works are: 1) the kernel integral in each layer is efficiently implemented via the Galerkin-type attention, which possesses non-local properties in the spatial domain and therefore benefits the grid-free continuum; and 2) the multilayer attention architecture allows for the dynamic latent basis update, which is crucial for SR problems to \"hallucinate\" high-frequency information from the LR image.

The recently developed point-to-point network (P2PNet) has achieved unprecedented cell recognition accuracy and efficiency compared to methods that rely on intermediate density map representations. However, P2PNet could not leverage multi-scale information since it can only decode a single feature map. Moreover, the distribution of predefined point proposals, which is determined by data properties, restricts the resolution of the feature map to decode, i.e., the encoder design. To lift these limitations, we propose a variant of P2PNet named deformable proposal-aware P2PNet (DPA-P2PNet) in this study. The proposed method uses coordinates of point proposals to directly extract multi-scale region-of-interest (ROI) features for feature enhancement. Such a design also opens up possibilities to exploit dynamic distributions of proposals. We further devise a deformation module to improve the proposal quality.

The deep learning-based IDSes are proposed to auto-extract high-level features and eliminate the time-consuming and costly signature extraction process. However, this new generation of IDSes still suffers from a number of challenges. One of the main issues of an IDS is facing traffic concept drift which manifests itself as new (i.e., zero-day) attacks, in addition to the changing behavior of benign users/applications. Furthermore, a practical DL-based IDS needs to be conformed to a distributed architecture to handle big data challenges. We propose a framework for adapting DL-based models to the changing attack/benign traffic behaviors, considering a more practical scenario (i.e., online adaptable IDSes). This framework employs continual deep anomaly detectors in addition to the federated learning approach to solve the above-mentioned challenges. Furthermore, the proposed framework implements sequential packet labeling for each flow, which provides an attack probability score for the flow by gradually observing each flow packet and updating its estimation. We evaluate the proposed framework by employing different deep models (including CNN-based and LSTM-based) over the CIC-IDS2017 and CSE-CIC-IDS2018 datasets. Through extensive evaluations and experiments, we show that the proposed distributed framework is well adapted to the traffic concept drift. More precisely, our results indicate that the CNN-based models are well suited for continually adapting to the traffic concept drift (i.e., achieving an average detection rate of above 95% while needing just 128 new flows for the updating phase), and the LSTM-based models are a good candidate for sequential packet labeling in practical online IDSes (i.e., detecting intrusions by just observing their first 15 packets).

    "abstract": "Autonomous Intersection Management (AIM) provides a signal-free intersection scheduling paradigm for Connected Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs). Distributed learning method has emerged as an attractive branch of AIM research. Compared with centralized AIM, distributed AIM can be deployed to CAVs at a lower cost, and compared with rule-based and optimization-based method, learning-based method can treat various complicated real-time intersection scenarios more flexibly. Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is the mainstream approach in distributed learning to address AIM problems. However, the large-scale simultaneous interactive decision of multiple agents and the rapid changes of environment caused by interactions pose challenges for DRL, making its reward curve oscillating and hard to converge, and ultimately leading to a compromise in safety and computing efficiency. For this, we propose a non-RL learning framework, called Distributed Hierarchical Adversarial Learning (D-HAL). The framework includes an actor network that generates the actions of each CAV at each step. The immediate discriminator evaluates the interaction performance of the actor network at the current step, while the final discriminator makes the final evaluation of the overall trajectory from a series of interactions. In this framework, the long-term outcome of the behavior no longer motivates the actor network in terms of discounted rewards, but rather through a designed adversarial loss function with discriminative labels. The proposed model is evaluated at a four-way-six-lane intersection, and outperforms several state-of-the-art methods on ensuring safety and reducing travel time. ",

    "abstract": "Despite their incredible performance, it is well reported that deep neural networks tend to be overoptimistic about their prediction confidence. Finding effective and efficient calibration methods for neural networks is therefore an important endeavour towards better uncertainty quantification in deep learning. In this manuscript, we introduce a novel calibration technique named expectation consistency (EC), consisting of a post-training rescaling of the last layer weights by enforcing that the average validation confidence coincides with the average proportion of correct labels. First, we show that the EC method achieves similar calibration performance to temperature scaling (TS) across different neural network architectures and data sets, all while requiring similar validation samples and computational resources. However, we argue that EC provides a principled method grounded on a Bayesian optimality principle known as the Nishimori identity. Next, we provide an asymptotic characterization of both TS and EC in a synthetic setting and show that their performance crucially depends on the target function. In particular, we discuss examples where EC significantly outperforms TS. ",

Consequently, image captioning become an intriguing area of research. There have been multiple attempts by the researchers to solve this problem with different deep learning architectures, although the accuracy has increased, but the results are still not up to standard. This study buckles down to the comparison of Transformer and LSTM with attention block model on MS-COCO dataset, which is a standard dataset for image captioning. For both the models we have used pretrained Inception-V3 CNN encoder for feature extraction of the images. The Bilingual Evaluation Understudy score (BLEU) is used to checked the accuracy of caption generated by both models. Along with the transformer and LSTM with attention block models,CLIP-diffusion model, M2-Transformer model and the X-Linear Attention model have been discussed with state of the art accuracy. ",

However, all available datasets are based on privacy and legally-sensitive authentic biometric data with a limited number of subjects. To target these legal and technical challenges, this work presents the first synthetic-based face PAD dataset, named SynthASpoof, as a large-scale PAD development dataset. The bona fide samples in SynthASpoof are synthetically generated and the attack samples are collected by presenting such synthetic data to capture systems in a real attack scenario. The experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of using SynthASpoof for the development of face PAD. Moreover, we boost the performance of such a solution by incorporating the domain generalization tool MixStyle into the PAD solutions. Additionally, we showed the viability of using synthetic data as a supplement to enrich the diversity of limited authentic training data and consistently enhance PAD performances.

This makes modeling audiovisual data using heterogeneous graphs an attractive option. However, graph structure does not appear naturally in audiovisual data. Graphs for audiovisual data are constructed manually which is both difficult and sub-optimal. In this work, we address this problem by (i) proposing a parametric graph construction strategy for the intra-modal edges, and (ii) learning the crossmodal edges. To this end, we develop a new model, heterogeneous graph crossmodal network (HGCN) that learns the crossmodal edges. Our proposed model can adapt to various spatial and temporal scales owing to its parametric construction, while the learnable crossmodal edges effectively connect the relevant nodes across modalities. Experiments on a large benchmark dataset (AudioSet) show that our model is state-of-the-art (0.53 mean average precision), outperforming transformer-based models and other graph-based models. ",

However, end IoT devices do not have abilities to automatically annotate their collected data, which leads to the label shortage issue at the client side. To collaboratively train an FL model, we can only use a small number of labeled data stored on the server. This is a new yet practical scenario in federated learning, i.e., labels-at-server semi-supervised federated learning (SemiFL). Although several SemiFL approaches have been proposed recently, none of them can focus on the personalization issue in their model design. IoT environments make SemiFL more challenging, as we need to take device computational constraints and communication cost into consideration simultaneously. To tackle these new challenges together, we propose a novel SemiFL framework named pFedKnow. pFedKnow generates lightweight personalized client models via neural network pruning techniques to reduce communication cost. Moreover, it incorporates pretrained large models as prior knowledge to guide the aggregation of personalized client models and further enhance the framework performance. Experiment results on both image and text datasets show that the proposed pFedKnow outperforms state-of-the-art baselines as well as reducing considerable communication cost.

    "abstract": "Recent works have shown that deep learning (DL) models can effectively learn city-wide crowd-flow patterns, which can be used for more effective urban planning and smart city management. However, DL models have been known to perform poorly on inconspicuous adversarial perturbations. Although many works have studied these adversarial perturbations in general, the adversarial vulnerabilities of deep crowd-flow prediction models in particular have remained largely unexplored. In this paper, we perform a rigorous analysis of the adversarial vulnerabilities of DL-based crowd-flow prediction models under multiple threat settings, making three-fold contributions. (1) We propose CaV-detect by formally identifying two novel properties - Consistency and Validity - of the crowd-flow prediction inputs that enable the detection of standard adversarial inputs with 0% false acceptance rate (FAR). (2) We leverage universal adversarial perturbations and an adaptive adversarial loss to present adaptive adversarial attacks to evade CaV-detect defense. (3) We propose CVPR, a Consistent, Valid and Physically-Realizable adversarial attack, that explicitly inducts the consistency and validity priors in the perturbation generation mechanism. We find out that although the crowd-flow models are vulnerable to adversarial perturbations, it is extremely challenging to simulate these perturbations in physical settings, notably when CaV-detect is in place. We also show that CVPR attack considerably outperforms the adaptively modified standard attacks in FAR and adversarial loss metrics. We conclude with useful insights emerging from our work and highlight promising future research directions. ",

In this paper, we attempt to analyze the speech signal in both time and frequency domains and propose the time-frequency network~(TFN) for speaker recognition by extracting and fusing the features in the two domains. Based on the recent advance of deep neural networks, we propose a convolution neural network to encode the raw speech waveform and the frequency spectrum into domain-specific features, which are then fused and transformed into a classification feature space for speaker recognition.

Indeed, solid-state LiDARs can bring in high resolution at a low cost to traditional spinning LiDARs in robotic applications. However, their reduced field of view (FoV) limits performance, particularly indoors. In this paper, we propose a tightly-coupled multi-modal multi-LiDAR-inertial SLAM system for surveying and mapping tasks. By taking advantage of both solid-state and spinnings LiDARs, and built-in inertial measurement units (IMU), we achieve both robust and low-drift ego-estimation as well as high-resolution maps in diverse challenging indoor environments (e.g., small, featureless rooms). First, we use spatial-temporal calibration modules to align the timestamp and calibrate extrinsic parameters between sensors. Then, we extract two groups of feature points including edge and plane points, from LiDAR data. Next, with pre-integrated IMU data, an undistortion module is applied to the LiDAR point cloud data. Finally, the undistorted point clouds are merged into one point cloud and processed with a sliding window based optimization module. From extensive experiment results, our method shows competitive performance with state-of-the-art spinning-LiDAR-only or solid-state-LiDAR-only SLAM systems in diverse environments.

The multi-agent structure addresses the major concern of data-hungry in traditional RL, while the federated mechanism protects the data privacy of individual agents. However, the federated mechanism also exposes the system to poisoning by malicious agents that can mislead the trained policy. Despite the advantage brought by FL, the vulnerability of Federated Reinforcement Learning (FRL) has not been well-studied before. In this work, we propose the first general framework to characterize FRL poisoning as an optimization problem constrained by a limited budget and design a poisoning protocol that can be applied to policy-based FRL and extended to FRL with actor-critic as a local RL algorithm by training a pair of private and public critics. We also discuss a conventional defense strategy inherited from FL to mitigate this risk. We verify our poisoning effectiveness by conducting extensive experiments targeting mainstream RL algorithms and over various RL OpenAI Gym environments covering a wide range of difficulty levels. Our results show that our proposed defense protocol is successful in most cases but is not robust under complicated environments. Our work provides new insights into the vulnerability of FL in RL training and poses additional challenges for designing robust FRL algorithms. ",

We focus on the tabular episodic learning setting where the algorithm has access to a generative model of the nominal (training) environment around which the uncertainty set is defined. We propose the Robust Phased Value Learning (RPVL) algorithm to solve this problem for the uncertainty sets specified by four different divergences: total variation, chi-square, Kullback-Leibler, and Wasserstein. We show that our algorithm achieves $\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(|\\mathcal{S}||\\mathcal{A}| H^{5})$ sample complexity, which is uniformly better than the existing results by a factor of $|\\mathcal{S}|$, where $|\\mathcal{S}|$ is number of states, $|\\mathcal{A}|$ is the number of actions, and $H$ is the horizon length. We also provide the first-ever sample complexity result for the Wasserstein uncertainty set. Finally, we demonstrate the performance of our algorithm using simulation experiments. ",

When the adjacency matrix has multi-dimensional eigenspaces, it is desirable to base GSP constructions on a particular eigenbasis (the `preferred basis'). In this paper, we provide an explicit and detailed representation-theoretic account for the spectral decomposition of the adjacency matrix of a Cayley graph, which results in a preferred basis. Our method applies to all (not necessarily quasi-Abelian) Cayley graphs, and provides descriptions of eigenvalues and eigenvectors based on the coefficient functions of the representations of the underlying group. Next, we use such bases to build frames that are suitable for developing signal processing on Cayley graphs. These are the Frobenius--Schur frames and Cayley frames, for which we provide a characterization and a practical recipe for their construction. ",

While the definition of community may vary, it is generally accepted that elements of a community should be ``well-connected\". We evaluated clusters generated by the Leiden algorithm and the Iterative K-core (IKC) clustering algorithm for their susceptibility to become disconnected by the deletion of a small number of edges. A striking observation is that for Leiden clustering of real-world networks, except for cases with large resolution parameter values, the majority of clusters do not meet the relatively mild condition we enforce for well-connected clusters. We also constructed a modular pipeline to enable well-connected output clusters that allows a user-specified criterion for a valid community considering cluster size and minimum edge cut size and describe the use of this pipeline on real world and synthetic networks. An interesting trend we observed is that the final clusterings on real-world networks had small node coverage, suggesting that not all nodes in a network belong in communities. ",

    "abstract": "Adversarial attacks on a convolutional neural network (CNN) -- injecting human-imperceptible perturbations into an input image -- could fool a high-performance CNN into making incorrect predictions. The success of adversarial attacks raises serious concerns about the robustness of CNNs, and prevents them from being used in safety-critical applications, such as medical diagnosis and autonomous driving. Our work introduces a visual analytics approach to understanding adversarial attacks by answering two questions: (1) which neurons are more vulnerable to attacks and (2) which image features do these vulnerable neurons capture during the prediction? For the first question, we introduce multiple perturbation-based measures to break down the attacking magnitude into individual CNN neurons and rank the neurons by their vulnerability levels. For the second, we identify image features (e.g., cat ears) that highly stimulate a user-selected neuron to augment and validate the neuron's responsibility. Furthermore, we support an interactive exploration of a large number of neurons by aiding with hierarchical clustering based on the neurons' roles in the prediction. To this end, a visual analytics system is designed to incorporate visual reasoning for interpreting adversarial attacks. We validate the effectiveness of our system through multiple case studies as well as feedback from domain experts. ",

Recently, researchers presented the edge AIGC paradigm, effectively optimize the service latency by distributing AIGC services to edge devices. However, AIGC products are still unprotected and vulnerable to tampering and plagiarization. Moreover, as a kind of online non-fungible digital property, the free circulation of AIGC products is hindered by the lack of trustworthiness in open networks. In this article, for the first time, we present a blockchain-empowered framework to manage the lifecycle of edge AIGC products. Specifically, leveraging fraud proof, we first propose a protocol to protect the ownership and copyright of AIGC, called Proof-of-AIGC. Then, we design an incentive mechanism to guarantee the legitimate and timely executions of the funds-AIGC ownership exchanges among anonymous users. Furthermore, we build a multi-weight subjective logic-based reputation scheme, with which AIGC producers can determine which edge service provider is trustworthy and reliable to handle their services. Through numerical results, the superiority of the proposed approach is demonstrated. Last but not least, we discuss important open directions for further research. ",

Although extensive research has been conducted to address different aspects and challenges of RS, there still exists a gap between academic research and industrial applications.

RS will stay unchanged until the next batch retrain is performed. We frame such RS as Batch Update Recommender Systems (BURS). In reality, they have to face the challenges where RS are expected to be instantly updated with new data streaming in, and generate updated recommendations for current user activities based on the newly arrived data. We frame such RS as Incremental Update Recommender Systems (IURS). In this article, we offer a systematic survey of incremental update for neural recommender systems. We begin the survey by introducing key concepts and formulating the task of IURS. We then illustrate the challenges in IURS compared with traditional BURS. Afterwards, we detail the introduction of existing literature and evaluation issues. We conclude the survey by outlining some prominent open research issues in this area. ",

    "abstract": "Salient object detection in optical remote sensing image (ORSI-SOD) has gradually attracted attention thanks to the development of deep learning (DL) and salient object detection in natural scene image (NSI-SOD). However, NSI and ORSI are different in many aspects, such as large coverage, complex background, and large differences in target types and scales. Therefore, a new dedicated method is needed for ORSI-SOD. In addition, existing methods do not pay sufficient attention to the boundary of the object, and the completeness of the final saliency map still needs improvement. To address these issues, we propose a novel method called Dual Feedback Attention Framework via Boundary-Aware Auxiliary and Progressive Semantic Optimization (DFA-BASO). First, Boundary Protection Calibration (BPC) module is proposed to reduce the loss of edge position information during forward propagation and suppress noise in low-level features. Second, a Dual Feature Feedback Complementary (DFFC) module is proposed based on BPC module. It aggregates boundary-semantic dual features and provides effective feedback to coordinate features across different layers. Finally, a Strong Semantic Feedback Refinement (SSFR) module is proposed to obtain more complete saliency maps. This module further refines feature representation and eliminates feature differences through a unique feedback mechanism. Extensive experiments on two public datasets show that DFA-BASO outperforms 15 state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, this paper strongly demonstrates the true contribution of DFA-BASO to ORSI-SOD by in-depth analysis of the visualization figure.

While several framework had been proposed to ensure robustness of machine learning model against adversarial attack, some of which includes adversarial training algorithm. There is still the pitfall that adversarial training algorithm tends to cause disparity in accuracy and robustness among different group. Our research is aimed at using adversarial sampling to test for fairness in the prediction of deep neural network model across different classes or categories of image in a given dataset. We successfully demonstrated a new method of ensuring fairness across various group of input in deep neural network classifier. We trained our neural network model on the original image, and without training our model on the perturbed or attacked image. When we feed the adversarial samplings to our model, it was able to predict the original category/ class of the image the adversarial sample belongs to. We also introduced and used the separation of concern concept from software engineering whereby there is an additional standalone filter layer that filters perturbed image by heavily removing the noise or attack before automatically passing it to the network for classification, we were able to have accuracy of 93.3%. Cifar-10 dataset have ten categories of dataset, and so, in order to account for fairness, we applied our hypothesis across each categories of dataset and were able to get a consistent result and accuracy.

Machine learning methods with finer supervision strategies have been applied to boost and guide the relaxation process of an atomic system and better predict its properties at the equilibrium state. In this paper, we present a novel graph neural network (GNN) supervision and prediction strategy DR-Label. The method enhances the supervision signal, reduces the multiplicity of solutions in edge representation, and encourages the model to provide node predictions that are graph structural variation robust. DR-Label first Deconstructs finer-grained equilibrium state information to the model by projecting the node-level supervision signal to each edge. Reversely, the model Reconstructs a more robust equilibrium state prediction by transforming edge-level predictions to node-level with a sphere-fitting algorithm. The DR-Label strategy was applied to three radically distinct models, each of which displayed consistent performance enhancements. Based on the DR-Label strategy, we further proposed DRFormer, which achieved a new state-of-the-art performance on the Open Catalyst 2020 (OC20) dataset and the Cu-based single-atom-alloyed CO adsorption (SAA) dataset. We expect that our work will highlight crucial steps for the development of a more accurate model in equilibrium state property prediction of a catalysis system. ",

However, the spatial attribute of vehicle movement behavior has been overlooked, resulting in incomplete information utilization. To bridge this gap, we put forward for the first time a hierarchical trajectory prediction structure using the capsule neural network (CapsNet) with three sequential components. First, the geographic information is transformed into a grid map presentation, describing vehicle mobility distribution spatially and temporally. Second, CapsNet serves as the core model to embed local temporal and global spatial correlation through hierarchical capsules. Finally, extensive experiments conducted on actual taxi mobility data collected in Porto city (Portugal) and Singapore show that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. ",

In this paper, we propose a kernel basis attention (KBA) module, which introduces learnable kernel bases to model representative image patterns for spatial information aggregation. Different kernel bases are trained to model different local structures. At each spatial location, they are linearly and adaptively fused by predicted pixel-wise coefficients to obtain aggregation weights.

Here, we present a new approach to approximating the solution to physical systems - physics-informed neural networks. The concept of artificial neural networks is introduced, the objective function is defined, and optimisation strategies are discussed.

    "abstract": "Is it possible for machines to think like humans? And if it is, how should we go about teaching them to do so? As early as 1950, Alan Turing stated that we ought to teach machines in the way of teaching a child. Reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) has emerged as a strong candidate toward allowing agents to learn from human feedback in a naturalistic manner. RLHF is distinct from traditional reinforcement learning as it provides feedback from a human teacher in addition to a reward signal. It has been catapulted into public view by multiple high-profile AI applications, including OpenAI's ChatGPT, DeepMind's Sparrow, and Anthropic's Claude. These highly capable chatbots are already overturning our understanding of how AI interacts with humanity. The wide applicability and burgeoning success of RLHF strongly motivate the need to evaluate its social impacts. In light of recent developments, this paper considers an important question: can RLHF be developed and used without negatively affecting human societies? Our objectives are threefold: to provide a systematic study of the social effects of RLHF; to identify key social and ethical issues of RLHF; and to discuss social impacts for stakeholders. Although text-based applications of RLHF have received much attention, it is crucial to consider when evaluating its social implications the diverse range of areas to which it may be deployed. We describe seven primary ways in which RLHF-based technologies will affect society by positively transforming human experiences with AI. This paper ultimately proposes that RLHF has potential to net positively impact areas of misinformation, AI value-alignment, bias, AI access, cross-cultural dialogue, industry, and workforce. As RLHF raises concerns that echo those of existing AI technologies, it will be important for all to be aware and intentional in the adoption of RLHF. ",

Social cues are a form of communication (i.e., information flow) between people. In this paper, a framework is introduced to detect and analyse social cues and information transfer directionality using an information-theoretic measure, namely, transfer entropy. We demonstrate the framework in three settings involving social interactions between humans: object-handover, group-joining and person-following. Results show that transfer entropy can identify information flows between agents, when and where they occur, and their relative strength. For instance, in a person-following scenario, we find that head orientation of a predictor is particularly informative, and the different times and locations that this is used to convey information to a leader influences their behaviour. Potential applications of the framework include information flow or social cue analysis for interactive robot design, or socially-aware robot planning. ",

Surprisingly, however, there is still no clear understanding of the relation between these two augmentation schemes. Here we propose a novel family of positional encoding schemes which draws a link between the above two approaches and improves over both. The new approach, named Random Feature Propagation (RFP), is inspired by the power iteration method and its generalizations. It concatenates several intermediate steps of an iterative algorithm for computing the dominant eigenvectors of a propagation matrix, starting from random node features. Notably, these propagation steps are based on graph-dependent propagation operators that can be either predefined or learned. We explore the theoretical and empirical benefits of RFP. First, we provide theoretical justifications for using random features, for incorporating early propagation steps, and for using multiple random initializations. Then, we empirically demonstrate that RFP significantly outperforms both spectral PE and random features in multiple node classification and graph classification benchmarks. ",

Even in the case of malicious deepfake, the privacy of the users is still protected. To achieve this, we introduce an optimization-based editing method that utilizes GAN inversion to discourage deepfake models from generating similar scapegoats.

    "abstract": "To deal with the explosive growth of mobile traffic, millimeter-wave (mmWave) communications with abundant bandwidth resources have been applied to vehicular networks. As mmWave signal is sensitive to blockage, we introduce the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-aided two-way relaying system for vehicular connection enhancement and coverage expansion. How to improve transmission efficiency and to reduce latency time in such a dynamic scenario is a challenging problem. In this paper, we formulate the joint optimization problem of relay selection and transmission scheduling, aiming to reduce transmission time while meeting the throughput requirements. To solve this problem, two schemes are proposed. The first one is the random relay selection with concurrent scheduling (RCS), a low-complexity algorithm implemented in two steps. The second one is the joint relay selection with dynamic scheduling (JRDS), which fully avoids relay contentions and exploits potential concurrent ability, to obtain further performance enhancement over RCS. Through extensive simulations under different environments with various flow numbers and vehicle speeds, we demonstrate that both RCS and JRDS schemes outperform the existing schemes significantly in terms of transmission time and network throughput. We also analyze the impact of threshold selection on achievable performance. ",

    "abstract": "Anomaly detection for the Internet of Things (IoT) is a major intelligent service required by many fields, including intrusion detection, device-activity analysis, and security supervision. However, the heterogeneous distribution of data and resource-constrained end nodes present challenges for existing anomaly detection models. Due to the advantages of flexible deployment and multi-dimensional resources, high altitude platform stations (HAPSs) and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), which are important components of vertical heterogeneous networks (VHetNets), have significant potential for sensing, computing, storage, and communication applications in ubiquitous IoT systems. In this paper, we propose a novel VHetNet-enabled asynchronous federated learning (AFL) framework to enable decentralized UAVs to collaboratively train a global anomaly detection model. In the VHetNet-enabled AFL framework, a HAPS operates as a central aerial server, and the local models trained in UAVs are uploaded to the HAPS for global aggregation due to its wide coverage and strong storage and computation capabilities. We introduce a UAV selection strategy into the AFL framework to prevent UAVs with low local model quality and large energy consumption from affecting the learning efficiency and detection accuracy of the global model. To ensure the security of transmissions between UAVs and the HAPS, we add designed noise to local model parameters in UAVs to achieve differential privacy. Moreover, we propose a compound-action actor-critic (CA2C)-based joint device association, UAV selection, and UAV trajectory planning algorithm to further enhance the overall federated execution efficiency and detection model accuracy. Extensive experimental evaluation on a real-world dataset demonstrates that the proposed algorithm can achieve high detection accuracy with short federated execution time and low energy consumption.

    "abstract": "Angle-constrained formation control has attracted much attention from control community due to the advantage that inter-edge angles are invariant under uniform translations, rotations, and scalings of the whole formation. However, almost all the existing angle-constrained formation control methods are limited to undirected triangulated sensing graphs. In this paper, we propose an angle-constrained formation control approach under a Leader-First Follower sensing architecture, where the sensing graph is directed and non-triangulated. Both shape stabilization and maneuver control are achieved under arbitrary initial configurations of the formation. During the formation process, the control input of each agent is based on relative positions from its neighbors measured in the local reference frame and wireless communications among agents are not required. We show that the proposed distributed formation controller ensures global exponential stability of the desired formation for an nagent system. Furthermore, it is interesting to see that the convergence rate of the whole formation is solely determined by partial specific angles within the target formation. The effectiveness of the proposed control algorithms is illustrated by carrying out experiments both in simulation environments and on real robotic platforms. ",

However, in low-latency scenarios, most existing neural video compression frameworks usually use the previous one frame as reference. Or a few frameworks which use the previous multiple frames as reference only adopt a simple multi-reference frames propagation mechanism. In this paper, we present a more reasonable multi-reference frames propagation mechanism for neural video compression, called butterfly multi-reference frame propagation mechanism (Butterfly), which allows a more effective feature fusion of multi-reference frames. By this, we can generate more accurate temporal context conditional prior for Contextual Coding Module. Besides, when the number of decoded frames does not meet the required number of reference frames, we duplicate the nearest reference frame to achieve the requirement, which is better than duplicating the furthest one. Experiment results show that our method can significantly outperform the previous state-of-the-art (SOTA), and our neural codec can achieve -7.6% bitrate save on HEVC Class D dataset when compares with our base single-reference frame model with the same compression configuration.

    "abstract": "Reliable confidence estimation for the predictions is important in many safety-critical applications. However, modern deep neural networks are often overconfident for their incorrect predictions. Recently, many calibration methods have been proposed to alleviate the overconfidence problem. With calibrated confidence, a primary and practical purpose is to detect misclassification errors by filtering out low-confidence predictions (known as failure prediction). In this paper, we find a general, widely-existed but actually-neglected phenomenon that most confidence calibration methods are useless or harmful for failure prediction. We investigate this problem and reveal that popular confidence calibration methods often lead to worse confidence separation between correct and incorrect samples, making it more difficult to decide whether to trust a prediction or not. Finally, inspired by the natural connection between flat minima and confidence separation, we propose a simple hypothesis: flat minima is beneficial for failure prediction. We verify this hypothesis via extensive experiments and further boost the performance by combining two different flat minima techniques.

This work describes the novel approaches developed by our team, Revenger, to solve these problems. Methods: PCGs were resampled to 1000 Hz, then filtered with a Butterworth band-pass filter of order 3, cutoff frequencies 25 - 400 Hz, and z-score normalized. We used the multi-task learning (MTL) method via hard parameter sharing to train one neural network (NN) model for all the Challenge tasks. We performed neural architecture searching among a set of network backbones, including multi-branch convolutional neural networks (CNNs), SE-ResNets, TResNets, simplified wav2vec2, etc. Based on a stratified splitting of the subjects, 20% of the public data was left out as a validation set for model selection. The AdamW optimizer was adopted, along with the OneCycle scheduler, to optimize the model weights. Results: Our murmur detection classifier received a weighted accuracy score of 0.736 (ranked 14th out of 40 teams) and a Challenge cost score of 12944 (ranked 19th out of 39 teams) on the hidden validation set.

Its main interest is to provide a low-level face representation that can be used to assist higher level affective computing tasks learning. Yet, it is a challenging task. Indeed, the available databases display limited face variability and are imbalanced toward neutral expressions. Furthermore, as AU involve subtle face movements they are difficult to annotate so that some of the few provided datapoints may be mislabeled. In this work, we aim at exploiting label smoothing ability to mitigate noisy examples impact by reducing confidence [1]. However, applying label smoothing as it is may aggravate imbalance-based pre-existing under-confidence issue and degrade performance. To circumvent this issue, we propose Robin Hood Label Smoothing (RHLS). RHLS principle is to restrain label smoothing confidence reduction to the majority class. In that extent, it alleviates both the imbalance-based over-confidence issue and the negative impact of noisy majority class examples. From an experimental standpoint, we show that RHLS provides a free performance improvement in AU detection. In particular, by applying it on top of a modern multi-task baseline we get promising results on BP4D and outperform state-of-the-art methods on DISFA. ",

However, the inevitable noise problem in pseudo-labels significantly degrades the performance of SSOD methods. Recent advances effectively alleviate the classification noise in SSOD, while the localization noise which is a non-negligible part of SSOD is not well-addressed. In this paper, we analyse the localization noise from the generation and learning phases, and propose two strategies, namely pseudo-label correction and noise-unaware learning. For pseudo-label correction, we introduce a multi-round refining method and a multi-vote weighting method. The former iteratively refines the pseudo boxes to improve the stability of predictions, while the latter smoothly self-corrects pseudo boxes by weighing the scores of surrounding jittered boxes. For noise-unaware learning, we introduce a loss weight function that is negatively correlated with the Intersection over Union (IoU) in the regression task, which pulls the predicted boxes closer to the object and improves localization accuracy. Our proposed method, Pseudo-label Correction and Learning (PCL), is extensively evaluated on the MS COCO and PASCAL VOC benchmarks. On MS COCO, PCL outperforms the supervised baseline by 12.16, 12.11, and 9.57 mAP and the recent SOTA (SoftTeacher) by 3.90, 2.54, and 2.43 mAP under 1\\%, 5\\%, and 10\\% labeling ratios, respectively.

Despite fast optimization NeRF variants have been proposed based on the explicit dense or hash grid features, their effectivenesses are mainly demonstrated in object-scale scene representation. In this paper, we point out that the low feature resolution in explicit representation is the bottleneck for large-scale unbounded scene representation. To address this problem, we introduce a new and efficient hybrid feature representation for NeRF that fuses the 3D hash-grids and high-resolution 2D dense plane features. Compared with the dense-grid representation, the resolution of a dense 2D plane can be scaled up more efficiently. Based on this hybrid representation, we propose a fast optimization NeRF variant, called GP-NeRF, that achieves better rendering results while maintaining a compact model size. Extensive experiments on multiple large-scale unbounded scene datasets show that our model can converge in 1.5 hours using a single GPU while achieving results comparable to or even better than the existing method that requires about one day's training with 8 GPUs.

Inspired by the recent success of imitation attacks in stealing computer vision and natural language models, this work launches the first imitation attack on LLCMs: by querying a target LLCM with carefully-designed queries and collecting the outputs, the adversary can train an imitation model that manifests close behavior with the target LLCM. We systematically investigate the effectiveness of launching imitation attacks under different query schemes and different LLCM tasks. We also design novel methods to polish the LLCM outputs, resulting in an effective imitation training process. We summarize our findings and provide lessons harvested in this study that can help better depict the attack surface of LLCMs. Our research contributes to the growing body of knowledge on imitation attacks and defenses in deep neural models, particularly in the domain of code related tasks.

The planner searches the graphs for view sequences with the highest accumulated information gain, allowing for efficient pepper plant monitoring while minimizing occlusions. The generated view poses aim at both sufficiently covering already detected and discovering new fruits. The graph and the corresponding best view pose sequence are computed with a limited horizon and are adaptively updated in fixed time intervals as the system gathers new information. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through simulated and real-world experiments using a robotic arm equipped with an RGB-D camera and mounted on a trolley. As the experimental results show, our planner produces view pose sequences to systematically cover the crops and leads to increased fruit coverage when given a limited time in comparison to a state-of-the-art single next-best view planner.

Recently, the large models pre-trained on diverse data demonstrate unprecedented robustness to various distribution shifts. However, fine-tuning on these models can lead to a trade-off between in-distribution (ID) performance and out-of-distribution (OOD) robustness. Existing methods for tackling this trade-off do not explicitly address the OOD robustness problem. In this paper, based on causal analysis on the aforementioned problems, we propose a novel fine-tuning method, which use masked images as counterfactual samples that help improving the robustness of the fine-tuning model. Specifically, we mask either the semantics-related or semantics-unrelated patches of the images based on class activation map to break the spurious correlation, and refill the masked patches with patches from other images. The resulting counterfactual samples are used in feature-based distillation with the pre-trained model. Extensive experiments verify that regularizing the fine-tuning with the proposed masked images can achieve a better trade-off between ID and OOD, surpassing previous methods on the OOD performance.

    "abstract": "Designing auctions to incentivize buyers to invite new buyers via their social connections is a new trend in mechanism design. The challenge is that buyers are competitors and we need to design proper incentives for them to invite each other. For selling a single item, many interesting mechanisms have been proposed. However, all the mechanisms require the seller or a third party to be trustworthy to execute the mechanisms. In addition, the owner of the mechanism will know all the connections of the network after the execution, which poses a potential privacy issue. Hence, distributed mechanisms to avoid the privacy issue are more appealing in practice. Therefore, in this paper, we propose the first distributed mechanism in social networks without revealing buyers' private connections to anyone, and it achieves complete decentralization that does not rely on any trustworthy third party. Moreover, the centralized reduction of our mechanism also offers a novel way to compute players' contributions compared to the existing solutions. ",

    "abstract": "Keyword spotting (KWS) in historical documents is an important tool for the initial exploration of digitized collections. Nowadays, the most efficient KWS methods are relying on machine learning techniques that require a large amount of annotated training data. However, in the case of historical manuscripts, there is a lack of annotated corpus for training. To handle the data scarcity issue, we investigate the merits of the self-supervised learning to extract useful representations of the input data without relying on human annotations and then using these representations in the downstream task. We propose ST-KeyS, a masked auto-encoder model based on vision transformers where the pretraining stage is based on the mask-and-predict paradigm, without the need of labeled data. In the fine-tuning stage, the pre-trained encoder is integrated into a siamese neural network model that is fine-tuned to improve feature embedding from the input images. We further improve the image representation using pyramidal histogram of characters (PHOC) embedding to create and exploit an intermediate representation of images based on text attributes. In an exhaustive experimental evaluation on three widely used benchmark datasets (Botany, Alvermann Konzilsprotokolle and George Washington), the proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods trained on the same datasets.

    "abstract": "Important research efforts have focused on the design and training of neural networks with a controlled Lipschitz constant. The goal is to increase and sometimes guarantee the robustness against adversarial attacks. Recent promising techniques draw inspirations from different backgrounds to design 1-Lipschitz neural networks, just to name a few: convex potential layers derive from the discretization of continuous dynamical systems, Almost-Orthogonal-Layer proposes a tailored method for matrix rescaling. However, it is today important to consider the recent and promising contributions in the field under a common theoretical lens to better design new and improved layers. This paper introduces a novel algebraic perspective unifying various types of 1-Lipschitz neural networks, including the ones previously mentioned, along with methods based on orthogonality and spectral methods. Interestingly, we show that many existing techniques can be derived and generalized via finding analytical solutions of a common semidefinite programming (SDP) condition. We also prove that AOL biases the scaled weight to the ones which are close to the set of orthogonal matrices in a certain mathematical manner. Moreover, our algebraic condition, combined with the Gershgorin circle theorem, readily leads to new and diverse parameterizations for 1-Lipschitz network layers. Our approach, called SDP-based Lipschitz Layers (SLL), allows us to design non-trivial yet efficient generalization of convex potential layers. Finally, the comprehensive set of experiments on image classification shows that SLLs outperform previous approaches on certified robust accuracy.

In this article, we apply the metamorphic testing technique to detect smart contract vulnerabilities. Based on the anomalies we observed in vulnerable smart contracts, we define five metamorphic relations to detect abnormal gas consumption and account interaction inconsistency of the target smart contract. Through dynamically executing transactions and checking the final violation of metamorphic relations, we determine whether a smart contract is vulnerable. We evaluate our approach on a benchmark of 67 manually annotated smart contracts. The experimental results show that our approach achieves a higher detection rate (TPR, true positive rate) with a lower misreport rate (FDR, false discovery rate) than the other three state-of-the-art tools. These results further suggest that metamorphic testing is a promising method for detecting smart contract vulnerabilities. ",

Despite great success in low-dimensional linear systems, it has been observed that these approaches overly exploit easier-to-fit samples, thus inevitably learning spurious edges. Worse still, inherent mostly in these methods the common homogeneity assumption can be easily violated, due to the widespread existence of heterogeneous data in the real world, resulting in performance vulnerability when noise distributions vary. We propose a simple yet effective model-agnostic framework to boost causal discovery performance by dynamically learning the adaptive weights for the Reweighted Score function, ReScore for short, where the weights tailor quantitatively to the importance degree of each sample. Intuitively, we leverage the bilevel optimization scheme to \\wx{alternately train a standard DAG learner and reweight samples -- that is, upweight the samples the learner fails to fit and downweight the samples that the learner easily extracts the spurious information from. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets are carried out to validate the effectiveness of ReScore. We observe consistent and significant boosts in structure learning performance. Furthermore, we visualize that ReScore concurrently mitigates the influence of spurious edges and generalizes to heterogeneous data. Finally, we perform the theoretical analysis to guarantee the structure identifiability and the weight adaptive properties of ReScore in linear systems.

However, current methods in continuous sign language recognition (CSLR) usually process frames independently, thus failing to capture cross-frame trajectories to effectively identify a sign. To handle this limitation, we propose correlation network (CorrNet) to explicitly capture and leverage body trajectories across frames to identify signs. In specific, a correlation module is first proposed to dynamically compute correlation maps between the current frame and adjacent frames to identify trajectories of all spatial patches. An identification module is then presented to dynamically emphasize the body trajectories within these correlation maps. As a result, the generated features are able to gain an overview of local temporal movements to identify a sign. Thanks to its special attention on body trajectories, CorrNet achieves new state-of-the-art accuracy on four large-scale datasets, i.e., PHOENIX14, PHOENIX14-T, CSL-Daily, and CSL. A comprehensive comparison with previous spatial-temporal reasoning methods verifies the effectiveness of CorrNet. Visualizations demonstrate the effects of CorrNet on emphasizing human body trajectories across adjacent frames. ",

Can a graphic visualisation of complex argumentation enable a more critical interpretation of the arguments? This study focuses on analysing the impact of argumentation graphs (AGs) compared with regular texts for supporting argument interpretation. We found that AGs outperformed the extrinsic metrics throughout most UEQ scales as well as the NASA-TLX workload in all the terms but not in temporal or physical demand. The AG model was liked by a more significant number of participants, despite the fact that both the text-based and AG models yielded comparable outcomes in the critical interpretation in terms of working memory and altering participants decisions. The interpretation process involves reference to argumentation schemes (linked to critical questions (CQs)) in AGs. Interestingly, we found that the participants chose more CQs (using argument schemes in AGs) when they were less familiar with the argument topics, making AG schemes on some scales (relatively) supportive of the interpretation process. Therefore, AGs were considered to deliver a more critical approach to argument interpretation, especially with unfamiliar topics. Based on the 25 participants conducted in this study, it appears that AG has demonstrated an overall positive effect on the argument interpretation process. ",

One prominent methodology are Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) which can solve both forward and inverse problems. In the paper at hand, full waveform inversion is the considered inverse problem. The performance of PINNs is compared against classical adjoint optimization, focusing on three key aspects: the forward-solver, the neural network Ansatz for the inverse field, and the sensitivity computation for the gradient-based minimization. Starting from PINNs, each of these key aspects is adapted individually until the classical adjoint optimization emerges. It is shown that it is beneficial to use the neural network only for the discretization of the unknown material field, where the neural network produces reconstructions without oscillatory artifacts as typically encountered in classical full waveform inversion approaches. Due to this finding, a hybrid approach is proposed. It exploits both the efficient gradient computation with the continuous adjoint method as well as the neural network Ansatz for the unknown material field. This new hybrid approach outperforms Physics-Informed Neural Networks and the classical adjoint optimization in settings of two and three-dimensional examples. ",

But many optimization tasks are neither i.i.d. nor fully adversarial, which makes it of fundamental interest to get a better theoretical understanding of the world between these extremes. In this work we establish novel regret bounds for online convex optimization in a setting that interpolates between stochastic i.i.d. and fully adversarial losses. By exploiting smoothness of the expected losses, these bounds replace a dependence on the maximum gradient length by the variance of the gradients, which was previously known only for linear losses. In addition, they weaken the i.i.d. assumption by allowing, for example, adversarially poisoned rounds, which were previously considered in the related expert and bandit settings. In the fully i.i.d. case, our regret bounds match the rates one would expect from results in stochastic acceleration, and we also recover the optimal stochastically accelerated rates via online-to-batch conversion. In the fully adversarial case our bounds gracefully deteriorate to match the minimax regret. We further provide lower bounds showing that our regret upper bounds are tight for all intermediate regimes in terms of the stochastic variance and the adversarial variation of the loss gradients. ",

The graphs generation is designed as a sequence of coarse-to-fine generative models allowing for parallel generation of all sub-structures, resulting in a high degree of scalability. Furthermore, we model the output distribution of edges with a more expressive multinomial distribution and derive a recursive factorization for this distribution, making it a suitable choice for graph generative models.

In particular, we propose a general reinforcement learning-based backdoor attack framework where the attacker first trains a (non-myopic) attack policy using a simulator built upon its local data and common knowledge on the FL system, which is then applied during actual FL training.

However, previous studies have highlighted the susceptibility of such models to backdoor attacks. Specifically, when training on backdoored examples, CLIP learns spurious correlations between the embedded backdoor trigger and the target label, aligning their representations in the joint embedding space. With injecting only a few poisoned examples e.g., 75 examples in the 3M pretraining data, the model's behavior can be significantly manipulated, thus making it hard to detect or unlearn such correlations. To address this issue, we propose CleanCLIP, a finetuning framework that weakens the learned spurious associations introduced by backdoor attacks by re-aligning the representations for individual modalities independently. CleanCLIP can be employed for both unsupervised finetuning on paired image-text data and for supervised finetuning on labeled image data. We demonstrate that unsupervised finetuning with a combination of multimodal contrastive and unimodal self-supervised objectives for individual modalities can significantly reduce the impact of the backdoor attack. Additionally, supervised finetuning on task-specific labeled data of the individual modality, such as image data, removes the backdoor trigger from the CLIP vision encoder. Empirically, we show that CleanCLIP maintains model performance on benign examples while mitigating the impact of a range of backdoor attacks on multimodal contrastive learning. ",

Symbolic systems commonly achieve data efficient generalization by exploiting modularity to benefit from local and discrete features of a representation. These features allow symbolic programs to be improved one module at a time and to experience combinatorial growth in the values they can successfully process. However, it is difficult to design components that can be used to form symbolic abstractions and which are highly-overparametrized like neural networks, as the adjustment of parameters makes the semantics of modules unstable. I present Graph-based Symbolically Synthesized Neural Networks (G-SSNNs), a form of neural network whose topology and parameters are informed by the output of a symbolic program. I demonstrate that by developing symbolic abstractions at a population level, and applying gradient-based optimization to such neural models at an individual level, I can elicit reliable patterns of improved generalization with small quantities of data known to contain local and discrete features. The paradigm embodied by G-SSNNs offers a route towards the communal development of compact and composable abstractions which can be flexibly repurposed for a variety of tasks and high-dimensional media. In future work, I hope to pursue these benefits by exploring more ambitious G-SSNN designs based on more complex classes of symbolic programs.

The framework leads to an explainable and generalizable trust-threshold defense policy.

    "title": "Efficient Skill Acquisition for Complex Manipulation Tasks in Obstructed  Environments",
    "abstract": "Data efficiency in robotic skill acquisition is crucial for operating robots in varied small-batch assembly settings. To operate in such environments, robots must have robust obstacle avoidance and versatile goal conditioning acquired from only a few simple demonstrations. Existing approaches, however, fall short of these requirements. Deep reinforcement learning (RL) enables a robot to learn complex manipulation tasks but is often limited to small task spaces in the real world due to sample inefficiency and safety concerns. Motion planning (MP) can generate collision-free paths in obstructed environments, but cannot solve complex manipulation tasks and requires goal states often specified by a user or object-specific pose estimator. In this work, we propose a system for efficient skill acquisition that leverages an object-centric generative model (OCGM) for versatile goal identification to specify a goal for MP combined with RL to solve complex manipulation tasks in obstructed environments. Specifically, OCGM enables one-shot target object identification and re-identification in new scenes, allowing MP to guide the robot to the target object while avoiding obstacles. This is combined with a skill transition network, which bridges the gap between terminal states of MP and feasible start states of a sample-efficient RL policy. The experiments demonstrate that our OCGM-based one-shot goal identification provides competitive accuracy to other baseline approaches and that our modular framework outperforms competitive baselines, including a state-of-the-art RL algorithm, by a significant margin for complex manipulation tasks in obstructed environments.

    "abstract": "Following the invasion of Ukraine, the US, UK, and EU governments--among others--sanctioned oligarchs close to Putin. This approach has come under scrutiny, as evidence has emerged of the oligarchs' successful evasion of these punishments. To address this problem, we analyze the role of an overlooked but highly influential group: the secretive professional intermediaries who create and administer the oligarchs' offshore financial empires. Drawing on the Offshore Leaks Database provided by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ), we examine the ties linking offshore expert advisors (lawyers, accountants, and other wealth management professionals) to ultra-high-net-worth individuals from four countries: Russia, China, the United States, and Hong Kong. We find that resulting nation-level \"oligarch networks\" share a scale-free structure characterized by heterogeneity of heavy-tailed degree distributions of wealth managers; however, network topologies diverge across clients from democratic versus autocratic regimes. While generally robust, scale-free networks are fragile when targeted by attacks on highly-connected nodes. Our \"knock-out\" experiments pinpoint this vulnerability to the small group of wealth managers themselves, suggesting that sanctioning these professional intermediaries may be more effective and efficient in disrupting dark finance flows than sanctions on their wealthy clients. This vulnerability is especially pronounced amongst Russian oligarchs, who concentrate their offshore business in a handful of boutique wealth management firms. The distinctive patterns we identify suggest a new approach to sanctions, focused on expert intermediaries to disrupt the finances and alliances of their wealthy clients. More generally, our research contributes to the larger body of work on complexity science and the structures of secrecy. ",

    "abstract": "Subgraph-based graph representation learning (SGRL) has recently emerged as a powerful tool in many prediction tasks on graphs due to its advantages in model expressiveness and generalization ability. Most previous SGRL models face computational issues associated with the high cost of extracting subgraphs for each training or testing query. Recently, SUREL has been proposed as a new framework to accelerate SGRL, which samples random walks offline and joins these walks as subgraphs online for prediction. Due to the reusability of sampled walks across different queries, SUREL achieves state-of-the-art performance in both scalability and prediction accuracy. However, SUREL still suffers from high computational overhead caused by node redundancy in sampled walks. In this work, we propose a novel framework SUREL+ that upgrades SUREL by using node sets instead of walks to represent subgraphs. This set-based representation avoids node duplication by definition, but the sizes of node sets can be irregular. To address this issue, we design a dedicated sparse data structure to efficiently store and fast index node sets, and provide a specialized operator to join them in parallel batches. SUREL+ is modularized to support multiple types of set samplers, structural features, and neural encoders to complement the loss of structural information due to the reduction from walks to sets. Extensive experiments have been performed to validate SUREL+ in the prediction tasks of links, relation types, and higher-order patterns. SUREL+ achieves 3-11$\\times$ speedups of SUREL while maintaining comparable or even better prediction performance; compared to other SGRL baselines, SUREL+ achieves $\\sim$20$\\times$ speedups and significantly improves the prediction accuracy.

To this end, we study weight decay regularized training problems of deep neural networks with threshold activations. We first show that regularized deep threshold network training problems can be equivalently formulated as a standard convex optimization problem, which parallels the LASSO method, provided that the last hidden layer width exceeds a certain threshold. We also derive a simplified convex optimization formulation when the dataset can be shattered at a certain layer of the network.

The installed capacity of battery energy storage system (BESS), mainly the lithium ion batteries are increasing significantly in recent years. However, the battery degradation cannot be accurately quantified and integrated into energy management system with existing heuristic battery degradation models. This paper proposed a hierarchical deep learning based battery degradation quantification (HDL-BDQ) model to quantify the battery degradation given scheduled BESS daily operations. Particularly, two sequential and cohesive deep neural networks are proposed to accurately estimate the degree of degradation using inputs of battery operational profiles and it can significantly outperform existing fixed or linear rate based degradation models as well as single-stage deep neural models. Training results show the high accuracy of the proposed system. Moreover, a learning and optimization decoupled algorithm is implemented to strategically take advantage of the proposed HDL-BDQ model in optimization-based look-ahead scheduling (LAS) problems. Case studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed HDL-BDQ model in LAS of a microgrid testbed. ",

The proposed mask estimation network incorporates three different types of blocks for aggregating information in the spatial, spectral, and temporal dimensions. It utilizes a spectral transformer with a modified feed-forward network and a temporal conformer with sequential dilated convolutions. The use of dense blocks and transformers dedicated to the three different characteristics of audio signals enables more comprehensive enhancement in noisy and reverberant environments. The remarkable performance of DeFT-AN over state-of-the-art multichannel models is demonstrated based on two popular noisy and reverberant datasets in terms of various metrics for speech quality and intelligibility.

To address this challenge, we design a cooperative learning (CL) framework which manages computation and coordination strategies of the CP and APs using dedicated deep neural network (DNN) modules. To build a versatile learning structure, the proposed CL is carefully designed such that its forward pass calculations are independent of the number of APs.

    "abstract": "The analytic inference, e.g. predictive distribution being in closed form, may be an appealing benefit for machine learning practitioners when they treat wide neural networks as Gaussian process in Bayesian setting. The realistic widths, however, are finite and cause weak deviation from the Gaussianity under which partial marginalization of random variables in a model is straightforward. On the basis of multivariate Edgeworth expansion, we propose a non-Gaussian distribution in differential form to model a finite set of outputs from a random neural network, and derive the corresponding marginal and conditional properties. Thus, we are able to derive the non-Gaussian posterior distribution in Bayesian regression task. In addition, in the bottlenecked deep neural networks, a weight space representation of deep Gaussian process, the non-Gaussianity is investigated through the marginal kernel. ",

    "abstract": "Topological magnetic textures observed in experiments can, in principle, be predicted by theoretical calculations and numerical simulations. However, such calculations are, in general, hampered by difficulties in distinguishing between local and global energy minima. This becomes particularly problematic for magnetic materials that allow for a multitude of topological charges. Finding solutions to such problems by means of classical numerical methods can be challenging because either a good initial guess or a gigantic amount of random sampling is required. In this study, we demonstrate an efficient way to identify those metastable configurations by leveraging the power of gradient descent-based optimization within the framework of a feedforward neural network combined with a heuristic meta-search, which is driven by a random perturbation of the neural network's input. We exemplify the power of the method by an analysis of the Pd/Fe/Ir(111) system, an experimentally well characterized system. ",

While recent works have made important advances in the study of the optimization problem for overparametrized low-rank matrix approximation, much emphasis has been placed on discriminative settings and the square loss. In contrast, our model considers another interesting type of loss and connects with the generative setting. We characterize the critical points and minimizers of the Bures-Wasserstein distance over the space of rank-bounded matrices. For low-rank matrices the Hessian of this loss can theoretically blow up, which creates challenges to analyze convergence of optimizaton methods. We establish convergence results for gradient flow using a smooth perturbative version of the loss and convergence results for finite step size gradient descent under certain assumptions on the initial weights.

To this end, the usual description of convolutional layers with convolution kernels, i.e., the impulse responses of linear filters, is realized in state space as a linear time-invariant 2-D system. The overall convolutional Neural Network composed of convolutional layers and nonlinear activation functions is then viewed as a 2-D version of a Lur'e system, i.e., a linear dynamical system interconnected with static nonlinear components. One benefit of this 2-D Lur'e system perspective on CNNs is that we can use robust control theory much more efficiently for Lipschitz constant estimation than previously possible. ",

With the aging population, there has been much interest in automated methods for cognitive impairment detection. One approach that has attracted attention in recent years is AD detection through spontaneous speech. While the results are promising, it is not certain whether the learned speech features can be generalized across languages. To fill this gap, the ADReSS-M challenge was organized. This paper presents our submission to this ICASSP-2023 Signal Processing Grand Challenge (SPGC). The model was trained on 228 English samples of a picture description task and was transferred to Greek using only 8 samples. We obtained an accuracy of 82.6% for AD detection, a root-mean-square error of 4.345 for cognitive score prediction, and ranked 2nd place in the competition out of 24 competitors. ",

The NNNH approach models the individual kernels and the base intensity of the nonlinear Hawkes process using feed forward neural networks and jointly calibrates the parameters of the networks by maximizing the log-likelihood function. We utilize Stochastic Gradient Descent to search for the optimal parameters and propose an unbiased estimator for the gradient, as well as an efficient computation method. We demonstrate the flexibility and accuracy of our method through numerical experiments on both simulated and real-world data, and compare it with state-of-the-art methods. Our results highlight the effectiveness of the NNNH method in accurately capturing the complexities of nonlinear Hawkes processes. ",

    "abstract": "In a large variety of systems (biological, physical, social etc.), synchronization occurs when different oscillating objects tune their rhythm when they interact with each other. The different underlying network defining the connectivity properties among these objects drives the global dynamics in a complex fashion and affects the global degree of synchrony of the system. Here we study the impact of such types of different network architectures, such as Fully-Connected, Random, Regular ring lattice graph, Small-World and Scale-Free in the global dynamical activity of a system of coupled Kuramoto phase oscillators. We fix the external stimulation parameters and we measure the global degree of synchrony when different fractions of nodes receive stimulus. These nodes are chosen either randomly or based on their respective strong/weak connectivity properties (centrality, shortest path length and clustering coefficient). Our main finding is, that in Scale-Free and Random networks a sophisticated choice of nodes based on their eigenvector centrality and average shortest path length exhibits a systematic trend in achieving higher degree of synchrony. However, this trend does not occur when using the clustering coefficient as a criterion. For the other types of graphs considered, the choice of the stimulated nodes (randomly vs selectively using the aforementioned criteria) does not seem to have a noticeable effect. ",

Speech models, such as Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) and Hidden units BERT (HuBERT), have enabled generating lexical and acoustic representations to benefit speech recognition applications. We investigated the use of pre-trained model representations for estimating dimensional emotions, such as activation, valence, and dominance, from speech. We observed that while valence may rely heavily on lexical representations, activation and dominance rely mostly on acoustic information. In this work, we used multi-modal fusion representations from pre-trained models to generate state-of-the-art speech emotion estimation, and we showed a 100% and 30% relative improvement in concordance correlation coefficient (CCC) on valence estimation compared to standard acoustic and lexical baselines. Finally, we investigated the robustness of pre-trained model representations against noise and reverberation degradation and noticed that lexical and acoustic representations are impacted differently. We discovered that lexical representations are more robust to distortions compared to acoustic representations, and demonstrated that knowledge distillation from a multi-modal model helps to improve the noise-robustness of acoustic-based models.

    "abstract": "Quantum neural networks represent a new machine learning paradigm that has recently attracted much attention due to its potential promise. Under certain conditions, these models approximate the distribution of their dataset with a truncated Fourier series. The trigonometric nature of this fit could result in angle-embedded quantum neural networks struggling to fit the non-harmonic features in a given dataset. Moreover, the interpretability of neural networks remains a challenge. In this work, we introduce a new, interpretable class of hybrid quantum neural networks that pass the inputs of the dataset in parallel to 1) a classical multi-layered perceptron and 2) a variational quantum circuit, and then the outputs of the two are linearly combined. We observe that the quantum neural network creates a smooth sinusoidal foundation base on the training set, and then the classical perceptrons fill the non-harmonic gaps in the landscape. We demonstrate this claim on two synthetic datasets sampled from periodic distributions with added protrusions as noise. The training results indicate that the parallel hybrid network architecture could improve the solution optimality on periodic datasets with additional noise. ",

The types (and equivalently preferences) of the players are dynamically evolving. Each player is fully rational and forward-looking and makes a decision in each round t to buy a product. She receives a higher utility if the product she bought is aligned with her current preference and if there is a higher fraction of people who bought that product (thus a game of strategic complementarity). We show that for certain parameters when the weight of strategic complementarity is high, players eventually herd towards one of the actions with probability 1 which is when each player buys a product irrespective of her preference.

Without training or fine-tuning, scientific language models could be used for such low-data tasks through their announced zero- and few-shot capabilities. However, their predictive quality at activity prediction is lacking. In this work, we envision a novel type of activity prediction model that is able to adapt to new prediction tasks at inference time, via understanding textual information describing the task. To this end, we propose a new architecture with separate modules for chemical and natural language inputs, and a contrastive pre-training objective on data from large biochemical databases. In extensive experiments, we show that our method CLAMP yields improved predictive performance on few-shot learning benchmarks and zero-shot problems in drug discovery. We attribute the advances of our method to the modularized architecture and to our pre-training objective. ",
