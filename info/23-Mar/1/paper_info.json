    "abstract": "Self-supervised representations of speech are currently being widely used for a large number of applications. Recently, some efforts have been made in trying to analyze the type of information present in each of these representations. Most such work uses downstream models to test whether the representations can be successfully used for a specific task. The downstream models, though, typically perform nonlinear operations on the representation extracting information that may not have been readily available in the original representation. In this work, we analyze the spatial organization of phone and speaker information in several state-of-the-art speech representations using methods that do not require a downstream model. We measure how different layers encode basic acoustic parameters such as formants and pitch using representation similarity analysis. Further, we study the extent to which each representation clusters the speech samples by phone or speaker classes using non-parametric statistical testing. Our results indicate that models represent these speech attributes differently depending on the target task used during pretraining. ",

    "abstract": "Automatic detection of multimodal fake news has gained a widespread attention recently. Many existing approaches seek to fuse unimodal features to produce multimodal news representations. However, the potential of powerful cross-modal contrastive learning methods for fake news detection has not been well exploited. Besides, how to aggregate features from different modalities to boost the performance of the decision-making process is still an open question. To address that, we propose COOLANT, a cross-modal contrastive learning framework for multimodal fake news detection, aiming to achieve more accurate image-text alignment. To further improve the alignment precision, we leverage an auxiliary task to soften the loss term of negative samples during the contrast process. A cross-modal fusion module is developed to learn the cross-modality correlations. An attention mechanism with an attention guidance module is implemented to help effectively and interpretably aggregate the aligned unimodal representations and the cross-modality correlations. Finally, we evaluate the COOLANT and conduct a comparative study on two widely used datasets, Twitter and Weibo. The experimental results demonstrate that our COOLANT outperforms previous approaches by a large margin and achieves new state-of-the-art results on the two datasets. ",

As there are various pattern mining algorithms, this study aimed to validate which algorithm discovers the best set of movement patterns for player movement profiling in professional rugby league and the similarity in extracted movement patterns between the algorithms. Three pattern mining algorithms (l-length Closed Contiguous [LCCspm], Longest Common Subsequence [LCS] and AprioriClose) were used to profile elite rugby football league hookers (n = 22 players) and wingers (n = 28 players) match-games movements across 319 matches. Machine learning classification algorithms were used to identify which algorithm gives the best set of movement patterns to separate playing positions with Jaccard similarity score identifying the extent of similarity between algorithms' movement patterns. LCCspm and LCS movement patterns shared a 0.19 Jaccard similarity score. AprioriClose movement patterns shared no significant similarity with LCCspm and LCS patterns. The closed contiguous movement patterns profiled by LCCspm best-separated players into playing positions. Multi-layered Perceptron algorithm achieved the highest accuracy of 91.02% and precision, recall and F1 scores of 0.91 respectively. Therefore, we recommend the extraction of closed contiguous (consecutive) over non-consecutive movement patterns for separating groups of players. ",

    "abstract": "Deep neural networks (DNNs) can be easily fooled by adversarial attacks during inference phase when attackers add imperceptible perturbations to original examples, i.e., adversarial examples. Many works focus on adversarial detection and adversarial training to defend against adversarial attacks. However, few works explore the tool-chains behind adversarial examples, which can help defenders to seize the clues about the originator of the attack, their goals, and provide insight into the most effective defense algorithm against corresponding attacks. With such a gap, it is necessary to develop techniques that can recognize tool-chains that are leveraged to generate the adversarial examples, which is called Adversarial Attribution Problem (AAP). In this paper, AAP is defined as the recognition of three signatures, i.e., {\\em attack algorithm}, {\\em victim model} and {\\em hyperparameter}. Current works transfer AAP into single label classification task and ignore the relationship between these signatures. The former will meet combination explosion problem as the number of signatures is increasing. The latter dictates that we cannot treat AAP simply as a single task problem. We first conduct some experiments to validate the attributability of adversarial examples. Furthermore, we propose a multi-task learning framework named Multi-Task Adversarial Attribution (MTAA) to recognize the three signatures simultaneously. MTAA contains perturbation extraction module, adversarial-only extraction module and classification and regression module. It takes the relationship between attack algorithm and corresponding hyperparameter into account and uses the uncertainty weighted loss to adjust the weights of three recognition tasks. The experimental results on MNIST and ImageNet show the feasibility and scalability of the proposed framework as well as its effectiveness in dealing with false alarms. ",

    "abstract": "Heterogeneous graph neural networks (HGNNs) have exhibited exceptional efficacy in modeling the complex heterogeneity in heterogeneous information networks (HINs). The critical advantage of HGNNs is their ability to handle diverse node and edge types in HINs by extracting and utilizing the abundant semantic information for effective representation learning. However, as a widespread phenomenon in many real-world scenarios, the class-imbalance distribution in HINs creates a performance bottleneck for existing HGNNs. Apart from the quantity imbalance of nodes, another more crucial and distinctive challenge in HINs is semantic imbalance. Minority classes in HINs often lack diverse and sufficient neighbor nodes, resulting in biased and incomplete semantic information. This semantic imbalance further compounds the difficulty of accurately classifying minority nodes, leading to the performance degradation of HGNNs. To tackle the imbalance of minority classes and supplement their inadequate semantics, we present the first method for the semantic imbalance problem in imbalanced HINs named Semantic-aware Node Synthesis (SNS). By assessing the influence on minority classes, SNS adaptively selects the heterogeneous neighbor nodes and augments the network with synthetic nodes while preserving the minority semantics. In addition, we introduce two regularization approaches for HGNNs that constrain the representation of synthetic nodes from both semantic and class perspectives to effectively suppress the potential noises from synthetic nodes, facilitating more expressive embeddings for classification. The comprehensive experimental study demonstrates that SNS consistently outperforms existing methods by a large margin in different benchmark datasets. ",

    "abstract": "A core challenge in the interpretation of deep neural networks is identifying commonalities between the underlying algorithms implemented by distinct networks trained for the same task. Motivated by this problem, we introduce DYNAMO, an algorithm that constructs low-dimensional manifolds where each point corresponds to a neural network model, and two points are nearby if the corresponding neural networks enact similar high-level computational processes. DYNAMO takes as input a collection of pre-trained neural networks and outputs a meta-model that emulates the dynamics of the hidden states as well as the outputs of any model in the collection. The specific model to be emulated is determined by a model embedding vector that the meta-model takes as input; these model embedding vectors constitute a manifold corresponding to the given population of models. We apply DYNAMO to both RNNs and CNNs, and find that the resulting model embedding spaces enable novel applications: clustering of neural networks on the basis of their high-level computational processes in a manner that is less sensitive to reparameterization; model averaging of several neural networks trained on the same task to arrive at a new, operable neural network with similar task performance; and semi-supervised learning via optimization on the model embedding space. Using a fixed-point analysis of meta-models trained on populations of RNNs, we gain new insights into how similarities of the topology of RNN dynamics correspond to similarities of their high-level computational processes.

We show that in a downstream return prediction classification task, an F1-score of 0.792 can be found using a Graph Neural Network (GNN), improving upon other models discussed in this work. Alongside this increased F1-score, we also present a lower cross-entropy loss by recasting the data into a graph structure, indicating more robust predictions from a GNN based solution. These results provide evidence that GNNs could provide more impactful and usable classifications than other baseline models on the presented dataset and with this motivation, we hope to encourage further research into graph-based approaches using the ASOS GraphReturns dataset.

This frontend has a small size but a heavy computational cost. In this work, we propose three task-specific structured pruning methods to deal with such heterogeneous networks. Experiments on LibriSpeech and SLURP show that the proposed method is more accurate than the original wav2vec2-base with 10% to 30% less computation, and is able to reduce the computation by 40% to 50% without any degradation.

Such problem consists in frequently obtaining \"Not a number\" (NaN) values during training. The pretraining method proposed resolves these issues by training the linear nodes in the hidden layer of the RMDN before starting including non-linear node updates.

Due to the limited research in structured attacks, imposing consistency checks on natural multi-object scenes is a promising yet practical defense against conventional adversarial attacks. More desired attacks, to this end, should be able to fool defenses with such consistency checks. Therefore, we present the first approach GLOW that copes with various attack requests by generating global layout-aware adversarial attacks where both categorical and geometric layout constraints are explicitly established. Specifically, we focus on object detection task and given a victim image, GLOW first localizes victim objects according to target labels. And then it generates multiple attack plans, together with their context-consistency scores. Our proposed GLOW, on the one hand, is capable of handling various types of requests, including single or multiple victim objects, with or without specified victim objects. On the other hand, it produces a consistency score for each attack plan, reflecting the overall contextual consistency that both semantic category and global scene layout are considered. In experiment, we design multiple types of attack requests and validate our ideas on MS COCO validation set. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that we can achieve about 40$\\%$ average relative improvement compared to state-of-the-art methods in conventional single object attack request; Moreover, our method outperforms SOTAs significantly on more generic attack requests by at least 30$\\%$; Finally, our method produces superior performance under challenging zero-query black-box setting, or 30$\\%$ better than SOTAs.

Unfortunately, existing vulnerability scoring systems are either vendor-specific, proprietary, or are only commercially available. Moreover, these and other prioritization strategies based on vulnerability severity are poor predictors of actual vulnerability exploitation because they do not incorporate new information that might impact the likelihood of exploitation. In this paper we present the efforts behind building a Special Interest Group (SIG) that seeks to develop a completely data-driven exploit scoring system that produces scores for all known vulnerabilities, that is freely available, and which adapts to new information. The Exploit Prediction Scoring System (EPSS) SIG consists of more than 170 experts from around the world and across all industries, providing crowd-sourced expertise and feedback. Based on these collective insights, we describe the design decisions and trade-offs that lead to the development of the next version of EPSS.

We identify this setting as Graph Intersection-induced Transfer Learning (GITL), which is motivated by practical applications in e-commerce or academic co-authorship predictions. We develop a framework to effectively leverage the structural prior in this setting. We first create an intersection subgraph using the shared nodes between the two graphs, then transfer knowledge from the source-enriched intersection subgraph to the full target graph. In the second step, we consider two approaches: a modified label propagation, and a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) model in a teacher-student regime.

Existing techniques address this by using computationally and memory expensive offline hard mining, which consists of identifying, at each iteration, the hardest samples from the training set. In this paper we introduce a new technique that performs global hard mini-batch sampling based on proxies. To do so, we add a new end-to-end trainable branch to the network, which generates efficient place descriptors (one proxy for each place). These proxy representations are thus used to construct a global index that encompasses the similarities between all places in the dataset, allowing for highly informative mini-batch sampling at each training iteration. Our method can be used in combination with all existing pairwise and triplet loss functions with negligible additional memory and computation cost. We run extensive ablation studies and show that our technique brings new state-of-the-art performance on multiple large-scale benchmarks such as Pittsburgh, Mapillary-SLS and SPED.

    "abstract": "Since reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is considered to be a passive reflector for rate performance enhancement, a RIS-aided amplify-and-forward (AF) relay network is presented. By jointly optimizing the beamforming matrix at AF relay and the phase shifts matrices at RIS, two schemes are put forward to address a maximizing signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) problem. Firstly, aiming at achieving a high rate, a high-performance alternating optimization (AO) method based on Charnes-Cooper transformation and semidefinite programming (CCT-SDP) is proposed, where the optimization problem is decomposed to three subproblems solved by CCT-SDP and rank-one solutions can be recovered by Gaussian randomization. While the optimization variables in CCT-SDP method are matrices, which leads to extremely high complexity. In order to reduce the complexity, a low-complexity AO scheme based on Dinkelbachs transformation and successive convex approximation (DT-SCA) is put forward, where matrices variables are transformed to vector variables and three decoupled subproblems are solved by DT-SCA. Simulation results verify that compared to two benchmarks (i.e. a RIS-assisted AF relay network with random phase and a AF relay network without RIS), the proposed CCT-SDP and DT-SCA schemes can harvest better rate performance. Furthermore, it is revealed that the rate of the low-complexity DT-SCA method is close to that of CCT-SDP method. ",

    "abstract": "While vision transformers have been highly successful in improving the performance in image-based tasks, not much work has been reported on applying transformers to multilingual scene text recognition due to the complexities in the visual appearance of multilingual texts. To fill the gap, this paper proposes an augmented transformer architecture with n-grams embedding and cross-language rectification (TANGER). TANGER consists of a primary transformer with single patch embeddings of visual images, and a supplementary transformer with adaptive n-grams embeddings that aims to flexibly explore the potential correlations between neighbouring visual patches, which is essential for feature extraction from multilingual scene texts. Cross-language rectification is achieved with a loss function that takes into account both language identification and contextual coherence scoring. Extensive comparative studies are conducted on four widely used benchmark datasets as well as a new multilingual scene text dataset containing Indonesian, English, and Chinese collected from tourism scenes in Indonesia. Our experimental results demonstrate that TANGER is considerably better compared to the state-of-the-art, especially in handling complex multilingual scene texts. ",

    "abstract": "Planar grasp detection is one of the most fundamental tasks to robotic manipulation, and the recent progress of consumer-grade RGB-D sensors enables delivering more comprehensive features from both the texture and shape modalities. However, depth maps are generally of a relatively lower quality with much stronger noise compared to RGB images, making it challenging to acquire grasp depth and fuse multi-modal clues. To address the two issues, this paper proposes a novel learning based approach to RGB-D grasp detection, namely Depth Guided Cross-modal Attention Network (DGCAN). To better leverage the geometry information recorded in the depth channel, a complete 6-dimensional rectangle representation is adopted with the grasp depth dedicatedly considered in addition to those defined in the common 5-dimensional one. The prediction of the extra grasp depth substantially strengthens feature learning, thereby leading to more accurate results. Moreover, to reduce the negative impact caused by the discrepancy of data quality in two modalities, a Local Cross-modal Attention (LCA) module is designed, where the depth features are refined according to cross-modal relations and concatenated to the RGB ones for more sufficient fusion. Extensive simulation and physical evaluations are conducted and the experimental results highlight the superiority of the proposed approach. ",

    "abstract": "We introduce a framework for eliminating the computation of controller gain functions in PDE control. We learn the nonlinear operator from the plant parameters to the control gains with a (deep) neural network. We provide closed-loop stability guarantees (global exponential) under an NN-approximation of the feedback gains. While, in the existing PDE backstepping, finding the gain kernel requires (one offline) solution to an integral equation, the neural operator (NO) approach we propose learns the mapping from the functional coefficients of the plant PDE to the kernel function by employing a sufficiently high number of offline numerical solutions to the kernel integral equation, for a large enough number of the PDE model's different functional coefficients. We prove the existence of a DeepONet approximation, with arbitrarily high accuracy, of the exact nonlinear continuous operator mapping PDE coefficient functions into gain functions. Once proven to exist, learning of the NO is standard, completed \"once and for all\" (never online) and the kernel integral equation doesn't need to be solved ever again, for any new functional coefficient not exceeding the magnitude of the functional coefficients used for training. We also present an extension from approximating the gain kernel operator to approximating the full feedback law mapping, from plant parameter functions and state measurement functions to the control input, with semiglobal practical stability guarantees. Simulation illustrations are provided and code is available on github. This framework, eliminating real-time recomputation of gains, has the potential to be game changing for adaptive control of PDEs and gain scheduling control of nonlinear PDEs.

On the other side, we show that the adversarial training using our AdvRD images can significantly improve the robustness of DNNs to the real-world raindrop attacks. Extensive experiments are carried out to demonstrate that the images crafted by AdvRD are visually and statistically close to the natural raindrop images, can work as strong attackers to DNN models, and also help improve the robustness of DNNs to raindrop attacks.

To reduce the heavy annotations needed for supervised learning methods, we present a novel self-supervised strategy that solves this problem without any human labels. Our key idea is to factorize canonical shapes and articulated object poses from input articulated shapes through part-level equivariant shape analysis. Specifically, we first introduce the concept of part-level SE(3) equivariance and devise a network to learn features of such property. Then, through a carefully designed fine-grained pose-shape disentanglement strategy, we expect that canonical spaces to support pose estimation could be induced automatically. Thus, we could further predict articulated object poses as per-part rigid transformations describing how parts transform from their canonical part spaces to the camera space. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on both complete and partial point clouds from synthetic and real articulated object datasets. ",

The results indicate that Parler had lower toxicity levels than both Twitter and Reddit in discussions related to COVID-19. In contrast, Reddit showed the highest levels of toxicity, largely due to various anti-vaccine forums that spread misinformation about COVID-19 vaccines. Notably, our analysis of COVID-19 vaccination conversations on Twitter also revealed a significant presence of conspiracy theories among individuals with highly toxic attitudes. Our computational approach provides decision-makers with useful information about reducing the spread of toxicity within online communities.

    "abstract": "Explicit communication among humans is key to coordinating and learning. Social learning, which uses cues from experts, can greatly benefit from the usage of explicit communication to align heterogeneous policies, reduce sample complexity, and solve partially observable tasks. Emergent communication, a type of explicit communication, studies the creation of an artificial language to encode a high task-utility message directly from data. However, in most cases, emergent communication sends insufficiently compressed messages with little or null information, which also may not be understandable to a third-party listener. This paper proposes an unsupervised method based on the information bottleneck to capture both referential complexity and task-specific utility to adequately explore sparse social communication scenarios in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). We show that our model is able to i) develop a natural-language-inspired lexicon of messages that is independently composed of a set of emergent concepts, which span the observations and intents with minimal bits, ii) develop communication to align the action policies of heterogeneous agents with dissimilar feature models, and iii) learn a communication policy from watching an expert's action policy, which we term `social shadowing'.

However, in the Adversarial DFKD framework, the student network's accuracy, suffers due to the non-stationary distribution of the pseudo-samples under multiple generator updates. To this end, at every generator update, we aim to maintain the student's performance on previously encountered examples while acquiring knowledge from samples of the current distribution. Thus, we propose a meta-learning inspired framework by treating the task of Knowledge-Acquisition (learning from newly generated samples) and Knowledge-Retention (retaining knowledge on previously met samples) as meta-train and meta-test, respectively. Hence, we dub our method as Learning to Retain while Acquiring. Moreover, we identify an implicit aligning factor between the Knowledge-Retention and Knowledge-Acquisition tasks indicating that the proposed student update strategy enforces a common gradient direction for both tasks, alleviating interference between the two objectives. Finally, we support our hypothesis by exhibiting extensive evaluation and comparison of our method with prior arts on multiple datasets. ",

    "abstract": "The robustness of deep neural networks is usually lacking under adversarial examples, common corruptions, and distribution shifts, which becomes an important research problem in the development of deep learning. Although new deep learning methods and robustness improvement techniques have been constantly proposed, the robustness evaluations of existing methods are often inadequate due to their rapid development, diverse noise patterns, and simple evaluation metrics. Without thorough robustness evaluations, it is hard to understand the advances in the field and identify the effective methods. In this paper, we establish a comprehensive robustness benchmark called \\textbf{ARES-Bench} on the image classification task. In our benchmark, we evaluate the robustness of 55 typical deep learning models on ImageNet with diverse architectures (e.g., CNNs, Transformers) and learning algorithms (e.g., normal supervised training, pre-training, adversarial training) under numerous adversarial attacks and out-of-distribution (OOD) datasets. Using robustness curves as the major evaluation criteria, we conduct large-scale experiments and draw several important findings, including: 1) there is an inherent trade-off between adversarial and natural robustness for the same model architecture; 2) adversarial training effectively improves adversarial robustness, especially when performed on Transformer architectures; 3) pre-training significantly improves natural robustness based on more training data or self-supervised learning. Based on ARES-Bench, we further analyze the training tricks in large-scale adversarial training on ImageNet. By designing the training settings accordingly, we achieve the new state-of-the-art adversarial robustness. We have made the benchmarking results and code platform publicly available. ",

Despite the importance of model generalization to out-of-distribution (OOD) data, the accuracy of state-of-the-art (SOTA) models on OOD data can plummet. Recent work has demonstrated that regular or off-manifold adversarial examples, as a special case of data augmentation, can be used to improve OOD generalization. Inspired by this, we theoretically prove that on-manifold adversarial examples can better benefit OOD generalization. Nevertheless, it is nontrivial to generate on-manifold adversarial examples because the real manifold is generally complex. To address this issue, we proposed a novel method of Augmenting data with Adversarial examples via a Wavelet module (AdvWavAug), an on-manifold adversarial data augmentation technique that is simple to implement. In particular, we project a benign image into a wavelet domain. With the assistance of the sparsity characteristic of wavelet transformation, we can modify an image on the estimated data manifold. We conduct adversarial augmentation based on AdvProp training framework. Extensive experiments on different models and different datasets, including ImageNet and its distorted versions, demonstrate that our method can improve model generalization, especially on OOD data. By integrating AdvWavAug into the training process, we have achieved SOTA results on some recent transformer-based models. ",

To exploit information in video with self-supervised learning, TeCo uses global content from video clips and optimizes models for entropy minimization. TeCo minimizes the entropy of the prediction based on the global content from video clips. Meanwhile, it also feeds local content to regularize the temporal coherence at the feature level. TeCo retains the generalization ability of various video classification models and achieves significant improvements in corruption robustness across Mini Kinetics-C and Mini SSV2-C.

For training the non-differentiable SNN models, the backpropagation through time (BPTT) with surrogate gradients (SG) method has achieved high performance. However, this method suffers from considerable memory cost and training time during training. In this paper, we propose the Spatial Learning Through Time (SLTT) method that can achieve high performance while greatly improving training efficiency compared with BPTT. First, we show that the backpropagation of SNNs through the temporal domain contributes just a little to the final calculated gradients. Thus, we propose to ignore the unimportant routes in the computational graph during backpropagation. The proposed method reduces the number of scalar multiplications and achieves a small memory occupation that is independent of the total time steps. Furthermore, we propose a variant of SLTT, called SLTT-K, that allows backpropagation only at K time steps, then the required number of scalar multiplications is further reduced and is independent of the total time steps. Experiments on both static and neuromorphic datasets demonstrate superior training efficiency and performance of our SLTT. In particular, our method achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on ImageNet, while the memory cost and training time are reduced by more than 70% and 50%, respectively, compared with BPTT. ",

Our framework combines deep learning and geometric vision for solving the robot pose, and the pipeline is fully differentiable. To train the Camera-to-Robot Pose Estimation Network (CtRNet), we leverage foreground segmentation and differentiable rendering for image-level self-supervision. The pose prediction is visualized through a renderer and the image loss with the input image is back-propagated to train the neural network. Our experimental results on two public real datasets confirm the effectiveness of our approach over existing works.

The recent promise leverages neural implicit surface learning and differentiable volume rendering, and achieves both the recovery of scene geometry and synthesis of novel views, where deep priors of neural models are used as an inductive smoothness bias. While promising for object-level surfaces, these methods suffer when coping with complex scene surfaces. In the meanwhile, traditional multi-view stereo can recover the geometry of scenes with rich textures, by globally optimizing the local, pixel-wise correspondences across multiple views. We are thus motivated to make use of the complementary benefits from the two strategies, and propose a method termed Helix-shaped neural implicit Surface learning or HelixSurf; HelixSurf uses the intermediate prediction from one strategy as the guidance to regularize the learning of the other one, and conducts such intertwined regularization iteratively during the learning process. We also propose an efficient scheme for differentiable volume rendering in HelixSurf. Experiments on surface reconstruction of indoor scenes show that our method compares favorably with existing methods and is orders of magnitude faster, even when some of existing methods are assisted with auxiliary training data.

    "abstract": "We present Implicit Two Hands (Im2Hands), the first neural implicit representation of two interacting hands. Unlike existing methods on two-hand reconstruction that rely on a parametric hand model and/or low-resolution meshes, Im2Hands can produce fine-grained geometry of two hands with high hand-to-hand and hand-to-image coherency. To handle the shape complexity and interaction context between two hands, Im2Hands models the occupancy volume of two hands - conditioned on an RGB image and coarse 3D keypoints - by two novel attention-based modules responsible for (1) initial occupancy estimation and (2) context-aware occupancy refinement, respectively. Im2Hands first learns per-hand neural articulated occupancy in the canonical space designed for each hand using query-image attention. It then refines the initial two-hand occupancy in the posed space to enhance the coherency between the two hand shapes using query-anchor attention. In addition, we introduce an optional keypoint refinement module to enable robust two-hand shape estimation from predicted hand keypoints in a single-image reconstruction scenario. We experimentally demonstrate the effectiveness of Im2Hands on two-hand reconstruction in comparison to related methods, where ours achieves state-of-the-art results.

    "title": "A semantic backdoor attack against Graph Convolutional Networks",
    "abstract": "Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) have been very effective in addressing the issue of various graph-structured related tasks, such as node classification and graph classification. However, extensive research has shown that GCNs are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. One of the security threats facing GCNs is the backdoor attack, which hides incorrect classification rules in models and activates only when the model encounters specific inputs containing special features (e.g., fixed patterns like subgraphs, called triggers), thus outputting incorrect classification results, while the model behaves normally on benign samples. The semantic backdoor attack is a type of the backdoor attack where the trigger is a semantic part of the sample; i.e., the trigger exists naturally in the original dataset and the attacker can pick a naturally occurring feature as the backdoor trigger, which causes the model to misclassify even unmodified inputs. Meanwhile, it is difficult to detect even if the attacker modifies the input samples in the inference phase as they do not have any anomaly compared to normal samples. Thus, semantic backdoor attacks are more imperceptible than non-semantic ones. However, existed research on semantic backdoor attacks has only focused on image and text domains, which have not been well explored against GCNs. In this work, we propose a black-box Semantic Backdoor Attack (SBA) against GCNs. We assign the trigger as a certain class of nodes in the dataset and our trigger is semantic. Through evaluation on several real-world benchmark graph datasets, the experimental results demonstrate that our proposed SBA can achieve almost 100% attack success rate under the poisoning rate less than 5% while having no impact on normal predictive accuracy.

    "abstract": "To perform household tasks, assistive robots receive commands in the form of user language instructions for tool manipulation. The initial stage involves selecting the intended tool (i.e., object grounding) and grasping it in a task-oriented manner (i.e., task grounding). Nevertheless, prior researches on visual-language grasping (VLG) focus on object grounding, while disregarding the fine-grained impact of tasks on object grasping. Task-incompatible grasping of a tool will inevitably limit the success of subsequent manipulation steps. Motivated by this problem, this paper proposes GraspCLIP, which addresses the challenge of task grounding in addition to object grounding to enable task-oriented grasp prediction with visual-language inputs. Evaluation on a custom dataset demonstrates that GraspCLIP achieves superior performance over established baselines with object grounding only. The effectiveness of the proposed method is further validated on an assistive robotic arm platform for grasping previously unseen kitchen tools given the task specification.

Previous approaches have demonstrated impressive results using color or depth images but still have difficulty handling poor light conditions and large-scale scenes. Methods taking global point cloud as input require accurate registration and ground truth coordinate labels, which limits their application scenarios. In this paper, we propose a new method that uses sparse LiDAR point clouds and rough odometry to reconstruct fine-grained implicit occupancy field efficiently within a few minutes. We introduce a new loss function that supervises directly in 3D space without 2D rendering, avoiding information loss. We also manage to refine poses of input frames in an end-to-end manner, creating consistent geometry without global point cloud registration. As far as we know, our method is the first to reconstruct implicit scene representation from LiDAR-only input. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets, including indoor and outdoor scenes, prove that our method is effective, efficient, and accurate, obtaining comparable results with existing methods using dense input.

Our approach generalizes to new subjects with electrodes in new positions and to unrelated tasks showing that the representations robustly disentangle the neural signal. Just like in NLP where one can study language by investigating what a language model learns, this approach opens the door to investigating the brain by what a model of the brain learns. As a first step along this path, we demonstrate a new analysis of the intrinsic dimensionality of the computations in different areas of the brain. To construct these representations, we combine a technique for producing super-resolution spectrograms of neural data with an approach designed for generating contextual representations of audio by masking. In the future, far more concepts will be decodable from neural recordings by using representation learning, potentially unlocking the brain like language models unlocked language. ",

This gap is mainly rooted from the speaker-language entanglement problem in cross-lingual TTS. In this paper, we propose CrossSpeech which improves the quality of cross-lingual speech by effectively disentangling speaker and language information in the level of acoustic feature space. Specifically, CrossSpeech decomposes the speech generation pipeline into the speaker-independent generator (SIG) and speaker-dependent generator (SDG). The SIG produces the speaker-independent acoustic representation which is not biased to specific speaker distributions. On the other hand, the SDG models speaker-dependent speech variation that characterizes speaker attributes. By handling each information separately, CrossSpeech can obtain disentangled speaker and language representations. From the experiments, we verify that CrossSpeech achieves significant improvements in cross-lingual TTS, especially in terms of speaker similarity to the target speaker. ",

Besides, we introduce a geometric gating mechanism which could be viewed as a soft domain decomposition to solve the multi-scale problems.

    "abstract": "A fundamental question in neurolinguistics concerns the brain regions involved in syntactic and semantic processing during speech comprehension, both at the lexical (word processing) and supra-lexical levels (sentence and discourse processing). To what extent are these regions separated or intertwined? To address this question, we trained a lexical language model, Glove, and a supra-lexical language model, GPT-2, on a text corpus from which we selectively removed either syntactic or semantic information. We then assessed to what extent these information-restricted models were able to predict the time-courses of fMRI signal of humans listening to naturalistic text. We also manipulated the size of contextual information provided to GPT-2 in order to determine the windows of integration of brain regions involved in supra-lexical processing. Our analyses show that, while most brain regions involved in language are sensitive to both syntactic and semantic variables, the relative magnitudes of these effects vary a lot across these regions. Furthermore, we found an asymmetry between the left and right hemispheres, with semantic and syntactic processing being more dissociated in the left hemisphere than in the right, and the left and right hemispheres showing respectively greater sensitivity to short and long contexts. The use of information-restricted NLP models thus shed new light on the spatial organization of syntactic processing, semantic processing and compositionality. ",

Various guidelines, frameworks and laws have been developed to ensure social media data is used in the most ethical way. However, they have quickly evolved within the past few years and are scattered across various fields and domains. To help researchers navigate these issues, this chapter provides an overview of the ethical considerations of studying migration via social media platforms. Building on relevant academic literature, as well as national and supranational frameworks and legislations, we review how the main ethical issues related to social media research have been discussed in the past twenty years and outline good practice examples to mitigate them.

In this paper we propose an adaptive algorithm that by dividing the image into concentric annuli is able to deal with sophisticated corrections like those applied out-camera by third party software like Adobe Lightroom, Photoshop, Gimp and PT-Lens. We also introduce a statistic called cumulative peak of correlation energy (CPCE) that allows for an efficient early stopping strategy.

We complement this line of work by proposing the first exact algorithm for finding optimal units given a broad class of causal objective functions and a fully specified structural causal model (SCM). We show that unit selection under this class of objective functions is $\\text{NP}^\\text{PP}$-complete but is $\\text{NP}$-complete when unit variables correspond to all exogenous variables in the SCM.

    "abstract": "Accelerators implementing Deep Neural Networks for image-based object detection operate on large volumes of data due to fetching images and neural network parameters, especially if they need to process video streams, hence with high power dissipation and bandwidth requirements to fetch all those data. While some solutions exist to mitigate power and bandwidth demands for data fetching, they are often assessed in the context of limited evaluations with a scale much smaller than that of the target application, which challenges finding the best tradeoff in practice. This paper sets up the infrastructure to assess at-scale a key power and bandwidth optimization - weight clustering - for You Only Look Once v3 (YOLOv3), a neural network-based object detection system, using videos of real driving conditions. Our assessment shows that accelerators such as systolic arrays with an Output Stationary architecture turn out to be a highly effective solution combined with weight clustering. In particular, applying weight clustering independently per neural network layer, and using between 32 (5-bit) and 256 (8-bit) weights allows achieving an accuracy close to that of the original YOLOv3 weights (32-bit weights). Such bit-count reduction of the weights allows shaving bandwidth requirements down to 30%-40% of the original requirements, and reduces energy consumption down to 45%. This is based on the fact that (i) energy due to multiply-and-accumulate operations is much smaller than DRAM data fetching, and (ii) designing accelerators appropriately may make that most of the data fetched corresponds to neural network weights, where clustering can be applied. Overall, our at-scale assessment provides key results to architect camera-based object detection accelerators by putting together a real-life application (YOLOv3), and real driving videos, in a unified setup so that trends observed are reliable.

To this end, we in this paper present a novel hierarchical representation network (HRN) to achieve accurate and detailed face reconstruction from a single image. Specifically, we implement the geometry disentanglement and introduce the hierarchical representation to fulfill detailed face modeling. Meanwhile, 3D priors of facial details are incorporated to enhance the accuracy and authenticity of the reconstruction results. We also propose a de-retouching module to achieve better decoupling of the geometry and appearance. It is noteworthy that our framework can be extended to a multi-view fashion by considering detail consistency of different views. Extensive experiments on two single-view and two multi-view FR benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms the existing methods in both reconstruction accuracy and visual effects.

However, most existing methods do not exploit the interest invariance between domains, which would yield sub-optimal solutions. In this paper, we propose a cross-domain recommendation method: Self-supervised Interest Transfer Network (SITN), which can effectively transfer invariant knowledge between domains via prototypical contrastive learning. Specifically, we perform two levels of cross-domain contrastive learning: 1) instance-to-instance contrastive learning, 2) instance-to-cluster contrastive learning. Not only that, we also take into account users' multi-granularity and multi-view interests. With this paradigm, SITN can explicitly learn the invariant knowledge of interest clusters between domains and accurately capture users' intents and preferences. We conducted extensive experiments on a public dataset and a large-scale industrial dataset collected from one of the world's leading e-commerce corporations. The experimental results indicate that SITN achieves significant improvements over state-of-the-art recommendation methods. Additionally, SITN has been deployed on a micro-video recommendation platform, and the online A/B testing results further demonstrate its practical value.

However, detecting novel categories with only a few samples usually leads to the problem of misclassification. In FSOD, we notice the false positive (FP) of novel categories is prominent, in which the base categories are often recognized as novel ones. To address this issue, a novel data augmentation pipeline that Crops the Novel instances and Pastes them on the selected Base images, called CNPB, is proposed. There are two key questions to be answered: (1) How to select useful base images? and (2) How to combine novel and base data? We design a multi-step selection strategy to find useful base data. Specifically, we first discover the base images which contain the FP of novel categories and select a certain amount of samples from them for the base and novel categories balance. Then the bad cases, such as the base images that have unlabeled ground truth or easily confused base instances, are removed by using CLIP. Finally, the same category strategy is adopted, in which a novel instance with category n is pasted on the base image with the FP of n. During combination, a novel instance is cropped and randomly down-sized, and thus pasted at the assigned optimal location from the randomly generated candidates in a selected base image. Our method is simple yet effective and can be easy to plug into existing FSOD methods, demonstrating significant potential for use. Extensive experiments on PASCAL VOC and MS COCO validate the effectiveness of our method. ",

Specifically, during each time slot of the RA protocol, the RIS covers a specific area of interest in the communication cell with a predefined set of phase-shift configurations, changing the channel qualities of the contending MTDs. Numerical results comparing the RA protocol performance reveal that access policies that exploit information of the channel qualities are suitable for green IoT networks, simultaneously attaining competitive EE and throughput combined with low power consumption at the MTDs-side.

    "abstract": "The training for deep neural networks (DNNs) demands immense energy consumption, which restricts the development of deep learning as well as increases carbon emissions. Thus, the study of energy-efficient training for DNNs is essential. In training, the linear layers consume the most energy because of the intense use of energy-consuming full-precision (FP32) multiplication in multiply-accumulate (MAC). The energy-efficient works try to decrease the precision of multiplication or replace the multiplication with energy-efficient operations such as addition or bitwise shift, to reduce the energy consumption of FP32 multiplications. However, the existing energy-efficient works cannot replace all of the FP32 multiplications during both forward and backward propagation with low-precision energy-efficient operations. In this work, we propose an Adaptive Layer-wise Scaling PoT Quantization (ALS-POTQ) method and a Multiplication-Free MAC (MF-MAC) to replace all of the FP32 multiplications with the INT4 additions and 1-bit XOR operations. In addition, we propose Weight Bias Correction and Parameterized Ratio Clipping techniques for stable training and improving accuracy. In our training scheme, all of the above methods do not introduce extra multiplications, so we reduce up to 95.8% of the energy consumption in linear layers during training. Experimentally, we achieve an accuracy degradation of less than 1% for CNN models on ImageNet and Transformer model on the WMT En-De task. In summary, we significantly outperform the existing methods for both energy efficiency and accuracy. ",

Firstly, we derive an expression of the required transmit power for the machine-type devices (MTDs) to attain a target signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), considering a channel model that accounts for the RIS discretization into sub-wavelength reflecting elements. Such an expression demonstrates that the transmit power depends on the target SNR, the position of the MTD in the service area, and the RIS setup, which includes the number of reflecting elements and the available reflecting angle configurations. Secondly, we develop an expression for the expected battery lifetime (EBL) of the MTDs, which explicitly depends on the MTD transmit power. Numerical simulations on the energy efficiency (EE) evaluated via the EBL demonstrate the benefits of adopting RISs to enable energy-efficient IoT networks. ",

From this probabilistic perspective, we calibrate its prediction based on the densities of labeled and unlabeled data, which leads to a simple closed-form solution from the Bayes' rule.

To achieve accurate CoSOD results with high-quality maps and high efficiency, we propose a novel Memory-aided Contrastive Consensus Learning (MCCL) framework, which is capable of effectively detecting co-salient objects in real time (~110 fps). To learn better group consensus, we propose the Group Consensus Aggregation Module (GCAM) to abstract the common features of each image group; meanwhile, to make the consensus representation more discriminative, we introduce the Memory-based Contrastive Module (MCM), which saves and updates the consensus of images from different groups in a queue of memories. Finally, to improve the quality and integrity of the predicted maps, we develop an Adversarial Integrity Learning (AIL) strategy to make the segmented regions more likely composed of complete objects with less surrounding noise. Extensive experiments on all the latest CoSOD benchmarks demonstrate that our lite MCCL outperforms 13 cutting-edge models, achieving the new state of the art (~5.9% and ~6.2% improvement in S-measure on CoSOD3k and CoSal2015, respectively).

In many applications such as user-item bipartite graph in E-commerce, customer-movie bipartite graph in movie rating website, nodes tend to have attributes, while previous community search algorithm on bipartite graphs ignore attributes, which makes the returned results with poor cohesion with respect to their node attributes. In this paper, we study the community search problem on attributed bipartite graphs. Given a query vertex q, we aim to find attributed $\\left(\\alpha,\\beta\\right)$-communities of $G$, where the structure cohesiveness of the community is described by an $\\left(\\alpha,\\beta\\right)$-core model, and the attribute similarity of two groups of nodes in the subgraph is maximized. In order to retrieve attributed communities from bipartite graphs, we first propose a basic algorithm composed of two steps: the generation and verification of candidate keyword sets, and then two improved query algorithms Inc and Dec are proposed. Inc is proposed considering the anti-monotonity property of attributed bipartite graphs, then we adopt different generating method and verifying order of candidate keyword sets and propose the Dec algorithm.

However, if the input contains a particular trigger, the trojaned model will have attacker-chosen abnormal behavior. Although many backdoor detection methods exist, most of them assume that the defender has access to a set of clean validation samples or samples with the trigger, which may not hold in some crucial real-world cases, e.g., the case where the defender is the maintainer of model-sharing platforms. Thus, in this paper, we propose FreeEagle, the first data-free backdoor detection method that can effectively detect complex backdoor attacks on deep neural networks, without relying on the access to any clean samples or samples with the trigger. The evaluation results on diverse datasets and model architectures show that FreeEagle is effective against various complex backdoor attacks, even outperforming some state-of-the-art non-data-free backdoor detection methods.

With the rapid development of deep neural networks (DNN), more and more steganographic networks are proposed recently, which are shown to be promising to achieve good performance. Unlike the traditional handcrafted steganographic tools, a steganographic network is relatively large in size. It raises concerns on how to covertly transmit the steganographic network in public channels, which is a crucial stage in the pipeline of steganography in real world applications. To address such an issue, we propose a novel scheme for steganography of steganographic networks in this paper. Unlike the existing steganographic schemes which focus on the subtle modification of the cover data to accommodate the secrets. We propose to disguise a steganographic network (termed as the secret DNN model) into a stego DNN model which performs an ordinary machine learning task (termed as the stego task). During the model disguising, we select and tune a subset of filters in the secret DNN model to preserve its function on the secret task, where the remaining filters are reactivated according to a partial optimization strategy to disguise the whole secret DNN model into a stego DNN model. The secret DNN model can be recovered from the stego DNN model when needed.

Current methods show great performance on detection and pose estimation of standard-shaped vehicles but lack behind on more complex shapes as e.g. semi-trailer truck combinations. Determining the shape and motion of those special vehicles accurately is crucial in yard operation and maneuvering and industrial automation applications. This work introduces several new methods to improve and measure the performance for such classes. State-of-the-art methods are based on predefined anchor grids or heatmaps for ground truth targets. However, the underlying representations do not take the shape of different sized objects into account. Our main contribution, AdaptiveShape, uses shape aware anchor distributions and heatmaps to improve the detection capabilities. For large vehicles we achieve +10.9% AP in comparison to current shape agnostic methods. Furthermore we introduce a new fast LiDAR-camera fusion. It is based on 2D bounding box camera detections which are available in many processing pipelines. This fusion method does not rely on perfectly calibrated or temporally synchronized systems and is therefore applicable to a broad range of robotic applications. We extend a standard point pillar network to account for temporal data and improve learning of complex object movements. In addition we extended a ground truth augmentation to use grouped object pairs to further improve truck AP by +2.2% compared to conventional augmentation. ",

GRAB consists of the Ghost Module and Channel and Spatial Attention Module (CSAM) to alleviate the generation of redundant features. Specifically, Ghost Module can reveal information underlying intrinsic features by employing linear operations to replace the standard convolutions. Reducing redundant features by the Ghost Module, our model decreases memory and computing resource requirements in the network. The CSAM pays more comprehensive attention to where and what the feature extraction is, which is critical to recovering the image details. Experiments conducted on the benchmark datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our method in both qualitative and quantitative.

    "abstract": "Discriminative representation is essential to keep a unique identifier for each target in Multiple object tracking (MOT). Some recent MOT methods extract features of the bounding box region or the center point as identity embeddings. However, when targets are occluded, these coarse-grained global representations become unreliable. To this end, we propose exploring diverse fine-grained representation, which describes appearance comprehensively from global and local perspectives. This fine-grained representation requires high feature resolution and precise semantic information. To effectively alleviate the semantic misalignment caused by indiscriminate contextual information aggregation, Flow Alignment FPN (FAFPN) is proposed for multi-scale feature alignment aggregation. It generates semantic flow among feature maps from different resolutions to transform their pixel positions. Furthermore, we present a Multi-head Part Mask Generator (MPMG) to extract fine-grained representation based on the aligned feature maps. Multiple parallel branches of MPMG allow it to focus on different parts of targets to generate local masks without label supervision. The diverse details in target masks facilitate fine-grained representation. Eventually, benefiting from a Shuffle-Group Sampling (SGS) training strategy with positive and negative samples balanced, we achieve state-of-the-art performance on MOT17 and MOT20 test sets. Even on DanceTrack, where the appearance of targets is extremely similar, our method significantly outperforms ByteTrack by 5.0% on HOTA and 5.6% on IDF1.

In this work, we propose a novel training framework, called deHuBERT, for noise reduction encoding inspired by H. Barlow's redundancy-reduction principle. The new framework improves the HuBERT training algorithm by introducing auxiliary losses that drive the self- and cross-correlation matrix between pairwise noise-distorted embeddings towards identity matrix.

These variations among specialties and objectives are likely to cause mixed motives that eventually result in a social dilemma where all the parties are at a loss. In order to resolve this issue, we propose the Incentive Q-Flow (IQ-Flow) algorithm, which modifies the system's reward setup with an incentive regulator agent such that the cooperative policy also corresponds to the self-interested policy for the agents. Unlike the existing methods that learn to incentivize self-interested agents, IQ-Flow does not make any assumptions about agents' policies or learning algorithms, which enables the generalization of the developed framework to a wider array of applications. IQ-Flow performs an offline evaluation of the optimality of the learned policies using the data provided by other agents to determine cooperative and self-interested policies. Next, IQ-Flow uses meta-gradient learning to estimate how policy evaluation changes according to given incentives and modifies the incentive such that the greedy policy for cooperative objective and self-interested objective yield the same actions. We present the operational characteristics of IQ-Flow in Iterated Matrix Games. We demonstrate that IQ-Flow outperforms the state-of-the-art incentive design algorithm in Escape Room and 2-Player Cleanup environments. We further demonstrate that the pretrained IQ-Flow mechanism significantly outperforms the performance of the shared reward setup in the 2-Player Cleanup environment. ",

    "abstract": "The sheer size of modern neural networks makes model serving a serious computational challenge. A popular class of compression techniques overcomes this challenge by pruning or sparsifying the weights of pretrained networks. While useful, these techniques often face serious tradeoffs between computational requirements and compression quality. In this work, we propose a novel optimization-based pruning framework that considers the combined effect of pruning (and updating) multiple weights subject to a sparsity constraint. Our approach, CHITA, extends the classical Optimal Brain Surgeon framework and results in significant improvements in speed, memory, and performance over existing optimization-based approaches for network pruning. CHITA's main workhorse performs combinatorial optimization updates on a memory-friendly representation of local quadratic approximation(s) of the loss function. On a standard benchmark of pretrained models and datasets, CHITA leads to significantly better sparsity-accuracy tradeoffs than competing methods. For example, for MLPNet with only 2% of the weights retained, our approach improves the accuracy by 63% relative to the state of the art. Furthermore, when used in conjunction with fine-tuning SGD steps, our method achieves significant accuracy gains over the state-of-the-art approaches. ",

    "abstract": "Black-box optimization refers to the optimization problem whose objective function and/or constraint sets are either unknown, inaccessible, or non-existent. In many applications, especially with the involvement of humans, the only way to access the optimization problem is through performing physical experiments with the available outcomes being the preference of one candidate with respect to one or many others. Accordingly, the algorithm so-called Active Preference Learning has been developed to exploit this specific information in constructing a surrogate function based on standard radial basis functions, and then forming an easy-to-solve acquisition function which repetitively suggests new decision vectors to search for the optimal solution. Based on this idea, our approach aims to extend the algorithm in such a way that can exploit further information effectively, which can be obtained in reality such as: 5-point Likert type scale for the outcomes of the preference query (i.e., the preference can be described in not only \"this is better than that\" but also \"this is much better than that\" level), or multiple outcomes for a single preference query with possible additive information on how certain the outcomes are. The validation of the proposed algorithm is done through some standard benchmark functions, showing a promising improvement with respect to the state-of-the-art algorithm. ",

Due to the simple implementation and low interpretation costs, deep neural networks are an attractive component for the common interpretation pipeline. However, neural networks are frequently met with distrust due to their property of producing semantically incorrect outputs when exposed to sections the model was not trained on. We address this issue by explaining model behaviour and improving generalization properties through example forgetting: First, we introduce a method that effectively relates semantically malfunctioned predictions to their respectful positions within the neural network representation manifold. More concrete, our method tracks how models \"forget\" seismic reflections during training and establishes a connection to the decision boundary proximity of the target class. Second, we use our analysis technique to identify frequently forgotten regions within the training volume and augment the training set with state-of-the-art style transfer techniques from computer vision. We show that our method improves the segmentation performance on underrepresented classes while significantly reducing the forgotten regions in the F3 volume in the Netherlands. ",

    "abstract": "In this paper, the performance optimization of federated learning (FL), when deployed over a realistic wireless multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication system with digital modulation and over-the-air computation (AirComp) is studied. In particular, an MIMO system is considered in which edge devices transmit their local FL models (trained using their locally collected data) to a parameter server (PS) using beamforming to maximize the number of devices scheduled for transmission. The PS, acting as a central controller, generates a global FL model using the received local FL models and broadcasts it back to all devices. Due to the limited bandwidth in a wireless network, AirComp is adopted to enable efficient wireless data aggregation. However, fading of wireless channels can produce aggregate distortions in an AirComp-based FL scheme. To tackle this challenge, we propose a modified federated averaging (FedAvg) algorithm that combines digital modulation with AirComp to mitigate wireless fading while ensuring the communication efficiency. This is achieved by a joint transmit and receive beamforming design, which is formulated as a optimization problem to dynamically adjust the beamforming matrices based on current FL model parameters so as to minimize the transmitting error and ensure the FL performance. To achieve this goal, we first analytically characterize how the beamforming matrices affect the performance of the FedAvg in different iterations. Based on this relationship, an artificial neural network (ANN) is used to estimate the local FL models of all devices and adjust the beamforming matrices at the PS for future model transmission. The algorithmic advantages and improved performance of the proposed methodologies are demonstrated through extensive numerical experiments. ",

Two objectives are fulfilled: obtain a refined solution to the initial orbit determination problem and detect possible outliers in the processed measurements. The uncertainty on the initial estimate is propagated forward in time and progressively reduced by exploiting sensor data available in said propagation window. Differential algebra techniques and a novel automatic domain splitting algorithm for second-order Taylor expansions are used to efficiently propagate uncertainties over time. A multifidelity approach is employed to minimize the computational effort while retaining the accuracy of the propagated estimate. At each observation epoch, a polynomial map is obtained by projecting the propagated states onto the observable space. Domains that do no overlap with the actual measurement are pruned thus reducing the uncertainty to be further propagated. Measurement outliers are also detected in this step. The refined estimate and pruned observations are then used to improve the robustness of batch orbit determination tools. The effectiveness of the algorithm is demonstrated for a geostationary transfer orbit object using synthetic and real observation data from the TAROT network. ",

Our proposed architecture leverages this structure by separately learning approximations for the low-dimensional factors and a subsequent combination. After developing the approach as a general framework, we apply it to a shape space of triangular surfaces. Here, typical examples of data manifolds are given through datasets of articulated models and can be factorized, for example, by a Sparse Principal Geodesic Analysis (SPGA).

However, deep learning models have proven to be vulnerable to backdoor attacks, where some specific trigger patterns added to the input can lead to malicious behavior of the models. In this paper, we present a novel backdoor attack with multiple triggers against learned image compression models. Motivated by the widely used discrete cosine transform (DCT) in existing compression systems and standards, we propose a frequency-based trigger injection model that adds triggers in the DCT domain. In particular, we design several attack objectives for various attacking scenarios, including: 1) attacking compression quality in terms of bit-rate and reconstruction quality; 2) attacking task-driven measures, such as down-stream face recognition and semantic segmentation. Moreover, a novel simple dynamic loss is designed to balance the influence of different loss terms adaptively, which helps achieve more efficient training. Extensive experiments show that with our trained trigger injection models and simple modification of encoder parameters (of the compression model), the proposed attack can successfully inject several backdoors with corresponding triggers in a single image compression model.

Common training strategies to improve generalization involve the use of data augmentations, ensembling and model averaging. In this work, we first establish a surprisingly simple but strong benchmark for generalization which utilizes diverse augmentations within a training minibatch, and show that this can learn a more balanced distribution of features. Further, we propose Diversify-Aggregate-Repeat Training (DART) strategy that first trains diverse models using different augmentations (or domains) to explore the loss basin, and further Aggregates their weights to combine their expertise and obtain improved generalization. We find that Repeating the step of Aggregation throughout training improves the overall optimization trajectory and also ensures that the individual models have a sufficiently low loss barrier to obtain improved generalization on combining them. We shed light on our approach by casting it in the framework proposed by Shen et al. and theoretically show that it indeed generalizes better. In addition to improvements in In- Domain generalization, we demonstrate SOTA performance on the Domain Generalization benchmarks in the popular DomainBed framework as well. Our method is generic and can easily be integrated with several base training algorithms to achieve performance gains. ",

We consider the following scenario: multiple pairs of agents communicating strategically over shared communication networks in the presence of a jammer who may launch a denial-of-service. We cast this problem as a game between a coordinator who optimizes the transmission and estimation policies jointly and a jammer who optimizes its probability of performing an attack. We consider two cases: point-to-point channels and large-scale networks with a countably infinite number of sensor-receiver pairs. When the jammer proactively attacks the channel, the game is nonconvex from the coordinator's perspective. However, despite the lack of convexity, we construct a saddle point equilibrium solution for any multi-variate Gaussian distribution for the observations. When the jammer is reactive, we obtain an algorithm based on sequential convex optimization, which converges swiftly to first-order Nash-equilibria. Interestingly, blocking the channel is often optimal when the jammer is reactive, even when it is idle, to create ambiguity at the receiver. ",

The sublinear regime is the most desirable in practice, but conditional hardness results point towards its limitations. In this work we study a \\emph{heterogeneous} model, where the memory of the machines varies in size. We focus mostly on the heterogeneous setting created by adding a single near-linear machine to the sublinear MPC regime, and show that even a single large machine suffices to circumvent most of the conditional hardness results for the sublinear regime: for graphs with $n$ vertices and $m$ edges, we give (a) an MST algorithm that runs in $O(\\log\\log(m/n))$ rounds; (b) an algorithm that constructs an $O(k)$-spanner of size $O(n^{1+1/k})$ in $O(1)$ rounds; and (c) a maximal-matching algorithm that runs in $O(\\sqrt{\\log(m/n)}\\log\\log(m/n))$ rounds. We also observe that the best known near-linear MPC algorithms for several other graph problems which are conjectured to be hard in the sublinear regime (minimum cut, maximal independent set, and vertex coloring) can easily be transformed to work in the heterogeneous MPC model with a single near-linear machine, while retaining their original round complexity in the near-linear regime.

The most commonly used methods are the algorithms designed to maximize modularity over different partitions of the network nodes into communities. Using 80 real and random networks from a wide range of contexts, we investigate the extent to which current heuristic modularity maximization algorithms succeed in returning modularity-maximum (optimal) partitions. We evaluate (1) the ratio of their output modularity to the maximum modularity for each input graph and (2) the maximum similarity between their output partition and any optimal partition of that graph. Our computational experiments involve eight existing heuristic algorithms which we compare against an exact integer programming method that globally maximizes modularity. The average modularity-based heuristic algorithm returns optimal partitions for only 16.9% of the 80 graphs considered. Results on adjusted mutual information show considerable dissimilarity between the sub-optimal partitions and any optimal partitions of the graphs in our experiments. More importantly, our results show that near-optimal partitions tend to be disproportionally dissimilar to any optimal partition. Taken together, our analysis points to a crucial limitation of commonly used modularity-based algorithms for discovering communities: they rarely return an optimal partition or a partition resembling an optimal partition. Given this finding, developing an exact or approximate algorithm for modularity maximization is recommendable for a more methodologically sound usage of modularity in community detection. ",

    "abstract": "Mobile Device Location Data (MDLD) has been popularly utilized in various fields. Yet its large-scale applications are limited because of either biased or insufficient spatial coverage of the data from individual data vendors. One approach to improve the data coverage is to leverage the data from multiple data vendors and integrate them to build a more representative dataset. For data integration, further treatments on the multi-sourced dataset are required due to several reasons. First, the possibility of carrying more than one device could result in duplicated observations from the same data subject. Additionally, when utilizing multiple data sources, the same device might be captured by more than one data provider. Our paper proposes a data integration methodology for multi-sourced data to investigate the feasibility of integrating data from several sources without introducing additional biases to the data. By leveraging the uniqueness of travel pattern of each device, duplicate devices are identified. The proposed methodology is shown to be cost-effective while it achieves the desired accuracy level. Our findings suggest that devices sharing the same imputed home location and the top five most-visited locations during a month can represent the same user in the MDLD. It is shown that more than 99.6% of the sample devices having the aforementioned attribute in common are observed at the same location simultaneously. Finally, the proposed algorithm has been successfully applied to the national-level MDLD of 2020 to produce the national passenger origin-destination data for the NextGeneration National Household Travel Survey (NextGen NHTS) program.

    "title": "On Learning Intrinsic Rewards for Faster Multi-Agent Reinforcement  Learning based MAC Protocol Design in 6G Wireless Networks",
    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a novel framework for designing a fast convergent multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL)-based medium access control (MAC) protocol operating in a single cell scenario. The user equipments (UEs) are cast as learning agents that need to learn a proper signaling policy to coordinate the transmission of protocol data units (PDUs) to the base station (BS) over shared radio resources. In many MARL tasks, the conventional centralized training with decentralized execution (CTDE) is adopted, where each agent receives the same global extrinsic reward from the environment. However, this approach involves a long training time. To overcome this drawback, we adopt the concept of learning a per-agent intrinsic reward, in which each agent learns a different intrinsic reward signal based solely on its individual behavior. Moreover, in order to provide an intrinsic reward function that takes into account the long-term training history, we represent it as a long shortterm memory (LSTM) network. As a result, each agent updates its policy network considering both the extrinsic reward, which characterizes the cooperative task, and the intrinsic reward that reflects local dynamics. The proposed learning framework yields a faster convergence and higher transmission performance compared to the baselines. Simulation results show that the proposed learning solution yields 75% improvement in convergence speed compared to the most performing baseline. ",

    "abstract": "To efficiently monitor the growth and evolution of a particular wildlife population, one of the main fundamental challenges to address in animal ecology is the re-identification of individuals that have been previously encountered but also the discrimination between known and unknown individuals (the so-called \"open-set problem\"), which is the first step to realize before re-identification. In particular, in this work, we are interested in the discrimination within digital photos of beluga whales, which are known to be among the most challenging marine species to discriminate due to their lack of distinctive features. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel approach based on the use of Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs), which are normally used to assess the privacy risks associated with releasing a particular machine learning model. More precisely, we demonstrate that the problem of discriminating between known and unknown individuals can be solved efficiently using state-of-the-art approaches for MIAs. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets related to whales, two different neural network architectures, and three MIA clearly demonstrate the performance of the approach. In addition, we have also designed a novel MIA strategy that we coined as ensemble MIA, which combines the outputs of different MIAs to increase the attack accuracy while diminishing the false positive rate. Overall, one of our main objectives is also to show that the research on privacy attacks can also be leveraged \"for good\" by helping to address practical challenges encountered in animal ecology.

While much work has focused on learning representations for other modalities, there are no aligned cross-modal representations for text and knowledge base (KB) elements. One challenge for learning such representations is the lack of parallel data, which we use contrastive training on heuristics-based datasets and data augmentation to overcome, training embedding models on (KB graph, text) pairs. On WebNLG, a cleaner manually crafted dataset, we show that they learn aligned representations suitable for retrieval. We then fine-tune on annotated data to create EREDAT (Ensembled Representations for Evaluation of DAta-to-Text), a similarity metric between English text and KB graphs. EREDAT outperforms or matches state-of-the-art metrics in terms of correlation with human judgments on WebNLG even though, unlike them, it does not require a reference text to compare against. ",

    "abstract": "Persistent multi-object tracking (MOT) allows autonomous vehicles to navigate safely in highly dynamic environments. One of the well-known challenges in MOT is object occlusion when an object becomes unobservant for subsequent frames. The current MOT methods store objects information, like objects' trajectory, in internal memory to recover the objects after occlusions. However, they retain short-term memory to save computational time and avoid slowing down the MOT method. As a result, they lose track of objects in some occlusion scenarios, particularly long ones. In this paper, we propose DFR-FastMOT, a light MOT method that uses data from a camera and LiDAR sensors and relies on an algebraic formulation for object association and fusion. The formulation boosts the computational time and permits long-term memory that tackles more occlusion scenarios. Our method shows outstanding tracking performance over recent learning and non-learning benchmarks with about 3% and 4% margin in MOTA, respectively. Also, we conduct extensive experiments that simulate occlusion phenomena by employing detectors with various distortion levels. The proposed solution enables superior performance under various distortion levels in detection over current state-of-art methods. Our framework processes about 7,763 frames in 1.48 seconds, which is seven times faster than recent benchmarks. The framework will be available at https://github.com/MohamedNagyMostafa/DFR-FastMOT.

EvoPrompting is successful at designing accurate and efficient neural network architectures across a variety of machine learning tasks, while also being general enough for easy adaptation to other tasks beyond neural network design.

Our results demonstrate that our models are robust to astrophysics, subgrid physics, and subhalo/galaxy finder changes. Furthermore, we test our models on 1,024 simulations that cover a vast region in parameter space - variations in 5 cosmological and 23 astrophysical parameters - finding that the model extrapolates really well.

Despite such significant efforts, the results remain unsatisfactory due to the inherently complicated nature of the stock market driven by factors including supply and demand, the state of the economy, the political climate, and even irrational human behavior. Recently, Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) have been extended for time series data; however, robust methods are primarily for synthetic series generation, which fall short for appropriate stock prediction. This is because existing GANs for stock applications suffer from mode collapse and only consider one-step prediction, thus underutilizing the potential of GAN. Furthermore, merging news and market volatility are neglected in current GANs. To address these issues, we exploit expert domain knowledge in finance and, for the first time, attempt to formulate stock movement prediction into a Wasserstein GAN framework for multi-step prediction. We propose IndexGAN, which includes deliberate designs for the inherent characteristics of the stock market, leverages news context learning to thoroughly investigate textual information and develop an attentive seq2seq learning network that captures the temporal dependency among stock prices, news, and market sentiment. We also utilize the critic to approximate the Wasserstein distance between actual and predicted sequences and develop a rolling strategy for deployment that mitigates noise from the financial market. Extensive experiments are conducted on real-world broad-based indices, demonstrating the superior performance of our architecture over other state-of-the-art baselines, also validating all its contributing components.

Existing detectors, which mainly rely on the logit, intermediate feature space, softmax score, or reconstruction loss, manage to produce promising results. However, most of these methods are developed for the image domain. In this study, we propose a novel reconstruction-based OOD detector to operate on the radar domain.

    "abstract": "Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) as a means of solving partial differential equations (PDE) have garnered much attention in Computational Science and Engineering (CS&E). However, a recent topic of interest is exploring various training (i.e., optimization) challenges - in particular, arriving at poor local minima in the optimization landscape results in a PINN approximation giving an inferior, and sometimes trivial, solution when solving forward time-dependent PDEs with no data. This problem is also found in, and in some sense more difficult, with domain decomposition strategies such as temporal decomposition using XPINNs. To address this problem, we first enable a general categorization for previous causality methods, from which we identify a gap in the previous approaches. We then furnish examples and explanations for different training challenges, their cause, and how they relate to information propagation and temporal decomposition. We propose a solution to fill this gap by reframing these causality concepts into a generalized information propagation framework in which any prior method or combination of methods can be described. Our unified framework moves toward reducing the number of PINN methods to consider and the implementation and retuning cost for thorough comparisons. We propose a new stacked-decomposition method that bridges the gap between time-marching PINNs and XPINNs. We also introduce significant computational speed-ups by using transfer learning concepts to initialize subnetworks in the domain and loss tolerance-based propagation for the subdomains. We formulate a new time-sweeping collocation point algorithm inspired by the previous PINNs causality literature, which our framework can still describe, and provides a significant computational speed-up via reduced-cost collocation point segmentation.

In this work, we present the Crystal Hamiltonian Graph neural Network (CHGNet) as a novel machine-learning interatomic potential (MLIP), using a graph-neural-network-based force-field to model a universal potential energy surface. CHGNet is pretrained on the energies, forces, stresses, and magnetic moments from the Materials Project Trajectory Dataset, which consists of over 10 years of density functional theory static and relaxation trajectories of $\\sim 1.5$ million inorganic structures. The explicit inclusion of magnetic moments enables CHGNet to learn and accurately represent the orbital occupancy of electrons, enhancing its capability to describe both atomic and electronic degrees of freedom. We demonstrate several applications of CHGNet in solid-state materials, including charge-informed molecular dynamics in Li$_x$MnO$_2$, the finite temperature phase diagram for Li$_x$FePO$_4$ and Li diffusion in garnet conductors. We critically analyze the significance of including charge information for capturing appropriate chemistry, and we provide new insights into ionic systems with additional electronic degrees of freedom that can not be observed by previous MLIPs.

Chest Computed Tomography (CT) holds great potential for screening and diagnosis of this disease.

COVID-19 infections are characterized by high heterogeneity and unclear boundaries, so capturing low-level features such as texture and intensity is critical for segmentation. However, segmentation networks that emphasize low-level features are still lacking. In this work, we propose a DECOR-Net capable of capturing more decorrelated low-level features. The channel re-weighting strategy is applied to obtain plenty of low-level features and the dependencies between channels are reduced by proposed decorrelation loss. Experiments show that DECOR-Net outperforms other cutting-edge methods and surpasses the baseline by 5.1% and 4.9% in terms of Dice coefficient and intersection over union. Moreover, the proposed decorrelation loss can improve the performance constantly under different settings. The Code is available at https://github.com/jiesihu/DECOR-Net.git. ",

    "abstract": "Ridesharing platforms are a type of two-sided marketplace where ``supply-demand balance'' is critical for market efficiency and yet is complex to define and analyze. We present a unified analytical framework based on the graph-based equilibrium metric (GEM) for quantifying the supply-demand spatiotemporal state and efficiency of a ridesharing marketplace. GEM was developed as a generalized Wasserstein distance between the supply and demand distributions in a ridesharing market and has been used as an evaluation metric for algorithms expected to improve supply-demand alignment. Building upon GEM, we develop SD-GEM, a dual-perspective (supply- and demand-side) representation of rideshare market equilibrium. We show that there are often disparities between the two views and examine how this dual-view leads to the notion of market efficiency, in which we propose novel statistical tests for capturing improvement and explaining the underlying driving factors.

    "abstract": "For any video codecs, the coding efficiency highly relies on whether the current signal to be encoded can find the relevant contexts from the previous reconstructed signals. Traditional codec has verified more contexts bring substantial coding gain, but in a time-consuming manner. However, for the emerging neural video codec (NVC), its contexts are still limited, leading to low compression ratio. To boost NVC, this paper proposes increasing the context diversity in both temporal and spatial dimensions. First, we guide the model to learn hierarchical quality patterns across frames, which enriches long-term and yet high-quality temporal contexts. Furthermore, to tap the potential of optical flow-based coding framework, we introduce a group-based offset diversity where the cross-group interaction is proposed for better context mining. In addition, this paper also adopts a quadtree-based partition to increase spatial context diversity when encoding the latent representation in parallel. Experiments show that our codec obtains 23.5% bitrate saving over previous SOTA NVC. Better yet, our codec has surpassed the under-developing next generation traditional codec/ECM in both RGB and YUV420 colorspaces, in terms of PSNR.

    "abstract": "Image based Deep Feature Quality Metrics (DFQMs) have been shown to better correlate with subjective perceptual scores over traditional metrics. The fundamental focus of these DFQMs is to exploit internal representations from a large scale classification network as the metric feature space. Previously, no attention has been given to the problem of identifying which layers are most perceptually relevant. In this paper we present a new method for selecting perceptually relevant layers from such a network, based on a neuroscience interpretation of layer behaviour. The selected layers are treated as a hyperparameter to the critic network in a W-GAN. The critic uses the output from these layers in the preliminary stages to extract perceptual information. A video enhancement network is trained adversarially with this critic. Our results show that the introduction of these selected features into the critic yields up to 10% (FID) and 15% (KID) performance increase against other critic networks that do not exploit the idea of optimised feature selection.

Soft labels can result from annotations which account for human uncertainty about categories, or emerge as a natural representation of multiple opinions in annotation. Converting annotations to hard labels results in unambiguous categories for training, at the cost of losing the details about the labels distribution. This work investigates how soft labels can be used, and what benefits they bring in training a SED system. The results show that the system is capable of learning information about the activity of the sounds which is reflected in the soft labels and is able to detect sounds that are missed in the typical binary target training setup. We also release a new dataset produced through crowdsourcing, containing temporally strong labels for sound events in real-life recordings, with both soft and hard labels. ",

Additionally, the efficiency of the proposed methods for solving convex problems is shown in simulations with the presence of adversaries.

    "abstract": "Many mathematical convergence results for gradient descent (GD) based algorithms employ the assumption that the GD process is (almost surely) bounded and, also in concrete numerical simulations, divergence of the GD process may slow down, or even completely rule out, convergence of the error function. In practical relevant learning problems, it thus seems to be advisable to design the ANN architectures in a way so that GD optimization processes remain bounded. The property of the boundedness of GD processes for a given learning problem seems, however, to be closely related to the existence of minimizers in the optimization landscape and, in particular, GD trajectories may escape to infinity if the infimum of the error function (objective function) is not attained in the optimization landscape. This naturally raises the question of the existence of minimizers in the optimization landscape and, in the situation of shallow residual ANNs with multi-dimensional input layers and multi-dimensional hidden layers with the ReLU activation, the main result of this work answers this question affirmatively for a general class of loss functions and all continuous target functions. In our proof of this statement, we propose a kind of closure of the search space, where the limits are called generalized responses, and, thereafter, we provide sufficient criteria for the loss function and the underlying probability distribution which ensure that all additional artificial generalized responses are suboptimal which finally allows us to conclude the existence of minimizers in the optimization landscape.

    "abstract": "For emergency response scenarios like firefighting in urban environments, there is a need to both localize emergency responders inside the building and also support a high bandwidth communication link between the responders and a command-and-control center. The emergency networks for such scenarios can be established with the quick deployment of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). Further, the 3D mobility of UAVs can be leveraged to improve the quality of the wireless link by maneuvering them into advantageous locations. This has motivated recent propagation measurement campaigns to study low-altitude air-to-ground channels in both 5G-sub6 GHz and 5G-mmWave bands. In this paper, we develop a model for the link in a UAV-assisted emergency location and/or communication system. Specifically, given the importance of Line-of-Sight (LoS) links in localization as well as mmWave communication, we derive a closed-form expression for the LoS probability. This probability is parameterized by the UAV base station location, the size of the building, and the size of the window that offers the best propagation path. An expression for coverage probability is also derived. The LoS probability and coverage probabilities derived in this paper can be used to analyze the outdoor UAV-to-indoor propagation environment to determine optimal UAV positioning and the number of UAVs needed to achieve the desired performance of the emergency network.

On the other hand, we show that there are 2-degenerate graphs that do not admit any straight-line drawing with a decomposition of the edge set into 2 plane graphs. That is, there are 2-degenerate graphs with geometric thickness, and hence geometric arboricity, at least 3.

    "abstract": "More than half of all fatalities on U.S. highways occur due to roadway departure (RwD) each year. Previous research has explored various risk factors that contribute to RwD crashes, however, a comprehensive investigation considering the effect of lighting conditions has been insufficiently addressed. Using the Louisiana Department of Transportation and Development crash database, fatal and injury RwD crashes occurring on rural two-lane (R2L) highways between 2008-2017 were analyzed based on daylight and dark (with/without streetlight). This research employed a safe system approach to explore meaningful complex interactions among multidimensional crash risk factors. To accomplish this, an unsupervised data mining algorithm association rules mining (ARM) was utilized. Based on the generated rules, the findings reveal several interesting crash patterns in the daylight, dark-with-streetlight, and dark-no-streetlight, emphasizing the importance of investigating RwD crash patterns depending on the lighting conditions. In daylight, fatal RwD crashes are associated with cloudy weather conditions, distracted drivers, standing water on the roadway, no seat belt use, and construction zones. In dark lighting conditions (with/without streetlight), the majority of the RwD crashes are associated with alcohol/drug involvement, young drivers (15-24 years), driver condition (e.g., inattentive, distracted, illness/fatigued/asleep) and colliding with animal (s). The findings reveal how certain driver behavior patterns are connected to RwD crashes, such as a strong association between alcohol/drug intoxication and no seat belt usage in the dark-no-streetlight condition. Based on the identified crash patterns and behavioral characteristics under different lighting conditions, the findings could aid researchers and safety specialists in developing the most effective RwD crash mitigation strategies.

    "abstract": "Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) are recognized with great potential to strengthen wireless security, yet the performance gain largely depends on the deployment location of RISs in the network topology. In this paper, we consider the anti-eavesdropping communication established through a RIS at a fixed location, as well as an aerial platform mounting another RIS and a friendly jammer to further improve the secrecy. The aerial RIS helps enhance the legitimate signal and the aerial cooperative jamming is strengthened through the fixed RIS. The security gain with aerial reflection and jamming is further improved with the optimized deployment of the aerial platform. We particularly consider the imperfect channel state information issue and address the worst-case secrecy for robust performance. The formulated robust secrecy rate maximization problem is decomposed into two layers, where the inner layer solves for reflection and jamming with robust optimization, and the outer layer tackles the aerial deployment through deep reinforcement learning. Simulation results show the deployment under different network topologies and demonstrate the performance superiority of our proposal in terms of the worst-case security provisioning as compared with the baselines.
