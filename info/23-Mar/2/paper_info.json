    "title": "Decentralized Model Dissemination Empowered Federated Learning in mmWave  Aerial-Terrestrial Integrated Networks",
    "abstract": "It is anticipated that aerial-terrestrial integrated networks incorporating unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) mounted relays will offer improved coverage and connectivity in the beyond 5G era. Meanwhile, federated learning (FL) is a promising distributed machine learning technique for building inference models over wireless networks due to its ability to maintain user privacy and reduce communication overhead. However, off-the-shelf FL models aggregate global parameters at a central parameter server (CPS), increasing energy consumption and latency, as well as inefficiently utilizing radio resource blocks (RRBs) for distributed user devices (UDs). This paper presents a resource-efficient FL framework, called FedMoD (\\textbf{fed}erated learning with \\textbf{mo}del \\textbf{d}issemination), for millimeter-wave (mmWave) aerial-terrestrial integrated networks with the following two unique characteristics. Firstly, FedMoD presents a novel decentralized model dissemination algorithm that makes use of UAVs as local model aggregators through UAV-to-UAV and device-to-device (D2D) communications. As a result, FedMoD (i) increases the number of participant UDs in developing FL model and (ii) achieves global model aggregation without involving CPS. Secondly, FedMoD reduces the energy consumption of FL using radio resource management (RRM) under the constraints of over-the-air learning latency. In order to achieve this, by leveraging graph theory, FedMoD optimizes the scheduling of line-of-sight (LOS) UDs to suitable UAVs/RRBs over mmWave links and non-LOS UDs to available LOS UDs via overlay D2D communications. Extensive simulations reveal that decentralized FedMoD offers same convergence rate performance as compared to conventional FL frameworks. ",

    "abstract": "This work considers the problem of Distributed Mean Estimation (DME) over networks with intermittent connectivity, where the goal is to learn a global statistic over the data samples localized across distributed nodes with the help of a central server. To mitigate the impact of intermittent links, nodes can collaborate with their neighbors to compute local consensus which they forward to the central server. In such a setup, the communications between any pair of nodes must satisfy local differential privacy constraints. We study the tradeoff between collaborative relaying and privacy leakage due to the additional data sharing among nodes and, subsequently, propose a novel differentially private collaborative algorithm for DME to achieve the optimal tradeoff. Finally, we present numerical simulations to substantiate our theoretical findings. ",

    "abstract": "Successful deployment in uncertain, real-world environments requires that deep learning models can be efficiently and reliably modified in order to adapt to unexpected issues. However, the current trend toward ever-larger models makes standard retraining procedures an ever-more expensive burden. For this reason, there is growing interest in model editing, which enables computationally inexpensive, interpretable, post-hoc model modifications. While many model editing techniques are promising, research on the properties of edited models is largely limited to evaluation of validation accuracy. The robustness of edited models is an important and yet mostly unexplored topic. In this paper, we employ recently developed techniques from the field of deep learning robustness to investigate both how model editing affects the general robustness of a model, as well as the robustness of the specific behavior targeted by the edit. We find that edits tend to reduce general robustness, but that the degree of degradation depends on the editing algorithm chosen. In particular, robustness is best preserved by more constrained techniques that modify less of the model. Motivated by these observations, we introduce two new model editing algorithms, direct low-rank model editing and 1-layer interpolation (1-LI), which each exhibit strong generalization performance.

Recent works represent the dynamic scene with neural radiance fields for photorealistic view synthesis, while their surface geometry is under-constrained and noisy. Other works introduce surface constraints to the implicit neural representation to disentangle the ambiguity of geometry and appearance field for static scene reconstruction. To bridge the gap between rendering dynamic scenes and recovering static surface geometry, we propose a template-free method to reconstruct surface geometry and appearance using neural implicit representations from multi-view videos. We leverage topology-aware deformation and the signed distance field to learn complex dynamic surfaces via differentiable volume rendering without scene-specific prior knowledge like template models. Furthermore, we propose a novel mask-based ray selection strategy to significantly boost the optimization on challenging time-varying regions. Experiments on different multi-view video datasets demonstrate that our method achieves high-fidelity surface reconstruction as well as photorealistic novel view synthesis. ",

    "abstract": "Gradient-based learning in multi-layer neural networks displays a number of striking features. In particular, the decrease rate of empirical risk is non-monotone even after averaging over large batches. Long plateaus in which one observes barely any progress alternate with intervals of rapid decrease. These successive phases of learning often take place on very different time scales. Finally, models learnt in an early phase are typically `simpler' or `easier to learn' although in a way that is difficult to formalize. Although theoretical explanations of these phenomena have been put forward, each of them captures at best certain specific regimes. In this paper, we study the gradient flow dynamics of a wide two-layer neural network in high-dimension, when data are distributed according to a single-index model (i.e., the target function depends on a one-dimensional projection of the covariates). Based on a mixture of new rigorous results, non-rigorous mathematical derivations, and numerical simulations, we propose a scenario for the learning dynamics in this setting. In particular, the proposed evolution exhibits separation of timescales and intermittency. These behaviors arise naturally because the population gradient flow can be recast as a singularly perturbed dynamical system. ",

For the class of all planar graphs the best known upper bound on the size of a universal point set is quadratic and the best known lower bound is linear in $n$. Some classes of planar graphs are known to admit universal point sets of near linear size, however, there are no truly linear bounds for interesting classes beyond outerplanar graphs. In this paper, we show that there is a universal point set of size $2n-2$ for the class of bipartite planar graphs with $n$ vertices. The same point set is also universal for the class of $n$-vertex planar graphs of maximum degree $3$. The point set used for the results is what we call an exploding double chain, and we prove that this point set allows planar straight-line embeddings of many more planar graphs, namely of all subgraphs of planar graphs admitting a one-sided Hamiltonian cycle. The result for bipartite graphs also implies that every $n$-vertex plane graph has a $1$-bend drawing all whose bends and vertices are contained in a specific point set of size $4n-6$, this improves a bound of $6n-10$ for the same problem by L\\\"offler and T\\'oth.

P systems on the other hand are classically introduced as a model of hierarchical multiset rewriting. However, over the years the community has proposed a wide range of P system variants including diverse ingredients suited for various needs. In this work, we propose a new variant -- Boolean P systems -- specifically designed for reasoning about sequential controllability of Boolean networks, and use it to first establish a crisp formalization of the problem, and then to prove that the problem of sequential controllability is PSPACE-complete. We further claim that Boolean P systems are a demonstration of how P systems can be used to construct ad hoc formalisms, custom-tailored for reasoning about specific problems, and providing new advantageous points of view.

    "abstract": "Single-shot auctions are commonly used as a means to sell goods, for example when selling ad space or allocating radio frequencies, however devising mechanisms for auctions with multiple bidders and multiple items can be complicated. It has been shown that neural networks can be used to approximate optimal mechanisms while satisfying the constraints that an auction be strategyproof and individually rational. We show that despite such auctions maximizing revenue, they do so at the cost of revealing private bidder information. While randomness is often used to build in privacy, in this context it comes with complications if done without care. Specifically, it can violate rationality and feasibility constraints, fundamentally change the incentive structure of the mechanism, and/or harm top-level metrics such as revenue and social welfare. We propose a method that employs stochasticity to improve privacy while meeting the requirements for auction mechanisms with only a modest sacrifice in revenue. We analyze the cost to the auction house that comes with introducing varying degrees of privacy in common auction settings. Our results show that despite current neural auctions' ability to approximate optimal mechanisms, the resulting vulnerability that comes with relying on neural networks must be accounted for. ",

We argue modern deep representation learning models are ill-posed with collider bias behaviour; a source of bias producing entanglement between generating variables. Under the rubric of causality, we show this issue can be explained and reconciled under the condition of identifiability; attainable under supervision or a weak-form of it. For this, we propose regularization by identification (ReI), a regularization framework defined by the identification of the causal queries involved in the learning problem. Empirical evidence shows that enforcing ReI in a variational framework results in disentangled representations equipped with generalization capabilities to out-of-distribution examples and that aligns nicely with the true expected effect between generating variables and measurement apparatus.

To address this issue, we propose a lightweight 3D dynamic obstacle detection and tracking (DODT) method based on an RGB-D camera. Our method adopts a novel ensemble detection strategy, combining multiple computationally efficient but low-accuracy detectors to achieve real-time high-accuracy obstacle detection. Besides, we introduce a new feature-based data association method to prevent mismatches and use the Kalman filter with the constant acceleration model to track detected obstacles. In addition, our system includes an optional and auxiliary learning-based module to enhance the obstacle detection range and dynamic obstacle identification. The users can determine whether or not to run this module based on the available computation resources. The proposed method is implemented in a lightweight quadcopter, and the experiments prove that the algorithm can make the robot detect dynamic obstacles and navigate dynamic environments safely. ",

While directly inferring all parameters of the underlying yarn model based on a single neural network may seem an intuitive choice, we show that the complexity of yarn structures in terms of twisting and migration characteristics of the involved fibers can be better encountered in terms of ensembles of networks that focus on individual characteristics. We analyze the effect of different loss functions including a parameter loss to penalize the deviation of inferred parameters to ground truth annotations, a reconstruction loss to enforce similar statistics of the image generated for the estimated parameters in comparison to training images as well as an additional regularization term to explicitly penalize deviations between latent codes of synthetic images and the average latent code of real images in the latent space of the encoder. We demonstrate that the combination of a carefully designed parametric, procedural yarn model with respective network ensembles as well as loss functions even allows robust parameter inference when solely trained on synthetic data. Since our approach relies on the availability of a yarn database with parameter annotations and we are not aware of such a respectively available dataset, we additionally provide, to the best of our knowledge, the first dataset of yarn images with annotations regarding the respective yarn parameters. For this purpose, we use a novel yarn generator that improves the realism of the produced results over previous approaches. ",

    "abstract": "This paper investigates the problem of securing exponentially fast consensus (exponential consensus for short) for identical agents with finite-dimensional linear system dynamics over dynamic network topology. Our aim is to find the weakest possible conditions that guarantee exponentially fast consensus using a Lyapunov function consisting of a sum of terms of the same functional form. We first investigate necessary conditions, starting by examining the system (both agent and network) parameters. It is found that controllability of the linear agents is necessary for reaching consensus. Then, to work out necessary conditions incorporating the network topology, we construct a set of Laplacian matrix-valued functions. The precompactness of this set of functions is shown to be a significant generalization of existing assumptions on network topology, including the common assumption that the edge weights are bounded piecewise constant functions or continuous functions. With the aid of such a precompactness assumption and restricting the Lyapunov function to one consisting of a sum of terms of the same functional form, we prove that a joint $(\\delta, T)$-connectivity condition on the network topology is necessary for exponential consensus. Finally, we investigate how the above two ``necessities'' work together to guarantee exponential consensus. To partially address this problem, we define a synchronization index to characterize the interplay between agent parameters and network topology. Based on this notion, it is shown that by designing a proper feedback matrix and under the precompactness assumption, exponential consensus can be reached globally and uniformly if the joint $(\\delta,T)$-connectivity and controllability conditions are satisfied, and the synchronization index is not less than one.

Most of the existing single-node GNN training systems are capable of training medium-scale graphs with tens of millions of edges; however, scaling them to large-scale graphs with billions of edges remains challenging. In addition, it is challenging to map GNN training algorithms onto a computation node as state-of-the-art machines feature heterogeneous architecture consisting of multiple processors and a variety of accelerators. We propose HyScale-GNN, a novel system to train GNN models on a single-node heterogeneous architecture. HyScale- GNN performs hybrid training which utilizes both the processors and the accelerators to train a model collaboratively. Our system design overcomes the memory size limitation of existing works and is optimized for training GNNs on large-scale graphs. We propose a two-stage data pre-fetching scheme to reduce the communication overhead during GNN training. To improve task mapping efficiency, we propose a dynamic resource management mechanism, which adjusts the workload assignment and resource allocation during runtime. We evaluate HyScale-GNN on a CPU-GPU and a CPU-FPGA heterogeneous architecture. Using several large-scale datasets and two widely-used GNN models, we compare the performance of our design with a multi-GPU baseline implemented in PyTorch-Geometric. The CPU-GPU design and the CPU-FPGA design achieve up to 2.08x speedup and 12.6x speedup, respectively.

Graph neural network (GNN) has recently been widely used for link prediction. However, existing GNN based link prediction (GNN-LP) methods suffer from scalability problem during training for large-scale graphs, which has received little attention by researchers. In this paper, we first give computation complexity analysis of existing GNN-LP methods, which reveals that the scalability problem stems from their symmetric learning strategy adopting the same class of GNN models to learn representation for both head and tail nodes. Then we propose a novel method, called asymmetric learning (AML), for GNN-LP. The main idea of AML is to adopt a GNN model for learning head node representation while using a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) model for learning tail node representation. Furthermore, AML proposes a row-wise sampling strategy to generate mini-batch for training, which is a necessary component to make the asymmetric learning strategy work for training speedup. To the best of our knowledge, AML is the first GNN-LP method adopting an asymmetric learning strategy for node representation learning. Experiments on three real large-scale datasets show that AML is 1.7X~7.3X faster in training than baselines with a symmetric learning strategy, while having almost no accuracy loss. ",

    "abstract": "Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs) - such as Siri, Alexa and Google Assistant, to name a few - play an increasingly important role to access information and complete tasks spanning multiple domains, and by diverse groups of users. A text-to-speech (TTS) module allows PDAs to interact in a natural, human-like manner, and play a vital role when the interaction involves people with visual impairments or other disabilities. To cater to the needs of a diverse set of users, inclusive TTS is important to recognize and pronounce correctly text in different languages and dialects. Despite great progress in speech synthesis, the pronunciation accuracy of named entities in a multi-lingual setting still has a large room for improvement. Existing approaches to correct named entity (NE) mispronunciations, like retraining Grapheme-to-Phoneme (G2P) models, or maintaining a TTS pronunciation dictionary, require expensive annotation of the ground truth pronunciation, which is also time consuming. In this work, we present a highly-precise, PDA-compatible pronunciation learning framework for the task of TTS mispronunciation detection and correction. In addition, we also propose a novel mispronunciation detection model called DTW-SiameseNet, which employs metric learning with a Siamese architecture for Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) with triplet loss. We demonstrate that a locale-agnostic, privacy-preserving solution to the problem of TTS mispronunciation detection is feasible. We evaluate our approach on a real-world dataset, and a corpus of NE pronunciations of an anonymized audio dataset of person names recorded by participants from 10 different locales. Human evaluation shows our proposed approach improves pronunciation accuracy on average by ~6% compared to strong phoneme-based and audio-based baselines. ",

    "abstract": "Emerging distributed applications recently boosted the development of decentralized machine learning, especially in IoT and edge computing fields. In real-world scenarios, the common problems of non-convexity and data heterogeneity result in inefficiency, performance degradation, and development stagnation. The bulk of studies concentrates on one of the issues mentioned above without having a more general framework that has been proven optimal. To this end, we propose a unified paradigm called UMP, which comprises two algorithms, D-SUM and GT-DSUM, based on the momentum technique with decentralized stochastic gradient descent(SGD). The former provides a convergence guarantee for general non-convex objectives. At the same time, the latter is extended by introducing gradient tracking, which estimates the global optimization direction to mitigate data heterogeneity(i.e., distribution drift). We can cover most momentum-based variants based on the classical heavy ball or Nesterov's acceleration with different parameters in UMP. In theory, we rigorously provide the convergence analysis of these two approaches for non-convex objectives and conduct extensive experiments, demonstrating a significant improvement in model accuracy by up to 57.6% compared to other methods in practice.

    "abstract": "Recently, a series of Image-Text Matching (ITM) methods achieve impressive performance. However, we observe that most existing ITM models suffer from gradients vanishing at the beginning of training, which makes these models prone to falling into local minima. Most ITM models adopt triplet loss with Hard Negative mining (HN) as the optimization objective. We find that optimizing an ITM model using only the hard negative samples can easily lead to gradient vanishing. In this paper, we derive the condition under which the gradient vanishes during training. When the difference between the positive pair similarity and the negative pair similarity is close to 0, the gradients on both the image and text encoders will approach 0. To alleviate the gradient vanishing problem, we propose a Selectively Hard Negative Mining (SelHN) strategy, which chooses whether to mine hard negative samples according to the gradient vanishing condition. SelHN can be plug-and-play applied to existing ITM models to give them better training behavior. To further ensure the back-propagation of gradients, we construct a Residual Visual Semantic Embedding model with SelHN, denoted as RVSE++. Extensive experiments on two ITM benchmarks demonstrate the strength of RVSE++, achieving state-of-the-art performance. ",

    "abstract": "Achieving efficient and robust multi-channel data learning is a challenging task in data science. By exploiting low-rankness in the transformed domain, i.e., transformed low-rankness, tensor Singular Value Decomposition (t-SVD) has achieved extensive success in multi-channel data representation and has recently been extended to function representation such as Neural Networks with t-product layers (t-NNs). However, it still remains unclear how t-SVD theoretically affects the learning behavior of t-NNs. This paper is the first to answer this question by deriving the upper bounds of the generalization error of both standard and adversarially trained t-NNs. It reveals that the t-NNs compressed by exact transformed low-rank parameterization can achieve a sharper adversarial generalization bound. In practice, although t-NNs rarely have exactly transformed low-rank weights, our analysis further shows that by adversarial training with gradient flow (GF), the over-parameterized t-NNs with ReLU activations are trained with implicit regularization towards transformed low-rank parameterization under certain conditions. We also establish adversarial generalization bounds for t-NNs with approximately transformed low-rank weights. Our analysis indicates that the transformed low-rank parameterization can promisingly enhance robust generalization for t-NNs. ",

To prevent massive facial images from being illegally modified by various deepfake models, it is essential to design a universal deepfake disruptor. However, existing works treat deepfake disruption as an End-to-End process, ignoring the functional difference between feature extraction and image reconstruction, which makes it difficult to generate a cross-model universal disruptor. In this work, we propose a novel Feature-Output ensemble UNiversal Disruptor (FOUND) against deepfake networks, which explores a new opinion that considers attacking feature extractors as the more critical and general task in deepfake disruption. We conduct an effective two-stage disruption process. We first disrupt multi-model feature extractors through multi-feature aggregation and individual-feature maintenance, and then develop a gradient-ensemble algorithm to enhance the disruption effect by simplifying the complex optimization problem of disrupting multiple End-to-End models. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FOUND can significantly boost the disruption effect against ensemble deepfake benchmark models. Besides, our method can fast obtain a cross-attribute, cross-image, and cross-model universal deepfake disruptor with only a few training images, surpassing state-of-the-art universal disruptors in both success rate and efficiency.

    "abstract": "Backdoor inversion, the process of finding a backdoor trigger inserted into a machine learning model, has become the pillar of many backdoor detection and defense methods. Previous works on backdoor inversion often recover the backdoor through an optimization process to flip a support set of clean images into the target class. However, it is rarely studied and understood how large this support set should be to recover a successful backdoor. In this work, we show that one can reliably recover the backdoor trigger with as few as a single image. Specifically, we propose the SmoothInv method, which first constructs a robust smoothed version of the backdoored classifier and then performs guided image synthesis towards the target class to reveal the backdoor pattern. SmoothInv requires neither an explicit modeling of the backdoor via a mask variable, nor any complex regularization schemes, which has become the standard practice in backdoor inversion methods. We perform both quantitaive and qualitative study on backdoored classifiers from previous published backdoor attacks. We demonstrate that compared to existing methods, SmoothInv is able to recover successful backdoors from single images, while maintaining high fidelity to the original backdoor. We also show how we identify the target backdoored class from the backdoored classifier. Last, we propose and analyze two countermeasures to our approach and show that SmoothInv remains robust in the face of an adaptive attacker.

Accurate monitoring of their blood glucose level prevents dangerous and life-threatening situations that might be experienced by those subjects. In addition, precise monitoring of blood glucose levels over long periods of time helps establishing knowledge about the daily mealtime routine which aids the medical staff to monitor subjects and properly intervene in hazardous cases such as hypo- or hyperglycemia. Establishing such knowledge will play a potential role when designing proper treatment intervention plan. In this research, we present a complete IoT framework, starting from hardware acquisition system to data analysis approaches that gives a hand for medical staff when long periods of blood glucose monitoring are essential for subjects. Also, this framework is validated with real-time data collection from 7 subjects over 10 successive days with temporal resolution of 5 minutes allowing for near real-time monitoring and analysis. Our results show the precisely estimated daily mealtime routines for 4 subjects out of the 7 with discard of 3 subjects due to huge data loss mainly. The daily mealtime routines for the 4 subjects are found to be matching to have a pattern of 4 periods of blood glucose level changes corresponding to the breakfast around 8 AM, the lunch around 5 PM, the dinner around 8 PM, and finally a within-day snack around 12 PM.

    "abstract": "Given only a set of images, neural implicit surface representation has shown its capability in 3D surface reconstruction. However, as the nature of per-scene optimization is based on the volumetric rendering of color, previous neural implicit surface reconstruction methods usually fail in low-textured regions, including the floors, walls, etc., which commonly exist for indoor scenes. Being aware of the fact that these low-textured regions usually correspond to planes, without introducing additional ground-truth supervisory signals or making additional assumptions about the room layout, we propose to leverage a novel Pseudo Plane-regularized Signed Distance Field (P$^2$SDF) for indoor scene reconstruction. Specifically, we consider adjacent pixels with similar colors to be on the same pseudo planes. The plane parameters are then estimated on the fly during training by an efficient and effective two-step scheme. Then the signed distances of the points on the planes are regularized by the estimated plane parameters in the training phase. As the unsupervised plane segments are usually noisy and inaccurate, we propose to assign different weights to the sampled points on the plane in plane estimation as well as the regularization loss. The weights come by fusing the plane segments from different views. As the sampled rays in the planar regions are redundant, leading to inefficient training, we further propose a keypoint-guided rays sampling strategy that attends to the informative textured regions with large color variations, and the implicit network gets a better reconstruction, compared with the original uniform ray sampling strategy. Experiments show that our P$^2$SDF achieves competitive reconstruction performance in Manhattan scenes. Further, as we do not introduce any additional room layout assumption, our P$^2$SDF generalizes well to the reconstruction of non-Manhattan scenes. ",

Using the CNN model's input features or internal filters as hypothetical causes, SUNY generates explanations by bi-directional quantifications on both the necessary and sufficient perspectives. Extensive evaluations justify that SUNY not only produces more informative and convincing explanations from the angles of necessity and sufficiency, but also achieves performances competitive to other approaches across different CNN architectures over large-scale datasets, including ILSVRC2012 and CUB-200-2011.

To address these limitations, we introduce ISBNet, a novel cluster-free method that represents instances as kernels and decodes instance masks via dynamic convolution. To efficiently generate high-recall and discriminative kernels, we propose a simple strategy named Instance-aware Farthest Point Sampling to sample candidates and leverage the local aggregation layer inspired by PointNet++ to encode candidate features.

Transfer learning performance of a CNN relies quite strongly on selection of its trainable layers. Selecting the most effective update layers for a certain target dataset often requires expert knowledge on CNN architecture which many practitioners do not posses. General users prefer to use an available architecture (e.g. GoogleNet, ResNet, EfficientNet etc.) that is developed by domain experts. With the ever-growing number of layers, it is increasingly becoming quite difficult and cumbersome to handpick the update layers. Therefore, in this paper we explore the application of genetic algorithm to mitigate this problem. The convolutional layers of popular pretrained networks are often grouped into modules that constitute their building blocks. We devise a genetic algorithm to select blocks of layers for updating the parameters. By experimenting with EfficientNetB0 pre-trained on ImageNet and using Food-101, CIFAR-100 and MangoLeafBD as target datasets, we show that our algorithm yields similar or better results than the baseline in terms of accuracy, and requires lower training and evaluation time due to learning less number of parameters.

Open research issues, challenges, and future directions specific to RPL security are also discussed. A taxonomy of RPL attacks, considering the essential attributes like resources, topology, and traffic, is shown for better understanding.

    "abstract": "Multi-label classification is a natural problem statement for sequential data. We might be interested in the items of the next order by a customer, or types of financial transactions that will occur tomorrow. Most modern approaches focus on transformer architecture for multi-label classification, introducing self-attention for the elements of a sequence with each element being a multi-label vector and supplementary information. However, in this way we loose local information related to interconnections between particular labels. We propose instead to use a self-attention mechanism over labels preceding the predicted step. Conducted experiments suggest that such architecture improves the model performance and provides meaningful attention between labels. The metric such as micro-AUC of our label attention network is $0.9847$ compared to $0.7390$ for vanilla transformers benchmark. ",

    "abstract": "Modern object detectors are vulnerable to adversarial examples, which may bring risks to real-world applications. The sparse attack is an important task which, compared with the popular adversarial perturbation on the whole image, needs to select the potential pixels that is generally regularized by an $\\ell_0$-norm constraint, and simultaneously optimize the corresponding texture. The non-differentiability of $\\ell_0$ norm brings challenges and many works on attacking object detection adopted manually-designed patterns to address them, which are meaningless and independent of objects, and therefore lead to relatively poor attack performance. In this paper, we propose Adversarial Semantic Contour (ASC), an MAP estimate of a Bayesian formulation of sparse attack with a deceived prior of object contour. The object contour prior effectively reduces the search space of pixel selection and improves the attack by introducing more semantic bias. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ASC can corrupt the prediction of 9 modern detectors with different architectures (\\e.g., one-stage, two-stage and Transformer) by modifying fewer than 5\\% of the pixels of the object area in COCO in white-box scenario and around 10\\% of those in black-box scenario. We further extend the attack to datasets for autonomous driving systems to verify the effectiveness. We conclude with cautions about contour being the common weakness of object detectors with various architecture and the care needed in applying them in safety-sensitive scenarios. ",

    "abstract": "Knowledge graph embedding models (KGEMs) are used for various tasks related to knowledge graphs (KGs), including link prediction. They are trained with loss functions that are computed considering a batch of scored triples and their corresponding labels. Traditional approaches consider the label of a triple to be either true or false. However, recent works suggest that all negative triples should not be valued equally. In line with this commonly adopted assumption, we posit that semantically valid negative triples might be high-quality negative triples. As such, loss functions should treat them differently from semantically invalid negative ones. To this aim, we propose semantic-driven versions for the three mostly used loss functions for link prediction. In particular, we treat the scores of negative triples differently by injecting background knowledge about relation domains and ranges into the loss functions. In an extensive and controlled experimental setting, we show that the proposed loss functions systematically provide satisfying results on three public benchmark KGs underpinned with different schemas, which demonstrates both the generality and superiority of our proposed approach. In fact, the proposed loss functions do not only lead to better MRR and Hits@10 values, but also drive KGEMs towards better semantic awareness. This highlights that semantic information globally improves KGEMs, and thus should be incorporated into loss functions whenever such information is available. ",

It consists of two self-supervised pre-training tasks: masked image modeling and masked language modeling, based on text region-level image masking. The proposed method randomly masks some image regions according to the bounding box coordinates of text words. The objectives of our pre-training tasks are reconstructing the pixels of masked image regions and the corresponding masked tokens simultaneously. Hence the pre-trained encoder can capture more textual semantics in comparison to the masked image modeling that usually predicts the masked image patches. Compared to the masked multi-modal modeling methods for document image understanding that rely on both the image and text modalities, StrucTexTv2 models image-only input and potentially deals with more application scenarios free from OCR pre-processing. Extensive experiments on mainstream benchmarks of document image understanding demonstrate the effectiveness of StrucTexTv2. It achieves competitive or even new state-of-the-art performance in various downstream tasks such as image classification, layout analysis, table structure recognition, document OCR, and information extraction under the end-to-end scenario.

However, their robustness and abilities to handle various complexities of the open world have yet to be explored, which is especially crucial in assessing the stability of models and is a key aspect of trustworthy AI. In this study, we perform a comprehensive experimental analysis of GPT-3.5, exploring its robustness using 21 datasets (about 116K test samples) with 66 text transformations from TextFlint that cover 9 popular Natural Language Understanding (NLU) tasks. Our findings indicate that while GPT-3.5 outperforms existing fine-tuned models on some tasks, it still encounters significant robustness degradation, such as its average performance dropping by up to 35.74\\% and 43.59\\% in natural language inference and sentiment analysis tasks, respectively. We also show that GPT-3.5 faces some specific robustness challenges, including robustness instability, prompt sensitivity, and number sensitivity. These insights are valuable for understanding its limitations and guiding future research in addressing these challenges to enhance GPT-3.5's overall performance and generalization abilities. ",

    "abstract": "Recognizing already explored places (a.k.a. place recognition) is a fundamental task in Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) to enable robot relocalization and loop closure detection. In topological SLAM the recognition takes place by comparing a signature (or feature vector) associated to the current node with the signatures of the nodes in the known map. However, as the number of nodes increases, matching the current node signature against all the existing ones becomes inefficient and thwarts real-time navigation. In this paper we propose a novel approach to pre-select a subset of map nodes for place recognition. The map nodes are clustered during exploration and each cluster is associated with a region. The region labels become the prediction targets of a deep neural network and, during navigation, only the nodes associated with the regions predicted with high probability are considered for matching. While the proposed technique can be integrated in different SLAM approaches, in this work we describe an effective integration with RTAB-Map (a popular framework for real-time topological SLAM) which allowed us to design and run several experiments to demonstrate its effectiveness.

Our method, termed as BiSVP, represents a building instance with ordered vertices and formulates the building footprint extraction as predicting the serialized vertices directly in a bidirectional fashion. Moreover, we propose a cross-scale feature fusion (CSFF) module to facilitate high resolution and rich semantic feature learning, which is essential for the dense building vertex prediction task. Without bells and whistles, our BiSVP outperforms state-of-the-art methods by considerable margins on three building instance segmentation benchmarks, clearly demonstrating its superiority.

The RNR-Map has a grid form and consists of latent codes at each pixel. These latent codes are embedded from image observations, and can be converted to the neural radiance field which enables image rendering given a camera pose. The recorded latent codes implicitly contain visual information about the environment, which makes the RNR-Map visually descriptive. This visual information in RNR-Map can be a useful guideline for visual localization and navigation. We develop localization and navigation frameworks that can effectively utilize the RNR-Map. We evaluate the proposed frameworks on camera tracking, visual localization, and image-goal navigation. Experimental results show that the RNR-Map-based localization framework can find the target location based on a single query image with fast speed and competitive accuracy compared to other baselines. Also, this localization framework is robust to environmental changes, and even finds the most visually similar places when a query image from a different environment is given. The proposed navigation framework outperforms the existing image-goal navigation methods in difficult scenarios, under odometry and actuation noises. The navigation framework shows 65.7% success rate in curved scenarios of the NRNS dataset, which is an improvement of 18.6% over the current state-of-the-art. ",

    "abstract": "Enhancing the expressive capacity of deep learning-based time series models with self-supervised pre-training has become ever-increasingly prevalent in time series classification. Even though numerous efforts have been devoted to developing self-supervised models for time series data, we argue that the current methods are not sufficient to learn optimal time series representations due to solely unidirectional encoding over sparse point-wise input units. In this work, we propose TimeMAE, a novel self-supervised paradigm for learning transferrable time series representations based on transformer networks. The distinct characteristics of the TimeMAE lie in processing each time series into a sequence of non-overlapping sub-series via window-slicing partitioning, followed by random masking strategies over the semantic units of localized sub-series. Such a simple yet effective setting can help us achieve the goal of killing three birds with one stone, i.e., (1) learning enriched contextual representations of time series with a bidirectional encoding scheme; (2) increasing the information density of basic semantic units; (3) efficiently encoding representations of time series using transformer networks. Nevertheless, it is a non-trivial to perform reconstructing task over such a novel formulated modeling paradigm. To solve the discrepancy issue incurred by newly injected masked embeddings, we design a decoupled autoencoder architecture, which learns the representations of visible (unmasked) positions and masked ones with two different encoder modules, respectively. Furthermore, we construct two types of informative targets to accomplish the corresponding pretext tasks. One is to create a tokenizer module that assigns a codeword to each masked region, allowing the masked codeword classification (MCC) task to be completed effectively... ",

Our approach defines a convolution-like operation and ensures equivariance based on our proposed scalable Fourier-Argand representation. The method maintains similar efficiency as a traditional network and hardly introduces any additional learnable parameters, since it does not face the computational issue that often occurs in group-convolution operators. We validate the efficacy of our approach in the image classification task, demonstrating its robustness and the generalization ability to both scaled and rotated inputs. ",

    "abstract": "Moving Target Defense and Cyber Deception emerged in recent years as two key proactive cyber defense approaches, contrasting with the static nature of the traditional reactive cyber defense. The key insight behind these approaches is to impose an asymmetric disadvantage for the attacker by using deception and randomization techniques to create a dynamic attack surface. Moving Target Defense typically relies on system randomization and diversification, while Cyber Deception is based on decoy nodes and fake systems to deceive attackers. However, current Moving Target Defense techniques are complex to manage and can introduce high overheads, while Cyber Deception nodes are easily recognized and avoided by adversaries. This paper presents DOLOS, a novel architecture that unifies Cyber Deception and Moving Target Defense approaches. DOLOS is motivated by the insight that deceptive techniques are much more powerful when integrated into production systems rather than deployed alongside them. DOLOS combines typical Moving Target Defense techniques, such as randomization, diversity, and redundancy, with cyber deception and seamlessly integrates them into production systems through multiple layers of isolation. We extensively evaluate DOLOS against a wide range of attackers, ranging from automated malware to professional penetration testers, and show that DOLOS is highly effective in slowing down attacks and protecting the integrity of production systems. We also provide valuable insights and considerations for the future development of MTD techniques based on our findings. ",

We explore three approaches to add contrastive supervision to the latent features of the bottleneck layer in the U-Nets encoding the multimodal images and evaluate three different critic functions. Our results show that representations learned without additional supervision on latent features perform best in the downstream task of registration on two public biomedical datasets. We investigate the performance drop by exploiting recent insights in contrastive learning in classification and self-supervised learning.

    "abstract": "Open-World Compositional Zero-Shot Learning (OW-CZSL) aims to recognize new compositions of seen attributes and objects. In OW-CZSL, methods built on the conventional closed-world setting degrade severely due to the unconstrained OW test space. While previous works alleviate the issue by pruning compositions according to external knowledge or correlations in seen pairs, they introduce biases that harm the generalization. Some methods thus predict state and object with independently constructed and trained classifiers, ignoring that attributes are highly context-dependent and visually entangled with objects. In this paper, we propose a novel Distilled Reverse Attention Network to address the challenges. We also model attributes and objects separately but with different motivations, capturing contextuality and locality, respectively. We further design a reverse-and-distill strategy that learns disentangled representations of elementary components in training data supervised by reverse attention and knowledge distillation. We conduct experiments on three datasets and consistently achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. ",

Providing lightweight and real-time anomaly detection for open-ended time series is highly desirable to industry and organizations since it allows immediate response and avoids potential financial loss. In the last few years, several real-time time series anomaly detection approaches have been introduced. However, they might exhaust system resources when they are applied to open-ended time series for a long time. To address this issue, in this paper we propose RePAD2, a lightweight real-time anomaly detection approach for open-ended time series by improving its predecessor RePAD, which is one of the state-of-the-art anomaly detection approaches. We conducted a series of experiments to compare RePAD2 with RePAD and another similar detection approach based on real-world time series datasets, and demonstrated that RePAD2 can address the mentioned resource exhaustion issue while offering comparable detection accuracy and slightly less time consumption.

    "abstract": "The approximate solution of the Cauchy problem for second-order evolution equations is performed, first of all, using three-level time approximations. Such approximations are easily constructed and relatively uncomplicated to investigate when using uniform time grids. When solving applied problems numerically, we should focus on approximations with variable time steps. When using multilevel schemes on non-uniform grids, we should maintain accuracy by choosing appropriate approximations and ensuring the approximate solution's stability. In this paper, we construct unconditionally stable first- and second-order accuracy schemes on a non-uniform time grid for the approximate solution of the Cauchy problem for a second-order evolutionary equation. We use a special transformation of the original second-order differential-operator equation to a system of first-order equations. For the system of first-order equations, we apply standard two-level time approximations. We obtained stability estimates for the initial data and the right-hand side in finite-dimensional Hilbert space. Eliminating auxiliary variables leads to three-level schemes for the initial second-order evolution equation. Numerical experiments were performed for the test problem for a one-dimensional in space bi-parabolic equation. The accuracy and stability properties of the constructed schemes are demonstrated on non-uniform grids with randomly varying grid steps. ",

    "abstract": "The easy and accurate identification of varieties is fundamental in agriculture, especially in the olive sector, where more than 1200 olive varieties are currently known worldwide. Varietal misidentification leads to many potential problems for all the actors in the sector: farmers and nursery workers may establish the wrong variety, leading to its maladaptation in the field; olive oil and table olive producers may label and sell a non-authentic product; consumers may be misled; and breeders may commit errors during targeted crossings between different varieties. To date, the standard for varietal identification and certification consists of two methods: morphological classification and genetic analysis. The morphological classification consists of the visual pairwise comparison of different organs of the olive tree, where the most important organ is considered to be the endocarp. In contrast, different methods for genetic classification exist (RAPDs, SSR, and SNP). Both classification methods present advantages and disadvantages. Visual morphological classification requires highly specialized personnel and is prone to human error. Genetic identification methods are more accurate but incur a high cost and are difficult to implement. This paper introduces OliVaR, a novel approach to olive varietal identification. OliVaR uses a teacher-student deep learning architecture to learn the defining characteristics of the endocarp of each specific olive variety and perform classification. We construct what is, to the best of our knowledge, the largest olive variety dataset to date, comprising image data for 131 varieties from the Mediterranean basin. We thoroughly test OliVaR on this dataset and show that it correctly predicts olive varieties with over 86% accuracy. ",

To that end, we propose a principled method, dubbed as \\ours, which unifies the two learning schemes by incorporating a well-justified group fairness metric into the training objective using a class wise distributionally robust optimization (DRO) framework. We then develop an iterative optimization algorithm that minimizes the resulting objective by automatically producing the correct re-weights for each group. Our experiments show that FairDRO is scalable and easily adaptable to diverse applications, and consistently achieves the state-of-the-art performance on several benchmark datasets in terms of the accuracy-fairness trade-off, compared to recent strong baselines.

By transferring knowledge from the pre-trained language model and obtaining richer information from the ASR decoding space, the proposed approach outperforms a strong Conformer-Transducer baseline. Another issue with standard error correction is that the generation process is not well-guided.

This design focuses on efficiency in terms of performance and computational complexity under the adverse effects of time variation and mobility of sources, the presence of multiuser and multipath components, or simply multi-clusters, and the near-far effect. The design is also suitable for hybrid beamforming and frequency-selective channels. In the proposed system, channel parameters are estimated in time-domain duplex (TDD) uplink mode using a per-cluster approach rather than a joint approach, which significantly reduces the complexity. Per-cluster estimation is possible thanks to the proposed interference-aware statistical beamforming method, namely reduced dimensional Generalized Eigenbeamformer (RD-GEB), which undertakes the computational load of interference mitigation and enables a simpler design for the remaining stages. In addition, the overall design is based on the separation of channel parameters as fast-time and slow-time, leaving only the instantaneous channel estimation and channel matched filtering as fast-time operations, which are handled inside cluster-specific reduced dimensional subspaces. Beam tracking and beamformer construction are held in slow-time rarely, which reduces the time-averaged complexity. Furthermore, beam tracking is performed by leveraging a batch of instantaneous channel estimates, which removes the need for an additional training process. The proposed low-complexity design is shown to outperform the conventional methods. ",

In fact, various types of surgical procedures are performed by emergency medical teams after sudden-onset disasters, such as soft tissue wounds, orthopaedic traumas, abdominal surgeries, etc. HMD-based Augmented Reality (AR), using state-of-the-art hardware such as the Magic Leap or the Microsoft HoloLens, have long been foreseen as a key enabler for clinicians in surgical use cases, especially for procedures performed outside of the operating room. This paper describes the Use Case (UC) \"AR-assisted emergency surgical care\", identified in the context of the 5G-EPICENTRE EU-funded project. Specifically, the UC will experiment with holographic AR technology for emergency medical surgery teams, by overlaying deformable medical models directly on top of the patient body parts, effectively enabling surgeons to see inside (visualizing bones, blood vessels, etc.) and perform surgical actions following step-by-step instructions. The goal is to combine the computational and data-intensive nature of AR and Computer Vision algorithms with upcoming 5G network architectures deployed for edge computing so as to satisfy real-time interaction requirements and provide an efficient and powerful platform for the pervasive promotion of such applications. By developing the necessary Virtual Network Functions (VNFs) to manage data-intensive services (e.g., prerendering, caching, compression) and by exploiting available network resources and Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC) support, provided by the 5G-EPICENTRE infrastructure, this UC aims to provide powerful AR-based tools, usable on site, to first-aid responders.

ASP consists of two components: Distributional Exploration, which enhances the solver's ability to handle unknown distributions using Policy Space Response Oracles, and Persistent Scale Adaption, which improves scalability through curriculum learning. We have tested ASP on several challenging COPs, including the traveling salesman problem, the vehicle routing problem, and the prize collecting TSP, as well as the real-world instances from TSPLib and CVRPLib. Our results show that even with the same model size and weak training signal, ASP can help neural solvers explore and adapt to unseen distributions and varying scales, achieving superior performance. In particular, compared with the same neural solvers under a standard training pipeline, ASP produces a remarkable decrease in terms of the optimality gap with 90.9% and 47.43% on generated instances and real-world instances for TSP, and a decrease of 19% and 45.57% for CVRP.

In particular, orchards are a difficult case study due to structural similarity across the entire field. In this work, we address the place recognition problem in orchards resorting to 3D LiDAR data, which is considered a key modality for robustness. Hence, we propose ORCHNet, a deep-learning-based approach that maps 3D-LiDAR scans to global descriptors. Specifically, this work proposes a new global feature aggregation approach, which fuses multiple aggregation methods into a robust global descriptor. ORCHNet is evaluated on real-world data collected in orchards, comprising data from the summer and autumn seasons. To assess the robustness, We compare ORCHNet with state-of-the-art aggregation approaches on data from the same season and across seasons. Moreover, we additionally evaluate the proposed approach as part of a localization framework, where ORCHNet is used as a loop closure detector. The empirical results indicate that, on the place recognition task, ORCHNet outperforms the remaining approaches, and is also more robust across seasons. As for the localization, the edge cases where the path goes through the trees are solved when integrating ORCHNet as a loop detector, showing the potential applicability of the proposed approach in this task.

Existing federated GNN studies mainly focus on systems where clients hold distinctive graphs or sub-graphs. The practical node-level federated situation, where each client is only aware of its direct neighbors, has yet to be studied. In this paper, we propose the first federated GNN framework called Lumos that supports supervised and unsupervised learning with feature and degree protection on node-level federated graphs. We first design a tree constructor to improve the representation capability given the limited structural information. We further present a Monte Carlo Markov Chain-based algorithm to mitigate the workload imbalance caused by degree heterogeneity with theoretically-guaranteed performance. Based on the constructed tree for each client, a decentralized tree-based GNN trainer is proposed to support versatile training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Lumos outperforms the baseline with significantly higher accuracy and greatly reduced communication cost and training time. ",

Meanwhile, some works lack the consideration of the diverse cellular traffic patterns, result in suboptimal prediction results. In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning network architecture, Adaptive Hybrid Spatial-Temporal Graph Neural Network (AHSTGNN), to tackle the cellular traffic prediction problem. First, we apply adaptive hybrid graph learning to learn the compound spatial correlations among cell towers. Second, we implement a Temporal Convolution Module with multi-periodic temporal data input to capture the nonlinear temporal dependencies. In addition, we introduce an extra Spatial-Temporal Adaptive Module to conquer the heterogeneity lying in cell towers.

Existing methods generally take the raw video as the ground truth and extract practical information from consecutive frames containing various artifacts. However, they do not fully exploit the valid information of compressed and raw videos to guide the quality enhancement for compressed videos. In this paper, we propose a unique Valid Information Guidance scheme (VIG) to enhance the quality of compressed videos by mining valid information from both compressed videos and raw videos. Specifically, we propose an efficient framework, Compressed Redundancy Filtering (CRF) network, to balance speed and enhancement. After removing the redundancy by filtering the information, CRF can use the valid information of the compressed video to reconstruct the texture. Furthermore, we propose a progressive Truth Guidance Distillation (TGD) strategy, which does not need to design additional teacher models and distillation loss functions. By only using the ground truth as input to guide the model to aggregate the correct spatio-temporal correspondence across the raw frames, TGD can significantly improve the enhancement effect without increasing the extra training cost. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves the state-of-the-art performance of compressed video quality enhancement in terms of accuracy and efficiency. ",

    "title": "Semi-decentralized Inference in Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks for  Traffic Demand Forecasting: An Edge-Computing Approach",
    "abstract": "Accurate and timely prediction of transportation demand and supply is essential for improving customer experience and raising the provider's profit. Recently, graph neural networks (GNNs) have been shown promising in predicting traffic demand and supply in small city regions. This awes their capability in modeling both a node's historical features and its relational information with other nodes. However, more efficient taxi demand and supply forecasting can still be achieved by following two main routes. First, is extending the scale of the prediction graph to include more regions. Second, is the simultaneous exploitation of multiple node and edge types to better expose and exploit the complex and diverse set of relations in a traffic system. Nevertheless, the applicability of both approaches is challenged by the scalability of system-wide GNN training and inference. An immediate remedy to the scalability challenge is to decentralize the GNN operation. However, decentralizing GNN operation creates excessive node-to-node communication overhead which hinders the potential of this approach. In this paper, we propose a semi-decentralized approach based on the use of multiple, moderately sized, and high-throughout cloudlet communication networks on the edge. This approach combines the best features of the centralized and decentralized settings; it may minimize the inter-cloudlet communication thereby alleviating the communication overhead of the decentralized approach while promoting scalability due to cloudlet-level decentralization. Also, we propose a heterogeneous GNN-LSTM algorithm for improved taxi-level demand and supply forecasting. This approach allows for handling dynamic taxi graphs where nodes are taxis. Through a set of experiments over real data, we show the advantage of the semi-decentralized approach as tested over our GNN-LSTM algorithm for taxi demand and supply prediction. ",

    "abstract": "Visual comparison is an important task in the analysis of multivariate graphs. However, comparison of topological features of a graph with respect to its data attributes for different portions of the data remains challenging because there is no single visual representation that would suit the dynamic nature of comparative analyses. To facilitate the visual comparison in node-link diagrams, we propose the comparison lens as a focus+context approach for dynamic layout adaptation. The core idea is to start with a topology-driven layout and locally inject an attribute-driven layout based on the multivariate similarity of node attributes. This facilitates comparison tasks on a local level while preserving the user's overall mental map of the graph topology. Additional visual enhancements, including color-coding, reduction of edge clutter, and radial guides, further support the comparison. To fit the lens to different comparison situations, it can be configured via user-controllable parameters. To demonstrate the utility of our approach, we use it for comparison in a real-world dataset of soccer players. ",

In this paper, we propose an end-to-end framework for oriented object detection, which simplifies the model pipeline and obtains superior performance. Our framework is based on DETR, with the box regression head replaced with a points prediction head. The learning of points is more flexible, and the distribution of points can reflect the angle and size of the target rotated box. We further propose to decouple the query features into classification and regression features, which significantly improves the model precision. Aerial images usually contain thousands of instances. To better balance model precision and efficiency, we propose a novel dynamic query design, which reduces the number of object queries in stacked decoder layers without sacrificing model performance. Finally, we rethink the label assignment strategy of existing DETR-like detectors and propose an effective label re-assignment strategy for improved performance. We name our method D2Q-DETR. Experiments on the largest and challenging DOTA-v1.0 and DOTA-v1.5 datasets show that D2Q-DETR outperforms existing NMS-based and NMS-free oriented object detection methods and achieves the new state-of-the-art.

    "abstract": "AI-based monitoring has become crucial for cloud-based services due to its scale. A common approach to AI-based monitoring is to detect causal relationships among service components and build a causal graph. Availability of domain information makes cloud systems even better suited for such causal detection approaches. In modern cloud systems, however, auto-scalers dynamically change the number of microservice instances, and a load-balancer manages the load on each instance. This poses a challenge for off-the-shelf causal structure detection techniques as they neither incorporate the system architectural domain information nor provide a way to model distributed compute across varying numbers of service instances. To address this, we develop CausIL, which detects a causal structure among service metrics by considering compute distributed across dynamic instances and incorporating domain knowledge derived from system architecture. Towards the application in cloud systems, CausIL estimates a causal graph using instance-specific variations in performance metrics, modeling multiple instances of a service as independent, conditional on system assumptions. Simulation study shows the efficacy of CausIL over baselines by improving graph estimation accuracy by ~25% as measured by Structural Hamming Distance whereas the real-world dataset demonstrates CausIL's applicability in deployment settings.

Integrating SAM with adaptive learning rate and momentum acceleration, dubbed AdaSAM, has already been explored empirically to train large-scale deep neural networks without theoretical guarantee due to the triple difficulties in analyzing the coupled perturbation step, adaptive learning rate and momentum step. In this paper, we try to analyze the convergence rate of AdaSAM in the stochastic non-convex setting. We theoretically show that AdaSAM admits a $\\mathcal{O}(1/\\sqrt{bT})$ convergence rate, which achieves linear speedup property with respect to mini-batch size $b$. Specifically, to decouple the stochastic gradient steps with the adaptive learning rate and perturbed gradient, we introduce the delayed second-order momentum term to decompose them to make them independent while taking an expectation during the analysis. Then we bound them by showing the adaptive learning rate has a limited range, which makes our analysis feasible. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to provide the non-trivial convergence rate of SAM with an adaptive learning rate and momentum acceleration. At last, we conduct several experiments on several NLP tasks, which show that AdaSAM could achieve superior performance compared with SGD, AMSGrad, and SAM optimizers. ",

The special requirements of structured pruning have led to the discovery of numerous new challenges and the development of innovative solutions. This article surveys the recent progress towards structured pruning of deep CNNs. We summarize and compare the state-of-the-art structured pruning techniques with respect to filter ranking methods, regularization methods, dynamic execution, neural architecture search, the lottery ticket hypothesis, and the applications of pruning. While discussing structured pruning algorithms, we briefly introduce the unstructured pruning counterpart to emphasize their differences.

Compared with single-agent cases, the major challenge in simultaneously processing multiple agents lies in modeling complex social interactions caused by various driving intentions and road conditions.

However, it is inherently sub-optimal. In this paper, we propose IPCC-TP, a novel relevance-aware module based on Incremental Pearson Correlation Coefficient to improve multi-agent interaction modeling. IPCC-TP learns pairwise joint Gaussian Distributions through the tightly-coupled estimation of the means and covariances according to interactive incremental movements. Our module can be conveniently embedded into existing multi-agent prediction methods to extend original motion distribution decoders. Extensive experiments on nuScenes and Argoverse 2 datasets demonstrate that IPCC-TP improves the performance of baselines by a large margin. ",

In this work, we explore whether more layers are beneficial to graph transformers, and find that current graph transformers suffer from the bottleneck of improving performance by increasing depth. Our further analysis reveals the reason is that deep graph transformers are limited by the vanishing capacity of global attention, restricting the graph transformer from focusing on the critical substructure and obtaining expressive features. To this end, we propose a novel graph transformer model named DeepGraph that explicitly employs substructure tokens in the encoded representation, and applies local attention on related nodes to obtain substructure based attention encoding. Our model enhances the ability of the global attention to focus on substructures and promotes the expressiveness of the representations, addressing the limitation of self-attention as the graph transformer deepens. Experiments show that our method unblocks the depth limitation of graph transformers and results in state-of-the-art performance across various graph benchmarks with deeper models. ",

Expressing a well-formed SPARQL query requires information about the graph structure and the exact URIs of its components, which is impractical for the average user. Question answering (QA) systems assist by translating natural language questions to SPARQL. Existing QA systems are typically based on application-specific human-curated rules, or require prior information, expensive pre-processing and model adaptation for each targeted KG. Therefore, they are hard to generalize to a broad set of applications and KGs. In this paper, we propose KGQAn, a universal QA system that does not need to be tailored to each target KG. Instead of curated rules, KGQAn introduces a novel formalization of question understanding as a text generation problem to convert a question into an intermediate abstract representation via a neural sequence-to-sequence model. We also develop a just-in-time linker that maps at query time the abstract representation to a SPARQL query for a specific KG, using only the publicly accessible APIs and the existing indices of the RDF store, without requiring any pre-processing. Our experiments with several real KGs demonstrate that KGQAn is easily deployed and outperforms by a large margin the state-of-the-art in terms of quality of answers and processing time, especially for arbitrary KGs, unseen during the training.

In particular, the information plane analysis, which measures mutual information (MI) between input and representation as well as representation and output, should give rich insights into the training process. This approach, however, was shown to strongly depend on the choice of estimator of the MI. The problem is amplified for deterministic networks if the MI between input and representation is infinite. Thus, the estimated values are defined by the different approaches for estimation, but do not adequately represent the training process from an information-theoretic perspective. In this work, we show that dropout with continuously distributed noise ensures that MI is finite.

A challenging aspect of designing Graph Transformers is integrating the arbitrary graph structure into the architecture. We propose Graph Diffuser (GD) to address this challenge. GD learns to extract structural and positional relationships between distant nodes in the graph, which it then uses to direct the Transformer's attention and node representation. We demonstrate that existing GNNs and Graph Transformers struggle to capture long-range interactions and how Graph Diffuser does so while admitting intuitive visualizations.

One of the essential steps to achieve robustness and resilience is the ability of SLAM to have an integrity measure for its localization estimates, and thus, have internal fault tolerance mechanisms to deal with performance degradation. In this work, we introduce a novel method for predicting SLAM localization error based on the characterization of raw sensor inputs. The proposed method relies on using a random forest regression model trained on 1-D global pooled features that are generated from characterized raw sensor data. The model is validated by using it to predict the performance of ORB-SLAM3 on three different datasets running on four different operating modes, resulting in an average prediction accuracy of up to 94.7\\%. The paper also studies the impact of 12 different 1-D global pooling functions on regression quality, and the superiority of 1-D global averaging is quantitatively proven. Finally, the paper studies the quality of prediction with limited training data, and proves that we are able to maintain proper prediction quality when only 20 \\% of the training examples are used for training, which highlights how the proposed model can optimize the evaluation footprint of SLAM systems.

The performed statistical analysis finds significant relationships between stimulus quality and the listener's valence and personality (agreeableness and openness) and, similarly, between the perceived task load during the listening task and the listener's personality and frustration intolerance.

Formalising latent moral content in human interaction is an appealing perspective that would enable a deeper understanding of both social dynamics and individual cognitive and behavioral dimension.

The problem of the most used theories is that they adopt a cultural-independent perspective while many entities that are considered \"values\" are grounded in commonsense knowledge and expressed in everyday life interaction. We propose here two ontological modules, FOLK, an ontology for values intended in their broad sense, and That's All Folks, a module for lexical and factual folk value triggers, whose purpose is to complement the main theories, providing a method for identifying the values that are not contemplated by the major value theories, but which nonetheless play a key role in daily human interactions, and shape social structures, cultural biases, and personal beliefs.

    "title": "Guided Graph Generation: Evaluation of Graph Generators in Terms of  Network Statistics, and a New Algorithm",
    "abstract": "We consider the problem of graph generation guided by network statistics, i.e., the generation of graphs which have given values of various numerical measures that characterize networks, such as the clustering coefficient and the number of cycles of given lengths. Algorithms for the generation of synthetic graphs are often based on graph growth models, i.e., rules of adding (and sometimes removing) nodes and edges to a graph that mimic the processes present in real-world networks. While such graph generators are desirable from a theoretical point of view, they are often only able to reproduce a narrow set of properties of real-world networks, resulting in graphs with otherwise unrealistic properties. In this article, we instead evaluate common graph generation algorithms at the task of reproducing the numerical statistics of real-world networks, such as the clustering coefficient, the degree assortativity, and the connectivity. We also propose an iterative algorithm, the Guided Graph Generator, based on a greedy-like procedure that recovers realistic values over a large number of commonly used graph statistics, while at the same time allowing an efficient implementation based on incremental updating of only a small number of subgraph counts. We show that the proposed algorithm outperforms previous graph generation algorithms in terms of the error in the reconstructed graphs for a large number of graph statistics such as the clustering coefficient, the assortativity, the mean node distance, and also evaluate the algorithm in terms of precision, speed of convergence and scalability, and compare it to previous graph generators and models. We also show that the proposed algorithm generates graphs with realistic degree distributions, graph spectra, clustering coefficient distributions, and distance distributions. ",

    "title": "How to DP-fy ML: A Practical Guide to Machine Learning with Differential  Privacy",
    "abstract": "ML models are ubiquitous in real world applications and are a constant focus of research. At the same time, the community has started to realize the importance of protecting the privacy of ML training data. Differential Privacy (DP) has become a gold standard for making formal statements about data anonymization. However, while some adoption of DP has happened in industry, attempts to apply DP to real world complex ML models are still few and far between. The adoption of DP is hindered by limited practical guidance of what DP protection entails, what privacy guarantees to aim for, and the difficulty of achieving good privacy-utility-computation trade-offs for ML models. Tricks for tuning and maximizing performance are scattered among papers or stored in the heads of practitioners. Furthermore, the literature seems to present conflicting evidence on how and whether to apply architectural adjustments and which components are ``safe'' to use with DP. This work is a self-contained guide that gives an in-depth overview of the field of DP ML and presents information about achieving the best possible DP ML model with rigorous privacy guarantees. Our target audience is both researchers and practitioners. Researchers interested in DP for ML will benefit from a clear overview of current advances and areas for improvement. We include theory-focused sections that highlight important topics such as privacy accounting and its assumptions, and convergence. For a practitioner, we provide a background in DP theory and a clear step-by-step guide for choosing an appropriate privacy definition and approach, implementing DP training, potentially updating the model architecture, and tuning hyperparameters. For both researchers and practitioners, consistently and fully reporting privacy guarantees is critical, and so we propose a set of specific best practices for stating guarantees. ",

    "title": "On the Importance of Feature Representation for Flood Mapping using  Classical Machine Learning Approaches",
    "abstract": "Climate change has increased the severity and frequency of weather disasters all around the world. Flood inundation mapping based on earth observation data can help in this context, by providing cheap and accurate maps depicting the area affected by a flood event to emergency-relief units in near-real-time. Building upon the recent development of the Sen1Floods11 dataset, which provides a limited amount of hand-labeled high-quality training data, this paper evaluates the potential of five traditional machine learning approaches such as gradient boosted decision trees, support vector machines or quadratic discriminant analysis. By performing a grid-search-based hyperparameter optimization on 23 feature spaces we can show that all considered classifiers are capable of outperforming the current state-of-the-art neural network-based approaches in terms of total IoU on their best-performing feature spaces. With total and mean IoU values of 0.8751 and 0.7031 compared to 0.70 and 0.5873 as the previous best-reported results, we show that a simple gradient boosting classifier can significantly improve over deep neural network based approaches, despite using less training data. Furthermore, an analysis of the regional distribution of the Sen1Floods11 dataset reveals a problem of spatial imbalance. We show that traditional machine learning models can learn this bias and argue that modified metric evaluations are required to counter artifacts due to spatial imbalance. Lastly, a qualitative analysis shows that this pixel-wise classifier provides highly-precise surface water classifications indicating that a good choice of a feature space and pixel-wise classification can generate high-quality flood maps using optical and SAR data.

This concept has been studied by Borm et al. (1992) and characterised by Slikker (2005). In this paper, we analyse the position value from the point of view of the typical properties of a measure of centrality in a social network. We extend the analysis already developed in Gomez et al. (2003) for the Myerson centrality measure, where the symmetric effect on the centralities of the end nodes of an added or removed edge is a fundamental part of its characterisation. However, the Position centrality measure, unlike the Myerson centrality measure, responds in a more versatile way to such addition or elimination. After studying the aforementioned properties, we will focus on the analysis and characterisation of the Position attachment centrality given by the position value when the underlying game is the attachment game. Some comparisons are made with the attachment centrality introduced by Skibski et al. (2019). ",

We present an alternative to enhance existing deep neural networks without any redesigning or extra parameters, termed as Spatial-Neighbor Adapter (SN-Adapter). Building on any trained 3D network, we utilize its learned encoding capability to extract features of the training dataset and summarize them as prototypical spatial knowledge. For a test point cloud, the SN-Adapter retrieves k nearest neighbors (k-NN) from the pre-constructed spatial prototypes and linearly interpolates the k-NN prediction with that of the original 3D network. By providing complementary characteristics, the proposed SN-Adapter serves as a plug-and-play module to economically improve performance in a non-parametric manner. More importantly, our SN-Adapter can be effectively generalized to various 3D tasks, including shape classification, part segmentation, and 3D object detection, demonstrating its superiority and robustness. We hope our approach could show a new perspective for point cloud analysis and facilitate future research. ",

    "abstract": "We introduce a new algorithm and software for solving linear equations in symmetric diagonally dominant matrices with non-positive off-diagonal entries (SDDM matrices), including Laplacian matrices. We use pre-conditioned conjugate gradient (PCG) to solve the system of linear equations. Our preconditioner is a variant of the Approximate Cholesky factorization of Kyng and Sachdeva (FOCS 2016). Our factorization approach is simple: we eliminate matrix rows/columns one at a time and update the remaining matrix using sampling to approximate the outcome of complete Cholesky factorization. Unlike earlier approaches, our sampling always maintains a connectivity in the remaining non-zero structure. Our algorithm comes with a tuning parameter that upper bounds the number of samples made per original entry. We implement our algorithm in Julia, providing two versions, AC and AC2, that respectively use 1 and 2 samples per original entry. We compare their single-threaded performance to that of current state-of-the-art solvers Combinatorial Multigrid (CMG), BoomerAMG-preconditioned Krylov solvers from HyPre and PETSc, Lean Algebraic Multigrid (LAMG), and MATLAB's with Incomplete Cholesky Factorization (ICC). Our evaluation uses a broad class of problems, including all large SDDM matrices from the SuiteSparse collection and diverse programmatically generated instances. Our experiments suggest that our algorithm attains a level of robustness and reliability not seen before in SDDM solvers, while retaining good performance across all instances. Our code and data are public, and we provide a tutorial on how to replicate our tests. We hope that others will adopt this suite of tests as a benchmark, which we refer to as SDDM2023.

We propose Randomized Utility-driven Synthesis of Uncertain REgions (R-U-SURE), an approach for building uncertainty-aware suggestions based on a decision-theoretic model of goal-conditioned utility, using random samples from a generative model as a proxy for the unobserved possible intents of the end user. Our technique combines minimum-Bayes-risk decoding, dual decomposition, and decision diagrams in order to efficiently produce structured uncertainty summaries, given only sample access to an arbitrary generative model of code and an optional AST parser. We demonstrate R-U-SURE on three developer-assistance tasks, and show that it can be applied different user interaction patterns without retraining the model and leads to more accurate uncertainty estimates than token-probability baselines.

With DP, privacy protections are probabilistic: they are bounded by the privacy budget parameter, $\\epsilon$. Prior work in health and computational science finds that people struggle to reason about probabilistic risks. Yet, communicating the implications of $\\epsilon$ to people contributing their data is vital to avoiding privacy theater -- presenting meaningless privacy protection as meaningful -- and empowering more informed data-sharing decisions. Drawing on best practices in risk communication and usability, we develop three methods to convey probabilistic DP guarantees to end users: two that communicate odds and one offering concrete examples of DP outputs. We quantitatively evaluate these explanation methods in a vignette survey study ($n=963$) via three metrics: objective risk comprehension, subjective privacy understanding of DP guarantees, and self-efficacy. We find that odds-based explanation methods are more effective than (1) output-based methods and (2) state-of-the-art approaches that gloss over information about $\\epsilon$. Further, when offered information about $\\epsilon$, respondents are more willing to share their data than when presented with a state-of-the-art DP explanation; this willingness to share is sensitive to $\\epsilon$ values: as privacy protections weaken, respondents are less likely to share data.

    "abstract": "Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) aim to synthesize novel views of objects and scenes, given the object-centric camera views with large overlaps. However, we conjugate that this paradigm does not fit the nature of the street views that are collected by many self-driving cars from the large-scale unbounded scenes. Also, the onboard cameras perceive scenes without much overlapping. Thus, existing NeRFs often produce blurs, 'floaters' and other artifacts on street-view synthesis. In this paper, we propose a new street-view NeRF (S-NeRF) that considers novel view synthesis of both the large-scale background scenes and the foreground moving vehicles jointly. Specifically, we improve the scene parameterization function and the camera poses for learning better neural representations from street views. We also use the the noisy and sparse LiDAR points to boost the training and learn a robust geometry and reprojection based confidence to address the depth outliers. Moreover, we extend our S-NeRF for reconstructing moving vehicles that is impracticable for conventional NeRFs. Thorough experiments on the large-scale driving datasets (e.g., nuScenes and Waymo) demonstrate that our method beats the state-of-the-art rivals by reducing 7% to 40% of the mean-squared error in the street-view synthesis and a 45% PSNR gain for the moving vehicles rendering.

    "abstract": "Modern financial exchanges use an electronic limit order book (LOB) to store bid and ask orders for a specific financial asset. As the most fine-grained information depicting the demand and supply of an asset, LOB data is essential in understanding market dynamics. Therefore, realistic LOB simulations offer a valuable methodology for explaining empirical properties of markets. Mainstream simulation models include agent-based models (ABMs) and stochastic models (SMs). However, ABMs tend not to be grounded on real historical data, while SMs tend not to enable dynamic agent-interaction. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel hybrid LOB simulation paradigm characterised by: (1) representing the aggregation of market events' logic by a neural stochastic background trader that is pre-trained on historical LOB data through a neural point process model; and (2) embedding the background trader in a multi-agent simulation with other trading agents. We instantiate this hybrid NS-ABM model using the ABIDES platform. We first run the background trader in isolation and show that the simulated LOB can recreate a comprehensive list of stylised facts that demonstrate realistic market behaviour. We then introduce a population of `trend' and `value' trading agents, which interact with the background trader. We show that the stylised facts remain and we demonstrate order flow impact and financial herding behaviours that are in accordance with empirical observations of real markets. ",

Nevertheless, the proliferation of multimodal single-cell data also introduces tremendous challenges in modeling the complex interactions among different modalities. The recently advanced methods focus on constructing static interaction graphs and applying graph neural networks (GNNs) to learn from multimodal data. However, such static graphs can be suboptimal as they do not take advantage of the downstream task information; meanwhile GNNs also have some inherent limitations when deeply stacking GNN layers. To tackle these issues, in this work, we investigate how to leverage transformers for multimodal single-cell data in an end-to-end manner while exploiting downstream task information. In particular, we propose a scMoFormer framework which can readily incorporate external domain knowledge and model the interactions within each modality and cross modalities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that scMoFormer achieves superior performance on various benchmark datasets. Note that scMoFormer won a Kaggle silver medal with the rank of $24\\ /\\ 1221$ (Top 2%) without ensemble in a NeurIPS 2022 competition. Our implementation is publicly available at Github. ",

First, some necessary and sufficient conditions that guarantee the FTS of general nonlinear systems are provided; such conditions are expressed in terms of the existence of a suitable Lyapunov-like function. Connections of the main theoretical result of given in this article with the typical conditions based on Linear Matrix Inequalities (LMI) that are used for Linear Time-Varying (LTV) systems are discussed. An extension to the case of discrete time systems is also provided. Then, we propose a method to verify the obtained conditions for a very broad class of nonlinear systems. The proposed technique leverages the capability of neural networks to serve as universal function approximators to obtain the Lyapunov-like function. The network training data are generated by enforcing the conditions defining such function in a (large) set of collocation points, as in the case of Physics-Informed Neural Networks. To illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, some numerical examples are proposed and discussed. The technique proposed in this paper allows to obtain the required Lyapunov-like function in closed form. This has the twofold advantage of a) providing a practical way to verify the considered FTS property for a very general class of systems, with an unprecedented flexibility in the FTS context, and b) paving the way to control applications based on Lyapunov methods in the framework of Finite-Time Stability and Control.

    "title": "Robustness of quantum algorithms against coherent control errors",
    "abstract": "Coherent control errors, for which ideal Hamiltonians are perturbed by unknown multiplicative noise terms, are a major obstacle for reliable quantum computing. In this paper, we present a framework for analyzing the robustness of quantum algorithms against coherent control errors using Lipschitz bounds. We derive worst-case fidelity bounds which show that the resilience against coherent control errors is mainly influenced by the norms of the Hamiltonians generating the individual gates. These bounds are explicitly computable even for large circuits, and they can be used to guarantee fault-tolerance via threshold theorems. Moreover, we apply our theoretical framework to derive a novel guideline for robust quantum algorithm design and transpilation, which amounts to reducing the norms of the Hamiltonians. Using the $3$-qubit Quantum Fourier Transform as an example application, we demonstrate that this guideline targets robustness more effectively than existing ones based on circuit depth or gate count. Furthermore, we apply our framework to study the effect of parameter regularization in variational quantum algorithms. The practicality of the theoretical results is demonstrated via implementations in simulation and on a quantum computer. ",

    "abstract": "The pixel vertex detector (PXD) is an essential part of the Belle II detector recording particle positions. Data from the PXD and other sensors allow us to reconstruct particle tracks and decay vertices. The effect of background hits on track reconstruction is simulated by adding measured or simulated background hit patterns to the hits produced by simulated signal particles. This model requires a large set of statistically independent PXD background noise samples to avoid a systematic bias of reconstructed tracks. However, data from the fine-grained PXD requires a substantial amount of storage. As an efficient way of producing background noise, we explore the idea of an on-demand PXD background generator using conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) with contrastive learning, adapted by the number of PXD sensors in order to both increase the image fidelity and produce sensor-dependent PXD hitmaps.
