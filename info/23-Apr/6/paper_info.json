    "title": "The Multimodal And Modular Ai Chef: Complex Recipe Generation From  Imagery",
    "abstract": "The AI community has embraced multi-sensory or multi-modal approaches to advance this generation of AI models to resemble expected intelligent understanding. Combining language and imagery represents a familiar method for specific tasks like image captioning or generation from descriptions. This paper compares these monolithic approaches to a lightweight and specialized method based on employing image models to label objects, then serially submitting this resulting object list to a large language model (LLM). This use of multiple Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) enables better than 95% mean average precision for correct object lists, which serve as input to the latest Open AI text generator (GPT-4). To demonstrate the API as a modular alternative, we solve the problem of a user taking a picture of ingredients available in a refrigerator, then generating novel recipe cards tailored to complex constraints on cost, preparation time, dietary restrictions, portion sizes, and multiple meal plans. The research concludes that monolithic multimodal models currently lack the coherent memory to maintain context and format for this task and that until recently, the language models like GPT-2/3 struggled to format similar problems without degenerating into repetitive or non-sensical combinations of ingredients. For the first time, an AI chef or cook seems not only possible but offers some enhanced capabilities to augment human recipe libraries in pragmatic ways. The work generates a 100-page recipe book featuring the thirty top ingredients using over 2000 refrigerator images as initializing lists. ",

    "abstract": "When using a tool, the grasps used for picking it up, reposing, and holding it in a suitable pose for the desired task could be distinct. Therefore, a key challenge for autonomous in-hand tool manipulation is finding a sequence of grasps that facilitates every step of the tool use process while continuously maintaining force closure and stability. Due to the complexity of modeling the contact dynamics, reinforcement learning (RL) techniques can provide a solution in this continuous space subject to highly parameterized physical models. However, these techniques impose a trade-off in adaptability and data efficiency. At test time the tool properties, desired trajectory, and desired application forces could differ substantially from training scenarios. Adapting to this necessitates more data or computationally expensive online policy updates. In this work, we apply the principles of discrete dynamic programming (DP) to augment RL performance with domain knowledge. Specifically, we first design a computationally simple approximation of our environment. We then demonstrate in physical simulation that performing tree searches (i.e., lookaheads) and policy rollouts with this approximation can improve an RL-derived grasp sequence policy with minimal additional online computation. Additionally, we show that pretraining a deep RL network with the DP-derived solution to the discretized problem can speed up policy training. ",

    "abstract": "This article considers the problem of risk-optimal allocation of security measures when the actuators of an uncertain control system are under attack. We consider an adversary injecting false data into the actuator channels. The attack impact is characterized by the maximum performance loss caused by a stealthy adversary with bounded energy. Since the impact is a random variable, due to system uncertainty, we use Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) to characterize the risk associated with the attack. We then consider the problem of allocating the security measures which minimize the risk. We assume that there are only a limited number of security measures available. Under this constraint, we observe that the allocation problem is a mixed-integer optimization problem. Thus we use relaxation techniques to approximate the security allocation problem into a Semi-Definite Program (SDP). We also compare our allocation method $(i)$ across different risk measures: the worst-case measure, the average (nominal) measure, and $(ii)$ across different search algorithms: the exhaustive and the greedy search algorithms. We depict the efficacy of our approach through numerical examples. ",

Concretely, we study joint distribution alignment for supervised MDA with few target labels and unsupervised MDA with pseudo labels, where the latter is relatively hard and less commonly studied. We further provide algorithm-dependent generalization bounds for these two settings, where the generalization is characterized by the mutual information between the parameters and the data. Then we propose a novel deep MDA algorithm, implicitly addressing the target shift through joint alignment. Finally, the mutual information bounds are extended to this algorithm providing a non-vacuous gradient-norm estimation. The proposed algorithm has comparable performance to the state-of-the-art on target-shifted MDA benchmark with improved memory efficiency. ",

    "abstract": "Scaling up weakly-supervised datasets has shown to be highly effective in the image-text domain and has contributed to most of the recent state-of-the-art computer vision and multimodal neural networks. However, existing large-scale video-text datasets and mining techniques suffer from several limitations, such as the scarcity of aligned data, the lack of diversity in the data, and the difficulty of collecting aligned data. Currently popular video-text data mining approach via automatic speech recognition (ASR) used in HowTo100M provides low-quality captions that often do not refer to the video content. Other mining approaches do not provide proper language descriptions (video tags) and are biased toward short clips (alt text). In this work, we show how recent advances in image captioning allow us to pre-train high-quality video models without any parallel video-text data. We pre-train several video captioning models that are based on an OPT language model and a TimeSformer visual backbone. We fine-tune these networks on several video captioning datasets. First, we demonstrate that image captioning pseudolabels work better for pre-training than the existing HowTo100M ASR captions. Second, we show that pre-training on both images and videos produces a significantly better network (+4 CIDER on MSR-VTT) than pre-training on a single modality. Our methods are complementary to the existing pre-training or data mining approaches and can be used in a variety of settings. Given the efficacy of the pseudolabeling method, we are planning to publicly release the generated captions. ",

    "abstract": "Estimating Click-Through Rate (CTR) is a vital yet challenging task in personalized product search. However, existing CTR methods still struggle in the product search settings due to the following three challenges including how to more effectively extract users' short-term interests with respect to multiple aspects, how to extract and fuse users' long-term interest with short-term interests, how to address the entangling characteristic of long and short-term interests. To resolve these challenges, in this paper, we propose a new approach named Hierarchical Interests Fusing Network (HIFN), which consists of four basic modules namely Short-term Interests Extractor (SIE), Long-term Interests Extractor (LIE), Interests Fusion Module (IFM) and Interests Disentanglement Module (IDM). Specifically, SIE is proposed to extract user's short-term interests by integrating three fundamental interests encoders within it namely query-dependent, target-dependent and causal-dependent interest encoder, respectively, followed by delivering the resultant representation to the module LIE, where it can effectively capture user long-term interests by devising an attention mechanism with respect to the short-term interests from SIE module. In IFM, the achieved long and short-term interests are further fused in an adaptive manner, followed by concatenating it with original raw context features for the final prediction result. Last but not least, considering the entangling characteristic of long and short-term interests, IDM further devises a self-supervised framework to disentangle long and short-term interests. Extensive offline and online evaluations on a real-world e-commerce platform demonstrate the superiority of HIFN over state-of-the-art methods. ",

    "abstract": "Although cryptographic algorithms may be mathematically secure, it is often possible to leak secret information from the implementation of the algorithms. Timing and power side-channel vulnerabilities are some of the most widely considered threats to cryptographic algorithm implementations. Timing vulnerabilities may be easier to detect and exploit, and all high-quality cryptographic code today should be written in constant-time style. However, this does not prevent power side-channels from existing. With constant time code, potential attackers can resort to power side-channel attacks to try leaking secrets. Detecting potential power side-channel vulnerabilities is a tedious task, as it requires analyzing code at the assembly level and needs reasoning about which instructions could be leaking information based on their operands and their values. To help make the process of detecting potential power side-channel vulnerabilities easier for cryptographers, this work presents Pascal: Power Analysis Side Channel Attack Locator, a tool that introduces novel symbolic register analysis techniques for binary analysis of constant-time cryptographic algorithms, and verifies locations of potential power side-channel vulnerabilities with high precision. Pascal is evaluated on a number of implementations of post-quantum cryptographic algorithms, and it is able to find dozens of previously reported single-trace power side-channel vulnerabilities in these algorithms, all in an automated manner.

    "title": "The Impact of Ownership and Contribution Alignment on Code Technical  Debt Accumulation",
    "abstract": "Software development organisations strive to maintain their effectiveness while the complexity of the systems they develop continues to grow. To tackle this challenge, organisations tend to be organised into small teams working with components that can be developed separately. Here, organisations must design their architecture and organisational structures in a way that enables communication and minimises dependencies, and helps teams reduce code and architectural degradation. Ensuring that each small independent team is responsible for components they primarily contribute is one approach to achieving this goal. This study aims at understanding the impact of ownership and contribution alignment on accumulation of code technical debt and how abrupt changes in team constellation affect teams' effectiveness in managing TD. We conducted an embedded case study in a company developing a very large software system, analysing ten components belonging to 1 team. During the studied period, the team was split into two, and the components owned by them were distributed between the two new teams. With high degrees of contribution alignment, we noticed a negative correlation between contribution alignment and TD Density before the team split. In 4 components, this correlation is statistically significant. This means a higher contribution alignment degree implies a lower TD Density. After the split, we observe a negative correlation in 3 components. The positive correlation observed in the other 5 components could be attributed to low contribution alignment, leading to difficulties in managing TD. Our findings suggest that contribution alignment can be important in controlling TD in software development organisations. Making teams responsible for the quality of components they have more expertise over and minimising dependencies between teams can help organisations mitigate the growth of TD. ",

Thus, recent advances in self-supervised learning present a largely-unexplored opportunity for improving separation models by leveraging unlabelled music data. In this paper, we propose a self-supervised learning framework for music source separation inspired by the HuBERT speech representation model. We first investigate the potential impact of the original HuBERT model by inserting an adapted version of it into the well-known Demucs V2 time-domain separation model architecture. We then propose a time-frequency-domain self-supervised model, Pac-HuBERT (for primitive auditory clustering HuBERT), that we later use in combination with a Res-U-Net decoder for source separation. Pac-HuBERT uses primitive auditory features of music as unsupervised clustering labels to initialize the self-supervised pretraining process using the Free Music Archive (FMA) dataset. The resulting framework achieves better source-to-distortion ratio (SDR) performance on the MusDB18 test set than the original Demucs V2 and Res-U-Net models. We further demonstrate that it can boost performance with small amounts of supervised data. Ultimately, our proposed framework is an effective solution to the challenge of limited clean source data for music source separation. ",

    "abstract": "Modeling the 3D world from sensor data for simulation is a scalable way of developing testing and validation environments for robotic learning problems such as autonomous driving. However, manually creating or re-creating real-world-like environments is difficult, expensive, and not scalable. Recent generative model techniques have shown promising progress to address such challenges by learning 3D assets using only plentiful 2D images -- but still suffer limitations as they leverage either human-curated image datasets or renderings from manually-created synthetic 3D environments. In this paper, we introduce GINA-3D, a generative model that uses real-world driving data from camera and LiDAR sensors to create realistic 3D implicit neural assets of diverse vehicles and pedestrians. Compared to the existing image datasets, the real-world driving setting poses new challenges due to occlusions, lighting-variations and long-tail distributions. GINA-3D tackles these challenges by decoupling representation learning and generative modeling into two stages with a learned tri-plane latent structure, inspired by recent advances in generative modeling of images. To evaluate our approach, we construct a large-scale object-centric dataset containing over 520K images of vehicles and pedestrians from the Waymo Open Dataset, and a new set of 80K images of long-tail instances such as construction equipment, garbage trucks, and cable cars. We compare our model with existing approaches and demonstrate that it achieves state-of-the-art performance in quality and diversity for both generated images and geometries. ",

A team of defender robots is tasked to ensure numerical advantage at every node in the graph against a team of attacker robots. The engagement is formulated as a discrete-time dynamic game, where the two teams reallocate their robots in sequence and each robot can move at most one hop at each time step. The game terminates with the attacker's victory if any node has more attacker robots than defender robots. Our goal is to identify the necessary and sufficient number of defender robots to guarantee defense. Through a reachability analysis, we first solve the problem for the case where the attacker team stays as a single group. The results are then generalized to the case where the attacker team can freely split and merge into subteams. Crucially, our analysis indicates that there is no incentive for the attacker team to split, which significantly reduces the search space for the attacker's winning strategies and also enables us to design defender counter-strategies using superposition. We also present an efficient numerical algorithm to identify the necessary and sufficient number of defender robots to defend a given graph.

    "abstract": "With advances seen in deep learning, voice-based applications are burgeoning, ranging from personal assistants, affective computing, to remote disease diagnostics. As the voice contains both linguistic and paralinguistic information (e.g., vocal pitch, intonation, speech rate, loudness), there is growing interest in voice anonymization to preserve speaker privacy and identity. Voice privacy challenges have emerged over the last few years and focus has been placed on removing speaker identity while keeping linguistic content intact. For affective computing and disease monitoring applications, however, the paralinguistic content may be more critical. Unfortunately, the effects that anonymization may have on these systems are still largely unknown. In this paper, we fill this gap and focus on one particular health monitoring application: speech-based COVID-19 diagnosis. We test two popular anonymization methods and their impact on five different state-of-the-art COVID-19 diagnostic systems using three public datasets. We validate the effectiveness of the anonymization methods, compare their computational complexity, and quantify the impact across different testing scenarios for both within- and across-dataset conditions. Lastly, we show the benefits of anonymization as a data augmentation tool to help recover some of the COVID-19 diagnostic accuracy loss seen with anonymized data. ",

    "abstract": "Vision-based Transformer have shown huge application in the perception module of autonomous driving in terms of predicting accurate 3D bounding boxes, owing to their strong capability in modeling long-range dependencies between the visual features. However Transformers, initially designed for language models, have mostly focused on the performance accuracy, and not so much on the inference-time budget. For a safety critical system like autonomous driving, real-time inference at the on-board compute is an absolute necessity. This keeps our object detection algorithm under a very tight run-time budget. In this paper, we evaluated a variety of strategies to optimize on the inference-time of vision transformers based object detection methods keeping a close-watch on any performance variations. Our chosen metric for these strategies is accuracy-runtime joint optimization. Moreover, for actual inference-time analysis we profile our strategies with float32 and float16 precision with TensorRT module. This is the most common format used by the industry for deployment of their Machine Learning networks on the edge devices. We showed that our strategies are able to improve inference-time by 63% at the cost of performance drop of mere 3% for our problem-statement defined in evaluation section. These strategies brings down Vision Transformers detectors inference-time even less than traditional single-image based CNN detectors like FCOS. We recommend practitioners use these techniques to deploy Transformers based hefty multi-view networks on a budge-constrained robotic platform. ",

Outliers are identified as singleton or small clusters. This algorithm is swept across the dataset in a searchlight manner. The dimensions that contain outliers are combined in pairs with other dimensions using a susbset scan technique to gain further insight into the outliers. We illustrate this system by anaylzing open health care data released by New York State. We apply our iterative k-means searchlight followed by subset scanning. Several anomalous trends in the data are identified, including cost overruns at specific hospitals, and increases in diagnoses such as suicides.

Annotating rotated bounding boxes is such a laborious process that they are not provided in many detection datasets where axis-aligned annotations are used instead. In this paper, we propose a framework that allows the model to predict precise rotated boxes only requiring cheaper axis-aligned annotation of the target dataset 1. To achieve this, we leverage the fact that neural networks are capable of learning richer representation of the target domain than what is utilized by the task. The under-utilized representation can be exploited to address a more detailed task. Our framework combines task knowledge of an out-of-domain source dataset with stronger annotation and domain knowledge of the target dataset with weaker annotation. A novel assignment process and projection loss are used to enable the co-training on the source and target datasets. As a result, the model is able to solve the more detailed task in the target domain, without additional computation overhead during inference. We extensively evaluate the method on various target datasets including fresh-produce dataset, HRSC2016 and SSDD. Results show that the proposed method consistently performs on par with the fully supervised approach. ",

    "abstract": "Heatmaps are widely used to interpret deep neural networks, particularly for computer vision tasks, and the heatmap-based explainable AI (XAI) techniques are a well-researched topic. However, most studies concentrate on enhancing the quality of the generated heatmap or discovering alternate heatmap generation techniques, and little effort has been devoted to making heatmap-based XAI automatic, interactive, scalable, and accessible. To address this gap, we propose a framework that includes two modules: (1) context modelling and (2) reasoning. We proposed a template-based image captioning approach for context modelling to create text-based contextual information from the heatmap and input data. The reasoning module leverages a large language model to provide explanations in combination with specialised knowledge. Our qualitative experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework and heatmap captioning approach. The code for the proposed template-based heatmap captioning approach will be publicly available. ",

Although dramatic progress has been made in sketch retrieval, few efforts are devoted to logo sketch retrieval which is still hindered by the following challenges: Firstly, logo sketch retrieval is more difficult than typical sketch retrieval problem, since a logo sketch usually contains much less visual contents with only irregular strokes and lines. Secondly, instance-specific sketches demonstrate dramatic appearance variances, making them less identifiable when querying the same logo instance. Thirdly, there exist several sketch retrieval benchmarking datasets nowadays, whereas an instance-level logo sketch dataset is still publicly unavailable. To address the above-mentioned limitations, we make twofold contributions in this study for instance-level logo sketch retrieval. To begin with, we construct an instance-level logo sketch dataset containing 2k logo instances and exceeding 9k sketches. To our knowledge, this is the first publicly available instance-level logo sketch dataset. Next, we develop a fine-grained triple-branch CNN architecture based on hybrid attention mechanism termed LogoNet for accurate logo sketch retrieval. More specifically, we embed the hybrid attention mechanism into the triple-branch architecture for capturing the key query-specific information from the limited visual cues in the logo sketches. Experimental evaluations both on our assembled dataset and public benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed network. ",

    "abstract": "Industrial anomaly detection (IAD) is crucial for automating industrial quality inspection. The diversity of the datasets is the foundation for developing comprehensive IAD algorithms. Existing IAD datasets focus on the diversity of data categories, overlooking the diversity of domains within the same data category. In this paper, to bridge this gap, we propose the Aero-engine Blade Anomaly Detection (AeBAD) dataset, consisting of two sub-datasets: the single-blade dataset and the video anomaly detection dataset of blades. Compared to existing datasets, AeBAD has the following two characteristics: 1.) The target samples are not aligned and at different scales. 2.) There is a domain shift between the distribution of normal samples in the test set and the training set, where the domain shifts are mainly caused by the changes in illumination and view. Based on this dataset, we observe that current state-of-the-art (SOTA) IAD methods exhibit limitations when the domain of normal samples in the test set undergoes a shift. To address this issue, we propose a novel method called masked multi-scale reconstruction (MMR), which enhances the model's capacity to deduce causality among patches in normal samples by a masked reconstruction task. MMR achieves superior performance compared to SOTA methods on the AeBAD dataset. Furthermore, MMR achieves competitive performance with SOTA methods to detect the anomalies of different types on the MVTec AD dataset.

In practical situations, SSAD methods suffer adapting to domain shifts, since anomalous data are unlikely to be available for the target domain in the training phase. To solve this problem, we propose a domain adaptation method for SSAD where no anomalous data are available for the target domain. First, we introduce a domain-adversarial network to a variational auto-encoder-based SSAD model to obtain domain-invariant latent variables. Since the decoder cannot reconstruct the original data solely from domain-invariant latent variables, we conditioned the decoder on the domain label. To compensate for the missing anomalous data of the target domain, we introduce an importance sampling-based weighted loss function that approximates the ideal loss function. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method helps adapt SSAD models to the target domain when no anomalous data are available for the target domain. ",

Our approach overcomes this limitation by considering both the sentence-level semantics and the document-level rhetorical structure, resulting in a more robust and style-agnostic approach to detecting political bias in news articles. We introduce a novel multi-head hierarchical attention model that effectively encodes the structure of long documents through a diverse ensemble of attention heads. While journalism follows a formalized rhetorical structure, the writing style may vary by news outlet. We demonstrate that our method overcomes this domain dependency and outperforms previous approaches for robustness and accuracy. Further analysis demonstrates the ability of our model to capture the discourse structures commonly used in the journalism domain. ",

Instance segmentation methods output pixel-level labels, which are computationally expensive for real-time applications. Therefore, a polygon representation is needed to achieve precise shape alignment, while retaining low computation cost. We develop a novel Deformable Polar Polygon Object Detection method (DPPD) to detect objects in polygon shapes. In particular, our network predicts, for each object, a sparse set of flexible vertices to construct the polygon, where each vertex is represented by a pair of angle and distance in the Polar coordinate system. To enable training, both ground truth and predicted polygons are densely resampled to have the same number of vertices with equal-spaced raypoints. The resampling operation is fully differentable, allowing gradient back-propagation. Sparse polygon predicton ensures high-speed runtime inference while dense resampling allows the network to learn object shapes with high precision. The polygon detection head is established on top of an anchor-free and NMS-free network architecture. DPPD has been demonstrated successfully in various object detection tasks for autonomous driving such as traffic-sign, crosswalk, vehicle and pedestrian objects. ",

ERRA is based on tightly-coupled probabilistic inferences at two granularity levels. Coarse-resolution inference is formulated as sequence generation through a large language model, which infers action language from natural language instruction and environment state. The robot then zooms to the fine-resolution inference part to perform the concrete action corresponding to the action language. Fine-resolution inference is constructed as a Markov decision process, which takes action language and environmental sensing as observations and outputs the action. The results of action execution in environments provide feedback for subsequent coarse-resolution reasoning. Such coarse-to-fine inference allows the robot to decompose and achieve long-horizon tasks interactively. In extensive experiments, we show that ERRA can complete various long-horizon manipulation tasks specified by abstract language instructions. We also demonstrate successful generalization to the novel but similar natural language instructions. ",

This group of algorithms works under the assumption of multiple environments that represent different interventions in the causal inference context. Those environments are not normally available when working with observational data and real-world applications. Here we propose a method to generate them in an efficient way. We assess the performance of this unsupervised learning problem by implementing ICP on simulated data. We also show how to apply ICP efficiently integrated with our method for causal discovery.

Our results show that MUFIN's back-translation loop generates valuable training samples in a fully automated, self-supervised manner, generating more than half-a-million pairs of bug/fix.

This paper presents a topological perspective on consensus solvability under oblivious message adversaries, which provides interesting new insights. Our main contribution is a topological characterization of consensus solvability, which also leads to explicit decision procedures. Our approach is based on the novel notion of a communication pseudosphere, which can be seen as the message-passing analog of the well-known standard chromatic subdivision for wait-free shared memory systems. We further push the elegance and expressiveness of the \"geometric\" reasoning enabled by the topological approach by dealing with uninterpreted complexes, which considerably reduce the size of the protocol complex, and by labeling facets with information flow arrows, which give an intuitive meaning to the implicit epistemic status of the faces in a protocol complex.

The self-supervision comes from an earlier idea exploiting consistency between predicted pose under 3D rotation. Our method is a substantial advance on state-of-the-art self-supervised methods in training a mapping directly from images, without limb articulation constraints or any 3D empirical pose prior. We compare performance with state-of-the-art self-supervised methods using benchmark datasets that provide images and ground-truth 3D pose (Human3.6M, MPI-INF-3DHP). Despite the reduced requirement for annotated data, we show that the method outperforms on Human3.6M and matches performance on MPI-INF-3DHP. Qualitative results on a dataset of human hands show the potential for rapidly learning to predict 3D pose for articulated structures other than the human body. ",

    "abstract": "Saliency Maps (SMs) have been extensively used to interpret deep learning models decision by highlighting the features deemed relevant by the model. They are used on highly nonlinear problems, where linear feature selection (FS) methods fail at highlighting relevant explanatory variables. However, the reliability of gradient-based feature attribution methods such as SM has mostly been only qualitatively (visually) assessed, and quantitative benchmarks are currently missing, partially due to the lack of a definite ground truth on image data. Concerned about the apophenic biases introduced by visual assessment of these methods, in this paper we propose a synthetic quantitative benchmark for Neural Networks (NNs) interpretation methods. For this purpose, we built synthetic datasets with nonlinearly separable classes and increasing number of decoy (random) features, illustrating the challenge of FS in high-dimensional settings. We also compare these methods to conventional approaches such as mRMR or Random Forests. Our results show that our simple synthetic datasets are sufficient to challenge most of the benchmarked methods. TreeShap, mRMR and LassoNet are the best performing FS methods. We also show that, when quantifying the relevance of a few non linearly-entangled predictive features diluted in a large number of irrelevant noisy variables, neural network-based FS and interpretation methods are still far from being reliable.

As a key result of that line of work, it was shown how to obtain upper bounds on the $H_2$-norm that are robust with respect to uncertain interconnection topologies. The main contribution of the current paper is to show that the same upper bounds hold not only for uncertain but also time-varying topologies that are superimposed with the stochastic packet loss. Because the results are formulated in terms of linear matrix inequalities that are independent of the number of agents, multi-agent systems of any size can be analysed efficiently. The applicability of the approach is demonstrated on a numerical first-order consensus example, on which the obtained upper bounds are compared to estimates from Monte-Carlo simulations. ",

In the considered system, the active RIS is adopted to enable the secure transmission of primary signals from the primary transmitter to multiple primary users in a multicasting manner, and simultaneously achieve its own information delivery to the secondary user by riding over the primary signals. Taking into account the imperfect channel state information (CSI) related with Eves, we formulate the system power consumption minimization problem by optimizing the transmit beamforming and reflection beamforming for the bounded and statistical CSI error models, taking the worst-case SNR constraints and the SNR outage probability constraints at the Eves into considerations, respectively. Specifically, the S-Procedure and the Bernstein-Type Inequality are implemented to approximately transform the worst-case SNR and the SNR outage probability constraints into tractable forms, respectively. After that, the formulated problems can be solved by the proposed alternating optimization (AO) algorithm with the semi-definite relaxation and sequential rank-one constraint relaxation techniques. Numerical results show that the proposed active RIS scheme can reduce up to 27.0% system power consumption compared to the passive RIS. ",

Two algorithms are presented to tackle the nonlinear non-convex waveform design problem. In the first algorithm, we derive a quadratic function to minorize the objective function. To tackle the quadratically constrained quadratic programming problem at each iteration, a semidefinite relaxation approach followed by a rank-one decomposition procedure and an efficient alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) are proposed, respectively. In the second algorithm, we present a novel ADMM algorithm to tackle the optimization problem and employ an efficient minorization-maximization approach in the inner loop of the ADMM algorithm.

Despite the remarkable accuracy of 3D detectors, they often overfit to specific domain biases, leading to suboptimal performance in various sensor setups and environments. Existing methods typically focus on adapting a single detector to the target domain, overlooking the fact that different detectors possess distinct expertise on different unseen domains. MS3D leverages this by combining different pre-trained detectors from multiple source domains and incorporating temporal information to produce high-quality pseudo-labels for fine-tuning. Our proposed Kernel-Density Estimation (KDE) Box Fusion method fuses box proposals from multiple domains to obtain pseudo-labels that surpass the performance of the best source domain detectors. MS3D exhibits greater robustness to domain shifts and produces accurate pseudo-labels over greater distances, making it well-suited for high-to-low beam domain adaptation and vice versa. Our method achieved state-of-the-art performance on all evaluated datasets, and we demonstrate that the choice of pre-trained source detectors has minimal impact on the self-training result, making MS3D suitable for real-world applications.

Thus, the pre-determined parameters of augmentation operations cannot always fit well with an evolving network during the whole training period, which degrades the quality of the learned representations. In this work, we propose AdDA, which implements a closed-loop feedback structure to a generic contrastive learning network. AdDA works by allowing the network to adaptively adjust the augmentation compositions according to the real-time feedback. This online adjustment helps maintain the dynamic optimal composition and enables the network to acquire more generalizable representations with minimal computational overhead. AdDA achieves competitive results under the common linear protocol on ImageNet-100 classification (+1.11% on MoCo v2). ",

We pursue the first goal via an extensive experimental study based on 3 recent models widely adopted in the prior literature on adversarial robustness. Our findings show that the complexity of the HPT problem, already notoriously expensive, is exacerbated in adversarial settings due to two main reasons: i) the need of tuning additional HPs which balance standard and adversarial training; ii) the need of tuning the HPs of the standard and adversarial training phases independently. Fortunately, we also identify new opportunities to reduce the cost of HPT for robust models. Specifically, we propose to leverage cheap adversarial training methods to obtain inexpensive, yet highly correlated, estimations of the quality achievable using state-of-the-art methods (PGD). We show that, by exploiting this novel idea in conjunction with a recent multi-fidelity optimizer (taKG), the efficiency of the HPT process can be significantly enhanced. ",

These features are then used as inputs in downstream tasks, such as image classification. Previously, autoencoders and Siamese networks such as SimSiam have been successfully employed in those tasks. Yet, challenges remain, such as matching characteristics of the features (e.g., level of detail) to the given task and data set. In this paper, we present a new self-supervised method that combines the benefits of Siamese architectures and denoising autoencoders. We show that our model, called SidAE (Siamese denoising autoencoder), outperforms two self-supervised baselines across multiple data sets, settings, and scenarios.

With frame index or positional index as input, implicit representations (NeRV, E-NeRV, \\etc) reconstruct video from fixed and content-agnostic embeddings. Such embedding largely limits the regression capacity and internal generalization for video interpolation. In this paper, we propose a Hybrid Neural Representation for Videos (HNeRV), where a learnable encoder generates content-adaptive embeddings, which act as the decoder input. Besides the input embedding, we introduce HNeRV blocks, which ensure model parameters are evenly distributed across the entire network, such that higher layers (layers near the output) can have more capacity to store high-resolution content and video details. With content-adaptive embeddings and re-designed architecture, HNeRV outperforms implicit methods in video regression tasks for both reconstruction quality ($+4.7$ PSNR) and convergence speed ($16\\times$ faster), and shows better internal generalization. As a simple and efficient video representation, HNeRV also shows decoding advantages for speed, flexibility, and deployment, compared to traditional codecs~(H.264, H.265) and learning-based compression methods. Finally, we explore the effectiveness of HNeRV on downstream tasks such as video compression and video inpainting.

Nevertheless, their point identification is challenging, requiring strong assumptions such as monotonicity. In the absence of such assumptions, existing work requires multiple observations of datasets that contain the same treatment and outcome variables, in order to establish bounds on these probabilities. However, in many clinical trials and public policy evaluation cases, there exist independent datasets that examine the effect of a different treatment each on the same outcome variable. Here, we outline how to significantly tighten existing bounds on the probabilities of causation, by imposing counterfactual consistency between SCMs constructed from such independent datasets ('causal marginal problem'). Next, we describe a new information theoretic approach on falsification of counterfactual probabilities, using conditional mutual information to quantify counterfactual influence. The latter generalises to arbitrary discrete variables and number of treatments, and renders the causal marginal problem more interpretable. Since the question of 'tight enough' is left to the user, we provide an additional method of inference when the bounds are unsatisfactory: A maximum entropy based method that defines a metric for the space of plausible SCMs and proposes the entropy maximising SCM for inferring counterfactuals in the absence of more information.

In this paper, we propose multi-mode video compression (MMVC), a block wise mode ensemble deep video compression framework that selects the optimal mode for feature domain prediction adapting to different motion patterns. Proposed multi-modes include ConvLSTM-based feature domain prediction, optical flow conditioned feature domain prediction, and feature propagation to address a wide range of cases from static scenes without apparent motions to dynamic scenes with a moving camera. We partition the feature space into blocks for temporal prediction in spatial block-based representations. For entropy coding, we consider both dense and sparse post-quantization residual blocks, and apply optional run-length coding to sparse residuals to improve the compression rate. In this sense, our method uses a dual-mode entropy coding scheme guided by a binary density map, which offers significant rate reduction surpassing the extra cost of transmitting the binary selection map. We validate our scheme with some of the most popular benchmarking datasets.

    "title": "Short-Term Volatility Prediction Using Deep CNNs Trained on Order Flow",
    "abstract": "As a newly emerged asset class, cryptocurrency is evidently more volatile compared to the traditional equity markets. Due to its mostly unregulated nature, and often low liquidity, the price of crypto assets can sustain a significant change within minutes that in turn might result in considerable losses. In this paper, we employ an approach for encoding market information into images and making predictions of short-term realized volatility by employing Convolutional Neural Networks. We then compare the performance of the proposed encoding and corresponding model with other benchmark models. The experimental results demonstrate that this representation of market data with a Convolutional Neural Network as a predictive model has the potential to better capture the market dynamics and a better volatility prediction.

    "title": "Bayesian neural networks via MCMC: a Python-based tutorial",
    "abstract": "Bayesian inference provides a methodology for parameter estimation and uncertainty quantification in machine learning and deep learning methods. Variational inference and Markov Chain Monte-Carlo (MCMC) sampling techniques are used to implement Bayesian inference. In the past three decades, MCMC methods have faced a number of challenges in being adapted to larger models (such as in deep learning) and big data problems. Advanced proposals that incorporate gradients, such as a Langevin proposal distribution, provide a means to address some of the limitations of MCMC sampling for Bayesian neural networks. Furthermore, MCMC methods have typically been constrained to use by statisticians and are still not prominent among deep learning researchers. We present a tutorial for MCMC methods that covers simple Bayesian linear and logistic models, and Bayesian neural networks. The aim of this tutorial is to bridge the gap between theory and implementation via coding, given a general sparsity of libraries and tutorials to this end. This tutorial provides code in Python with data and instructions that enable their use and extension. We provide results for some benchmark problems showing the strengths and weaknesses of implementing the respective Bayesian models via MCMC. We highlight the challenges in sampling multi-modal posterior distributions in particular for the case of Bayesian neural networks, and the need for further improvement of convergence diagnosis. ",
