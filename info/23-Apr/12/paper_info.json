    "abstract": "The potential for blockchain technology to eliminate the middleman and replace the top down hierarchical model of governance with a system of distributed cooperation has opened up many new opportunities, as well as dilemmas. Surpassing the level of acceptance by early tech adopters, the market of smart contracts is now moving towards wider acceptance from regular (non tech) users. For this to happen however, smart contract development will have to overcome certain technical and legal obstacles to bring the code and the user closer. Guided by notions from contract law and consumer protection we highlight the information gap that exists between users, legal bodies and the source code. We present a spectrum of low-code to no-code initiatives that aim at bridging this gap, promising the potential of higher regulatory acceptance. Nevertheless, this highlights the so called \"Pitfall of the Trustless Dream\", because arguably solutions to the information gap tend to make the system more centralized. In this article, we aim to make a practical contribution of relevance to the wide-spread adoption of smart contracts and their legal acceptance by analyzing the evolving practices that bring the user and the code closer.

    "abstract": "In the automotive industry, the full cycle of managing in-use vehicle quality issues can take weeks to investigate. The process involves isolating root causes, defining and implementing appropriate treatments, and refining treatments if needed. The main pain-point is the lack of a systematic method to identify causal relationships, evaluate treatment effectiveness, and direct the next actionable treatment if the current treatment was deemed ineffective. This paper will show how we leverage causal Machine Learning (ML) to speed up such processes. A real-word data set collected from on-road vehicles will be used to demonstrate the proposed framework. Open challenges for vehicle quality applications will also be discussed. ",

    "abstract": "Geometric deep learning enables the encoding of physical symmetries in modeling 3D objects. Despite rapid progress in encoding 3D symmetries into Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), a comprehensive evaluation of the expressiveness of these networks through a local-to-global analysis lacks today. In this paper, we propose a local hierarchy of 3D isomorphism to evaluate the expressive power of equivariant GNNs and investigate the process of representing global geometric information from local patches. Our work leads to two crucial modules for designing expressive and efficient geometric GNNs; namely local substructure encoding (LSE) and frame transition encoding (FTE). To demonstrate the applicability of our theory, we propose LEFTNet which effectively implements these modules and achieves state-of-the-art performance on both scalar-valued and vector-valued molecular property prediction tasks. We further point out the design space for future developments of equivariant graph neural networks. Our codes are available at \\url{https://github.com/yuanqidu/LeftNet}. ",

Designing these on-chip systems with complex and application-specific functionality requires beyond what is possible with physical intuition, for which machine learning-based design methods have recently become popular. However, as the expensive computational requirements for physically accurate device simulations last a critical challenge, these methods typically remain limited in scalability and the optical design degrees of freedom they can provide for application-specific and arbitrary photonic integrated circuits. Here, we introduce a highly-scalable, physics-informed framework for the design of on-chip optical systems with arbitrary functionality based on a deep photonic network of custom-designed Mach-Zehnder interferometers. Using this framework, we design ultra-broadband power splitters and a spectral duplexer, each in less than two minutes, and demonstrate state-of-the-art experimental performance with less than 0.66 dB insertion loss and over 120 nm of 1-dB bandwidth for all devices. Our presented framework provides an essential tool with a tractable path towards the systematic design of large-scale photonic systems with custom and broadband power, phase, and dispersion profiles for use in multi-band optical applications including high-throughput communications, quantum information processing, and medical/biological sensing.

    "abstract": "Graph self-supervised learning (SSL), including contrastive and generative approaches, offers great potential to address the fundamental challenge of label scarcity in real-world graph data. Among both sets of graph SSL techniques, the masked graph autoencoders (e.g., GraphMAE)--one type of generative method--have recently produced promising results. The idea behind this is to reconstruct the node features (or structures)--that are randomly masked from the input--with the autoencoder architecture. However, the performance of masked feature reconstruction naturally relies on the discriminability of the input features and is usually vulnerable to disturbance in the features. In this paper, we present a masked self-supervised learning framework GraphMAE2 with the goal of overcoming this issue. The idea is to impose regularization on feature reconstruction for graph SSL. Specifically, we design the strategies of multi-view random re-mask decoding and latent representation prediction to regularize the feature reconstruction. The multi-view random re-mask decoding is to introduce randomness into reconstruction in the feature space, while the latent representation prediction is to enforce the reconstruction in the embedding space. Extensive experiments show that GraphMAE2 can consistently generate top results on various public datasets, including at least 2.45% improvements over state-of-the-art baselines on ogbn-Papers100M with 111M nodes and 1.6B edges.

Here, we present a scaled DW-MTJ neuron with voltage-dependent firing probability. The measured behavior was used to simulate a SNN that attains accuracy during learning compared to an equivalent, but more complicated, multi-weight (MW) DW-MTJ device. The validation accuracy during training was also shown to be comparable to an ideal leaky integrate and fire (LIF) device. However, during inference, the binary DW-MTJ neuron outperformed the other devices after gaussian noise was introduced to the Fashion-MNIST classification task. This work shows that DW-MTJ devices can be used to construct noise-resilient networks suitable for neuromorphic computing on the edge. ",

It is crucial for policymakers to have a comprehensive understanding of the public's stance towards vaccination on a large scale. However, attitudes towards COVID-19 vaccination, such as pro-vaccine or vaccine hesitancy, have evolved over time on social media. Thus, it is necessary to account for possible temporal shifts when analysing these stances. This study aims to examine the impact of temporal concept drift on stance detection towards COVID-19 vaccination on Twitter. To this end, we evaluate a range of transformer-based models using chronological and random splits of social media data. Our findings demonstrate significant discrepancies in model performance when comparing random and chronological splits across all monolingual and multilingual datasets. Chronological splits significantly reduce the accuracy of stance classification. Therefore, real-world stance detection approaches need to be further refined to incorporate temporal factors as a key consideration. ",

However, in order to assist individuals who are lying in bed, robots must be capable of dealing with a significant obstacle: the blanket or sheet that will almost always cover the person's body. We propose a method for targeted bedding manipulation over people lying supine in bed where we first learn a model of the cloth's dynamics. Then, we optimize over this model to uncover a given target limb using information about human body shape and pose that only needs to be provided at run-time. We show how this approach enables greater robustness to variation relative to geometric and reinforcement learning baselines via a number of generalization evaluations in simulation and in the real world. We further evaluate our approach in a human study with 12 participants where we demonstrate that a mobile manipulator can adapt to real variation in human body shape, size, pose, and blanket configuration to uncover target body parts without exposing the rest of the body.

However, this approach is currently limited: effects of the optical hardware stack and in particular lenses are hard to model in a unified way. This limits the quality that can be achieved for camera calibration and the fidelity of the results of 3D reconstruction. In this paper, we propose NeuroLens, a neural lens model for distortion and vignetting that can be used for point projection and ray casting and can be optimized through both operations. This means that it can (optionally) be used to perform pre-capture calibration using classical calibration targets, and can later be used to perform calibration or refinement during 3D reconstruction, e.g., while optimizing a radiance field. To evaluate the performance of our proposed model, we create a comprehensive dataset assembled from the Lensfun database with a multitude of lenses. Using this and other real-world datasets, we show that the quality of our proposed lens model outperforms standard packages as well as recent approaches while being much easier to use and extend. The model generalizes across many lens types and is trivial to integrate into existing 3D reconstruction and rendering systems. ",

However, finding a set of neural network parameters that lead to fulfilling a PDE can be challenging and non-unique due to the complexity of the loss landscape that needs to be traversed. Although a variety of multi-task learning and transfer learning approaches have been proposed to overcome these issues, there is no incremental training procedure for PINNs that can effectively mitigate such training challenges. We propose incremental PINNs (iPINNs) that can learn multiple tasks (equations) sequentially without additional parameters for new tasks and improve performance for every equation in the sequence. Our approach learns multiple PDEs starting from the simplest one by creating its own subnetwork for each PDE and allowing each subnetwork to overlap with previously learned subnetworks. We demonstrate that previous subnetworks are a good initialization for a new equation if PDEs share similarities. We also show that iPINNs achieve lower prediction error than regular PINNs for two different scenarios: (1) learning a family of equations (e.g., 1-D convection PDE); and (2) learning PDEs resulting from a combination of processes (e.g., 1-D reaction-diffusion PDE). The ability to learn all problems with a single network together with learning more complex PDEs with better generalization than regular PINNs will open new avenues in this field. ",

Multi-fidelity methods use a small set of high-fidelity data to enhance the accuracy of a large set of low-fidelity data. In the approach described in this paper, this is accomplished by constructing a graph Laplacian using the low-fidelity data and computing its low-lying spectrum. This spectrum is then used to cluster the data and identify points that are closest to the centroids of the clusters. High-fidelity data is then acquired for these key points. Thereafter, a transformation that maps every low-fidelity data point to its bi-fidelity counterpart is determined by minimizing the discrepancy between the bi- and high-fidelity data at the key points, and to preserve the underlying structure of the low-fidelity data distribution. The latter objective is achieved by relying, once again, on the spectral properties of the graph Laplacian. This method is applied to a problem in solid mechanics and another in aerodynamics. In both cases, this methods uses a small fraction of high-fidelity data to significantly improve the accuracy of a large set of low-fidelity data. ",

Recently, weighted regularization techniques including the weighted nuclear norm regularization have been proposed in the image processing community to promote adaptive sparsity while achieving efficient performance. In this paper, we propose a robust dual graph regularized moving object detection model based on a novel weighted nuclear norm regularization and spatiotemporal graph Laplacians.

Meanwhile, we present a novel reward setting, under which the optimal policy with minimal flipping actions to realize reachability is the one of the highest returns. Then, to obtain the optimal policy, we propose QL, and fast small memory QL for large-scale systems. Specifically, on the basis of the small memory QL mentioned before, the fast small memory QL uses a changeable reward setting to speed up the learning efficiency while ensuring the optimality of the policy. For parameter settings, we give some system properties for reference. Finally, two examples, which are a small-scale system and a large-scale one, are considered to verify the proposed method. ",

    "title": "Multi-Graph Convolution Network for Pose Forecasting",
    "abstract": "Recently, there has been a growing interest in predicting human motion, which involves forecasting future body poses based on observed pose sequences. This task is complex due to modeling spatial and temporal relationships. The most commonly used models for this task are autoregressive models, such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs) or variants, and Transformer Networks. However, RNNs have several drawbacks, such as vanishing or exploding gradients. Other researchers have attempted to solve the communication problem in the spatial dimension by integrating Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models. These works deal with temporal and spatial information separately, which limits the effectiveness. To fix this problem, we propose a novel approach called the multi-graph convolution network (MGCN) for 3D human pose forecasting. This model simultaneously captures spatial and temporal information by introducing an augmented graph for pose sequences. Multiple frames give multiple parts, joined together in a single graph instance. Furthermore, we also explore the influence of natural structure and sequence-aware attention to our model. In our experimental evaluation of the large-scale benchmark datasets, Human3.6M, AMSS and 3DPW, MGCN outperforms the state-of-the-art in pose prediction. ",

In this paper, we present a novel model Adaptive Task-to-Task Fusion Network (AdaTT) to address both challenges. AdaTT is a deep fusion network built with task specific and optional shared fusion units at multiple levels. By leveraging a residual mechanism and gating mechanism for task-to-task fusion, these units adaptively learn shared knowledge and task specific knowledge.

To ameliorate this problem, existing methods simply condition NeRF models on image features, lacking the global understanding and modeling of the entire 3D scene. Inspired by the significant success of mask-based modeling in other research fields, we propose a masked ray and view modeling method for generalizable NeRF (MRVM-NeRF), the first attempt to incorporate mask-based pretraining into 3D implicit representations. Specifically, considering that the core of NeRFs lies in modeling 3D representations along the rays and across the views, we randomly mask a proportion of sampled points along the ray at fine stage by discarding partial information obtained from multi-viewpoints, targeting at predicting the corresponding features produced in the coarse branch. In this way, the learned prior knowledge of 3D scenes during pretraining helps the model generalize better to novel scenarios after finetuning. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our proposed MRVM-NeRF under various synthetic and real-world settings, both qualitatively and quantitatively. Our empirical studies reveal the effectiveness of our proposed innovative MRVM which is specifically designed for NeRF models. ",

To meet the practical requirements of botanical research and intelligent plant management, we construct a large-scale dataset for Plant detection in the Three-River-Source region (PTRS). This dataset comprises 6965 high-resolution images of 2160*3840 pixels, captured by diverse sensors and platforms, and featuring objects of varying shapes and sizes. Subsequently, a team of botanical image interpretation experts annotated these images with 21 commonly occurring object categories. The fully annotated PTRS images contain 122, 300 instances of plant leaves, each labeled by a horizontal rectangle. The PTRS presents us with challenges such as dense occlusion, varying leaf resolutions, and high feature similarity among plants, prompting us to develop a novel object detection network named PlantDet. This network employs a window-based efficient self-attention module (ST block) to generate robust feature representation at multiple scales, improving the detection efficiency for small and densely-occluded objects. Our experimental results validate the efficacy of our proposed plant detection benchmark, with a precision of 88.1%, a mean average precision (mAP) of 77.6%, and a higher recall compared to the baseline. Additionally, our method effectively overcomes the issue of missing small objects. We intend to share our data and code with interested parties to advance further research in this field. ",

In addition, there are applications such as physics-informed simulators in which accurate forecasts in real time with a minimal lag are required. The present neural network designs include millions of parameters, which makes it difficult to install such complex models on devices that have limited memory. Compression techniques might be able to resolve these issues by decreasing the size of CNN models that are created by reducing the number of parameters that contribute to the complexity of the models. We propose a compressed tensor format of convolutional layer, a priori, before the training of the neural network. 3-way kernels or 2-way kernels in convolutional layers are replaced by one-way fiters. The overfitting phenomena will be reduced also. The time needed to make predictions or time required for training using the original Convolutional Neural Networks model would be cut significantly if there were fewer parameters to deal with. In this paper we present a method of a priori compressing convolutional neural networks for finite element (FE) predictions of physical data. Afterwards we validate our a priori compressed models on physical data from a FE model solving a 2D wave equation. We show that the proposed convolutinal compression technique achieves equivalent performance as classical convolutional layers with fewer trainable parameters and lower memory footprint. ",

In the last decade, many partitioning algorithms have been developed which differ from each other with respect to the partitioning quality, the run-time of the partitioning and the type of graph for which they work best. The plethora of graph partitioning algorithms makes it a challenging task to select a partitioner for a given scenario. Different studies exist that provide qualitative insights into the characteristics of graph partitioning algorithms that support a selection. However, in order to enable automatic selection, a quantitative prediction of the partitioning quality, the partitioning run-time and the run-time of subsequent graph processing jobs is needed. In this paper, we propose a machine learning-based approach to provide such a quantitative prediction for different types of edge partitioning algorithms and graph processing workloads. We show that training based on generated graphs achieves high accuracy, which can be further improved when using real-world data. Based on the predictions, the automatic selection reduces the end-to-end run-time on average by 11.1% compared to a random selection, by 17.4% compared to selecting the partitioner that yields the lowest cut size, and by 29.1% compared to the worst strategy, respectively. Furthermore, in 35.7% of the cases, the best strategy was selected. ",

It has been shown that the two properties quorum intersection and availability are necessary. In this paper, we prove that they are not sufficient. We then define the notion of quorum inclusion, and show that the three conditions together are sufficient: we present reliable broadcast and consensus protocols, and prove their correctness for quorum systems that provide the three properties.

Despite their promising performance, it is hard for deep neural networks to provide biological insights for humans due to their black-box nature. Recently, some works integrated biological knowledge with neural networks to improve the transparency and performance of their models. However, these methods can only incorporate partial biological knowledge, leading to suboptimal performance. In this paper, we propose the Biological Factor Regulatory Neural Network (BFReg-NN), a generic framework to model relations among biological factors in cell systems. BFReg-NN starts from gene expression data and is capable of merging most existing biological knowledge into the model, including the regulatory relations among genes or proteins (e.g., gene regulatory networks (GRN), protein-protein interaction networks (PPI)) and the hierarchical relations among genes, proteins and pathways (e.g., several genes/proteins are contained in a pathway). Moreover, BFReg-NN also has the ability to provide new biologically meaningful insights because of its white-box characteristics. Experimental results on different gene expression-based tasks verify the superiority of BFReg-NN compared with baselines. Our case studies also show that the key insights found by BFReg-NN are consistent with the biological literature. ",

Anomaly-based detection methods are promising in finding new attacks, but there are certain practical challenges like false-positive alarms, hard to explain, and difficult to scale cost-effectively. The IETF recent standard called Manufacturer Usage Description (MUD) seems promising to limit the attack surface on IoT devices by formally specifying their intended network behavior. In this paper, we use SDN to enforce and monitor the expected behaviors of each IoT device, and train one-class classifier models to detect volumetric attacks. Our specific contributions are fourfold. (1) We develop a multi-level inferencing model to dynamically detect anomalous patterns in network activity of MUD-compliant traffic flows via SDN telemetry, followed by packet inspection of anomalous flows. This provides enhanced fine-grained visibility into distributed and direct attacks, allowing us to precisely isolate volumetric attacks with microflow (5-tuple) resolution. (2) We collect traffic traces (benign and a variety of volumetric attacks) from network behavior of IoT devices in our lab, generate labeled datasets, and make them available to the public. (3) We prototype a full working system (modules are released as open-source), demonstrates its efficacy in detecting volumetric attacks on several consumer IoT devices with high accuracy while maintaining low false positives, and provides insights into cost and performance of our system. (4) We demonstrate how our models scale in environments with a large number of connected IoTs (with datasets collected from a network of IP cameras in our university campus) by considering various training strategies (per device unit versus per device type), and balancing the accuracy of prediction against the cost of models in terms of size and training time.

To be more precise, the proposed technique includes two parts, that are, module weight multiplexing and attention score multiplexing. Moreover, a novel decoder structure has been proposed to facilitate the attention score multiplexing. Extensive experiments have been conducted to validate the effectiveness of Sim-T. In Aishell-1 dataset, when the proposed Sim-T is 48% parameter less than the baseline Transformer, 0.4% CER improvement can be obtained. Alternatively, 69% parameter reduction can be achieved if the Sim-T gives the same performance as the baseline Transformer. With regard to the HKUST and WSJ eval92 datasets, CER and WER will be improved by 0.3% and 0.2%, respectively, when parameters in Sim-T are 40% less than the baseline Transformer. ",

Analyzing privacy amplification via shuffling is a critical component in both single-message and multi-message shuffle protocols. However, current methods used in these two areas are distinct and specific, making them less convenient for protocol designers and practitioners. In this work, we introduce variation-ratio reduction as a unified framework for privacy amplification analyses in the shuffle model. This framework utilizes total variation bounds of local messages and probability ratio bounds of other users' blanket messages, converting them to indistinguishable levels. Our results indicate that the framework yields tighter bounds for both single-message and multi-message encoders (e.g., with local DP, local metric DP, or general multi-message randomizers). Specifically, for a broad range of local randomizers having extremal probability design, our amplification bounds are precisely tight. We also demonstrate that variation-ratio reduction is well-suited for parallel composition in the shuffle model and results in stricter privacy accounting for common sampling-based local randomizers. Our experimental findings show that, compared to existing amplification bounds, our numerical amplification bounds can save up to $30\\%$ of the budget for single-message protocols, $75\\%$ of the budget for multi-message protocols, and $75\\%$-$95\\%$ of the budget for parallel composition. Additionally, our implementation for numerical amplification bounds has only $\\tilde{O}(n)$ complexity and is highly efficient in practice, taking just $2$ minutes for $n=10^8$ users.

Detecting so-called out-of-distribution (OoD) samples is crucial in safety-critical applications such as robotically-guided retinal microsurgery, where distances between the instrument and the retina are derived from sequences of 1D images that are acquired by an instrument-integrated optical coherence tomography (iiOCT) probe. Methods: This work investigates the feasibility of using an OoD detector to identify when images from the iiOCT probe are inappropriate for subsequent machine learning-based distance estimation. We show how a simple OoD detector based on the Mahalanobis distance can successfully reject corrupted samples coming from real-world ex-vivo porcine eyes. Results: Our results demonstrate that the proposed approach can successfully detect OoD samples and help maintain the performance of the downstream task within reasonable levels. MahaAD outperformed a supervised approach trained on the same kind of corruptions and achieved the best performance in detecting OoD cases from a collection of iiOCT samples with real-world corruptions. Conclusion: The results indicate that detecting corrupted iiOCT data through OoD detection is feasible and does not need prior knowledge of possible corruptions. Consequently, MahaAD could aid in ensuring patient safety during robotically-guided microsurgery by preventing deployed prediction models from estimating distances that put the patient at risk. ",

    "abstract": "In this work, we investigate the potential threat of adversarial examples to the security of face recognition systems. Although previous research has explored the adversarial risk to individual components of FRSs, our study presents an initial exploration of an adversary simultaneously fooling multiple components: the face detector and feature extractor in an FRS pipeline. We propose three multi-objective attacks on FRSs and demonstrate their effectiveness through a preliminary experimental analysis on a target system. Our attacks achieved up to 100% Attack Success Rates against both the face detector and feature extractor and were able to manipulate the face detection probability by up to 50% depending on the adversarial objective. This research identifies and examines novel attack vectors against FRSs and suggests possible ways to augment the robustness by leveraging the attack vector's knowledge during training of an FRS's components.

    "abstract": "Graph representation learning aims to effectively encode high-dimensional sparse graph-structured data into low-dimensional dense vectors, which is a fundamental task that has been widely studied in a range of fields, including machine learning and data mining. Classic graph embedding methods follow the basic idea that the embedding vectors of interconnected nodes in the graph can still maintain a relatively close distance, thereby preserving the structural information between the nodes in the graph. However, this is sub-optimal due to: (i) traditional methods have limited model capacity which limits the learning performance; (ii) existing techniques typically rely on unsupervised learning strategies and fail to couple with the latest learning paradigms; (iii) representation learning and downstream tasks are dependent on each other which should be jointly enhanced. With the remarkable success of deep learning, deep graph representation learning has shown great potential and advantages over shallow (traditional) methods, there exist a large number of deep graph representation learning techniques have been proposed in the past decade, especially graph neural networks. In this survey, we conduct a comprehensive survey on current deep graph representation learning algorithms by proposing a new taxonomy of existing state-of-the-art literature. Specifically, we systematically summarize the essential components of graph representation learning and categorize existing approaches by the ways of graph neural network architectures and the most recent advanced learning paradigms. Moreover, this survey also provides the practical and promising applications of deep graph representation learning. Last but not least, we state new perspectives and suggest challenging directions which deserve further investigations in the future. ",

    "abstract": "Learning unbiased node representations for imbalanced samples in the graph has become a more remarkable and important topic. For the graph, a significant challenge is that the topological properties of the nodes (e.g., locations, roles) are unbalanced (topology-imbalance), other than the number of training labeled nodes (quantity-imbalance). Existing studies on topology-imbalance focus on the location or the local neighborhood structure of nodes, ignoring the global underlying hierarchical properties of the graph, i.e., hierarchy. In the real-world scenario, the hierarchical structure of graph data reveals important topological properties of graphs and is relevant to a wide range of applications. We find that training labeled nodes with different hierarchical properties have a significant impact on the node classification tasks and confirm it in our experiments. It is well known that hyperbolic geometry has a unique advantage in representing the hierarchical structure of graphs. Therefore, we attempt to explore the hierarchy-imbalance issue for node classification of graph neural networks with a novelty perspective of hyperbolic geometry, including its characteristics and causes. Then, we propose a novel hyperbolic geometric hierarchy-imbalance learning framework, named HyperIMBA, to alleviate the hierarchy-imbalance issue caused by uneven hierarchy-levels and cross-hierarchy connectivity patterns of labeled nodes.Extensive experimental results demonstrate the superior effectiveness of HyperIMBA for hierarchy-imbalance node classification tasks.

Before pediatric surgeons perform surgery, they need to ask patients how the fracture occurred and analyze the fracture situation by interpreting X-ray images. The interpretation of X-ray images often requires a combination of techniques from radiologists and surgeons, which requires time-consuming specialized training. With the rise of deep learning in the field of computer vision, network models applying for fracture detection has become an important research topic. In this paper, YOLOv8 algorithm is used to train models on the GRAZPEDWRI-DX dataset, which includes X-ray images from 6,091 pediatric patients with wrist trauma. The experimental results show that YOLOv8 algorithm models have different advantages for different model sizes, with YOLOv8l model achieving the highest mean average precision (mAP 50) of 63.6\\%, and YOLOv8n model achieving the inference time of 67.4ms per X-ray image on one single CPU with low computing power. In this way, we create \"Fracture Detection Using YOLOv8 App\" to assist surgeons in interpreting X-ray images without the help of radiologists.

Unfortunately, the existing deep learning-based methods neglect the hidden dependencies in different dimensions and also rarely consider the unique dynamic features of time series, which lack sufficient feature extraction capability to obtain satisfactory classification accuracy. To address this problem, we propose a novel temporal dynamic graph neural network (TodyNet) that can extract hidden spatio-temporal dependencies without undefined graph structure. It enables information flow among isolated but implicit interdependent variables and captures the associations between different time slots by dynamic graph mechanism, which further improves the classification performance of the model. Meanwhile, the hierarchical representations of graphs cannot be learned due to the limitation of GNNs. Thus, we also design a temporal graph pooling layer to obtain a global graph-level representation for graph learning with learnable temporal parameters. The dynamic graph, graph information propagation, and temporal convolution are jointly learned in an end-to-end framework. The experiments on 26 UEA benchmark datasets illustrate that the proposed TodyNet outperforms existing deep learning-based methods in the MTSC tasks. ",

Most SOH estimation methods focus on the 0-100\\% full state-of-charge (SOC) range that has similar distributions. However, the batteries in real-world applications usually work in the partial SOC range under shallow-cycle conditions and follow different degradation profiles with no labeled data available, thus making SOH estimation challenging. To estimate shallow-cycle battery SOH, a novel unsupervised deep transfer learning method is proposed to bridge different domains using self-attention distillation module and multi-kernel maximum mean discrepancy technique. The proposed method automatically extracts domain-variant features from charge curves to transfer knowledge from the large-scale labeled full cycles to the unlabeled shallow cycles. The CALCE and SNL battery datasets are employed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method to estimate the battery SOH for different SOC ranges, temperatures, and discharge rates. The proposed method achieves a root-mean-square error within 2\\% and outperforms other transfer learning methods for different SOC ranges. When applied to batteries with different operating conditions and from different manufacturers, the proposed method still exhibits superior SOH estimation performance. The proposed method is the first attempt at accurately estimating battery SOH under shallow-cycle conditions without needing a full-cycle characteristic test. ",

    "abstract": "Two-stage object detectors generate object proposals and classify them to detect objects in images. These proposals often do not contain the objects perfectly but overlap with them in many possible ways, exhibiting great variability in the difficulty levels of the proposals. Training a robust classifier against this crop-related variability requires abundant training data, which is not available in few-shot settings. To mitigate this issue, we propose a novel variational autoencoder (VAE) based data generation model, which is capable of generating data with increased crop-related diversity. The main idea is to transform the latent space such latent codes with different norms represent different crop-related variations. This allows us to generate features with increased crop-related diversity in difficulty levels by simply varying the latent norm. In particular, each latent code is rescaled such that its norm linearly correlates with the IoU score of the input crop w.r.t. the ground-truth box. Here the IoU score is a proxy that represents the difficulty level of the crop. We train this VAE model on base classes conditioned on the semantic code of each class and then use the trained model to generate features for novel classes. In our experiments our generated features consistently improve state-of-the-art few-shot object detection methods on the PASCAL VOC and MS COCO datasets. ",

    "abstract": "Talking head generation aims to generate faces that maintain the identity information of the source image and imitate the motion of the driving image. Most pioneering methods rely primarily on 2D representations and thus will inevitably suffer from face distortion when large head rotations are encountered. Recent works instead employ explicit 3D structural representations or implicit neural rendering to improve performance under large pose changes. Nevertheless, the fidelity of identity and expression is not so desirable, especially for novel-view synthesis. In this paper, we propose HiDe-NeRF, which achieves high-fidelity and free-view talking-head synthesis. Drawing on the recently proposed Deformable Neural Radiance Fields, HiDe-NeRF represents the 3D dynamic scene into a canonical appearance field and an implicit deformation field, where the former comprises the canonical source face and the latter models the driving pose and expression. In particular, we improve fidelity from two aspects: (i) to enhance identity expressiveness, we design a generalized appearance module that leverages multi-scale volume features to preserve face shape and details; (ii) to improve expression preciseness, we propose a lightweight deformation module that explicitly decouples the pose and expression to enable precise expression modeling. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed approach can generate better results than previous works. Project page: https://www.waytron.net/hidenerf/ ",

Evaluating the robustness of detection models in the physical world can be challenging due to the time-consuming and labor-intensive nature of many experiments. Thus, virtual simulation experiments can provide a solution to this challenge. However, there is no unified detection benchmark based on virtual simulation environment. To address this challenge, we proposed an instant-level data generation pipeline based on the CARLA simulator. Using this pipeline, we generated the DCI dataset and conducted extensive experiments on three detection models and three physical adversarial attacks. The dataset covers 7 continuous and 1 discrete scenes, with over 40 angles, 20 distances, and 20,000 positions. The results indicate that Yolo v6 had strongest resistance, with only a 6.59% average AP drop, and ASA was the most effective attack algorithm with a 14.51% average AP reduction, twice that of other algorithms. Static scenes had higher recognition AP, and results under different weather conditions were similar. Adversarial attack algorithm improvement may be approaching its 'limitation'. ",

    "abstract": "We focus on learning composable policies to control a variety of physical agents with possibly different structures. Among state-of-the-art methods, prominent approaches exploit graph-based representations and weight-sharing modular policies based on the message-passing framework. However, as shown by recent literature, message passing can create bottlenecks in information propagation and hinder global coordination. This drawback can become even more problematic in tasks where high-level planning is crucial. In fact, in similar scenarios, each modular policy - e.g., controlling a joint of a robot - would request to coordinate not only for basic locomotion but also achieve high-level goals, such as navigating a maze. A classical solution to avoid similar pitfalls is to resort to hierarchical decision-making. In this work, we adopt the Feudal Reinforcement Learning paradigm to develop agents where control actions are the outcome of a hierarchical (pyramidal) message-passing process. In the proposed Feudal Graph Reinforcement Learning (FGRL) framework, high-level decisions at the top level of the hierarchy are propagated through a layered graph representing a hierarchy of policies. Lower layers mimic the morphology of the physical system and upper layers can capture more abstract sub-modules. The purpose of this preliminary work is to formalize the framework and provide proof-of-concept experiments on benchmark environments (MuJoCo locomotion tasks). Empirical evaluation shows promising results on both standard benchmarks and zero-shot transfer learning settings. ",

    "abstract": "With the fast development of AI-related techniques, the applications of trajectory prediction are no longer limited to easier scenes and trajectories. More and more heterogeneous trajectories with different representation forms, such as 2D or 3D coordinates, 2D or 3D bounding boxes, and even high-dimensional human skeletons, need to be analyzed and forecasted. Among these heterogeneous trajectories, interactions between different elements within a frame of trajectory, which we call the ``Dimension-Wise Interactions'', would be more complex and challenging. However, most previous approaches focus mainly on a specific form of trajectories, which means these methods could not be used to forecast heterogeneous trajectories, not to mention the dimension-wise interaction. Besides, previous methods mostly treat trajectory prediction as a normal time sequence generation task, indicating that these methods may require more work to directly analyze agents' behaviors and social interactions at different temporal scales. In this paper, we bring a new ``view'' for trajectory prediction to model and forecast trajectories hierarchically according to different frequency portions from the spectral domain to learn to forecast trajectories by considering their frequency responses. Moreover, we try to expand the current trajectory prediction task by introducing the dimension $M$ from ``another view'', thus extending its application scenarios to heterogeneous trajectories vertically. Finally, we adopt the bilinear structure to fuse two factors, including the frequency response and the dimension-wise interaction, to forecast heterogeneous trajectories via spectrums hierarchically in a generic way. Experiments show that the proposed model outperforms most state-of-the-art methods on ETH-UCY, Stanford Drone Dataset and nuScenes with heterogeneous trajectories, including 2D coordinates, 2D and 3D bounding boxes.

Inspired by video codec theory, we introduce a brand-new VAD paradigm to break through these limitations: First, we propose a new task of video event restoration based on keyframes. Encouraging DNN to infer missing multiple frames based on video keyframes so as to restore a video event, which can more effectively motivate DNN to mine and learn potential higher-level visual features and comprehensive temporal context relationships in the video. To this end, we propose a novel U-shaped Swin Transformer Network with Dual Skip Connections (USTN-DSC) for video event restoration, where a cross-attention and a temporal upsampling residual skip connection are introduced to further assist in restoring complex static and dynamic motion object features in the video. In addition, we propose a simple and effective adjacent frame difference loss to constrain the motion consistency of the video sequence.

The study shows that simpler models, such as low-order integrator models, are preferred over more complex ones, e.g., kinematic models, to achieve accurate predictions.

    "abstract": "This paper investigates the effect of low-resolution analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) on device activity detection in massive machine-type communications (mMTC). The low-resolution ADCs induce two challenges on the device activity detection compared with the traditional setup with assumption of infinite ADC resolution. First, the codebook design for signal quantization by the low-resolution ADCs is particularly important since a good codebook design can lead to small quantization error on the received signal, which in turn has significant influence on the activity detector performance. To this end, prior information about the received signal power is needed, which depends on the number of active devices $K$. This is sharply different from the activity detection problem in traditional setups, in which the knowledge of $K$ is not required by the BS as a prerequisite. Second, the covariance-based approach achieves good activity detection performance in traditional setups while it is not clear if it can still achieve good performance in this paper. To solve the above challenges, we propose a communication protocol that consists of an estimator for $K$ and a detector for active device identities: 1) For the estimator, the technical difficulty is that the design of the ADC quantizer and the estimation of $K$ are closely intertwined and doing one needs the information/execution from the other. We propose a progressive estimator which iteratively performs the estimation of $K$ and the design of the ADC quantizer; 2) For the activity detector, we propose a custom-designed stochastic gradient descent algorithm to estimate the active device identities. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the communication protocol. ",

We study the performance of the two algorithms theoretically, and compare them to other algorithms by simulation.

    "abstract": "Federated learning (FL) provides a variety of privacy advantages by allowing clients to collaboratively train a model without sharing their private data. However, recent studies have shown that private information can still be leaked through shared gradients. To further minimize the risk of privacy leakage, existing defenses usually require clients to locally modify their gradients (e.g., differential privacy) prior to sharing with the server. While these approaches are effective in certain cases, they regard the entire data as a single entity to protect, which usually comes at a large cost in model utility. In this paper, we seek to reconcile utility and privacy in FL by proposing a user-configurable privacy defense, RecUP-FL, that can better focus on the user-specified sensitive attributes while obtaining significant improvements in utility over traditional defenses. Moreover, we observe that existing inference attacks often rely on a machine learning model to extract the private information (e.g., attributes). We thus formulate such a privacy defense as an adversarial learning problem, where RecUP-FL generates slight perturbations that can be added to the gradients before sharing to fool adversary models. To improve the transferability to un-queryable black-box adversary models, inspired by the idea of meta-learning, RecUP-FL forms a model zoo containing a set of substitute models and iteratively alternates between simulations of the white-box and the black-box adversarial attack scenarios to generate perturbations. Extensive experiments on four datasets under various adversarial settings (both attribute inference attack and data reconstruction attack) show that RecUP-FL can meet user-specified privacy constraints over the sensitive attributes while significantly improving the model utility compared with state-of-the-art privacy defenses.

    "abstract": "Spider webs are incredible biological structures, comprising thin but strong silk filament and arranged into complex hierarchical architectures with striking mechanical properties (e.g., lightweight but high strength, achieving diverse mechanical responses). While simple 2D orb webs can easily be mimicked, the modeling and synthesis of 3D-based web structures remain challenging, partly due to the rich set of design features. Here we provide a detailed analysis of the heterogenous graph structures of spider webs, and use deep learning as a way to model and then synthesize artificial, bio-inspired 3D web structures. The generative AI models are conditioned based on key geometric parameters (including average edge length, number of nodes, average node degree, and others). To identify graph construction principles, we use inductive representation sampling of large experimentally determined spider web graphs, to yield a dataset that is used to train three conditional generative models: 1) An analog diffusion model inspired by nonequilibrium thermodynamics, with sparse neighbor representation, 2) a discrete diffusion model with full neighbor representation, and 3) an autoregressive transformer architecture with full neighbor representation. All three models are scalable, produce complex, de novo bio-inspired spider web mimics, and successfully construct graphs that meet the design objectives. We further propose algorithm that assembles web samples produced by the generative models into larger-scale structures based on a series of geometric design targets, including helical and parametric shapes, mimicking, and extending natural design principles towards integration with diverging engineering objectives. Several webs are manufactured using 3D printing and tested to assess mechanical properties. ",

In this paper, we present an object-based loop closure detection method based on the spatial layout and semanic consistency of the 3D scene graph. Firstly, we propose an object-level data association approach based on the semantic information from semantic labels, intersection over union (IoU), object color, and object embedding. Subsequently, multi-view bundle adjustment with the associated objects is utilized to jointly optimize the poses of objects and cameras. We represent the refined objects as a 3D spatial graph with semantics and topology. Then, we propose a graph matching approach to select correspondence objects based on the structure layout and semantic property similarity of vertices' neighbors. Finally, we jointly optimize camera trajectories and object poses in an object-level pose graph optimization, which results in a globally consistent map. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed data association approach can construct more accurate 3D semantic maps, and our loop closure method is more robust than point-based and object-based methods in circumstances with large viewpoint changes.

    "abstract": "Deep learning based fusion methods have been achieving promising performance in image fusion tasks. This is attributed to the network architecture that plays a very important role in the fusion process. However, in general, it is hard to specify a good fusion architecture, and consequently, the design of fusion networks is still a black art, rather than science. To address this problem, we formulate the fusion task mathematically, and establish a connection between its optimal solution and the network architecture that can implement it. This approach leads to a novel method proposed in the paper of constructing a lightweight fusion network. It avoids the time-consuming empirical network design by a trial-and-test strategy. In particular we adopt a learnable representation approach to the fusion task, in which the construction of the fusion network architecture is guided by the optimisation algorithm producing the learnable model. The low-rank representation (LRR) objective is the foundation of our learnable model. The matrix multiplications, which are at the heart of the solution are transformed into convolutional operations, and the iterative process of optimisation is replaced by a special feed-forward network. Based on this novel network architecture, an end-to-end lightweight fusion network is constructed to fuse infrared and visible light images. Its successful training is facilitated by a detail-to-semantic information loss function proposed to preserve the image details and to enhance the salient features of the source images. Our experiments show that the proposed fusion network exhibits better fusion performance than the state-of-the-art fusion methods on public datasets. Interestingly, our network requires a fewer training parameters than other existing methods. ",

Existing methods suffer from semantic mixture and imbalance issue because they mainly focus on anomaly discrimination, ignoring representation learning. It conflicts with the assortativity assumption that anomalous nodes commonly connect with normal nodes directly. Additionally, there are far fewer anomalous nodes than normal nodes, indicating a long-tailed data distribution. To address these challenges, a unique algorithm,Decoupled Self-supervised Learning forAnomalyDetection (DSLAD), is proposed in this paper. DSLAD is a self-supervised method with anomaly discrimination and representation learning decoupled for anomaly detection. DSLAD employs bilinear pooling and masked autoencoder as the anomaly discriminators. By decoupling anomaly discrimination and representation learning, a balanced feature space is constructed, in which nodes are more semantically discriminative, as well as imbalance issue can be resolved. Experiments conducted on various six benchmark datasets reveal the effectiveness of DSLAD. ",

Despite its potential, the misuse of ChatGPT poses significant concerns, especially in education and safetycritical domains. Numerous AIGC detectors have been developed and evaluated on natural language data. However, their performance on code-related content generated by ChatGPT remains unexplored. To fill this gap, in this paper, we present the first empirical study on evaluating existing AIGC detectors in the software domain. We created a comprehensive dataset including 492.5K samples comprising code-related content produced by ChatGPT, encompassing popular software activities like Q&A (115K), code summarization (126K), and code generation (226.5K). We evaluated six AIGC detectors, including three commercial and three open-source solutions, assessing their performance on this dataset. Additionally, we conducted a human study to understand human detection capabilities and compare them with the existing AIGC detectors. Our results indicate that AIGC detectors demonstrate lower performance on code-related data compared to natural language data. Fine-tuning can enhance detector performance, especially for content within the same domain; but generalization remains a challenge. The human evaluation reveals that detection by humans is quite challenging. ",

Early detection of abnormalities is crucial to prevent catastrophic accidents.

Two-dimensionalization methods such as the Gram angle field method (GAF) or interval sampling have been proposed, but they lack mathematical derivation and interpretability. This paper proposes an improved GAF combined with grayscale images for convolution scenarios. The main contributions include illustrating the feasibility of the approach in complex scenarios, widening the data set, and introducing an improved convolutional neural network method with a multi-scale feature fusion diffusion model and deep learning compression techniques for deployment in industrial scenarios.

    "abstract": "Multivariate time series data comprises various channels of variables. The multivariate forecasting models need to capture the relationship between the channels to accurately predict future values. However, recently, there has been an emergence of methods that employ the Channel Independent (CI) strategy. These methods view multivariate time series data as separate univariate time series and disregard the correlation between channels. Surprisingly, our empirical results have shown that models trained with the CI strategy outperform those trained with the Channel Dependent (CD) strategy, usually by a significant margin. Nevertheless, the reasons behind this phenomenon have not yet been thoroughly explored in the literature. This paper provides comprehensive empirical and theoretical analyses of the characteristics of multivariate time series datasets and the CI/CD strategy. Our results conclude that the CD approach has higher capacity but often lacks robustness to accurately predict distributionally drifted time series. In contrast, the CI approach trades capacity for robust prediction. Practical measures inspired by these analyses are proposed to address the capacity and robustness dilemma, including a modified CD method called Predict Residuals with Regularization (PRReg) that can surpass the CI strategy. We hope our findings can raise awareness among researchers about the characteristics of multivariate time series and inspire the construction of better forecasting models. ",

    "abstract": "Rule-based surrogate models are an effective and interpretable way to approximate a Deep Neural Network's (DNN) decision boundaries, allowing humans to easily understand deep learning models. Current state-of-the-art decompositional methods, which are those that consider the DNN's latent space to extract more exact rule sets, manage to derive rule sets at high accuracy. However, they a) do not guarantee that the surrogate model has learned from the same variables as the DNN (alignment), b) only allow to optimise for a single objective, such as accuracy, which can result in excessively large rule sets (complexity), and c) use decision tree algorithms as intermediate models, which can result in different explanations for the same DNN (stability). This paper introduces the CGX (Column Generation eXplainer) to address these limitations - a decompositional method using dual linear programming to extract rules from the hidden representations of the DNN. This approach allows to optimise for any number of objectives and empowers users to tweak the explanation model to their needs. We evaluate our results on a wide variety of tasks and show that CGX meets all three criteria, by having exact reproducibility of the explanation model that guarantees stability and reduces the rule set size by >80% (complexity) at equivalent or improved accuracy and fidelity across tasks (alignment).

While effective and prevalent, fine-tuning the pre-trained parameters incurs a large computational cost. In this paper, we conduct an extensive experimental study to explore what happens to layer-wise pre-trained representations and their encoded code knowledge during fine-tuning. We then propose efficient alternatives to fine-tune the large pre-trained code model based on the above findings. Our experimental study shows that (1) lexical, syntactic and structural properties of source code are encoded in the lower, intermediate, and higher layers, respectively, while the semantic property spans across the entire model. (2) The process of fine-tuning preserves most of the code properties. Specifically, the basic code properties captured by lower and intermediate layers are still preserved during fine-tuning. Furthermore, we find that only the representations of the top two layers change most during fine-tuning for various downstream tasks. (3) Based on the above findings, we propose Telly to efficiently fine-tune pre-trained code models via layer freezing. The extensive experimental results on five various downstream tasks demonstrate that training parameters and the corresponding time cost are greatly reduced, while performances are similar or better.

Although the synthesis quality is excellent, existing NeRF-based methods fail to obtain moderate three-dimensional (3D) structures. The novel view synthesis quality drops dramatically given sparse input due to the implicitly reconstructed inaccurate 3D-scene structure. We propose SfMNeRF, a method to better synthesize novel views as well as reconstruct the 3D-scene geometry. SfMNeRF leverages the knowledge from the self-supervised depth estimation methods to constrain the 3D-scene geometry during view synthesis training. Specifically, SfMNeRF employs the epipolar, photometric consistency, depth smoothness, and position-of-matches constraints to explicitly reconstruct the 3D-scene structure. Through these explicit constraints and the implicit constraint from NeRF, our method improves the view synthesis as well as the 3D-scene geometry performance of NeRF at the same time. In addition, SfMNeRF synthesizes novel sub-pixels in which the ground truth is obtained by image interpolation. This strategy enables SfMNeRF to include more samples to improve generalization performance. Experiments on two public datasets demonstrate that SfMNeRF surpasses state-of-the-art approaches.

Such unprecedented interaction experiences may pose considerable social and psychological risks to the users unless the technology is properly controlled. This creates an urgent need for scalable and robust evaluation metrics for conversational chatbots. Existing automatic evaluation metrics usually focus on objective quality measures and disregard subjective perceptions of social dimensions. Moreover, most of these approaches operate on pre-produced dialogs from available benchmark corpora, which implies human involvement for preparing the material for evaluation and, thus, impeded scalability of the metrics. To address this limitation, we propose to make use of the emerging large language models (LLMs) from the GPT-family and describe a new framework allowing to conduct dialog system evaluation with prompting. With this framework, we are able to achieve full automation of the evaluation pipeline and reach impressive correlation with the human judgement (up to Pearson r=0.95 on system level). The underlying concept is to collect synthetic chat logs of evaluated bots with a LLM in the other-play setting, where LLM is carefully conditioned to follow a specific scenario. We further explore different prompting approaches to produce evaluation scores with the same LLM. The best-performing prompts, containing few-show demonstrations and instructions, show outstanding performance on the tested dataset and demonstrate the ability to generalize to other dialog corpora.

    "abstract": "One of the major challenges slowing down the use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) as aerial base stations (ABSs) is the limited on-board power supply which reduces the UAV's flight time. Using a tether to provide UAVs with power can be considered a reasonable compromise that will enhance the flight time while limiting the UAV's mobility. In this work, we propose a system where ABSs are deployed at the centers of user hotspots to offload the traffic and assist terrestrial base stations (TBSs). Firstly, given the location of the ground station in the user hotspot (user cluster) and the users spatial distribution, we compute the optimal inclination angle and length of the tether. Using these results, we compute the densities of the tethered UAVs deployed at different altitudes, which enables tractable analysis of the interference in the considered setup. Next, using tools from stochastic geometry and an approach of dividing user clusters into finite frames, we analyze the coverage probability as a function of the maximum tether length, the density of accessible rooftops for UAV ground station deployment, and the density of clusters. We verify our findings using Monte-Carlo simulations and draw multiple useful insights. For instance, we show that it is actually better to deploy UAVs at a fraction of the clusters, not all of them as it is usually assumed in literature. ",

Recently, an augmented framework has been developed to overcome some limitations that emerged in the application of the original framework. In this paper, we propose a new class of continuous-depth neural networks with delay, named Neural Delay Differential Equations (NDDEs). To compute the corresponding gradients, we use the adjoint sensitivity method to obtain the delayed dynamics of the adjoint. Differential equations with delays are typically seen as dynamical systems of infinite dimension that possess more fruitful dynamics. Compared to NODEs, NDDEs have a stronger capacity of nonlinear representations. We use several illustrative examples to demonstrate this outstanding capacity. Firstly, we successfully model the delayed dynamics where the trajectories in the lower-dimensional phase space could be mutually intersected and even chaotic in a model-free or model-based manner. Traditional NODEs, without any argumentation, are not directly applicable for such modeling. Secondly, we achieve lower loss and higher accuracy not only for the data produced synthetically by complex models but also for the CIFAR10, a well-known image dataset. Our results on the NDDEs demonstrate that appropriately articulating the elements of dynamical systems into the network design is truly beneficial in promoting network performance. ",

In order to minimize false collision warnings, in our multi-step framework, first, the large animal is accurately detected and a preliminary risk level is predicted for it and low-risk animals are discarded. In the next stage, a multi-stream CONV-LSTM-based encoder-decoder framework is designed to predict the future trajectory of the potentially high-risk animals. The proposed model uses camera motion prediction as well as the local and global context of the scene to generate accurate predictions. Furthermore, this paper introduces a new dataset of FIR videos for large animal detection and risk estimation in real nighttime driving scenarios.

Because this pretext task differs from the downstream tasks used to evaluate the performance of these models, there is an inherent misalignment or pretraining bias. A commonly used trick in SSL, shown to make deep networks more robust to such bias, is the addition of a small projector (usually a 2 or 3 layer multi-layer perceptron) on top of a backbone network during training. In contrast to previous work that studied the impact of the projector architecture, we here focus on a simpler, yet overlooked lever to control the information in the backbone representation. We show that merely changing its dimensionality -- by changing only the size of the backbone's very last block -- is a remarkably effective technique to mitigate the pretraining bias. It significantly improves downstream transfer performance for both Self-Supervised and Supervised pretrained models. ",

However, the limited computing resources on edge nodes make the models vulnerable to attacks, such that the predictions made by models are unreliable. In this paper, we investigate latency attacks on deep learning applications. Unlike common adversarial attacks for misclassification, the goal of latency attacks is to increase the inference time, which may stop applications from responding to the requests within a reasonable time. This kind of attack is ubiquitous for various applications, and we use object detection to demonstrate how such kind of attacks work. We also design a framework named Overload to generate latency attacks at scale. Our method is based on a newly formulated optimization problem and a novel technique, called spatial attention, to increase the inference time of object detection. We have conducted experiments using YOLOv5 models on Nvidia NX. The experimental results show that with latency attacks, the inference time of a single image can be increased ten times longer in reference to the normal setting. Moreover, comparing to existing methods, our attacking method is simpler and more effective. ",

These dequantization results typically hold when classical algorithms can access the data via length-squared sampling. In this work we investigate how robust these dequantization results are. We introduce the notion of approximate length-squared sampling, where classical algorithms are only able to sample from a distribution close to the ideal distribution in total variation distance. While quantum algorithms are natively robust against small perturbations, current techniques in dequantization are not. Our main technical contribution is showing how many techniques from randomized linear algebra can be adapted to work under this weaker assumption as well. We then use these techniques to show that the recent low-rank dequantization framework by Chia, Gily\\'en, Li, Lin, Tang and Wang (JACM 2022) and the dequantization framework for sparse matrices by Gharibian and Le Gall (STOC 2022), which are both based on the Quantum Singular Value Transformation, can be generalized to the case of approximate length-squared sampling access to the input.

    "title": "Audio Bank: A High-Level Acoustic Signal Representation for Audio Event  Recognition",
    "abstract": "Automatic audio event recognition plays a pivotal role in making human robot interaction more closer and has a wide applicability in industrial automation, control and surveillance systems. Audio event is composed of intricate phonic patterns which are harmonically entangled. Audio recognition is dominated by low and mid-level features, which have demonstrated their recognition capability but they have high computational cost and low semantic meaning. In this paper, we propose a new computationally efficient framework for audio recognition. Audio Bank, a new high-level representation of audio, is comprised of distinctive audio detectors representing each audio class in frequency-temporal space. Dimensionality of the resulting feature vector is reduced using non-negative matrix factorization preserving its discriminability and rich semantic information. The high audio recognition performance using several classifiers (SVM, neural network, Gaussian process classification and k-nearest neighbors) shows the effectiveness of the proposed method. ",

    "abstract": "This paper is concerned with model predictive control (MPC) of discrete-time linear systems subject to bounded additive disturbance and hard constraints on the state and input, whereas the true disturbance set is unknown. Unlike most existing work on robust MPC, we propose an MPC algorithm incorporating online uncertainty quantification that builds on prior knowledge of the disturbance, i.e., a known but conservative disturbance set. We approximate the true disturbance set at each time step with a parameterised set, which is referred to as a quantified disturbance set, using the scenario approach with additional disturbance realisations collected online. A key novelty of this paper is that the parameterisation of these quantified disturbance sets enjoy desirable properties such that the quantified disturbance set and its corresponding rigid tube bounding disturbance propagation can be efficiently updated online. We provide statistical gaps between the true and quantified disturbance sets, based on which, probabilistic recursive feasibility of MPC optimisation problems are discussed. Numerical simulations are provided to demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed algorithm and compare with conventional robust MPC algorithms. ",

One of the main defense techniques is to identify the source of attack by reconstructing the attack graph, and then filter the messages arriving from this source. One of the most common methods for reconstructing the attack graph is Probabilistic Packet Marking (PPM). We focus on edge-sampling, which is the most common method. Here, we study the time, in terms of the number of packets, the victim needs to reconstruct the attack graph when there is a single attacker. This random variable plays an important role in the reconstruction algorithm. Our main result is a determination of the asymptotic distribution and expected value of this time. The process of reconstructing the attack graph is analogous to a version of the well-known coupon collector's problem (with coupons having distinct probabilities). Thus, the results may be used in other applications of this problem. ",

    "abstract": "Graph neural networks (GNNs) have gained traction in high-energy physics (HEP) for their potential to improve accuracy and scalability. However, their resource-intensive nature and complex operations have motivated the development of symmetry-equivariant architectures. In this work, we introduce EuclidNet, a novel symmetry-equivariant GNN for charged particle tracking. EuclidNet leverages the graph representation of collision events and enforces rotational symmetry with respect to the detector's beamline axis, leading to a more efficient model. We benchmark EuclidNet against the state-of-the-art Interaction Network on the TrackML dataset, which simulates high-pileup conditions expected at the High-Luminosity Large Hadron Collider (HL-LHC). Our results show that EuclidNet achieves near-state-of-the-art performance at small model scales (<1000 parameters), outperforming the non-equivariant benchmarks. This study paves the way for future investigations into more resource-efficient GNN models for particle tracking in HEP experiments. ",

    "title": "Selecting Robust Features for Machine Learning Applications using  Multidata Causal Discovery",
    "abstract": "Robust feature selection is vital for creating reliable and interpretable Machine Learning (ML) models. When designing statistical prediction models in cases where domain knowledge is limited and underlying interactions are unknown, choosing the optimal set of features is often difficult. To mitigate this issue, we introduce a Multidata (M) causal feature selection approach that simultaneously processes an ensemble of time series datasets and produces a single set of causal drivers. This approach uses the causal discovery algorithms PC1 or PCMCI that are implemented in the Tigramite Python package. These algorithms utilize conditional independence tests to infer parts of the causal graph. Our causal feature selection approach filters out causally-spurious links before passing the remaining causal features as inputs to ML models (Multiple linear regression, Random Forest) that predict the targets. We apply our framework to the statistical intensity prediction of Western Pacific Tropical Cyclones (TC), for which it is often difficult to accurately choose drivers and their dimensionality reduction (time lags, vertical levels, and area-averaging). Using more stringent significance thresholds in the conditional independence tests helps eliminate spurious causal relationships, thus helping the ML model generalize better to unseen TC cases. M-PC1 with a reduced number of features outperforms M-PCMCI, non-causal ML, and other feature selection methods (lagged correlation, random), even slightly outperforming feature selection based on eXplainable Artificial Intelligence. The optimal causal drivers obtained from our causal feature selection help improve our understanding of underlying relationships and suggest new potential drivers of TC intensification. ",

    "title": "Optimal Asset Allocation in a High Inflation Regime: a Leverage-feasible  Neural Network Approach",
    "abstract": "We study the optimal multi-period asset allocation problem with leverage constraints in a persistent, high-inflation environment. Based on filtered high-inflation regimes, we discover that a portfolio containing an equal-weighted stock index partially stochastically dominates a portfolio containing a capitalization-weighted stock index. Assuming the asset prices follow the jump diffusion model during high inflation periods, we establish a closed-form solution for the optimal strategy that outperforms a passive strategy under the cumulative quadratic tracking difference (CD) objective. The closed-form solution provides insights but requires unrealistic constraints. To obtain strategies under more practical considerations, we consider a constrained optimal control problem with bounded leverage. To solve this optimal control problem, we propose a novel leverage-feasible neural network (LFNN) model that approximates the optimal control directly. The LFNN model avoids high-dimensional evaluation of the conditional expectation (common in dynamic programming (DP) approaches). We establish mathematically that the LFNN approximation can yield a solution that is arbitrarily close to the solution of the original optimal control problem with bounded leverage. Numerical experiments show that the LFNN model achieves comparable performance to the closed-form solution on simulated data. We apply the LFNN approach to a four-asset investment scenario with bootstrap resampled asset returns. The LFNN strategy consistently outperforms the passive benchmark strategy by about 200 bps (median annualized return), with a greater than 90% probability of outperforming the benchmark at the terminal date. These results suggest that during persistent inflation regimes, investors should favor short-term bonds over long-term bonds, and the equal-weighted stock index over the cap-weighted stock index. ",

Smartphone-based microscopy systems are portable, low-cost, and more accessible alternatives for the detection of Giardia and Cryptosporidium than traditional brightfield microscopes. However, the images from smartphone microscopes are noisier and require manual cyst identification by trained technicians, usually unavailable in resource-limited settings. Automatic detection of (oo)cysts using deep-learning-based object detection could offer a solution for this limitation. We evaluate the performance of three state-of-the-art object detectors to detect (oo)cysts of Giardia and Cryptosporidium on a custom dataset that includes both smartphone and brightfield microscopic images from vegetable samples. Faster RCNN, RetinaNet, and you only look once (YOLOv8s) deep-learning models were employed to explore their efficacy and limitations. Our results show that while the deep-learning models perform better with the brightfield microscopy image dataset than the smartphone microscopy image dataset, the smartphone microscopy predictions are still comparable to the prediction performance of non-experts.
