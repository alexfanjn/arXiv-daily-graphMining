    "abstract": "Knowledge graphs are a key technique for linking and integrating cross-domain data, concepts, tools, and knowledge to enable data-driven analytics. As much of the worlds data have become massive in size, visualizing graph entities and their interrelationships intuitively and interactively has become a crucial task for ingesting and better utilizing graph content to support semantic reasoning, discovering hidden knowledge discovering, and better scientific understanding of geophysical and social phenomena. Despite the fact that many such phenomena (e.g., disasters) have clear spatial footprints and geographical properties, their location information is considered only as a textual label in existing graph visualization tools, limiting their capability to reveal the geospatial distribution patterns of the graph nodes. In addition, most graph visualization techniques rely on 2D graph visualization, which constraints the dimensions of information that can be presented and lacks support for graph structure examination from multiple angles. To tackle the above challenges, we developed a novel 3D map-based graph visualization algorithm to enable interactive exploration of graph content and patterns in a spatially explicit manner. The algorithm extends a 3D force directed graph by integrating a web map, an additional geolocational force, and a force balancing variable that allows for the dynamic adjustment of the 3D graph structure and layout. This mechanism helps create a balanced graph view between the semantic forces among the graph nodes and the attractive force from a geolocation to a graph node. Our solution offers a new perspective in visualizing and understanding spatial entities and events in a knowledge graph. ",

    "abstract": "This work presents a novel domain adaption paradigm for studying contrastive self-supervised representation learning and knowledge transfer using remote sensing satellite data. Major state-of-the-art remote sensing visual domain efforts primarily focus on fully supervised learning approaches that rely entirely on human annotations. On the other hand, human annotations in remote sensing satellite imagery are always subject to limited quantity due to high costs and domain expertise, making transfer learning a viable alternative. The proposed approach investigates the knowledge transfer of selfsupervised representations across the distinct source and target data distributions in depth in the remote sensing data domain. In this arrangement, self-supervised contrastive learning-based pretraining is performed on the source dataset, and downstream tasks are performed on the target datasets in a round-robin fashion. Experiments are conducted on three publicly available datasets, UC Merced Landuse (UCMD), SIRI-WHU, and MLRSNet, for different downstream classification tasks versus label efficiency. In self-supervised knowledge transfer, the proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art performance with label efficiency labels and outperforms a fully supervised setting. A more in-depth qualitative examination reveals consistent evidence for explainable representation learning. The source code and trained models are published on GitHub. ",

    "abstract": "Current studies on adversarial robustness mainly focus on aggregating local robustness results from a set of data samples to evaluate and rank different models. However, the local statistics may not well represent the true global robustness of the underlying unknown data distribution. To address this challenge, this paper makes the first attempt to present a new framework, called GREAT Score , for global robustness evaluation of adversarial perturbation using generative models. Formally, GREAT Score carries the physical meaning of a global statistic capturing a mean certified attack-proof perturbation level over all samples drawn from a generative model. For finite-sample evaluation, we also derive a probabilistic guarantee on the sample complexity and the difference between the sample mean and the true mean. GREAT Score has several advantages: (1) Robustness evaluations using GREAT Score are efficient and scalable to large models, by sparing the need of running adversarial attacks. In particular, we show high correlation and significantly reduced computation cost of GREAT Score when compared to the attack-based model ranking on RobustBench (Croce,et. al. 2021). (2) The use of generative models facilitates the approximation of the unknown data distribution. In our ablation study with different generative adversarial networks (GANs), we observe consistency between global robustness evaluation and the quality of GANs. (3) GREAT Score can be used for remote auditing of privacy-sensitive black-box models, as demonstrated by our robustness evaluation on several online facial recognition services. ",

Additionally, we propose a dynamic extension to remove velocity measurements from the controller while rejecting matched disturbances. In particular, we propose three control designs stemming from the Interconnection and Damping Assignment Passivity-Based Control approach. The first controller is a tracker that does not require velocity measurements. The second control design solves the trajectory-tracking problem while guaranteeing robustness with respect to matched disturbances. Then, the third approach is a combination of both mentioned controllers. It is shown that all proposed design methods guarantee exponential convergence of the mechanical system to the desired (feasible) trajectory due to the contraction property of the closed-loop system. The applicability of this method is illustrated via the design of a controller for an underactuated mechanical system. ",

Motivated by the observation that there are many homogeneous areas with distinguished semantic and geometric properties in HSIs, which can be used to extract useful contexts, we propose an end-to-end segmentation network named DCN-T. It adopts transformers to effectively encode regional adaptation and global aggregation spatial contexts within and between the homogeneous areas discovered by similarity-based clustering. To fully exploit the rich spectrums of the HSI, we adopt an ensemble approach where all segmentation results of the tri-spectral images are integrated into the final prediction through a voting scheme. Extensive experiments on three public benchmarks show that our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods for HSI classification. ",

However, these patterns often do not fulfill the assumptions of existing methods. We provide a direct method using samples of the noise to create a moving horizon observer for linear time-varying and nonlinear systems, which is optimal under the empirical noise distribution. Moreover, we show how to enhance the observer with distributional robustness properties in order to handle unmodeled components in the noise profile, as well as different noise realizations. We prove that, even though the design of distributionally robust estimators is a complex minmax problem over an infinite-dimensional space, it can be transformed into a regularized linear program using a system level synthesis approach. Numerical experiments with the Van der Pol oscillator show the benefits of not only using empirical samples of the noise to design the state estimator, but also of adding distributional robustness. We show that our method can significantly outperform state-of-the-art approaches under challenging noise distributions, including multi-modal and deterministic components. ",

    "abstract": "We present KeyMorph, a deep learning-based image registration framework that relies on automatically detecting corresponding keypoints. State-of-the-art deep learning methods for registration often are not robust to large misalignments, are not interpretable, and do not incorporate the symmetries of the problem. In addition, most models produce only a single prediction at test-time. Our core insight which addresses these shortcomings is that corresponding keypoints between images can be used to obtain the optimal transformation via a differentiable closed-form expression. We use this observation to drive the end-to-end learning of keypoints tailored for the registration task, and without knowledge of ground-truth keypoints. This framework not only leads to substantially more robust registration but also yields better interpretability, since the keypoints reveal which parts of the image are driving the final alignment. Moreover, KeyMorph can be designed to be equivariant under image translations and/or symmetric with respect to the input image ordering. Finally, we show how multiple deformation fields can be computed efficiently and in closed-form at test time corresponding to different transformation variants. We demonstrate the proposed framework in solving 3D affine and spline-based registration of multi-modal brain MRI scans. In particular, we show registration accuracy that surpasses current state-of-the-art methods, especially in the context of large displacements.

In a blockchain application where the task of the application which makes use of the data stored in a blockchain has to be accomplished by a time instant, the employed blockchain is essentially finitely-long. In this paper, we consider a general finitely-long blockchain model which is generalized from most existing works on finitely-long blockchain applications, and take the first step towards characterizing the vulnerability of finitely-long blockchains in securing data against double-spending attacks. For the first time, we develop a general closed-form expression for the probability of success in launching a double-spending attack on a finitely-long blockchain. This probability essentially characterizes the vulnerability of finitely-long blockchains. Then, we prove that the probability of success in launching a double-spending attack on a finitely-long blockchain is no greater than that on an infinitely-long blockchain, which implies that finitely-long blockchains are less vulnerable to double-spending attacks than infinitely-long blockchains. Moreover, we show that unlike infinitely-long blockchains which can be surely paralyzed by a 51% attack, finitely-long blockchains are more resistant to 51% attacks. ",

The proposed technique consists of two main steps: the first is a Graph Neural Network (GNN) trained without supervision; the second is a deterministic non-learned search heuristic that uses the output of the GNN to find paths and cycles. To allow for comparisons, we also implemented and tested an exact solution method using integer programming, two greedy search heuristics without the machine learning module, and the GNN alone without a heuristic. We analyze and compare the methods and conclude that the learning-based two-stage approach is the best solution quality, outputting approximate solutions on average 1.1 times more valuable than the ones from the deterministic heuristic alone.

We show that such a representation enables efficient training and leads to state-of-the-art results. Our approach elegantly combines concepts from 3D geometry processing, triangle-based rendering, and modern neural radiance fields.

This approach allowed for both static and dynamic flood predictions. Bayesian optimization was applied to identify the seven most influential flood-driven factors and determine the best combination strategy. By combining four CNNs (FCN, UNet, SegNet, DeepLabv3+) and three RNNs (LSTM, BiLSTM, GRU), the optimal hybrid model was identified as LSTM-DeepLabv3+.

In this work, we propose a distributional reinforcement learning based framework that learns return distributions which explicitly reflect environmental stochasticity. Policies based on the second-order stochastic dominance (SSD) relation can be used to make adjustable route decisions according to user preference on performance robustness. Our proposed method is evaluated in a simulated road network environment, and experimental results show that our method is able to plan the shortest routes that minimize stochasticity in travel time when robustness is preferred, while other state-of-the-art DRL methods are agnostic to environmental stochasticity.

To evaluate the performance of HTNet, we prepare six different setups with more than five thousands dense dynamic WLAN deployments that cover a wide range of real-world scenarios.

In this paper, we propose Jedi, a new defense against adversarial patches that is resilient to realistic patch attacks. Jedi tackles the patch localization problem from an information theory perspective; leverages two new ideas: (1) it improves the identification of potential patch regions using entropy analysis: we show that the entropy of adversarial patches is high, even in naturalistic patches; and (2) it improves the localization of adversarial patches, using an autoencoder that is able to complete patch regions from high entropy kernels. Jedi achieves high-precision adversarial patch localization, which we show is critical to successfully repair the images. Since Jedi relies on an input entropy analysis, it is model-agnostic, and can be applied on pre-trained off-the-shelf models without changes to the training or inference of the protected models. Jedi detects on average 90% of adversarial patches across different benchmarks and recovers up to 94% of successful patch attacks (Compared to 75% and 65% for LGS and Jujutsu, respectively). ",

To address this issue, we provide an accessible introduction to TDL, and compare the recently published TNNs using a unified mathematical and graphical notation. Through an intuitive and critical review of the emerging field of TDL, we extract valuable insights into current challenges and exciting opportunities for future development. ",

    "abstract": "As AI agents are increasingly used in the real open world with unknowns or novelties, they need the ability to (1) recognize objects that (i) they have learned and (ii) detect items that they have not seen or learned before, and (2) learn the new items incrementally to become more and more knowledgeable and powerful. (1) is called novelty detection or out-of-distribution (OOD) detection and (2) is called class incremental learning (CIL), which is a setting of continual learning (CL). In existing research, OOD detection and CIL are regarded as two completely different problems. This paper theoretically proves that OOD detection actually is necessary for CIL. We first show that CIL can be decomposed into two sub-problems: within-task prediction (WP) and task-id prediction (TP). We then prove that TP is correlated with OOD detection. The key theoretical result is that regardless of whether WP and OOD detection (or TP) are defined explicitly or implicitly by a CIL algorithm, good WP and good OOD detection are necessary and sufficient conditions for good CIL, which unifies novelty or OOD detection and continual learning (CIL, in particular). A good CIL algorithm based on our theory can naturally be used in open world learning, which is able to perform both novelty/OOD detection and continual learning. Based on the theoretical result, new CIL methods are also designed, which outperform strong baselines in terms of CIL accuracy and its continual OOD detection by a large margin. ",

    "abstract": "Recently developed graph contrastive learning (GCL) approaches compare two different \"views\" of the same graph in order to learn node/graph representations. The core assumption of these approaches is that by graph augmentation, it is possible to generate several structurally different but semantically similar graph structures, and therefore, the identity labels of the original and augmented graph/nodes should be identical. However, in this paper, we observe that this assumption does not always hold, for example, any perturbation to nodes or edges in a molecular graph will change the graph labels to some degree. Therefore, we believe that augmenting the graph structure should be accompanied by an adaptation of the labels used for the contrastive loss. Based on this idea, we propose ID-MixGCL, which allows for simultaneous modulation of both the input graph and the corresponding identity labels, with a controllable degree of change, leading to the capture of fine-grained representations from unlabeled graphs. Experimental results demonstrate that ID-MixGCL improves performance on graph classification and node classification tasks, as demonstrated by significant improvements on the Cora, IMDB-B, and IMDB-M datasets compared to state-of-the-art techniques, by 3-29% absolute points.

We thus propose Dynablox, a novel online mapping-based approach for robust moving object detection in complex environments. The central idea of our approach is to incrementally estimate high confidence free-space areas by modeling and accounting for sensing, state estimation, and mapping limitations during online robot operation. The spatio-temporally conservative free space estimate enables robust detection of moving objects without making any assumptions on the appearance of objects or environments. This allows deployment in complex scenes such as multi-storied buildings or staircases, and for diverse moving objects such as people carrying various items, doors swinging or even balls rolling around. We thoroughly evaluate our approach on real-world data sets, achieving 86% IoU at 17 FPS in typical robotic settings. The method outperforms a recent appearance-based classifier and approaches the performance of offline methods. We demonstrate its generality on a novel data set with rare moving objects in complex environments. We make our efficient implementation and the novel data set available as open-source. ",

Slice admission control is regarded as an essential means to ensure service quality and service isolation when the network is under burden. Herein, the scenario where rational tenants coexist with partially competitive network slice providers is adopted. We aim to maximize the long-term average revenue of the network operators through slice admission control, with the feasibility of multidimensional resource requirements, the priority differences among heterogeneous slices, and the admission fairness within each slice taken into account concurrently. We prove the intractability of our problem by a reduction from the Multidimensional Knapsack Problem (MKP), and propose a two-stage algorithm called MPSAC to make a sub-optimal solution efficiently. The principle of MPSAC is to split the original problem into two sub-problems; inter-slice decision-making and intra-slice quota allocation, which are solved using a heuristic method and a tailored auction mechanism respectively. Extensive simulations are carried out to demonstrate the efficacy of our algorithm, the results show that the long-term average revenue of ours is at least 9.6% higher than comparisons while maintaining better priority relations and achieving improved fairness performance.

In this paper, we study principled approaches to elevate the recognizability of a face in the embedding space instead of the visual quality. We first formulate a robust learning-based face recognizability measure, namely recognizability index (RI), based on two criteria: (i) proximity of each face embedding against the unrecognizable faces cluster center and (ii) closeness of each face embedding against its positive and negative class prototypes. We then devise an index diversion loss to push the hard-to-recognize face embedding with low RI away from unrecognizable faces cluster to boost the RI, which reflects better recognizability. Additionally, a perceptibility attention mechanism is introduced to attend to the most recognizable face regions, which offers better explanatory and discriminative traits for embedding learning. Our proposed model is trained end-to-end and simultaneously serves recognizability-aware embedding learning and face quality estimation. To address VLRFR, our extensive evaluations on three challenging low-resolution datasets and face quality assessment demonstrate the superiority of the proposed model over the state-of-the-art methods.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we provide a theory of using graph neural networks (GNNs) for \\textit{multi-node representation learning}, where we are interested in learning a representation for a set of more than one node such as a link. Existing GNNs are mainly designed to learn single-node representations. When we want to learn a node-set representation involving multiple nodes, a common practice in previous works is to directly aggregate the single-node representations obtained by a GNN. In this paper, we show a fundamental limitation of such an approach, namely the inability to capture the dependence among multiple nodes in a node set, and argue that directly aggregating individual node representations fails to produce an effective joint representation for multiple nodes. A straightforward solution is to distinguish target nodes from others. Formalizing this idea, we propose \\text{labeling trick}, which first labels nodes in the graph according to their relationships with the target node set before applying a GNN and then aggregates node representations obtained in the labeled graph for multi-node representations. The labeling trick also unifies a few previous successful works for multi-node representation learning, including SEAL, Distance Encoding, ID-GNN, and NBFNet. Besides node sets in graphs, we also extend labeling tricks to posets, subsets and hypergraphs. Experiments verify that the labeling trick technique can boost GNNs on various tasks, including undirected link prediction, directed link prediction, hyperedge prediction, and subgraph prediction. Our work explains the superior performance of previous node-labeling-based methods and establishes a theoretical foundation for using GNNs for multi-node representation learning. ",

    "abstract": "The rendering scheme in neural radiance field (NeRF) is effective in rendering a pixel by casting a ray into the scene. However, NeRF yields blurred rendering results when the training images are captured at non-uniform scales, and produces aliasing artifacts if the test images are taken in distant views. To address this issue, Mip-NeRF proposes a multiscale representation as a conical frustum to encode scale information. Nevertheless, this approach is only suitable for offline rendering since it relies on integrated positional encoding (IPE) to query a multilayer perceptron (MLP). To overcome this limitation, we propose mip voxel grids (Mip-VoG), an explicit multiscale representation with a deferred architecture for real-time anti-aliasing rendering. Our approach includes a density Mip-VoG for scene geometry and a feature Mip-VoG with a small MLP for view-dependent color. Mip-VoG encodes scene scale using the level of detail (LOD) derived from ray differentials and uses quadrilinear interpolation to map a queried 3D location to its features and density from two neighboring downsampled voxel grids. To our knowledge, our approach is the first to offer multiscale training and real-time anti-aliasing rendering simultaneously. We conducted experiments on multiscale datasets, and the results show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art real-time rendering baselines. ",

Despite the encouraging performance of many recent works that build upon recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and graph neural networks (GNNs), they fail to explicitly model the impact of edge temporal states on node features over time slices. Additionally, they are challenging to extract global structural features because of the inherent over-smoothing disadvantage of GNNs, which further restricts the performance. In this paper, we propose a recurrent difference graph transformer (RDGT) framework, which firstly assigns the edges in each snapshot with various types and weights to illustrate their specific temporal states explicitly, then a structure-reinforced graph transformer is employed to capture the temporal node representations by a recurrent learning paradigm. Experimental results on four real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of RDGT for discrete dynamic graph representation learning, as it consistently outperforms competing methods in dynamic link prediction tasks.

To gain the flexibility of representing arbitrary surfaces, NeUDF leverages the unsigned distance function (UDF) as surface representation. While a naive extension of an SDF-based neural renderer cannot scale to UDF, we propose two new formulations of weight function specially tailored for UDF-based volume rendering. Furthermore, to cope with open surface rendering, where the in/out test is no longer valid, we present a dedicated normal regularization strategy to resolve the surface orientation ambiguity. We extensively evaluate our method over a number of challenging datasets, including DTU}, MGN, and Deep Fashion 3D. Experimental results demonstrate that nEudf can significantly outperform the state-of-the-art method in the task of multi-view surface reconstruction, especially for complex shapes with open boundaries.

This ensures that the model incorporates the knowledge of the newly encountered domains, without catastrophically forgetting about the previously seen ones.

It extremely limits the application of stochastic optimization algorithms so that the training of GNN is usually time-consuming. To address this problem, we propose to decouple a multi-layer GNN as multiple simple modules for more efficient training, which is comprised of classical forward training (FT)and designed backward training (BT). Under the proposed framework, each module can be trained efficiently in FT by stochastic algorithms without distortion of graph information owing to its simplicity. To avoid the only unidirectional information delivery of FT and sufficiently train shallow modules with the deeper ones, we develop a backward training mechanism that makes the former modules perceive the latter modules. The backward training introduces the reversed information delivery into the decoupled modules as well as the forward information delivery. To investigate how the decoupling and greedy training affect the representational capacity, we theoretically prove that the error produced by linear modules will not accumulate on unsupervised tasks in most cases. The theoretical and experimental results show that the proposed framework is highly efficient with reasonable performance. ",

To address this issue, we propose to utilize large-scale pre-trained models to guide downstream model training with sample difficulty-aware entropy regularization.

However, existing attacks often utilize advanced gradient calculation or input transformation but ignore the white-box model. Inspired by the fact that DNNs are over-parameterized for superior performance, we propose diversifying the high-level features (DHF) for more transferable adversarial examples. In particular, DHF perturbs the high-level features by randomly transforming the high-level features and mixing them with the feature of benign samples when calculating the gradient at each iteration. Due to the redundancy of parameters, such transformation does not affect the classification performance but helps identify the invariant features across different models, leading to much better transferability. Empirical evaluations on ImageNet dataset show that DHF could effectively improve the transferability of existing momentum-based attacks. Incorporated into the input transformation-based attacks, DHF generates more transferable adversarial examples and outperforms the baselines with a clear margin when attacking several defense models, showing its generalization to various attacks and high effectiveness for boosting transferability.

We propose FTMRate which uses the fine timing measurement (FTM) feature, recently introduced in IEEE 802.11. FTM allows stations to measure their distance from the AP. We argue that knowledge of the distance from the receiver can be useful in determining which data rate to use. We apply statistical learning (a form of machine learning) to estimate the distance based on measurements, estimate channel quality from the distance, and select data rates based on channel quality. We evaluate three distinct estimation approaches: exponential smoothing, Kalman filter, and particle filter. We present a performance evaluation of the three variants of FTMRate and show, in several dense and mobile (though line-of-sight only) scenarios, that it can outperform two benchmarks and provide close to optimal results in IEEE 802.11ax networks.

    "abstract": "The release of ChatGPT has uncovered a range of possibilities whereby large language models (LLMs) can substitute human intelligence. In this paper, we seek to understand whether ChatGPT has the potential to reproduce human-generated label annotations in social computing tasks. Such an achievement could significantly reduce the cost and complexity of social computing research. As such, we use ChatGPT to re-label five seminal datasets covering stance detection (2x), sentiment analysis, hate speech, and bot detection. Our results highlight that ChatGPT does have the potential to handle these data annotation tasks, although a number of challenges remain. ChatGPT obtains an average precision 0.609. Performance is highest for the sentiment analysis dataset, with ChatGPT correctly annotating 64.9% of tweets. Yet, we show that performance varies substantially across individual labels. We believe this work can open up new lines of analysis and act as a basis for future research into the exploitation of ChatGPT for human annotation tasks. ",

    "abstract": "Cone Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) is widely used in dentistry for diagnostics and treatment planning. CBCT Imaging has a long acquisition time and consequently, the patient is likely to move. This motion causes significant artifacts in the reconstructed data which may lead to misdiagnosis. Existing motion correction algorithms only address this issue partially, struggling with inconsistencies due to truncation, accuracy, and execution speed. On the other hand, a short-scan reconstruction using a subset of motion-free projections with appropriate weighting methods can have a sufficient clinical image quality for most diagnostic purposes. Therefore, a framework is used in this study to extract the motion-free part of the scanned projections with which a clean short-scan volume can be reconstructed without using correction algorithms. Motion artifacts are detected using deep learning with a slice-based prediction scheme followed by volume averaging to get the final result. A realistic motion simulation strategy and data augmentation has been implemented to address data scarcity. The framework has been validated by testing it with real motion-affected data while the model was trained only with simulated motion data. This shows the feasibility to apply the proposed framework to a broad variety of motion cases for further research. ",

    "abstract": "Several algorithms for learning the structure of dynamic Bayesian networks (DBNs) require an a priori ordering of variables, which influences the determined graph topology. However, it is often unclear how to determine this order if feature importance is unknown, especially as an exhaustive search is usually impractical. In this paper, we introduce Ranking Approaches for Unknown Structures (RAUS), an automated framework to systematically inform variable ordering and learn networks end-to-end. RAUS leverages existing statistical methods (Cramers V, chi-squared test, and information gain) to compare variable ordering, resultant generated network topologies, and DBN performance. RAUS enables end-users with limited DBN expertise to implement models via command line interface. We evaluate RAUS on the task of predicting impending acute kidney injury (AKI) from inpatient clinical laboratory data. Longitudinal observations from 67,460 patients were collected from our electronic health record (EHR) and Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) criteria were then applied to define AKI events. RAUS learns multiple DBNs simultaneously to predict a future AKI event at different time points (i.e., 24-, 48-, 72-hours in advance of AKI). We also compared the results of the learned AKI prediction models and variable orderings to baseline techniques (logistic regression, random forests, and extreme gradient boosting). The DBNs generated by RAUS achieved 73-83% area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUCROC) within 24-hours before AKI; and 71-79% AUCROC within 48-hours before AKI of any stage in a 7-day observation window. Insights from this automated framework can help efficiently implement and interpret DBNs for clinical decision support. The source code for RAUS is available in GitHub at https://github.com/dgrdn08/RAUS . ",

Thereby, learning can be carried out in optimal environments without neglecting or unlearning desired behavior.

To deal with this new task, we propose \"Spiking-FER\", a deep convolutional SNN model, and compare it against a similar Artificial Neural Network (ANN). Experiments show that the proposed approach achieves comparable performance to the ANN architecture, while consuming less energy by orders of magnitude (up to 65.39x).

We examine the effectiveness of using Paracrawl for learning document-level translation. Paracrawl is a large-scale parallel corpus crawled from the Internet and contains data from various domains. The official Paracrawl corpus was released as parallel sentences (extracted from parallel webpages) and therefore previous works only used Paracrawl for learning sentence-level translation. In this work, we extract parallel paragraphs from Paracrawl parallel webpages using automatic sentence alignments and we use the extracted parallel paragraphs as parallel documents for training document-level translation models. We show that document-level NMT models trained with only parallel paragraphs from Paracrawl can be used to translate real documents from TED, News and Europarl, outperforming sentence-level NMT models. We also perform a targeted pronoun evaluation and show that document-level models trained with Paracrawl data can help context-aware pronoun translation. ",

    "abstract": "In recent years, video streaming applications have proliferated the demand for Video Quality Assessment VQA). Reduced reference video quality assessment (RR-VQA) is a category of VQA where certain features (e.g., texture, edges) of the original video are provided for quality assessment. It is a popular research area for various applications such as social media, online games, and video streaming. This paper introduces a reduced reference Transcoding Quality Prediction Model (TQPM) to determine the visual quality score of the video possibly transcoded in multiple stages. The quality is predicted using Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT)-energy-based features of the video (i.e., the video's brightness, spatial texture information, and temporal activity) and the target bitrate representation of each transcoding stage. To do that, the problem is formulated, and a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)-based quality prediction model is presented. Experimental results illustrate that, on average, TQPM yields PSNR, SSIM, and VMAF predictions with an R2 score of 0.83, 0.85, and 0.87, respectively, and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 1.31 dB, 1.19 dB, and 3.01, respectively, for single-stage transcoding. Furthermore, an R2 score of 0.84, 0.86, and 0.91, respectively, and MAE of 1.32 dB, 1.33 dB, and 3.25, respectively, are observed for a two-stage transcoding scenario. Moreover, the average processing time of TQPM for 4s segments is 0.328s, making it a practical VQA method in online streaming applications. ",

However, most of the existing methods ignore the important geometric structural consistency, which inevitably leads to performance degradation and distortion of 3D reconstruction. To address this issue, we introduce a gradient loss to penalize edge fluctuations ambiguous around stepped edge structures and a normal loss to explicitly express the sensitivity to frequently small structures, and propose a geometric consistency loss to spreads the spatial information across the sample grids to constrain the global geometric anatomy structures. In addition, we develop a synthetic RGB-Depth dataset that captures the anatomical structures under reflections and illumination variations. The proposed method is extensively validated across different datasets and clinical images and achieves mean RMSE values of 0.066 (stomach), 0.029 (small intestine), and 0.139 (colon) on the EndoSLAM dataset. The generalizability of the proposed method achieves mean RMSE values of 12.604 (T1-L1), 9.930 (T2-L2), and 13.893 (T3-L3) on the ColonDepth dataset. The experimental results show that our method exceeds previous state-of-the-art competitors and generates more consistent depth maps and reasonable anatomical structures. The quality of intraoperative 3D structure perception from endoscopic videos of the proposed method meets the accuracy requirements of video-CT registration algorithms for endoscopic navigation.

Traditional neural networks, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) or Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINN), are restricted to the prediction of solutions in a predefined configuration. With neural operators, one can learn the general solution of Partial Differential Equations, such as the elastic wave equation, with varying parameters. There have been very few applications of neural operators in seismology. All of them were limited to two-dimensional settings, although the importance of three-dimensional (3D) effects is well known. In this work, we apply the Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) to predict ground motion time series from a 3D geological description. We used a high-fidelity simulation code, SEM3D, to build an extensive database of ground motions generated by 30,000 different geologies. With this database, we show that the FNO can produce accurate ground motion even when the underlying geology exhibits large heterogeneities. Intensity measures at moderate and large periods are especially well reproduced. We present the first seismological application of Fourier Neural Operators in 3D. Thanks to the generalizability of our database, we believe that our model can be used to assess the influence of geological features such as sedimentary basins on ground motion, which is paramount to evaluating site effects.

To tackle these drawbacks, this work proposes two enhanced components under a new Omni-SR architecture. First, an Omni Self-Attention (OSA) block is proposed based on dense interaction principle, which can simultaneously model pixel-interaction from both spatial and channel dimensions, mining the potential correlations across omni-axis (i.e., spatial and channel). Coupling with mainstream window partitioning strategies, OSA can achieve superior performance with compelling computational budgets. Second, a multi-scale interaction scheme is proposed to mitigate sub-optimal ERF (i.e., premature saturation) in shallow models, which facilitates local propagation and meso-/global-scale interactions, rendering an omni-scale aggregation building block. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Omni-SR achieves record-high performance on lightweight super-resolution benchmarks (e.g., 26.95 dB@Urban100 $\\times 4$ with only 792K parameters).

Analysing the single data format, either fake text description or fake image, is the mainstream direction for the current research. However, the misinformation in real-world scenario is commonly formed as a text-image pair where the news article/news title is described as text content, and usually followed by the related image.

In this paper, our goal is to explore the constrastive learning in the domain of misinformation identification. We developed a self-learning model and carried out the comprehensive experiments on a public data set named COSMOS. Comparing to the baseline classifier, our model shows the superior performance of non-matched image-text pair detection (approximately 10%) when the training data is insufficient.

We perform a systematic evaluation of existing methods to generate images from diffusion models and study new extensions to assess their benefit for data augmentation. While we find that personalizing diffusion models towards the target data outperforms simpler prompting strategies, we also show that using the training data of the diffusion model alone, via a simple nearest neighbor retrieval procedure, leads to even stronger downstream performance.

As a result of the substantial human resource utilization, personally examining the whole country with a huge population like India, to determine whether the execution of mask wearing and social distance maintained is unfeasible. The COVID-19 Social Distancing Detector System is a single-stage detector that employs deep learning to integrate high-end semantic data to a CNN module in order to maintain social distances and simultaneously monitor violations within a specified region. By deploying current Security footages, CCTV cameras, and computer vision (CV), it will also be able to identify those who are experiencing the calamity of social separation. Providing tools for safety and security, this technology disposes the need for a labor-force based surveillance system, yet a manual governing body is still required to monitor, track, and inform on the violations that are committed. Any sort of infrastructure, including universities, hospitals, offices of the government, schools, and building sites, can employ the technology. Therefore, the risk management system created to report and analyze video streams along with the social distance detector system might help to ensure our protection and security as well as the security of our loved ones.

    "title": "BackCache: Mitigating Contention-Based Cache Timing Attacks by Hiding  Cache Line Evictions",
    "abstract": "Caches are used to reduce the speed differential between the CPU and memory to improve the performance of modern processors. However, attackers can use contention-based cache timing attacks to steal sensitive information from victim processes through carefully designed cache eviction sets. And L1 data cache attacks are widely exploited and pose a significant privacy and confidentiality threat. Existing hardware-based countermeasures mainly focus on cache partitioning, randomization, and cache line flushing, which unfortunately either incur high overhead or can be circumvented by sophisticated attacks. In this paper, we propose a novel hardware-software co-design called BackCache with the idea of always achieving cache hits instead of cache misses to mitigate contention-based cache timing attacks on the L1 data cache. BackCache places the evicted cache lines from the L1 data cache into a fully-associative backup cache to hide the evictions. To improve the security of BackCache, we introduce a randomly used replacement policy (RURP) and a dynamic backup cache resizing mechanism. We also present a theoretical security analysis to demonstrate the effectiveness of BackCache. Our evaluation on the gem5 simulator shows that BackCache can degrade the performance by 1.33%, 7.34%, and 7.59% For OS kernel, single-thread, and multi-thread benchmarks. ",

    "abstract": "There has recently been an increased interest in reinforcement learning for nonlinear control problems. However standard reinforcement learning algorithms can often struggle even on seemingly simple set-point control problems. This paper argues that three ideas can improve reinforcement learning methods even for highly nonlinear set-point control problems: 1) Make use of a prior feedback controller to aid amplitude exploration. 2) Use integrated errors. 3) Train on model ensembles. Together these ideas lead to more efficient training, and a trained set-point controller that is more robust to modelling errors and thus can be directly deployed to real-world nonlinear systems. The claim is supported by experiments with a real-world nonlinear cascaded tank process and a simulated strongly nonlinear pH-control system. ",

To address this issue, data augmentation techniques are widely used in natural language processing (NLP) to generate new samples for the minority class. However, in this paper, we challenge the common assumption that data augmentation is always necessary to improve predictions on imbalanced datasets. Instead, we argue that adjusting the classifier cutoffs without data augmentation can produce similar results to oversampling techniques. Our study provides theoretical and empirical evidence to support this claim. Our findings contribute to a better understanding of the strengths and limitations of different approaches to dealing with imbalanced data, and help researchers and practitioners make informed decisions about which methods to use for a given task.

    "abstract": "Few-shot relation reasoning on knowledge graphs (FS-KGR) aims to infer long-tail data-poor relations, which has drawn increasing attention these years due to its practicalities. The pre-training of previous methods needs to manually construct the meta-relation set, leading to numerous labor costs. Self-supervised learning (SSL) is treated as a solution to tackle the issue, but still at an early stage for FS-KGR task. Moreover, most of the existing methods ignore leveraging the beneficial information from aliasing relations (AR), i.e., data-rich relations with similar contextual semantics to the target data-poor relation. Therefore, we proposed a novel Self-Supervised Learning model by leveraging Aliasing Relations to assist FS-KGR, termed SARF. Concretely, four main components are designed in our model, i.e., SSL reasoning module, AR-assisted mechanism, fusion module, and scoring function. We first generate the representation of the co-occurrence patterns in a generative manner. Meanwhile, the representations of aliasing relations are learned to enhance reasoning in the AR-assist mechanism. Besides, multiple strategies, i.e., simple summation and learnable fusion, are offered for representation fusion. Finally, the generated representation is used for scoring. Extensive experiments on three few-shot benchmarks demonstrate that SARF achieves state-of-the-art performance compared with other methods in most cases. ",

It follows, that we might restrain the models complexity on some instances, maintaining a high quality. We propose a method for diminishing computations by adding so-called early exit branches to the original architecture, and dynamically switching the computational path depending on how difficult it will be to render the output. We apply our method on two different SOTA models performing generative tasks: generation from a semantic map, and cross-reenactment of face expressions; showing it is able to output images with custom lower-quality thresholds. For a threshold of LPIPS <=0.1, we diminish their computations by up to a half. This is especially relevant for real-time applications such as synthesis of faces, when quality loss needs to be contained, but most of the inputs need fewer computations than the complex instances.

In contrast to the general dropout method, which randomly drops neurons, DropDim drops part of the embedding dimensions. In this way, the semantic information can be completely discarded. Thus, the excessive coadapting between different embedding dimensions can be broken, and the self-attention is forced to encode meaningful featureswith a certain number of embedding dimensions erased. Experiments on a wide range of tasks executed on the MUST-C English-Germany dataset show that DropDim can effectively improve model performance, reduce over-fitting, and show complementary effects with other regularization methods. When combined with label smoothing, the WER can be reduced from 19.1% to 15.1% on the ASR task, and the BLEU value can be increased from26.90 to 28.38 on the MT task.

To address this issue, Neural Symbolic Regression (NSR) algorithms have been developed that can quickly identify patterns in the data and generate analytical expressions. However, these methods, in their current form, lack the capability to incorporate user-defined prior knowledge, which is often required in natural sciences and engineering fields. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel neural symbolic regression method, named Neural Symbolic Regression with Hypothesis (NSRwH) that enables the explicit incorporation of assumptions about the expected structure of the ground-truth expression into the prediction process. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed conditioned deep learning model outperforms its unconditioned counterparts in terms of accuracy while also providing control over the predicted expression structure.

The PARCS v3.2 nodal-diffusion core simulator was used as a full-core reactor physics solver to emulate the operation of a reactor and to generate training, and validation data for the ANN. The ANN was implemented with dedicated Python 3.8 code with Google's TensorFlow 2.0 library. The effort was based to a large extent on the process of appropriate automatic transformation of data generated by PARCS simulator, which was later used in the process of the ANN development. Various methods that allow obtaining better accuracy of the ANN predicted results were studied, such as trying different ANN architectures to find the optimal number of neurons in the hidden layers of the network. Results were later compared with the architectures proposed in the literature. For the selected best architecture predictions were made for different core parameters and their dependence on core loading patterns. In this study, a special focus was put on the prediction of the fuel cycle length for a given core loading pattern, as it can be considered one of the targets for plant economic operation. For instance, the length of a single fuel cycle depending on the initial core loading pattern was predicted with very good accuracy (>99%). This work contributes to the exploration of the usefulness of neural networks in solving nuclear reactor design problems. Thanks to the application of ANN, designers can avoid using an excessive amount of core simulator runs and more rapidly explore the space of possible solutions before performing more detailed design considerations.

This paper is motivated by the vision of self-adjusting infrastructures whose resources can be adjusted according to the workload they currently serve, in a demand-aware manner. Such dynamic adjustments can be exploited to improve network utilization and hence performance, by dynamically moving frequently interacting communication partners closer, e.g., collocating them in the same server or datacenter rack. In particular, we revisit the online balanced graph partitioning problem which captures the fundamental tradeoff between the benefits and costs of dynamically collocating communication partners. The demand is modelled as a sequence $\\sigma$ (revealed in an online manner) of communication requests between $n$ processes, each of which is running on one of the $\\ell$ servers. Each server has capacity $k=n/\\ell$, hence, the processes have to be scheduled in a balanced manner across the servers. A request incurs cost $1$, if the requested processes are located on different servers, otherwise the cost is 0. A process can be migrated to a different server at cost $1$. This paper presents the first online algorithm for online balanced graph partitioning achieving a polylogarithmic competitive ratio for the fundamental case of ring communication patterns. Specifically, our main contribution is a $O(\\log^3 n)$-competitive randomized online algorithm for this problem. We further present a randomized online algorithm which is $O(\\log^2 n)$-competitive when compared to a static optimal solution. Our two results rely on different algorithms and techniques and hence are of independent interest. ",

We implemented these interventions into a within-subject experiment where participants (N=24) teamed up with a social robot and played a collaborative game. The level of trust was measured after each section using the Multi-Dimensional Measure of Trust (MDMT) scale.

The Kirchhoff-Love shell formulation requires global $C^1$-continuous basis functions. The nonuniform rational B-spline (NURBS)-based IGA has been extensively used for developing Kirchhoff-Love shell elements. However, shells with complex geometries inevitably need multiple patches and trimming techniques, where stitching patches with high continuity is a challenge. On the other hand, due to their unstructured nature, TCB-splines can accommodate general polygonal domains, have local refinement, and are flexible to model complex geometries with $C^1$ continuity, which naturally fit into the Kirchhoff-Love shell formulation with complex geometries. Therefore, we propose to use TCB-splines as basis functions for geometric representation and solution approximation. We apply our method to both linear and nonlinear benchmark shell problems, where the accuracy and robustness are validated. The applicability of the proposed approach to shell analysis is further exemplified by performing geometrically nonlinear Kirchhoff-Love shell simulations of a pipe junction and a front bumper represented by a single patch of TCB-splines.

Methods: Our framework consists of different convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures for feature extraction and a region-based CNN for tumor detection. We use 7 different architectures: DenseNet201, ResNet50, InceptionV3, InceptionResNetV3, MobileNetV2, NASNetMobile and NASNetLarge and compare its performance to find the best architecture out of the seven. An experimental dataset of MRI-derived breast phantoms was used. Results: NASNetLarge is the best architecture which can be used for the CNN model with accuracy of 88.41% and loss of 27.82%. Given that the model's AUC is 0.786, it can be concluded that it is suitable for use in its present form, while it could be improved upon and trained on other datasets that are comparable. Impact: One of the main causes of death in women is breast cancer, and early identification is essential for enhancing the results for patients. Due to its non-invasiveness and capacity to produce high-resolution images, microwave imaging is a potential tool for breast cancer screening. The complexity of tumors makes it difficult to adequately detect them in microwave images. The results of this research show that deep learning has a lot of potential for breast cancer detection in microwave images ",

We address this by formulating, to the best of our knowledge, the first differentiable LiDAR renderer, and propose an end-to-end framework, LiDAR-NeRF, leveraging a neural radiance field (NeRF) to enable jointly learning the geometry and the attributes of 3D points. To evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we establish an object-centric multi-view LiDAR dataset, dubbed NeRF-MVL. It contains observations of objects from 9 categories seen from 360-degree viewpoints captured with multiple LiDAR sensors. Our extensive experiments on the scene-level KITTI-360 dataset, and on our object-level NeRF-MVL show that our LiDAR- NeRF surpasses the model-based algorithms significantly. ",

    "abstract": "Driven by deep learning techniques, perception technology in autonomous driving has developed rapidly in recent years. To achieve accurate and robust perception capabilities, autonomous vehicles are often equipped with multiple sensors, making sensor fusion a crucial part of the perception system. Among these fused sensors, radars and cameras enable a complementary and cost-effective perception of the surrounding environment regardless of lighting and weather conditions. This review aims to provide a comprehensive guideline for radar-camera fusion, particularly concentrating on perception tasks related to object detection and semantic segmentation. Based on the principles of the radar and camera sensors, we delve into the data processing process and representations, followed by an in-depth analysis and summary of radar-camera fusion datasets. In the review of methodologies in radar-camera fusion, we address interrogative questions, including \"why to fuse\", \"what to fuse\", \"where to fuse\", \"when to fuse\", and \"how to fuse\", subsequently discussing various challenges and potential research directions within this domain. To ease the retrieval and comparison of datasets and fusion methods, we also provide an interactive website: https://XJTLU-VEC.github.io/Radar-Camera-Fusion. ",

    "abstract": "Deep learning inference brings together the data and the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This is problematic in case the user wants to preserve the privacy of the data and the service provider does not want to reveal the weights of his CNN. Secure Inference allows the two parties to engage in a protocol that preserves their respective privacy concerns, while revealing only the inference result to the user. This is known as Multi-Party Computation (MPC). A major bottleneck of MPC algorithms is communication, as the parties must send data back and forth. The linear component of a CNN (i.e. convolutions) can be done efficiently with minimal communication, but the non-linear part (i.e., ReLU) requires the bulk of communication bandwidth. We propose two ways to accelerate Secure Inference. The first is based on the observation that the ReLU outcome of many convolutions is highly correlated. Therefore, we replace the per pixel ReLU operation by a ReLU operation per patch. Each layer in the network will benefit from a patch of a different size and we devise an algorithm to choose the optimal set of patch sizes through a novel reduction of the problem to a knapsack problem. The second way to accelerate Secure Inference is based on cutting the number of bit comparisons required for a secure ReLU operation. We demonstrate the cumulative effect of these tools in the semi-honest secure 3-party setting for four problems: Classifying ImageNet using ResNet50 backbone, classifying CIFAR100 using ResNet18 backbone, semantic segmentation of ADE20K using MobileNetV2 backbone and semantic segmentation of Pascal VOC 2012 using ResNet50 backbone.

    "abstract": "Randomized smoothing (RS) is a well known certified defense against adversarial attacks, which creates a smoothed classifier by predicting the most likely class under random noise perturbations of inputs during inference. While initial work focused on robustness to $\\ell_2$ norm perturbations using noise sampled from a Gaussian distribution, subsequent works have shown that different noise distributions can result in robustness to other $\\ell_p$ norm bounds as well. In general, a specific noise distribution is optimal for defending against a given $\\ell_p$ norm based attack. In this work, we aim to improve the certified adversarial robustness against multiple perturbation bounds simultaneously. Towards this, we firstly present a novel \\textit{certification scheme}, that effectively combines the certificates obtained using different noise distributions to obtain optimal results against multiple perturbation bounds. We further propose a novel \\textit{training noise distribution} along with a \\textit{regularized training scheme} to improve the certification within both $\\ell_1$ and $\\ell_2$ perturbation norms simultaneously. Contrary to prior works, we compare the certified robustness of different training algorithms across the same natural (clean) accuracy, rather than across fixed noise levels used for training and certification. We also empirically invalidate the argument that training and certifying the classifier with the same amount of noise gives the best results. The proposed approach achieves improvements on the ACR (Average Certified Radius) metric across both $\\ell_1$ and $\\ell_2$ perturbation bounds. ",

    "abstract": "In location-based services(LBSs), it is promising for users to crowdsource and share their Point-of-Interest(PoI) information with each other in a common cache to reduce query frequency and preserve location privacy. Yet most studies on multi-user privacy preservation overlook the opportunity of leveraging their service flexibility. This paper is the first to study multiple users' strategic cooperation against an adversary's optimal inference attack, by leveraging mutual service flexibility. We formulate the multi-user privacy cooperation against the adversary as a max-min adversarial game and solve it in a linear program. Unlike the vast literature, even if a user finds the cached information useful, we prove it beneficial to still query the platform to further confuse the adversary. As the linear program's computational complexity still increases superlinearly with the number of users' possible locations, we propose a binary obfuscation scheme in two opposite spatial directions to achieve guaranteed performance with only constant complexity. Perhaps surprisingly, a user with a greater service flexibility should query with a less obfuscated location to add confusion. Finally, we provide guidance on the optimal query sequence among LBS users. Simulation results show that our crowdsourced privacy protection scheme greatly improves users' privacy as compared with existing approaches. ",

    "abstract": "Despite a growing body of work at the intersection of deep learning and formal languages, there has been relatively little systematic exploration of transformer models for reasoning about typed lambda calculi. This is an interesting area of inquiry for two reasons. First, typed lambda calculi are the lingua franc of programming languages. A set of heuristics that relate various typed lambda calculi to effective neural architectures would provide a systematic method for mapping language features (e.g., polymorphism, subtyping, inheritance, etc.) to architecture choices. Second, transformer models are widely used in deep learning architectures applied to code, but the design and hyperparameter space for them is large and relatively unexplored in programming language applications. Therefore, we suggest a benchmark that allows us to explore exactly this through perhaps the simplest and most fundamental property of a programming language: the relationship between terms and types. Consequently, we begin this inquiry of transformer architectures for typed lambda calculi by exploring the effect of transformer warm-up and optimizer selection in the task of type inference: i.e., predicting the types of lambda calculus terms using only transformers. We find that the optimization landscape is difficult even in this simple setting. One particular experimental finding is that optimization by Adafactor converges much faster compared to the optimization by Adam and RAdam. We conjecture that such different performance of optimizers might be related to the difficulties of generalization over formally generated dataset. ",

In particular, two algorithms are presented to find the angular sector of interference in every snapshot based on the adopted spatial uncertainty region of the interference direction. Moreover, a power spectrum is introduced based on the estimation of the power of interference and noise components, which allows the development of a robust approach to IPN covariance matrix reconstruction. The proposed method has two main advantages. First, an angular region that contains the interference direction is updated based on the statistics of the array data. Secondly, the proposed IPN-PSEUR method avoids estimating the power spectrum of the whole range of possible directions of the interference sector. Simulation results show that the performance of the proposed IPN-PSEUR beamformer is almost always close to the optimal value across a wide range of signal-to-noise ratios. ",

The THz link suffers from the joint impact of antenna misalignment and stochastic characteristics of wireless channels, including the effect of environmental conditions such as pressure, humidity, and temperature. The envelope of THz link in the first hop follows a generalized $\\alpha-\\mu$ distribution, and for the RF end, the Nakagami-$m$ distribution is considered. In this context, we obtain new closed-form expressions of the cumulative density function and the moment-generating function of the end-to-end signal-to-noise ratio. Further, we derive the average symbol error rate expressions for coherent rectangular quadrature amplitude modulation (RQAM) and coherent hexagonal QAM (HQAM), as well as the non-coherent modulation scheme. The asymptotic behavior is also discussed to examine the system's diversity. Furthermore, the impact of several parameters, such as fading coefficients of individual links and antenna misalignment, as well as the distance between nodes, are also highlighted in the system's performance. Moreover, Monte Carlo simulations are used to validate the presented analytical framework. Finally, the presented numerical insights aid in the extraction of practical design principles. ",

    "abstract": "Opioid and substance misuse is rampant in the United States today, with the phenomenon known as the \"opioid crisis\". The relationship between substance use and mental health has been extensively studied, with one possible relationship being: substance misuse causes poor mental health. However, the lack of evidence on the relationship has resulted in opioids being largely inaccessible through legal means. This study analyzes the substance use posts on social media with opioids being sold through crypto market listings. We use the Drug Abuse Ontology, state-of-the-art deep learning, and knowledge-aware BERT-based models to generate sentiment and emotion for the social media posts to understand users' perceptions on social media by investigating questions such as: which synthetic opioids people are optimistic, neutral, or negative about? or what kind of drugs induced fear and sorrow? or what kind of drugs people love or are thankful about? or which drugs people think negatively about? or which opioids cause little to no sentimental reaction. We discuss how we crawled crypto market data and its use in extracting posts for fentanyl, fentanyl analogs, and other novel synthetic opioids. We also perform topic analysis associated with the generated sentiments and emotions to understand which topics correlate with people's responses to various drugs. Additionally, we analyze time-aware neural models built on these features while considering historical sentiment and emotional activity of posts related to a drug. The most effective model performs well (statistically significant) with (macroF1=82.12, recall =83.58) to identify substance use disorder. ",

To overcome this, exploring network design principles that are generalizable across tasks is a more practical solution. In this study, We explore a novel brain-inspired design principle based on the core-periphery property of the human brain network to guide the design of CNNs. Our work draws inspiration from recent studies suggesting that artificial and biological neural networks may have common principles in optimizing network architecture. We implement the core-periphery principle in the design of network wiring patterns and the sparsification of the convolution operation. The resulting core-periphery principle guided CNNs (CP-CNNs) are evaluated on three different datasets. The experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority compared to CNNs and ViT-based methods.

    "abstract": "People form judgments and make decisions based on the information that they observe. A growing portion of that information is not only provided, but carefully curated by social media platforms. Although lawmakers largely agree that platforms should not operate without any oversight, there is little consensus on how to regulate social media. There is consensus, however, that creating a strict, global standard of \"acceptable\" content is untenable (e.g., in the US, it is incompatible with Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act and the First Amendment). In this work, we propose that algorithmic filtering should be regulated with respect to a flexible, user-driven baseline. We provide a concrete framework for regulating and auditing a social media platform according to such a baseline. In particular, we introduce the notion of a baseline feed: the content that a user would see without filtering (e.g., on Twitter, this could be the chronological timeline). We require that the feeds a platform filters contain \"similar\" informational content as their respective baseline feeds, and we design a principled way to measure similarity. This approach is motivated by related suggestions that regulations should increase user agency. We present an auditing procedure that checks whether a platform honors this requirement. Notably, the audit needs only black-box access to a platform's filtering algorithm, and it does not access or infer private user information. We provide theoretical guarantees on the strength of the audit. We further show that requiring closeness between filtered and baseline feeds does not impose a large performance cost, nor does it create echo chambers. ",

However, inherent uncertainties derived from different root causes have been realized as serious hurdles for DNNs to find robust and trustworthy solutions for real-world problems. A lack of consideration of such uncertainties may lead to unnecessary risk. For example, a self-driving autonomous car can misdetect a human on the road. A deep learning-based medical assistant may misdiagnose cancer as a benign tumor. In this work, we study how to measure different uncertainty causes for DNNs and use them to solve diverse decision-making problems more effectively. In the first part of this thesis, we develop a general learning framework to quantify multiple types of uncertainties caused by different root causes, such as vacuity (i.e., uncertainty due to a lack of evidence) and dissonance (i.e., uncertainty due to conflicting evidence), for graph neural networks. We provide a theoretical analysis of the relationships between different uncertainty types. We further demonstrate that dissonance is most effective for misclassification detection and vacuity is most effective for Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection. In the second part of the thesis, we study the significant impact of OOD objects on semi-supervised learning (SSL) for DNNs and develop a novel framework to improve the robustness of existing SSL algorithms against OODs.

    "abstract": "We address the problem of fitting a parametric human body model (SMPL) to point cloud data. Optimization-based methods require careful initialization and are prone to becoming trapped in local optima. Learning-based methods address this but do not generalize well when the input pose is far from those seen during training. For rigid point clouds, remarkable generalization has been achieved by leveraging SE(3)-equivariant networks, but these methods do not work on articulated objects. In this work we extend this idea to human bodies and propose ArtEq, a novel part-based SE(3)-equivariant neural architecture for SMPL model estimation from point clouds. Specifically, we learn a part detection network by leveraging local SO(3) invariance, and regress shape and pose using articulated SE(3) shape-invariant and pose-equivariant networks, all trained end-to-end. Our novel equivariant pose regression module leverages the permutation-equivariant property of self-attention layers to preserve rotational equivariance. Experimental results show that ArtEq can generalize to poses not seen during training, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by 74.5%, without requiring an optimization refinement step. Further, compared with competing works, our method is more than three orders of magnitude faster during inference and has 97.3% fewer parameters.

However, to render photorealistic images, NeRFs require hundreds of deep multilayer perceptron (MLP) evaluations - for each pixel. This is prohibitively expensive and makes real-time rendering infeasible, even on powerful modern GPUs. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to distill and bake NeRFs into highly efficient mesh-based neural representations that are fully compatible with the massively parallel graphics rendering pipeline. We represent scenes as neural radiance features encoded on a two-layer duplex mesh, which effectively overcomes the inherent inaccuracies in 3D surface reconstruction by learning the aggregated radiance information from a reliable interval of ray-surface intersections. To exploit local geometric relationships of nearby pixels, we leverage screen-space convolutions instead of the MLPs used in NeRFs to achieve high-quality appearance. Finally, the performance of the whole framework is further boosted by a novel multi-view distillation optimization strategy. We demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our approach via extensive experiments on a range of standard datasets. ",

In this paper, uncertainty sets are constructed in a data-driven manner using kernel method, i.e., they are centered around empirical distributions of training samples from the null and alternative hypotheses, respectively; and are constrained via the distance between kernel mean embeddings of distributions in the reproducing kernel Hilbert space, i.e., maximum mean discrepancy (MMD). The Bayesian setting and the Neyman-Pearson setting are investigated. For the Bayesian setting where the goal is to minimize the worst-case error probability, an optimal test is firstly obtained when the alphabet is finite. When the alphabet is infinite, a tractable approximation is proposed to quantify the worst-case average error probability, and a kernel smoothing method is further applied to design test that generalizes to unseen samples. A direct robust kernel test is also proposed and proved to be exponentially consistent. For the Neyman-Pearson setting, where the goal is to minimize the worst-case probability of miss detection subject to a constraint on the worst-case probability of false alarm, an efficient robust kernel test is proposed and is shown to be asymptotically optimal. Numerical results are provided to demonstrate the performance of the proposed robust tests. ",

    "abstract": "We used survival analysis to quantify the impact of postdischarge evaluation and management (E/M) services in preventing hospital readmission or death. Our approach avoids a specific pitfall of applying machine learning to this problem, which is an inflated estimate of the effect of interventions, due to survivors bias -- where the magnitude of inflation may be conditional on heterogeneous confounders in the population. This bias arises simply because in order to receive an intervention after discharge, a person must not have been readmitted in the intervening period. After deriving an expression for this phantom effect, we controlled for this and other biases within an inherently interpretable Bayesian survival framework. We identified case management services as being the most impactful for reducing readmissions overall, particularly for patients discharged to long term care facilities, with high resource utilization in the quarter preceding admission.

The loss function $\\mathcal{L}_{\\sigma}$ involving a scaling parameter $\\sigma>0$ can cover a wide range of commonly used robust losses. The proposed algorithm is then a robust alternative for online least squares regression aiming to estimate the conditional mean function. For properly chosen $\\sigma$ and step size, we show that the last iterate of this online algorithm can achieve optimal capacity independent convergence in the mean square distance. Moreover, if additional information on the underlying function space is known, we also establish optimal capacity dependent rates for strong convergence in RKHS. To the best of our knowledge, both of the two results are new to the existing literature of online learning. ",

    "title": "Towards the Universal Defense for Query-Based Audio Adversarial Attacks",
    "abstract": "Recently, studies show that deep learning-based automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems are vulnerable to adversarial examples (AEs), which add a small amount of noise to the original audio examples. These AE attacks pose new challenges to deep learning security and have raised significant concerns about deploying ASR systems and devices. The existing defense methods are either limited in application or only defend on results, but not on process. In this work, we propose a novel method to infer the adversary intent and discover audio adversarial examples based on the AEs generation process. The insight of this method is based on the observation: many existing audio AE attacks utilize query-based methods, which means the adversary must send continuous and similar queries to target ASR models during the audio AE generation process. Inspired by this observation, We propose a memory mechanism by adopting audio fingerprint technology to analyze the similarity of the current query with a certain length of memory query. Thus, we can identify when a sequence of queries appears to be suspectable to generate audio AEs. Through extensive evaluation on four state-of-the-art audio AE attacks, we demonstrate that on average our defense identify the adversary intent with over 90% accuracy. With careful regard for robustness evaluations, we also analyze our proposed defense and its strength to withstand two adaptive attacks. Finally, our scheme is available out-of-the-box and directly compatible with any ensemble of ASR defense models to uncover audio AE attacks effectively without model retraining. ",

The radio number of $G$, denoted by $rn(G)$, is the smallest number $k$ such that $G$ has radio labeling $f$ with max$\\{f(v):v \\in V(G)\\} = k$. In this paper, we give a lower bound for the radio number for the Cartesian product of the generalized Petersen graph and tree. We present two necessary and sufficient conditions, and three other sufficient conditions to achieve the lower bound. Using these results, we determine the radio number for the Cartesian product of the Peterson graph and stars. ",

It addresses the challenge of balancing a large field of view and high resolution by fusing information from multiple images taken with varying illumination angles. Nevertheless, conventional FPM framework always suffers from long acquisition time and a heavy computational burden. In this paper, we propose a novel physical neural network that generates an adaptive illumination mode by incorporating temporally-encoded illumination modes as a distinct layer, aiming to improve the acquisition and calculation efficiency. Both simulations and experiments have been conducted to validate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method. It is worth mentioning that, unlike previous works that obtain the intensity of a multiplexed illumination by post-combination of each sequentially illuminated and obtained low-resolution images, our experimental data is captured directly by turning on multiple LEDs with a coded illumination pattern. Our method has exhibited state-of-the-art performance in terms of both detail fidelity and imaging velocity when assessed through a multitude of evaluative aspects. ",
