    "title": "A Unified Approach to Lane Change Intention Recognition and Driving  Status Prediction through TCN-LSTM and Multi-Task Learning Models",
    "abstract": "Lane change (LC) is a continuous and complex operation process. Accurately detecting and predicting LC processes can help traffic participants better understand their surrounding environment, recognize potential LC safety hazards, and improve traffic safety. This present paper focuses on LC processes, developing an LC intention recognition (LC-IR) model and an LC status prediction (LC-SP) model. A novel ensemble temporal convolutional network with Long Short-Term Memory units (TCN-LSTM) is first proposed to capture long-range dependencies in sequential data. Then, three multi-task models (MTL-LSTM, MTL-TCN, MTL-TCN -LSTM) are developed to capture the intrinsic relationship among output indicators. Furthermore, a unified modeling framework for LC intention recognition and driving status prediction (LC-IR-SP) is developed. To validate the performance of the proposed models, a total number of 1023 vehicle trajectories is extracted from the CitySim dataset. The Pearson coefficient is employed to determine the related indicators. The results indicate that using150 frames as input length, the TCN-LSTM model with 96.67% accuracy outperforms TCN and LSTM models in LC intention classification and provides more balanced results for each class. Three proposed multi-tasking learning models provide markedly increased performance compared to corresponding single-task models, with an average reduction of 24.24% and 22.86% in the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), respectively. The developed LC-IR-SP model has promising applications for autonomous vehicles to identity lane change behaviors, calculate a real-time traffic conflict index and improve vehicle control strategies.

    "abstract": "We propose TR0N, a highly general framework to turn pre-trained unconditional generative models, such as GANs and VAEs, into conditional models. The conditioning can be highly arbitrary, and requires only a pre-trained auxiliary model. For example, we show how to turn unconditional models into class-conditional ones with the help of a classifier, and also into text-to-image models by leveraging CLIP. TR0N learns a lightweight stochastic mapping which \"translates\" between the space of conditions and the latent space of the generative model, in such a way that the generated latent corresponds to a data sample satisfying the desired condition. The translated latent samples are then further improved upon through Langevin dynamics, enabling us to obtain higher-quality data samples. TR0N requires no training data nor fine-tuning, yet can achieve a zero-shot FID of 10.9 on MS-COCO, outperforming competing alternatives not only on this metric, but also in sampling speed -- all while retaining a much higher level of generality.

    "abstract": "This paper presents a physics-informed neural network (PINN) approach for monitoring the health of diesel engines. The aim is to evaluate the engine dynamics, identify unknown parameters in a \"mean value\" model, and anticipate maintenance requirements. The PINN model is applied to diesel engines with a variable-geometry turbocharger and exhaust gas recirculation, using measurement data of selected state variables. The results demonstrate the ability of the PINN model to predict simultaneously both unknown parameters and dynamics accurately with both clean and noisy data, and the importance of the self-adaptive weight in the loss function for faster convergence. The input data for these simulations are derived from actual engine running conditions, while the outputs are simulated data, making this a practical case study of PINN's ability to predict real-world dynamical systems. The mean value model of the diesel engine incorporates empirical formulae to represent certain states, but these formulae may not be generalizable to other engines. To address this, the study considers the use of deep neural networks (DNNs) in addition to the PINN model. The DNNs are trained using laboratory test data and are used to model the engine-specific empirical formulae in the mean value model, allowing for a more flexible and adaptive representation of the engine's states. In other words, the mean value model uses both the PINN model and the DNNs to represent the engine's states, with the PINN providing a physics-based understanding of the engine's overall dynamics and the DNNs offering a more engine-specific and adaptive representation of the empirical formulae. By combining these two approaches, the study aims to offer a comprehensive and versatile approach to monitoring the health and performance of diesel engines. ",

Rapid deployment, portability, and flexibility are some of the fundamental characteristics of UAVs, which make them ideal for effectively managing emergency-based IoT applications. This paper studies a UAV-assisted wireless IoT network relying on non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) to facilitate uplink connectivity for devices spread over a disaster region. The UAV setup is capable of relaying the information to the cellular base station (BS) using decode and forward relay protocol. By jointly utilizing the concepts of unsupervised machine learning (ML) and solving the resulting non-convex problem, we can maximize the total energy efficiency (EE) of IoT devices spread over a disaster region. Our proposed approach uses a combination of k-medoids and Silhouette analysis to perform resource allocation, whereas, power optimization is performed using iterative methods. In comparison to the exhaustive search method, our proposed scheme solves the EE maximization problem with much lower complexity and at the same time improves the overall energy consumption of the IoT devices. Moreover, in comparison to a modified version of greedy algorithm, our proposed approach improves the total EE of the system by 19% for a fixed 50k target number of bits. ",

Current literature has focused primarily on deep neural network (DNN) based methods for solving a specific DE or a family of DEs. Research communities with a history of using DE models may view DNN-based differential equation solvers (DNN-DEs) as a faster and transferable alternative to current numerical methods. However, there is a lack of systematic surveys detailing the use of DNN-DE methods across physical application domains and a generalized taxonomy to guide future research. This paper surveys and classifies previous works and provides an educational tutorial for senior practitioners, professionals, and graduate students in engineering and computer science. First, we propose a taxonomy to navigate domains of DE systems studied under the umbrella of DNN-DE. Second, we examine the theory and performance of the Physics Informed Neural Network (PINN) to demonstrate how the influential DNN-DE architecture mathematically solves a system of equations. Third, to reinforce the key ideas of solving and discovery of DEs using DNN, we provide a tutorial using DeepXDE, a Python package for developing PINNs, to develop DNN-DEs for solving and discovering a classic DE, the linear transport equation.

Many prior methods require keypoint annotations to find correspondence between the source and target. Current pose transfer methods allow end-to-end correspondence learning but require the desired final output as ground truth for supervision. Unsupervised methods have been proposed for graph convolutional models but they require ground truth correspondence between the source and target inputs. We present a novel self-supervised framework for 3D pose transfer which can be trained in unsupervised, semi-supervised, or fully supervised settings without any correspondence labels. We introduce two contrastive learning constraints in the latent space: a mesh-level loss for disentangling global patterns including pose and identity, and a point-level loss for discriminating local semantics. We demonstrate quantitatively and qualitatively that our method achieves state-of-the-art results in supervised 3D pose transfer, with comparable results in unsupervised and semi-supervised settings. Our method is also generalisable to unseen human and animal data with complex topologies. ",

Concretely, we show that given the trained model and a crop of a training image containing only the background (e.g., water, sky, grass), it is possible to infer the foreground object with high accuracy or even visually reconstruct it. Furthermore, we show that d\\'ej\\`a vu memorization is common to different SSL algorithms, is exacerbated by certain design choices, and cannot be detected by conventional techniques for evaluating representation quality.

We use GPT-4 and ChatGPT to augment small labeled datasets with synthetic data via simple prompts, in three different classification tasks with varying complexity.

We explore two augmentation strategies: one that preserves original label distribution and another that balances the distribution. Using a progressively larger training sample size, we train and evaluate a 110M parameter multilingual language model on the real and synthetic data separately. We also test GPT-4 and ChatGPT in a zero-shot setting on the test sets. We observe that GPT-4 and ChatGPT have strong zero-shot performance across all tasks. We find that data augmented with synthetic samples yields a good downstream performance, and particularly aids in low-resource settings, such as in identifying rare classes. Human-annotated data exhibits a strong predictive power, overtaking synthetic data in two out of the three tasks. This finding highlights the need for more complex prompts for synthetic datasets to consistently surpass human-generated ones. ",

New methods freed data scientists from hand-crafting features for common tasks. Similarly, problems that require considering the spatial variable can benefit from pretrained map region representations instead of manually creating feature tables that one needs to prepare to solve a task. However, very few methods for map area representation exist, especially with respect to road network characteristics. In this paper, we propose a method for generating microregions' embeddings with respect to their road infrastructure characteristics. We base our representations on OpenStreetMap road networks in a selection of cities and use the H3 spatial index to allow reproducible and scalable representation learning. We obtained vector representations that detect how similar map hexagons are in the road networks they contain. Additionally, we observe that embeddings yield a latent space with meaningful arithmetic operations. Finally, clustering methods allowed us to draft a high-level typology of obtained representations. We are confident that this contribution will aid data scientists working on infrastructure-related prediction tasks with spatial variables. ",

Existing rumor detection methods typically exploit the reposting propagation of a rumor candidate for detection by regarding all reposts to a rumor candidate as a temporal sequence and learning semantics representations of the repost sequence. However, extracting informative support from the topological structure of propagation and the influence of reposting authors for debunking rumors is crucial, which generally has not been well addressed by existing methods. In this paper, we organize a claim post in circulation as an adhoc event tree, extract event elements, and convert it to bipartite adhoc event trees in terms of both posts and authors, i.e., author tree and post tree. Accordingly, we propose a novel rumor detection model with hierarchical representation on the bipartite adhoc event trees called BAET. Specifically, we introduce word embedding and feature encoder for the author and post tree, respectively, and design a root-aware attention module to perform node representation. Then we adopt the tree-like RNN model to capture the structural correlations and propose a tree-aware attention module to learn tree representation for the author tree and post tree, respectively. Extensive experimental results on two public Twitter datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of BAET in exploring and exploiting the rumor propagation structure and the superior detection performance of BAET over state-of-the-art baseline methods.

    "abstract": "The incorporation of trees on farms can help to improve livelihoods and build resilience among small-holder farmers in developing countries. On-farm trees can help gen- erate additional income from commercial tree harvest as well as contribute significant environmental benefits and ecosystem services to increase resiliency. Long-term benefits from tree-based livelihoods, however, depend on sustainable timber harvesting. In this paper, we discuss the potential for network analysis as a tool to inform conservation and development decision-making. Specifically, we formulate the commercial tree market between farmers and traders as a transportation problem and optimize the transactions. We create a model of the commercial tree market in the Bilaspur district of Himachal Pradesh, India based on a detailed dataset of market interactions between farmers and timber traders, using the existing road network of this region. Using this model, we perform a maximum-flow-minimum-cost optimization for tree commodity flow. We compare the results of our optimized model with actual flow within the network, and we find a high potential to increase efficiency of market transactions within this region, noting a significant reduction to the minimum- cost flow value for our optimized model compared to the flow cost for actual transactions. We propose that using this network flow optimization model to strategically distribute permits can reduce costs associated with market transactions. Our results suggest that this direct policy action would be beneficial to the region. Finally, we suggest that cost savings could be used to establish tree planting programs to support a long-term sustainable tree market. Shaping policies to address these market inefficiencies in developing regions could help support and elevate tree-based livelihoods for farmers, traders, and industries. ",

    "title": "Detection of Adversarial Physical Attacks in Time-Series Image Data",
    "abstract": "Deep neural networks (DNN) have become a common sensing modality in autonomous systems as they allow for semantically perceiving the ambient environment given input images. Nevertheless, DNN models have proven to be vulnerable to adversarial digital and physical attacks. To mitigate this issue, several detection frameworks have been proposed to detect whether a single input image has been manipulated by adversarial digital noise or not. In our prior work, we proposed a real-time detector, called VisionGuard (VG), for adversarial physical attacks against single input images to DNN models. Building upon that work, we propose VisionGuard* (VG), which couples VG with majority-vote methods, to detect adversarial physical attacks in time-series image data, e.g., videos. This is motivated by autonomous systems applications where images are collected over time using onboard sensors for decision-making purposes. We emphasize that majority-vote mechanisms are quite common in autonomous system applications (among many other applications), as e.g., in autonomous driving stacks for object detection. In this paper, we investigate, both theoretically and experimentally, how this widely used mechanism can be leveraged to enhance the performance of adversarial detectors. We have evaluated VG* on videos of both clean and physically attacked traffic signs generated by a state-of-the-art robust physical attack. We provide extensive comparative experiments against detectors that have been designed originally for out-of-distribution data and digitally attacked images. ",

    "abstract": "Bitcoin transactions include unspent transaction outputs (UTXOs) as their inputs and generate one or more newly owned UTXOs at specified addresses. Each UTXO can only be used as an input in a transaction once, and using it in two or more different transactions is referred to as a double-spending attack. Ultimately, due to the characteristics of the Bitcoin protocol, double-spending is impossible. However, problems may arise when a transaction is considered final even though its finality has not been fully guaranteed in order to achieve fast payment. In this paper, we propose an approach to detecting Bitcoin double-spending attacks using a graph neural network (GNN). This model predicts whether all nodes in the network contain a given payment transaction in their own memory pool (mempool) using information only obtained from some observer nodes in the network. Our experiment shows that the proposed model can detect double-spending with an accuracy of at least 0.95 when more than about 1% of the entire nodes in the network are observer nodes. ",

    "abstract": "Deepfake detection remains a challenging task due to the difficulty of generalizing to new types of forgeries. This problem primarily stems from the overfitting of existing detection methods to forgery-irrelevant features and method-specific patterns. The latter is often ignored by previous works. This paper presents a novel approach to address the two types of overfitting issues by uncovering common forgery features. Specifically, we first propose a disentanglement framework that decomposes image information into three distinct components: forgery-irrelevant, method-specific forgery, and common forgery features. To ensure the decoupling of method-specific and common forgery features, a multi-task learning strategy is employed, including a multi-class classification that predicts the category of the forgery method and a binary classification that distinguishes the real from the fake. Additionally, a conditional decoder is designed to utilize forgery features as a condition along with forgery-irrelevant features to generate reconstructed images. Furthermore, a contrastive regularization technique is proposed to encourage the disentanglement of the common and specific forgery features. Ultimately, we only utilize the common forgery features for the purpose of generalizable deepfake detection. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our framework can perform superior generalization than current state-of-the-art methods. ",

    "abstract": "Robust image watermarking that can resist camera shooting has become an active research topic in recent years due to the increasing demand for preventing sensitive information displayed on computer screens from being captured. However, many mainstream schemes require human assistance during the watermark detection process and cannot adapt to scenarios that require processing a large number of images. Although deep learning-based schemes enable end-to-end watermark embedding and detection, their limited generalization ability makes them vulnerable to failure in complex scenarios. In this paper, we propose a carefully crafted watermarking system that can resist camera shooting. The proposed scheme deals with two important problems: automatic watermark localization (AWL) and automatic watermark detection (AWD). AWL automatically identifies the region of interest (RoI), which contains watermark information, in the camera-shooting image by analyzing the local statistical characteristics. Meanwhile, AWD extracts the hidden watermark from the identified RoI after applying perspective correction. Compared with previous works, the proposed scheme is fully automatic, making it ideal for application scenarios. Furthermore, the proposed scheme is not limited to any specific watermark embedding strategy, allowing for improvements in the watermark embedding and extraction procedure. Extensive experimental results and analysis show that the embedded watermark can be automatically and reliably extracted from the camera-shooting image in different scenarios, demonstrating the superiority and applicability of the proposed approach.

Most mainstream methods rely on large amounts of existing or related domain data as auxiliary information. However, in actual industrial production, there are often multi-batch, low-volume manufacturing scenarios with rapidly changing task demands, making it difficult to obtain sufficient and diverse defect data. This paper proposes a parallel solution that uses a human-machine knowledge hybrid augmentation method to help the model extract unknown important features. Specifically, by incorporating experts' knowledge of abnormality to create data with rich features, positions, sizes, and backgrounds, we can quickly accumulate an amount of data from scratch and provide it to the model as prior knowledge for few-data learning. The proposed method was evaluated on the magnetic tile dataset and achieved F1-scores of 60.73%, 70.82%, 77.09%, and 82.81% when using 2, 5, 10, and 15 training images, respectively. Compared to the traditional augmentation method's F1-score of 64.59%, the proposed method achieved an 18.22% increase in the best result, demonstrating its feasibility and effectiveness in few-data industrial defect detection.

    "abstract": "Segmentation of drivable roads and negative obstacles is critical to the safe driving of autonomous vehicles. Currently, many multi-modal fusion methods have been proposed to improve segmentation accuracy, such as fusing RGB and depth images. However, we find that when fusing two modals of data with untrustworthy features, the performance of multi-modal networks could be degraded, even lower than those using a single modality. In this paper, the untrustworthy features refer to those extracted from regions (e.g., far objects that are beyond the depth measurement range) with invalid depth data (i.e., 0 pixel value) in depth images. The untrustworthy features can confuse the segmentation results, and hence lead to inferior results. To provide a solution to this issue, we propose the Adaptive-Mask Fusion Network (AMFNet) by introducing adaptive-weight masks in the fusion module to fuse features from RGB and depth images with inconsistency. In addition, we release a large-scale RGB-depth dataset with manually-labeled ground truth based on the NPO dataset for drivable roads and negative obstacles segmentation.

To this end, we first revise the discriminator design and remove dependency on ground-truth camera poses. Then, to capture complex and challenging 3D scene structures more effectively, we make the discriminator estimate a high-dimensional implicit pose embedding from a given image and perform contrastive learning on the pose embedding. The proposed approach can be employed for the dataset, where the canonical camera pose is ill-defined because it does not look up or estimate camera poses.

However, there are inherent gaps between testing and training data, which can make this approach unreliable. To address this issue, we propose an \\textit{Abductive Prediction Correction} (APC) framework for sequential recommendation. Our approach simulates abductive reasoning to correct predictions. Specifically, we design an abductive reasoning task that infers the most probable historical interactions from the future interactions predicted by a recommender, and minimizes the discrepancy between the inferred and true historical interactions to adjust the predictions.We perform the abductive inference and adjustment using a reversed sequential model in the forward and backward propagation manner of neural networks.

Such development is accompanied with continuous liberalization in the energy sector, giving rise to possible energy trading among networked local energy hub. Joint operation of such hubs can improve energy efficiency and support the integration of renewable energy resource. Acknowledging peer-to-peer trading between hubs, their optimal operation within the network can maximize consumption of locally produced energy. However, for such complex systems involving multiple stakeholders, both computational tractability and privacy concerns need to be accounted for. We investigate both decentralized and centralized model predictive control (MPC) approaches for a network of energy hubs. While the centralized control strategy offers superior performance to the decentralized method, its implementation is computationally prohibitive and raises privacy concerns, as the information of each hub has to be shared extensively. On the other hand, a classical decentralized control approach can ease the implementation at the expense of sub-optimal performance of the overall system. In this work, a distributed scheme based on a consensus alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm is proposed. It combines the performance of the centralized approach with the privacy preservation of decentralized approach. A novel multi-horizon MPC framework is also introduced to increase the prediction horizon without compromising the time discretization or making the problem computationally intractable. A benchmark three-hub network is used to compare the performance of the mentioned methods. The results show superior performance in terms of total cost, computational time, robustness to demand and prices variations. ",

Unfortunately, the lack of safety guarantees and the large data requirements by DRL algorithms make learning in the real world unfeasible. To bridge this gap, simulation environments are frequently used. We propose SocNavGym, an advanced simulation environment for social navigation that can generate a wide variety of social navigation scenarios and facilitates the development of intelligent social agents.

It can also be configured to work with different hand-crafted and data-driven social reward signals and to yield a variety of evaluation metrics to benchmark agents' performance. Further, we also provide a case study where a Dueling-DQN agent is trained to learn social-navigation policies using SocNavGym. The results provides evidence that SocNavGym can be used to train an agent from scratch to navigate in simple as well as complex social scenarios.

In spite of intensive research on deep learning (DL) approaches over the past few years, there is still a significant performance gap between WSOD and fully supervised object detection. In fact, most existing WSOD methods only consider the visual appearance of each region proposal but ignore employing the useful context information in the image. To this end, this paper proposes an interactive end-to-end WSDO framework called JLWSOD with two innovations: i) two types of WSOD-specific context information (i.e., instance-wise correlation andsemantic-wise correlation) are proposed and introduced into WSOD framework; ii) an interactive graph contrastive learning (iGCL) mechanism is designed to jointly optimize the visual appearance and context information for better WSOD performance. Specifically, the iGCL mechanism takes full advantage of the complementary interpretations of the WSOD, namely instance-wise detection and semantic-wise prediction tasks, forming a more comprehensive solution. Extensive experiments on the widely used PASCAL VOC and MS COCO benchmarks verify the superiority of JLWSOD over alternative state-of-the-art approaches and baseline models (improvement of 3.6%~23.3% on mAP and 3.4%~19.7% on CorLoc, respectively).

The CAPE module can be combined with neural PDE solvers allowing them to adapt to unseen PDE parameters. The curriculum learning strategy provides a seamless transition between teacher-forcing and fully auto-regressive training. We compare CAPE in conjunction with the curriculum learning strategy using a popular PDE benchmark and obtain consistent and significant improvements over the baseline models. The experiments also show several advantages of CAPE, such as its increased ability to generalize to unseen PDE parameters without large increases inference time and parameter count. ",

    "abstract": "We consider the online scheduling problem of moldable task graphs on multiprocessor systems for minimizing the overall completion time (or makespan). Moldable job scheduling has been widely studied in the literature, in particular when tasks have dependencies (i.e., task graphs) or when tasks are released on-the-fly (i.e., online). However, few studies have focused on both (i.e., online scheduling of moldable task graphs). In this paper, we design a new online scheduling algorithm for this problem and derive constant competitive ratios under several common yet realistic speedup models (i.e., roofline, communication, Amdahl, and a general combination). These results improve the ones we have shown in the preliminary version of this paper. We also prove, for each speedup model, a lower bound on the competitiveness of any online list scheduling algorithm that allocates processors to a task based only on the task's parameters and not on its position in the graph. This lower bound matches exactly the competitive ratio of our algorithm for the roofline, communication and Amdahl's model, and is close to the ratio for the general model. Finally, we provide a lower bound on the competitive ratio of any deterministic online algorithm for the arbitrary speedup model, which is not constant but depends on the number of tasks in the longest path of the graph.

    "abstract": "Multimedia content has become ubiquitous on social media platforms, leading to the rise of multimodal misinformation and the urgent need for effective strategies to detect and prevent its spread. This study focuses on CrossModal Misinformation (CMM) where image-caption pairs work together to spread falsehoods. We contrast CMM with Asymmetric Multimodal Misinformation (AMM), where one dominant modality propagates falsehoods while other modalities have little or no influence. We show that AMM adds noise to the training and evaluation process while exacerbating the unimodal bias, where text-only or image-only detectors can seemingly outperform their multimodal counterparts on an inherently multimodal task. To address this issue, we collect and curate FIGMENTS, a robust evaluation benchmark for CMM, which consists of real world cases of misinformation, excludes AMM and utilizes modality balancing to successfully alleviate unimodal bias. FIGMENTS also provides a first step towards fine-grained CMM detection by including three classes: truthful, out-of-context, and miscaptioned image-caption pairs. Furthermore, we introduce a method for generating realistic synthetic training data that maintains crossmodal relations between legitimate images and false human-written captions that we term Crossmodal HArd Synthetic MisAlignment (CHASMA). We conduct extensive comparative study using a Transformer-based architecture. Our results show that incorporating CHASMA in conjunction with other generated datasets consistently improved the overall performance on FIGMENTS in both binary (+6.26%) and multiclass settings (+15.8%).We release our code at: https://github.com/stevejpapad/figments-and-misalignments ",

    "abstract": "Bias in computer vision systems can perpetuate or even amplify discrimination against certain populations. Considering that bias is often introduced by biased visual datasets, many recent research efforts focus on training fair models using such data. However, most of them heavily rely on the availability of protected attribute labels in the dataset, which limits their applicability, while label-unaware approaches, i.e., approaches operating without such labels, exhibit considerably lower performance. To overcome these limitations, this work introduces FLAC, a methodology that minimizes mutual information between the features extracted by the model and a protected attribute, without the use of attribute labels. To do that, FLAC proposes a sampling strategy that highlights underrepresented samples in the dataset, and casts the problem of learning fair representations as a probability matching problem that leverages representations extracted by a bias-capturing classifier. It is theoretically shown that FLAC can indeed lead to fair representations, that are independent of the protected attributes. FLAC surpasses the current state-of-the-art on Biased MNIST, CelebA, and UTKFace, by 29.1%, 18.1%, and 21.9%, respectively. Additionally, FLAC exhibits 2.2% increased accuracy on ImageNet-A consisting of the most challenging samples of ImageNet.

    "abstract": "Homophily principle, i.e. nodes with the same labels are more likely to be connected, was believed to be the main reason for the performance superiority of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) over Neural Networks (NNs) on Node Classification (NC) tasks. Recently, people have developed theoretical results arguing that, even though the homophily principle is broken, the advantage of GNNs can still hold as long as nodes from the same class share similar neighborhood patterns, which questions the validity of homophily. However, this argument only considers intra-class Node Distinguishability (ND) and ignores inter-class ND, which is insufficient to study the effect of homophily. In this paper, we first demonstrate the aforementioned insufficiency with examples and argue that an ideal situation for ND is to have smaller intra-class ND than inter-class ND. To formulate this idea and have a better understanding of homophily, we propose Contextual Stochastic Block Model for Homophily (CSBM-H) and define two metrics, Probabilistic Bayes Error (PBE) and Expected Negative KL-divergence (ENKL), to quantify ND, through which we can also find how intra- and inter-class ND influence ND together. We visualize the results and give detailed analysis. Through experiments, we verified that the superiority of GNNs is indeed closely related to both intra- and inter-class ND regardless of homophily levels, based on which we define Kernel Performance Metric (KPM). KPM is a new non-linear, feature-based metric, which is tested to be more effective than the existing homophily metrics on revealing the advantage and disadvantage of GNNs on synthetic and real-world datasets.

Although these models have shown promising results in tasks such as machine translation and summarization, their applicability in code generation tasks remains limited without human involvement. The complexity of programming concepts required for such tasks makes it difficult to develop evaluation metrics that align with human judgment. Token-matching-based metrics, such as BLEU, have demonstrated weak correlations with human practitioners in code generation tasks. Moreover, the utilization of human-written test suites to evaluate functional correctness can be challenging in domains with low resources.

    "abstract": "By identifying four important components of existing LiDAR-camera 3D object detection methods (LiDAR and camera candidates, transformation, and fusion outputs), we observe that all existing methods either find dense candidates or yield dense representations of scenes. However, given that objects occupy only a small part of a scene, finding dense candidates and generating dense representations is noisy and inefficient. We propose SparseFusion, a novel multi-sensor 3D detection method that exclusively uses sparse candidates and sparse representations. Specifically, SparseFusion utilizes the outputs of parallel detectors in the LiDAR and camera modalities as sparse candidates for fusion. We transform the camera candidates into the LiDAR coordinate space by disentangling the object representations. Then, we can fuse the multi-modality candidates in a unified 3D space by a lightweight self-attention module. To mitigate negative transfer between modalities, we propose novel semantic and geometric cross-modality transfer modules that are applied prior to the modality-specific detectors. SparseFusion achieves state-of-the-art performance on the nuScenes benchmark while also running at the fastest speed, even outperforming methods with stronger backbones. We perform extensive experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our modules and overall method pipeline.

Many NN approaches learn an end-to-end model that implicitly models both the governing PDE and constitutive models (or material models). Without explicit PDE knowledge, these approaches cannot guarantee physical correctness and have limited generalizability. We argue that the governing PDEs are often well-known and should be explicitly enforced rather than learned. Instead, constitutive models are particularly suitable for learning due to their data-fitting nature. To this end, we introduce a new framework termed \"Neural Constitutive Laws\" (NCLaw), which utilizes a network architecture that strictly guarantees standard constitutive priors, including rotation equivariance and undeformed state equilibrium. We embed this network inside a differentiable simulation and train the model by minimizing a loss function based on the difference between the simulation and the motion observation. We validate NCLaw on various large-deformation dynamical systems, ranging from solids to fluids. After training on a single motion trajectory, our method generalizes to new geometries, initial/boundary conditions, temporal ranges, and even multi-physics systems. On these extremely out-of-distribution generalization tasks, NCLaw is orders-of-magnitude more accurate than previous NN approaches. Real-world experiments demonstrate our method's ability to learn constitutive laws from videos. ",

    "abstract": "Neural fields are neural networks which map coordinates to a desired signal. When a neural field should jointly model multiple signals, and not memorize only one, it needs to be conditioned on a latent code which describes the signal at hand. Despite being an important aspect, there has been little research on conditioning strategies for neural fields. In this work, we explore the use of neural fields as decoders for 2D semantic segmentation. For this task, we compare three conditioning methods, simple concatenation of the latent code, Feature Wise Linear Modulation (FiLM), and Cross-Attention, in conjunction with latent codes which either describe the full image or only a local region of the image. Our results show a considerable difference in performance between the examined conditioning strategies. Furthermore, we show that conditioning via Cross-Attention achieves the best results and is competitive with a CNN-based decoder for semantic segmentation. ",

In this paper, we extend the method to partial differential equations. The resulting model is comprised of up to three neural networks, modelling terms representing conservation, dissipation and external forces, and discrete convolution operators that can either be learned or be prior knowledge. We demonstrate numerically the superior performance of PHNN compared to a baseline model that models the full dynamics by a single neural network. Moreover, since the PHNN model consists of three parts with different physical interpretations, these can be studied separately to gain insight into the system, and the learned model is applicable also if external forces are removed or changed.

    "abstract": "We present Co-SLAM, a neural RGB-D SLAM system based on a hybrid representation, that performs robust camera tracking and high-fidelity surface reconstruction in real time. Co-SLAM represents the scene as a multi-resolution hash-grid to exploit its high convergence speed and ability to represent high-frequency local features. In addition, Co-SLAM incorporates one-blob encoding, to encourage surface coherence and completion in unobserved areas. This joint parametric-coordinate encoding enables real-time and robust performance by bringing the best of both worlds: fast convergence and surface hole filling. Moreover, our ray sampling strategy allows Co-SLAM to perform global bundle adjustment over all keyframes instead of requiring keyframe selection to maintain a small number of active keyframes as competing neural SLAM approaches do. Experimental results show that Co-SLAM runs at 10-17Hz and achieves state-of-the-art scene reconstruction results, and competitive tracking performance in various datasets and benchmarks (ScanNet, TUM, Replica, Synthetic RGBD).

    "abstract": "Low-density parity-check codes together with belief propagation (BP) decoding are known to be well-performing for large block lengths. However, for short block lengths there is still a considerable gap between the performance of the BP decoder and the maximum likelihood decoder. Different ensemble decoding schemes such as, e.g., the automorphism ensemble decoder (AED), can reduce this gap in short block length regime. We propose a generalized AED (GAED) that uses automorphisms according to the definition in linear algebra. Here, an automorphism of a vector space is defined as a linear, bijective self-mapping, whereas in coding theory self-mappings that are scaled permutations are commonly used. We show that the more general definition leads to an explicit joint construction of codes and automorphisms, and significantly enlarges the search space for automorphisms of existing linear codes. Furthermore, we prove the concept that generalized automorphisms can indeed be used to improve decoding. Additionally, we propose a code construction of parity check codes enabling the construction of codes with suitably designed automorphisms. Finally, we analyze the decoding performances of the GAED for some of our constructed codes. ",

    "abstract": "Deep Learning (DL) can diagnose faults and assess machine health from raw condition monitoring data without manually designed statistical features. However, practical manufacturing applications remain extremely difficult for existing DL methods. Machine data is often unlabeled and from very few health conditions (e.g., only normal operating data). Furthermore, models often encounter shifts in domain as process parameters change and new categories of faults emerge. Traditional supervised learning may struggle to learn compact, discriminative representations that generalize to these unseen target domains since it depends on having plentiful classes to partition the feature space with decision boundaries. Transfer Learning (TL) with domain adaptation attempts to adapt these models to unlabeled target domains but assumes similar underlying structure that may not be present if new faults emerge. This study proposes focusing on maximizing the feature generality on the source domain and applying TL via weight transfer to copy the model to the target domain. Specifically, Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) with Barlow Twins may produce more discriminative features for monitoring health condition than supervised learning by focusing on semantic properties of the data. Furthermore, Federated Learning (FL) for distributed training may also improve generalization by efficiently expanding the effective size and diversity of training data by sharing information across multiple client machines. Results show that Barlow Twins outperforms supervised learning in an unlabeled target domain with emerging motor faults when the source training data contains very few distinct categories. Incorporating FL may also provide a slight advantage by diffusing knowledge of health conditions between machines. ",

    "abstract": "Brain tumor is one of the leading causes of cancer death. The high-grade brain tumors are easier to recurrent even after standard treatment. Therefore, developing a method to predict brain tumor recurrence location plays an important role in the treatment planning and it can potentially prolong patient's survival time. There is still little work to deal with this issue. In this paper, we present a deep learning-based brain tumor recurrence location prediction network. Since the dataset is usually small, we propose to use transfer learning to improve the prediction. We first train a multi-modal brain tumor segmentation network on the public dataset BraTS 2021. Then, the pre-trained encoder is transferred to our private dataset for extracting the rich semantic features. Following that, a multi-scale multi-channel feature fusion model and a nonlinear correlation learning module are developed to learn the effective features. The correlation between multi-channel features is modeled by a nonlinear equation. To measure the similarity between the distributions of original features of one modality and the estimated correlated features of another modality, we propose to use Kullback-Leibler divergence. Based on this divergence, a correlation loss function is designed to maximize the similarity between the two feature distributions. Finally, two decoders are constructed to jointly segment the present brain tumor and predict its future tumor recurrence location. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that can segment the present tumor and at the same time predict future tumor recurrence location, making the treatment planning more efficient and precise. The experimental results demonstrated the effectiveness of our proposed method to predict the brain tumor recurrence location from the limited dataset. ",

However, their complex structure may lead to low robustness against small covariate perturbation in unseen data. In this study, we apply one-hot encoding to convert a GBDT model into a linear framework, through encoding of each tree leaf to one dummy variable. This allows for the use of linear regression techniques, plus a novel risk decomposition for assessing the robustness of a GBDT model against covariate perturbations. We propose to enhance the robustness of GBDT models by refitting their linear regression forms with $L_1$ or $L_2$ regularization. Theoretical results are obtained about the effect of regularization on the model performance and robustness. It is demonstrated through numerical experiments that the proposed regularization approach can enhance the robustness of the one-hot-encoded GBDT models. ",

We analyze the geometry of the landscape of solutions in both models and find important similarities and differences. Both models exhibit subdominant minimizers which are extremely flat and wide. These minimizers coexist with a background of dominant solutions which are composed by an exponential number of algorithmically inaccessible small clusters for the binary case (the frozen 1-RSB phase) or a hierarchical structure of clusters of different sizes for the spherical case (the full RSB phase). In both cases, when a certain threshold in constraint density is crossed, the local entropy of the wide flat minima becomes non-monotonic, indicating a break-up of the space of robust solutions into disconnected components. This has a strong impact on the behavior of algorithms in binary models, which cannot access the remaining isolated clusters. For the spherical case the behaviour is different, since even beyond the disappearance of the wide flat minima the remaining solutions are shown to always be surrounded by a large number of other solutions at any distance, up to capacity. Indeed, we exhibit numerical evidence that algorithms seem to find solutions up to the SAT/UNSAT transition, that we compute here using an 1RSB approximation. For both models, the generalization performance as a learning device is shown to be greatly improved by the existence of wide flat minimizers even when trained in the highly underconstrained regime of very negative margins.
