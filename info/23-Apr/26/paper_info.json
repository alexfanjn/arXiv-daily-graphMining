    "abstract": "Light plays an important role in human well-being. However, most computer vision tasks treat pixels without considering their relationship to physical luminance. To address this shortcoming, we present the first large-scale photometrically calibrated dataset of high dynamic range \\ang{360} panoramas. Our key contribution is the calibration of an existing, uncalibrated HDR Dataset. We do so by accurately capturing RAW bracketed exposures simultaneously with a professional photometric measurement device (chroma meter) for multiple scenes across a variety of lighting conditions. Using the resulting measurements, we establish the calibration coefficients to be applied to the HDR images. The resulting dataset is a rich representation of indoor scenes which displays a wide range of illuminance and color temperature, and varied types of light sources. We exploit the dataset to introduce three novel tasks: where per-pixel luminance, per-pixel temperature and planar illuminance can be predicted from a single input image. Finally, we also capture another smaller calibrated dataset with a commercial \\ang{360} camera, to experiment on generalization across cameras. We are optimistic that the release of our datasets and associated code will spark interest in physically accurate light estimation within the community. ",

    "abstract": "In this work, we developed an algorithm for detecting code quality issues in the templates of online programming tasks, validated it, and conducted an empirical study on the dataset of student solutions. The algorithm consists of analyzing recurring unfixed issues in solutions of different students, matching them with the code of the template, and then filtering the results. Our manual validation on a subset of tasks demonstrated a precision of 80.8% and a recall of 73.3%. We used the algorithm on 415 Java tasks from the JetBrains Academy platform and discovered that as much as 14.7% of tasks have at least one issue in their template, thus making it harder for students to learn good code quality practices. We describe our results in detail, provide several motivating examples and specific cases, and share the feedback of the developers of the platform, who fixed 51 issues based on the output of our approach.

This unique capability enables, out-of-the-box, surface normal estimation, rendering room-scale point clouds, inverse rendering, and ray tracing with global illumination. Unlike existing work that focuses on converting point clouds to other representations--e.g., surfaces or implicit functions--our key idea is to directly infer the intersection of a light ray with the underlying surface represented by the given point cloud. Specifically, we train a set transformer that, given a small number of local neighbor points along a light ray, provides the intersection point, the surface normal, and the material blending weights, which are used to render the outcome of this light ray. Localizing the problem into small neighborhoods enables us to train a model with only 48 meshes and apply it to unseen point clouds. Our model achieves higher estimation accuracy than state-of-the-art surface reconstruction and point-cloud rendering methods on three test sets. When applied to room-scale point clouds, without any scene-specific optimization, the model achieves competitive quality with the state-of-the-art novel-view rendering methods. Moreover, we demonstrate ability to render and manipulate Lidar-scanned point clouds such as lighting control and object insertion. ",

While deep neuroevolution has recently been shown to match the performance of gradient-based techniques on various reinforcement learning problems, the application of deep neuroevolution techniques to imitation learning remains relatively unexplored. In this work, we propose to explore whether deep neuroevolution can be used for behaviour imitation on popular simulation environments. We introduce a simple co-evolutionary adversarial generation framework, and evaluate its capabilities by evolving standard deep recurrent networks to imitate state-of-the-art pre-trained agents on 8 OpenAI Gym state-based control tasks. Across all tasks, we find the final elite actor agents capable of achieving scores as high as those obtained by the pre-trained agents, all the while closely following their score trajectories. Our results suggest that neuroevolution could be a valuable addition to deep learning techniques to produce accurate emulation of behavioural agents. We believe that the generality and simplicity of our approach opens avenues for imitating increasingly complex behaviours in increasingly complex settings, e.g. human behaviour in real-world settings.

    "abstract": "Ground fault detection in inverter-based microgrid systems is challenging, particularly in a real-time setting, as the fault current deviates slightly from the nominal value. This difficulty is reinforced when natural disturbances exhibit similar output patterns as a faulty setting does. The conventional solution of installing more relays to obtain additional measurements is costly and also increases the complexity of the system. In this paper, we propose diagnosis schemes based on optimization-based fault detection filters with the output current as the only measurement. Modeling the microgrid dynamics and the diagnosis filter, we formulate the filter design as a linear programming (LP) problem that accounts for decoupling a class of disturbances and ensuring fault sensitivity simultaneously. Next, we robustify the filter to disturbances that cannot be fully decoupled. To this end, we leverage tools from the existing literature and extend the optimization program to a quadratic programming (QP) problem in which the filter is trained for this class of disturbances. To ease the computational effort, we also provide an approximate but analytical solution to this QP. Additionally, we use classical statistical results to provide a thresholding mechanism that enjoys probabilistic false-alarm guarantees. Finally, we verify the effectiveness of the proposed methods through several numerical simulations. ",

    "abstract": "Impressive advances in acquisition and sharing technologies have made the growth of multimedia collections and their applications almost unlimited. However, the opposite is true for the availability of labeled data, which is needed for supervised training, since such data is often expensive and time-consuming to obtain. While there is a pressing need for the development of effective retrieval and classification methods, the difficulties faced by supervised approaches highlight the relevance of methods capable of operating with few or no labeled data. In this work, we propose a novel manifold learning algorithm named Rank Flow Embedding (RFE) for unsupervised and semi-supervised scenarios. The proposed method is based on ideas recently exploited by manifold learning approaches, which include hypergraphs, Cartesian products, and connected components. The algorithm computes context-sensitive embeddings, which are refined following a rank-based processing flow, while complementary contextual information is incorporated. The generated embeddings can be exploited for more effective unsupervised retrieval or semi-supervised classification based on Graph Convolutional Networks. Experimental results were conducted on 10 different collections. Various features were considered, including the ones obtained with recent Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Vision Transformer (ViT) models. High effective results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method on different tasks: unsupervised image retrieval, semi-supervised classification, and person Re-ID. The results demonstrate that RFE is competitive or superior to the state-of-the-art in diverse evaluated scenarios. ",

    "abstract": "Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) based 3D reconstruction is highly desirable for immersive Augmented and Virtual Reality (AR/VR) applications, but achieving instant (i.e., < 5 seconds) on-device NeRF training remains a challenge. In this work, we first identify the inefficiency bottleneck: the need to interpolate NeRF embeddings up to 200,000 times from a 3D embedding grid during each training iteration. To alleviate this, we propose Instant-3D, an algorithm-hardware co-design acceleration framework that achieves instant on-device NeRF training. Our algorithm decomposes the embedding grid representation in terms of color and density, enabling computational redundancy to be squeezed out by adopting different (1) grid sizes and (2) update frequencies for the color and density branches. Our hardware accelerator further reduces the dominant memory accesses for embedding grid interpolation by (1) mapping multiple nearby points' memory read requests into one during the feed-forward process, (2) merging embedding grid updates from the same sliding time window during back-propagation, and (3) fusing different computation cores to support the different grid sizes needed by the color and density branches of Instant-3D algorithm. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of Instant-3D, achieving a large training time reduction of 41x - 248x while maintaining the same reconstruction quality. Excitingly, Instant-3D has enabled instant 3D reconstruction for AR/VR, requiring a reconstruction time of only 1.6 seconds per scene and meeting the AR/VR power consumption constraint of 1.9 W. ",

Information theory, a branch of mathematics historically associated with questions about encoding and decoding messages, has emerged as something of a lingua franca for those studying complex systems, far exceeding its original narrow domain of communication systems engineering. In the context of complexity science, information theory provides a set of tools which allow researchers to uncover the statistical and effective dependencies between interacting components; relationships between systems and their environment; mereological whole-part relationships; and is sensitive to non-linearities missed by commonly parametric statistical models. In this review, we aim to provide an accessible introduction to the core of modern information theory, aimed specifically at aspiring (and established) complex systems scientists. This includes standard measures, such as Shannon entropy, relative entropy, and mutual information, before building to more advanced topics, including: information dynamics, measures of statistical complexity, information decomposition, and effective network inference. In addition to detailing the formal definitions, in this review we make an effort to discuss how information theory can be interpreted and develop the intuition behind abstract concepts like \"entropy,\" in the hope that this will enable interested readings to understand what information is, and how it is used, at a more fundamental level.

Previous methods mainly rely on prior expert knowledge to capture specific forgery clues, such as noise patterns, blending boundaries, and frequency artifacts.

To address these issues, we propose a novel Critical Forgery Mining (CFM) framework, which can be flexibly assembled with various backbones to boost their generalization and robustness performance. Specifically, we first build a fine-grained triplet and suppress specific forgery traces through prior knowledge-agnostic data augmentation. Subsequently, we propose a fine-grained relation learning prototype to mine critical information in forgeries through instance and local similarity-aware losses. Moreover, we design a novel progressive learning controller to guide the model to focus on principal feature components, enabling it to learn critical forgery features in a coarse-to-fine manner.

In spite of many advances, most of the approaches require a large amount of labeled data, which is often not available, due to costs and difficulties of manual labeling processes. In this scenario, unsupervised and semi-supervised approaches have been gaining increasing attention. The GCNs (Graph Convolutional Neural Networks) represent a promising solution since they encode the neighborhood information and have achieved state-of-the-art results on scenarios with limited labeled data. However, since GCNs require graph-structured data, their use for semi-supervised image classification is still scarce in the literature. In this work, we propose a novel approach, the Manifold-GCN, based on GCNs for semi-supervised image classification. The main hypothesis of this paper is that the use of manifold learning to model the graph structure can further improve the GCN classification. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first framework that allows the combination of GCNs with different types of manifold learning approaches for image classification. All manifold learning algorithms employed are completely unsupervised, which is especially useful for scenarios where the availability of labeled data is a concern. A broad experimental evaluation was conducted considering 5 GCN models, 3 manifold learning approaches, 3 image datasets, and 5 deep features. The results reveal that our approach presents better accuracy than traditional and recent state-of-the-art methods with very efficient run times for both training and testing. ",

    "abstract": "A digital twin (DT) leverages a virtual representation of the physical world, along with communication (e.g., 6G), computing (e.g., edge computing), and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies to enable many connected intelligence services. In order to handle the large amounts of network data based on digital twins (DTs), wireless systems can exploit the paradigm of semantic communication (SC) for facilitating informed decision-making under strict communication constraints by utilizing AI techniques such as causal reasoning. In this paper, a novel framework called causal semantic communication (CSC) is proposed for DT-based wireless systems. The CSC system is posed as an imitation learning (IL) problem, where the transmitter, with access to optimal network control policies using a DT, teaches the receiver using SC over a bandwidth limited wireless channel how to improve its knowledge to perform optimal control actions. The causal structure in the source data is extracted using novel approaches from the framework of deep end-to-end causal inference, thereby enabling the creation of a semantic representation that is causally invariant, which in turn helps generalize the learned knowledge of the system to unseen scenarios. The CSC decoder at the receiver is designed to extract and estimate semantic information while ensuring high semantic reliability. The receiver control policies, semantic decoder, and causal inference are formulated as a bi-level optimization problem within a variational inference framework. This problem is solved using a novel concept called network state models, inspired from world models in generative AI, that faithfully represents the environment dynamics leading to data generation. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed CSC system outperforms state-of-the-art SC systems by achieving better semantic reliability and reduced semantic representation. ",

    "abstract": "The emerging social network platforms enable users to share their own opinions, as well as to exchange opinions with others. However, adversarial network perturbation, where malicious users intentionally spread their extreme opinions, rumors, and misinformation to others, is ubiquitous in social networks. Such adversarial network perturbation greatly influences the opinion formation of the public and threatens our societies. Thus, it is critical to study and control the influence of adversarial network perturbation. Although tremendous efforts have been made in both academia and industry to guide and control the public opinion dynamics, most of these works assume that the network is static, and ignore such adversarial network perturbation. In this work, based on the well-accepted Friedkin-Johnsen opinion dynamics model, we model the adversarial network perturbation and analyze its impact on the networks' opinion. Then, from the adversary's perspective, we analyze its optimal network perturbation, which maximally changes the network's opinion. Next, from the network defender's perspective, we formulate a Stackelberg game and aim to control the network's opinion even under such adversarial network perturbation. We devise a projected subgradient algorithm to solve the formulated Stackelberg game. Extensive simulations on real social networks validate our analysis of the adversarial network perturbation's influence and the effectiveness of the proposed opinion control algorithm. ",

While O-RAN harbors the potential to revolutionize cellular access networks, the absence of an open platform for use case prototyping has served as an impediment to its widespread adoption. The situation is further compounded by the fact that O-RAN's flagship use case, network slicing, presents a rigid dichotomy. On the one hand, systems research in the slicing domain is largely centered around LTE, while, on the other hand, 3GPP slicing specifications exclusively cater to 5G Standalone (SA). From a practical standpoint, most commercial networks today use a mix of 4G, 5G NSA (Non-standalone), and 5G SA, necessitating the need for solutions across all radio access technologies (RATs). With a view to addressing these challenges, this paper introduces HexRAN, a first of its kind purpose-built multi-RAT O-RAN compliant access network. Key highlights of HexRAN include support for LTE, 5G NSA, and 5G SA with full disaggregation, a novel Programmable Protocol-level API repository, a multi-RAT RAN slicing framework, a modular and extensible E2 Agent, and a new O-RAN service model in support of slicing. Furthermore, the paper also includes a comprehensive system evaluation addressing the key themes of scalability and disaggregation, the slicing framework's impact, and system performance. The results thus obtained showcase that not only is HexRAN the most feature-complete RAN platform to date, it also offers a significant performance advantage over the prior art. ",

    "abstract": "Auxiliary tasks improve the representations learned by deep reinforcement learning agents. Analytically, their effect is reasonably well understood; in practice, however, their primary use remains in support of a main learning objective, rather than as a method for learning representations. This is perhaps surprising given that many auxiliary tasks are defined procedurally, and hence can be treated as an essentially infinite source of information about the environment. Based on this observation, we study the effectiveness of auxiliary tasks for learning rich representations, focusing on the setting where the number of tasks and the size of the agent's network are simultaneously increased. For this purpose, we derive a new family of auxiliary tasks based on the successor measure. These tasks are easy to implement and have appealing theoretical properties. Combined with a suitable off-policy learning rule, the result is a representation learning algorithm that can be understood as extending Mahadevan & Maggioni (2007)'s proto-value functions to deep reinforcement learning -- accordingly, we call the resulting object proto-value networks. Through a series of experiments on the Arcade Learning Environment, we demonstrate that proto-value networks produce rich features that may be used to obtain performance comparable to established algorithms, using only linear approximation and a small number (~4M) of interactions with the environment's reward function.

    "abstract": "Growing heterogeneity and configurability in HPC architectures has made auto-tuning applications and runtime parameters on these systems very complex. Users are presented with a multitude of options to configure parameters. In addition to application specific solutions, a common approach is to use general purpose search strategies, which often might not identify the best configurations or their time to convergence is a significant barrier. There is, thus, a need for a general purpose and efficient tuning approach that can be easily scaled and adapted to various tuning tasks. We propose a technique for tuning parallel code regions that is general enough to be adapted to multiple tasks. In this paper, we analyze IR-based programming models to make task-specific performance optimizations. To this end, we propose the Multimodal Graph Neural Network and Autoencoder (MGA) tuner, a multimodal deep learning based approach that adapts Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks and Denoizing Autoencoders for modeling IR-based code representations that serve as separate modalities. This approach is used as part of our pipeline to model a syntax, semantics, and structure-aware IR-based code representation for tuning parallel code regions/kernels. We extensively experiment on OpenMP and OpenCL code regions/kernels obtained from PolyBench, Rodinia, STREAM, DataRaceBench, AMD SDK, NPB, NVIDIA SDK, Parboil, SHOC, and LULESH benchmarks. We apply our multimodal learning techniques to the tasks of i) optimizing the number of threads, scheduling policy and chunk size in OpenMP loops and, ii) identifying the best device for heterogeneous device mapping of OpenCL kernels. Our experiments show that this multimodal learning based approach outperforms the state-of-the-art in all experiments. ",

To this end, we propose a novel two-part transformer network that aims to achieve high-quality, controllable motion synthesis results in real-time. Our network separates the skeleton into the upper and lower body parts, reducing the expensive cross-part fusion operations, and models the motions of each part separately through two streams of auto-regressive modules formed by multi-head attention layers. However, such a design might not sufficiently capture the correlations between the parts. We thus intentionally let the two parts share the features of the root joint and design a consistency loss to penalize the difference in the estimated root features and motions by these two auto-regressive modules, significantly improving the quality of synthesized motions. After training on our motion dataset, our network can synthesize a wide range of heterogeneous motions, like cartwheels and twists. Experimental and user study results demonstrate that our network is superior to state-of-the-art human motion synthesis networks in the quality of generated motions. ",

    "abstract": "In recent years, the demand for mapping construction sites or buildings using light detection and ranging~(LiDAR) sensors has been increased to model environments for efficient site management. However, it is observed that sometimes LiDAR-based approaches diverge in narrow and confined environments, such as spiral stairs and corridors, caused by fixed parameters regardless of the changes in the environments. That is, the parameters of LiDAR (-inertial) odometry are mostly set for open space; thus, if the same parameters suitable for the open space are applied in a corridor-like scene, it results in divergence of odometry methods, which is referred to as \\textit{degeneracy}. To tackle this degeneracy problem, we propose a robust LiDAR inertial odometry called \\textit{AdaLIO}, which employs an adaptive parameter setting strategy. To this end, we first check the degeneracy by checking whether the surroundings are corridor-like environments. If so, the parameters relevant to voxelization and normal vector estimation are adaptively changed to increase the number of correspondences. As verified in a public dataset, our proposed method showed promising performance in narrow and cramped environments, avoiding the degeneracy problem. ",

Previous works infer manipulation relationship by deep neural network trained with data collected from a predefined view, which has limitation in visual dislocation in unstructured environments. Multi-view data provide more comprehensive information in space, while a challenge of multi-view MRD is domain shift. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-view fusion framework, namely multi-view MRD network (MMRDN), which is trained by 2D and 3D multi-view data. We project the 2D data from different views into a common hidden space and fit the embeddings with a set of Von-Mises-Fisher distributions to learn the consistent representations. Besides, taking advantage of position information within the 3D data, we select a set of $K$ Maximum Vertical Neighbors (KMVN) points from the point cloud of each object pair, which encodes the relative position of these two objects. Finally, the features of multi-view 2D and 3D data are concatenated to predict the pairwise relationship of objects. Experimental results on the challenging REGRAD dataset show that MMRDN outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in multi-view MRD tasks. The results also demonstrate that our model trained by synthetic data is capable to transfer to real-world scenarios. ",

Effective detection of surface cracks is significant for damage evaluation and structure maintenance. In recent years, the emergence and development of deep learning techniques have shown great potential to facilitate surface crack detection. Currently, most reported tasks were performed by a convolutional neural network (CNN), while the limitation of CNN may be improved by the transformer architecture introduced recently. In this study, we investigated nine promising models to evaluate their performance in pavement surface crack detection by model accuracy, computational complexity, and model stability. We created 711 images of 224 by 224 pixels with crack labels, selected an optimal loss function, compared the evaluation metrics of the validation dataset and test dataset, analyzed the data details, and checked the segmentation outcomes of each model. We find that transformer-based models generally are easier to converge during the training process and have higher accuracy, but usually exhibit more memory consumption and low processing efficiency. Among nine models, SwinUNet outperforms the other two transformers and shows the highest accuracy among nine models. The results should shed light on surface crack detection by various deep-learning models and provide a guideline for future applications in this field. ",

It models the historical information without depending on entity representation. Specifically, DaeMon uses path memory to record the temporal path information derived from path aggregation unit across timeline considering the memory passing strategy between adjacent timestamps.

    "abstract": "Streaming graphs are drawing increasing attention in both academic and industrial communities as many graphs in real applications evolve over time. Continuous subgraph matching (shorted as CSM) aims to report the incremental matches of a query graph in such streaming graphs. It involves two major steps, i.e., candidate maintenance and incremental match generation, to answer CSM. Throughout the course of continuous subgraph matching, incremental match generation backtracking over the search space dominates the total cost. However, most previous approaches focus on developing techniques for efficient candidate maintenance, while incremental match generation receives less attention despite its importance in CSM. Aiming to minimize the overall cost, we propose two techniques to reduce backtrackings in this paper. We present a cost-effective index CaLiG that yields tighter candidate maintenance, shrinking the search space of backtracking. In addition, we develop a novel incremental matching paradigm KSS that decomposes the query vertices into conditional kernel vertices and shell vertices. With the matches of kernel vertices, the incremental matches can be produced immediately by joining the candidates of shell vertices without any backtrackings. Benefiting from reduced backtrackings, the elapsed time of CSM decreases significantly. Extensive experiments over real graphs show that our method runs faster than the state-of-the-art algorithm orders of magnitude. ",

    "abstract": "Estimating the layout of a room from a single-shot panoramic image is important in virtual/augmented reality and furniture layout simulation. This involves identifying three-dimensional (3D) geometry, such as the location of corners and boundaries, and performing 3D reconstruction. However, occlusion is a common issue that can negatively impact room layout estimation, and this has not been thoroughly studied to date. It is possible to obtain 3D shape information of rooms as drawings of buildings and coordinates of corners from image datasets, thus we propose providing both 2D panoramic and 3D information to a model to effectively deal with occlusion. However, simply feeding 3D information to a model is not sufficient to utilize the shape information for an occluded area. Therefore, we improve the model by introducing 3D Intersection over Union (IoU) loss to effectively use 3D information. In some cases, drawings are not available or the construction deviates from a drawing. Considering such practical cases, we propose a method for distilling knowledge from a model trained with both images and 3D information to a model that takes only images as input. The proposed model, which is called Shape-Net, achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on benchmark datasets. We also confirmed its effectiveness in dealing with occlusion through significantly improved accuracy on images with occlusion compared with existing models. ",

This topic is challenged since air pollution varies in a spatiotemporal manner and depends on many complicated factors. Our previous research has solved the problem by considering the whole city as an image and leveraged a Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (ConvLSTM) model to learn the spatiotemporal features. However, an image-based representation may not be ideal as air pollution and other impact factors have natural graph structures. In this research, we argue that a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) can efficiently represent the spatial features of air quality readings in the whole city. Specially, we extend the ConvLSTM model to a Spatiotemporal Graph Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network (Spatiotemporal GCRNN) model by tightly integrating a GCN architecture into an RNN structure for efficient learning spatiotemporal characteristics of air quality values and their influential factors. Our extensive experiments prove the proposed model has a better performance compare to the state-of-the-art ConvLSTM model for air pollution predicting while the number of parameters is much smaller. Moreover, our approach is also superior to a hybrid GCN-based method in a real-world air pollution dataset. ",

In landscapes with complex geometry such as urban environment, vertical information turn out to be a very useful knowledge not only to highlight changes but also to classify them into different categories. In this paper, we focus on change segmentation directly using raw 3D point clouds (PCs), to avoid any loss of information due to rasterization processes. While deep learning has recently proved its effectiveness for this particular task by encoding the information through Siamese networks, we investigate here the idea of also using change information in early steps of deep networks. To do this, we first propose to provide the Siamese KPConv State-of-The-Art (SoTA) network with hand-crafted features and especially a change-related one. This improves the mean of Intersection over Union (IoU) over classes of change by 4.70\\%. Considering that the major improvement was obtained thanks to the change-related feature, we propose three new architectures to address 3D PCs change segmentation: OneConvFusion, Triplet KPConv, and Encoder Fusion SiamKPConv. All the three networks take into account change information in early steps and outperform SoTA methods. In particular, the last network, entitled Encoder Fusion SiamKPConv, overtakes SoTA with more than 5% of mean of IoU over classes of change emphasizing the value of having the network focus on change information for change detection task.

The method enables global optimization for a novel class of optimization problems, with high relevance in application areas such as image processing and computer vision.

While our proposed method has the same theoretical asymptotic time complexity, we demonstrate that is substantially more efficient in practice. Even for small problems, we observe a speedup of 4-5 orders of magnitude. This reduction in computation time makes the Malmberg-Ciesielski method a viable option for many practical applications. ",

As smart contracts become increasingly popular and carry trillion dollars worth of digital assets, they become more of an appealing target for attackers, who have exploited vulnerabilities in smart contracts to cause catastrophic economic losses. Notwithstanding a proliferation of work that has been developed to detect an impressive list of vulnerabilities, the bad randomness vulnerability is overlooked by many existing tools. In this paper, we make the first attempt to provide a systematic analysis of random numbers in Ethereum smart contracts, by investigating the principles behind pseudo-random number generation and organizing them into a taxonomy. We also lucubrate various attacks against bad random numbers and group them into four categories. Furthermore, we present RNVulDet - a tool that incorporates taint analysis techniques to automatically identify bad randomness vulnerabilities and detect corresponding attack transactions. To extensively verify the effectiveness of RNVulDet, we construct three new datasets: i) 34 well-known contracts that are reported to possess bad randomness vulnerabilities, ii) 214 popular contracts that have been rigorously audited before launch and are regarded as free of bad randomness vulnerabilities, and iii) a dataset consisting of 47,668 smart contracts and 49,951 suspicious transactions. We compare RNVulDet with three state-of-the-art smart contract vulnerability detectors, and our tool significantly outperforms them. Meanwhile, RNVulDet spends 2.98s per contract on average, in most cases orders-of-magnitude faster than other tools. RNVulDet successfully reveals 44,264 attack transactions. Our implementation and datasets are released, hoping to inspire others. ",

In this paper, we study the problem of generating the k-hop-constrained s-t simple path graph, i.e., the subgraph consisting of all simple paths from vertex s to vertex t of length no larger than k. To our best knowledge, we are the first to formalize this problem and prove its NP-hardness on directed graphs. To tackle this challenging problem, we propose an efficient algorithm named EVE, which exploits the paradigm of edge-wise examination rather than exhaustively enumerating all paths. Powered by essential vertices appearing in all simple paths between vertex pairs, EVE distinguishes the edges that are definitely (or not) contained in the desired simple path graph, producing a tight upper-bound graph in the time cost $\\mathcal{O}(k^2|E|)$. Each remaining undetermined edge is further verified to deliver the exact answer. Extensive experiments are conducted on 15 real networks. The results show that EVE significantly outperforms all baselines by several orders of magnitude. Moreover, by taking EVE as a built-in block, state-of-the-art for hop-constrained simple path enumeration can be accelerated by up to an order of magnitude. ",

    "abstract": "With increasing complexity of modern communication systems, machine learning algorithms have become a focal point of research. However, performance demands have tightened in parallel to complexity. For some of the key applications targeted by future wireless, such as the medical field, strict and reliable performance guarantees are essential, but vanilla machine learning methods have been shown to struggle with these types of requirements. Therefore, the question is raised whether these methods can be extended to better deal with the demands imposed by such applications. In this paper, we look at a combinatorial resource allocation challenge with rare, significant events which must be handled properly. We propose to treat this as a multi-task learning problem, select two methods from this domain, Elastic Weight Consolidation and Gradient Episodic Memory, and integrate them into a vanilla actor-critic scheduler. We compare their performance in dealing with Black Swan Events with the state-of-the-art of augmenting the training data distribution and report that the multi-task approach proves highly effective.

    "abstract": "With the expansion of mobile communications infrastructure and the resulting proliferation of smartphones, social media usage in the Global South is surging with Twitter fast becoming an important platform. In this paper, we present what to our knowledge is the first data set of a Twitter landscape in an African country that is beset by conflict. In particular, we provide a comprehensive data base to explore Twitter usage in Mali, a west African country that until recently has had a relatively precarious media ecology. Mali has since 2012 been affected by an intersection of armed conflicts, often between different ethnic and religious groups. We collected the database in 2022, in a period when the Malian conflict became more violent, both internally and towards external, international actors. We assume that this context influences the ways in which people access social media, and therefore the shape of the Twittersphere and its characteristics. Hence our aim is to primarily invite researchers from various disciplines including complex networks and social sciences scholars to further explore these characteristics. The given snapshot of the Malian Twitter follower network, contains 7M accounts with 56K accounts clearly identifiable as Malian, a figure that coincides with official numbers. In addition, we present the tweets. Both are attached to the data set. The dataset is available at https://osf.io/XXX (available after review). The corresponding hydrate scripts are available at https: //github.com/XXX (available after review). ",

In recent years, pre-trained large language models have been quite effective for computing such representations. These models produce high-dimensional sentence embeddings. An evident performance gap between large and small models exists in practice. Hence, due to space and time hardware limitations, there is a need to attain comparable results when using the smaller model, which is usually a distilled version of the large language model. In this paper, we assess the model distillation of the sentence representation model Sentence-BERT by augmenting the pre-trained distilled model with a projection layer additionally learned on the Maximum Coding Rate Reduction (MCR2)objective, a novel approach developed for general-purpose manifold clustering. We demonstrate that the new language model with reduced complexity and sentence embedding size can achieve comparable results on semantic retrieval benchmarks. ",

    "abstract": "In recent years, differential privacy has emerged as the de facto standard for sharing statistics of datasets while limiting the disclosure of private information about the involved individuals. This is achieved by randomly perturbing the statistics to be published, which in turn leads to a privacy-accuracy trade-off: larger perturbations provide stronger privacy guarantees, but they result in less accurate statistics that offer lower utility to the recipients. Of particular interest are therefore optimal mechanisms that provide the highest accuracy for a pre-selected level of privacy. To date, work in this area has focused on specifying families of perturbations a priori and subsequently proving their asymptotic and/or best-in-class optimality. In this paper, we develop a class of mechanisms that enjoy non-asymptotic and unconditional optimality guarantees. To this end, we formulate the mechanism design problem as an infinite-dimensional distributionally robust optimization problem. We show that the problem affords a strong dual, and we exploit this duality to develop converging hierarchies of finite-dimensional upper and lower bounding problems. Our upper (primal) bounds correspond to implementable perturbations whose suboptimality can be bounded by our lower (dual) bounds. Both bounding problems can be solved within seconds via cutting plane techniques that exploit the inherent problem structure. Our numerical experiments demonstrate that our perturbations can outperform the previously best results from the literature on artificial as well as standard benchmark problems. ",

Watermark image is static and stays on the screen all the time thus watermark present on every captured photograph of the screen. The key components of the approach are three neural networks. The first network generates an image with embedded message in a way that this image is almost invisible when displayed on the screen. The other two neural networks are used to retrieve embedded message with high accuracy. Developed method was comprehensively tested on different screen and cameras.

    "abstract": "Although both self-supervised single-frame and multi-frame depth estimation methods only require unlabeled monocular videos for training, the information they leverage varies because single-frame methods mainly rely on appearance-based features while multi-frame methods focus on geometric cues. Considering the complementary information of single-frame and multi-frame methods, some works attempt to leverage single-frame depth to improve multi-frame depth. However, these methods can neither exploit the difference between single-frame depth and multi-frame depth to improve multi-frame depth nor leverage multi-frame depth to optimize single-frame depth models. To fully utilize the mutual influence between single-frame and multi-frame methods, we propose a novel self-supervised training framework. Specifically, we first introduce a pixel-wise adaptive depth sampling module guided by single-frame depth to train the multi-frame model. Then, we leverage the minimum reprojection based distillation loss to transfer the knowledge from the multi-frame depth network to the single-frame network to improve single-frame depth. Finally, we regard the improved single-frame depth as a prior to further boost the performance of multi-frame depth estimation. Experimental results on the KITTI and Cityscapes datasets show that our method outperforms existing approaches in the self-supervised monocular setting. ",

However, these sparse neural retrievers have been shown to increase the computational costs and latency of query processing compared to their classical counterparts. To mitigate this, we apply a well-known family of techniques for boosting the efficiency of query processing over inverted indexes: static pruning. We experiment with three static pruning strategies, namely document-centric, term-centric and agnostic pruning, and we assess, over diverse datasets, that these techniques still work with sparse neural retrievers. In particular, static pruning achieves $2\\times$ speedup with negligible effectiveness loss ($\\leq 2\\%$ drop) and, depending on the use case, even $4\\times$ speedup with minimal impact on the effectiveness ($\\leq 8\\%$ drop). Moreover, we show that neural rerankers are robust to candidates from statically pruned indexes. ",

Despite their success, the stability of the fixed points for these models remains poorly understood. Recently, Lyapunov theory has been applied to Neural ODEs, another type of implicit layer model, to confer adversarial robustness. By considering DEQ models as nonlinear dynamic systems, we propose a robust DEQ model named LyaDEQ with guaranteed provable stability via Lyapunov theory. The crux of our method is ensuring the fixed points of the DEQ models are Lyapunov stable, which enables the LyaDEQ models to resist the minor initial perturbations. To avoid poor adversarial defense due to Lyapunov-stable fixed points being located near each other, we add an orthogonal fully connected layer after the Lyapunov stability module to separate different fixed points. We evaluate LyaDEQ models on several widely used datasets under well-known adversarial attacks, and experimental results demonstrate significant improvement in robustness. Furthermore, we show that the LyaDEQ model can be combined with other defense methods, such as adversarial training, to achieve even better adversarial robustness. ",

    "abstract": "Sepsis is a syndrome that develops in response to the presence of infection. It is characterized by severe organ dysfunction and is one of the leading causes of mortality in Intensive Care Units (ICUs) worldwide. These complications can be reduced through early application of antibiotics, hence the ability to anticipate the onset of sepsis early is crucial to the survival and well-being of patients. Current machine learning algorithms deployed inside medical infrastructures have demonstrated poor performance and are insufficient for anticipating sepsis onset early. In recent years, deep learning methodologies have been proposed to predict sepsis, but some fail to capture the time of onset (e.g., classifying patients' entire visits as developing sepsis or not) and others are unrealistic to be deployed into medical facilities (e.g., creating training instances using a fixed time to onset where the time of onset needs to be known apriori). Therefore, in this paper, we first propose a novel but realistic prediction framework that predicts each morning whether sepsis onset will occur within the next 24 hours using data collected at night, when patient-provider ratios are higher due to cross-coverage resulting in limited observation to each patient. However, as we increase the prediction rate into daily, the number of negative instances will increase while that of positive ones remain the same. Thereafter, we have a severe class imbalance problem, making a machine learning model hard to capture rare sepsis cases. To address this problem, we propose to do nightly profile representation learning (NPRL) for each patient. We prove that NPRL can theoretically alleviate the rare event problem. Our empirical study using data from a level-1 trauma center further demonstrates the effectiveness of our proposal. ",

To solve this problem, we propose LIRF to aggregate the information from conical frustums to construct a ray. Given 3D positions within conical frustums, LIRF takes 3D coordinates and the features of conical frustums as inputs and predicts a local volumetric radiance field. Since the coordinates are continuous, LIRF renders high-quality novel views at a continuously-valued scale via volume rendering. Besides, we predict the visible weights for each input view via transformer-based feature matching to improve the performance in occluded areas. Experimental results on real-world scenes validate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods on novel view rendering of unseen scenes at arbitrary scales. ",

Although NA methods have achieved remarkable success in a myriad of scenarios, their effectiveness is not without additional information such as prior anchor links and/or node features, which may not always be available due to privacy concerns or access restrictions. To tackle this practical challenge, we propose Grad-Align+, a novel NA method built upon a recent state-of-the-art NA method, the so-called Grad-Align, that gradually discovers only a part of node pairs until all node pairs are found. In designing Grad-Align+, we account for how to augment node features in the sense of performing the NA task and how to design our NA method by maximally exploiting the augmented node features. To achieve this goal, we develop Grad-Align+ consisting of three key components: 1) centrality-based node feature augmentation (CNFA), 2) graph neural network (GNN)-aided embedding similarity calculation alongside the augmented node features, and 3) gradual NA with similarity calculation using the information of aligned cross-network neighbor-pairs (ACNs). Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that Grad-Align+ exhibits (a) the superiority over benchmark NA methods by a large margin, (b) empirical validations as well as our theoretical findings to see the effectiveness of CNFA, (c) the influence of each component, (d) the robustness to network noises, and (e) the computational efficiency.

Agents reside on graph vertices, where each stimulus is only recognized locally, and agents communicate via token passing along edges to alert other agents to transition to an \"aware\" state when stimuli are present and an \"unaware\" state when the stimuli disappear. We present an Adaptive Stimuli Algorithm that is robust to competing waves of messages as multiple stimuli change, possibly adversarially. Moreover, in addition to handling arbitrary stimulus dynamics, the algorithm can handle agents reconfiguring the connections (edges) of the graph over time in a controlled way. As an application, we show how this Adaptive Stimuli Algorithm on reconfigurable graphs can be used to solve the foraging problem, where food sources may be discovered, removed, or shifted at arbitrary times. We would like the agents to consistently self-organize using only local interactions, such that if the food remains in position long enough, the agents transition to a gather phase, collectively forming a single large component with small perimeter around the food. Alternatively, if no food source has existed recently, the agents should self-induce a switch to a search phase in which they distribute themselves randomly throughout the lattice region to search for food. Unlike previous approaches to foraging, this process is indefinitely repeatable. Like a physical phase change, microscopic changes such as the deletion or addition of a single food source triggers these macroscopic, system-wide transitions as agents share information about the environment and respond locally to get the desired collective response.

We propose a systematic method, called `Expand-and-Cluster' that needs only the number of hidden layers and the activation function of the probed ANN to identify all network parameters. In the expansion phase, we train a series of student networks of increasing size using the probed data of the ANN as a teacher. Expansion stops when a minimal loss is consistently reached in student networks of a given size. In the clustering phase, weight vectors of the expanded students are clustered, which allows structured pruning of superfluous neurons in a principled way. We find that an overparameterization of a factor four is sufficient to reliably identify the minimal number of neurons and to retrieve the original network parameters in $80\\%$ of tasks across a family of 150 toy problems of variable difficulty. Furthermore, a teacher network trained on MNIST data can be identified with less than $5\\%$ overhead in the neuron number. Thus, while direct training of a student network with a size identical to that of the teacher is practically impossible because of the non-convex loss function, training with mild overparameterization followed by clustering and structured pruning correctly identifies the target network.

Channel estimation and signal detection have been investigated according to the space division characteristics of the structure. Firstly, we adopt the balanced structure on the pilot matrix, analyze the channel estimation mean square error (MSE), and optimize the structure parameters. Then, with the estimated parameters, an analytical threshold detection rule is proposed as a preliminary work of multiuser detection. The detection rule can be optimized by analyzing the separability of two users based on the Gaussian approximation of Poisson weighted sum. To assess the effect of imperfect estimation, the sensitivity analysis of channel estimation error on two-user signal detection is performed. Moreover, we propose a successive elimination method for on-off keying (OOK) modulated multiuser symbol detection based on the previous threshold detection rule. A closed-form upper bound on the detection error rate is calculated, which turns out to be a good approximation of that of multiuser maximum-likelihood (ML) detection. The proposed successive elimination method is twenty times faster than the ML detection with negligible detection error rate degradation. ",

    "abstract": "Acquiring driving policies that can transfer to unseen environments is challenging when driving in dense traffic flows. The design of traffic flow is essential and previous studies are unable to balance interaction and safety-criticism. To tackle this problem, we propose a socially adversarial traffic flow. We propose a Contextual Partially-Observable Stochastic Game to model traffic flow and assign Social Value Orientation (SVO) as context. We then adopt a two-stage framework. In Stage 1, each agent in our socially-aware traffic flow is driven by a hierarchical policy where upper-level policy communicates genuine SVOs of all agents, which the lower-level policy takes as input. In Stage 2, each agent in the socially adversarial traffic flow is driven by the hierarchical policy where upper-level communicates mistaken SVOs, taken by the lower-level policy trained in Stage 1. Driving policy is adversarially trained through a zero-sum game formulation with upper-level policies, resulting in a policy with enhanced zero-shot transfer capability to unseen traffic flows. Comprehensive experiments on cross-validation verify the superior zero-shot transfer performance of our method. ",

    "abstract": "Guided sampling is a vital approach for applying diffusion models in real-world tasks that embeds human-defined guidance during the sampling procedure. This paper considers a general setting where the guidance is defined by an (unnormalized) energy function. The main challenge for this setting is that the intermediate guidance during the diffusion sampling procedure, which is jointly defined by the sampling distribution and the energy function, is unknown and is hard to estimate. To address this challenge, we propose an exact formulation of the intermediate guidance as well as a novel training objective named contrastive energy prediction (CEP) to learn the exact guidance. Our method is guaranteed to converge to the exact guidance under unlimited model capacity and data samples, while previous methods can not. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by applying it to offline reinforcement learning (RL). Extensive experiments on D4RL benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art algorithms. We also provide some examples of applying CEP for image synthesis to demonstrate the scalability of CEP on high-dimensional data. ",

    "abstract": "Reducing the memory footprint of Machine Learning (ML) models, particularly Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), is essential to enable their deployment into resource-constrained tiny devices. However, a disadvantage of DNN models is their vulnerability to adversarial attacks, as they can be fooled by adding slight perturbations to the inputs. Therefore, the challenge is how to create accurate, robust, and tiny DNN models deployable on resource-constrained embedded devices. This paper reports the results of devising a tiny DNN model, robust to adversarial black and white box attacks, trained with an automatic quantizationaware training framework, i.e. QKeras, with deep quantization loss accounted in the learning loop, thereby making the designed DNNs more accurate for deployment on tiny devices. We investigated how QKeras and an adversarial robustness technique, Jacobian Regularization (JR), can provide a co-optimization strategy by exploiting the DNN topology and the per layer JR approach to produce robust yet tiny deeply quantized DNN models. As a result, a new DNN model implementing this cooptimization strategy was conceived, developed and tested on three datasets containing both images and audio inputs, as well as compared its performance with existing benchmarks against various white-box and black-box attacks. Experimental results demonstrated that on average our proposed DNN model resulted in 8.3% and 79.5% higher accuracy than MLCommons/Tiny benchmarks in the presence of white-box and black-box attacks on the CIFAR-10 image dataset and a subset of the Google Speech Commands audio dataset respectively. It was also 6.5% more accurate for black-box attacks on the SVHN image dataset. ",

Theoretically, the optimal MIMO detector is the maximum-likelihood (ML) MIMO detector; however, due to its extremely high complexity, it is not feasible for large real-world communication systems. Over the past few years, algorithms based on physics-inspired Ising solvers, like Coherent Ising machines and Quantum Annealers, have shown significant performance improvements for the MIMO detection problem. However, the current state-of-the-art is limited to low-order modulations or systems with few users. In this paper, we propose an adaptive multi-stage Ising machine-based MIMO detector that extends the performance gains of physics-inspired computation to Large and Massive MIMO systems with a large number of users and very high modulation schemes~(up to 256-QAM). We enhance our previously proposed delta Ising formulation and develop a heuristic that adaptively optimizes the performance and complexity of our proposed method. We perform extensive micro-benchmarking to optimize several free parameters of the system and evaluate our methods' BER and spectral efficiency for Large and Massive MIMO systems (up to 32 users and 256 QAM modulation).

    "abstract": "In recent years, Local Differential Privacy (LDP), a robust privacy-preserving methodology, has gained widespread adoption in real-world applications. With LDP, users can perturb their data on their devices before sending it out for analysis. However, as the collection of multiple sensitive information becomes more prevalent across various industries, collecting a single sensitive attribute under LDP may not be sufficient. Correlated attributes in the data may still lead to inferences about the sensitive attribute. This paper empirically studies the impact of collecting multiple sensitive attributes under LDP on fairness. We propose a novel privacy budget allocation scheme that considers the varying domain size of sensitive attributes. This generally led to a better privacy-utility-fairness trade-off in our experiments than the state-of-art solution. Our results show that LDP leads to slightly improved fairness in learning problems without significantly affecting the performance of the models. We conduct extensive experiments evaluating three benchmark datasets using several group fairness metrics and seven state-of-the-art LDP protocols. Overall, this study challenges the common belief that differential privacy necessarily leads to worsened fairness in machine learning. ",

    "abstract": "Machine learning (ML), including deep learning, has recently gained tremendous popularity in a wide range of applications. However, like traditional software, ML applications are not immune to the bugs that result from programming errors. Explicit programming errors usually manifest through error messages and stack traces. These stack traces describe the chain of function calls that lead to an anomalous situation, or exception. Indeed, these exceptions may cross the entire software stack (including applications and libraries). Thus, studying the patterns in stack traces can help practitioners and researchers understand the causes of exceptions in ML applications and the challenges faced by ML developers. To that end, we mine Stack Overflow (SO) and study 11,449 stack traces related to seven popular Python ML libraries. First, we observe that ML questions that contain stack traces gain more popularity than questions without stack traces; however, they are less likely to get accepted answers. Second, we observe that recurrent patterns exists in ML stack traces, even across different ML libraries, with a small portion of patterns covering many stack traces. Third, we derive five high-level categories and 25 low-level types from the stack trace patterns: most patterns are related to python basic syntax, model training, parallelization, data transformation, and subprocess invocation. Furthermore, the patterns related to subprocess invocation, external module execution, and remote API call are among the least likely to get accepted answers on SO. Our findings provide insights for researchers, ML library providers, and ML application developers to improve the quality of ML libraries and their applications. ",

Until recently, most of research works focused on API-based attacks that consider a ML model as a pure algorithmic abstraction. However, new implementation-based threats have been revealed, emphasizing the urgency to propose both practical and simulation-based methods to properly evaluate the robustness of models. A major concern is parameter-based attacks (such as the Bit-Flip Attack, BFA) that highlight the lack of robustness of typical deep neural network models when confronted by accurate and optimal alterations of their internal parameters stored in memory. Setting in a security testing purpose, this work practically reports, for the first time, a successful variant of the BFA on a 32-bit Cortex-M microcontroller using laser fault injection. It is a standard fault injection means for security evaluation, that enables to inject spatially and temporally accurate faults. To avoid unrealistic brute-force strategies, we show how simulations help selecting the most sensitive set of bits from the parameters taking into account the laser fault model. ",

However, we find evidence-aware detection models suffer from biases, i.e., spurious correlations between news/evidence contents and true/fake news labels, and are hard to be generalized to Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) situations. To deal with this, we propose a novel Dual Adversarial Learning (DAL) approach. We incorporate news-aspect and evidence-aspect debiasing discriminators, whose targets are both true/fake news labels, in DAL. Then, DAL reversely optimizes news-aspect and evidence-aspect debiasing discriminators to mitigate the impact of news and evidence content biases. At the same time, DAL also optimizes the main fake news predictor, so that the news-evidence interaction module can be learned. This process allows us to teach evidence-aware fake news detection models to better conduct news-evidence reasoning, and minimize the impact of content biases. To be noted, our proposed DAL approach is a plug-and-play module that works well with existing backbones. We conduct comprehensive experiments under two OOD settings, and plug DAL in four evidence-aware fake news detection backbones. Results demonstrate that, DAL significantly and stably outperforms the original backbones and some competitive debiasing methods. ",

The fundamental properties of semantic networks must be taken into account when designing NLP algorithms, yet they remain to be structurally investigated. We study the properties of semantic networks from ConceptNet, defined by 7 semantic relations from 11 different languages. We find that semantic networks have universal basic properties: they are sparse, highly clustered, and exhibit power-law degree distributions. Our findings show that the majority of the considered networks are scale-free. Some networks exhibit language-specific properties determined by grammatical rules, for example networks from highly inflected languages, such as e.g. Latin, German, French and Spanish, show peaks in the degree distribution that deviate from a power law. We find that depending on the semantic relation type and the language, the link formation in semantic networks is guided by different principles. In some networks the connections are similarity-based, while in others the connections are more complementarity-based. Finally, we demonstrate how knowledge of similarity and complementarity in semantic networks can improve NLP algorithms in missing link inference. ",

This form of robustness is particularly challenging as it involves a trade-off between the robustness of the counterfactual and the proximity with the example to explain.

This allows to interpret the effect of each learnable parameter and study achievable deformations. With this, we perform geometric editing: finding a parameter update that best approximates a globally prescribed deformation. Prescribing the deformation only locally allows the rest of the shape to change according to some prior, such as semantics or deformation rigidity. Our method is agnostic to the model its training and updates the NN in-place. Furthermore, we show how boundary sensitivity helps to optimize and constrain objectives (such as surface area and volume), which are difficult to compute without first converting to another representation, such as a mesh.

    "abstract": "Human language is full of compositional syntactic structures, and although neural networks have contributed to groundbreaking improvements in computer systems that process language, widely-used neural network architectures still exhibit limitations in their ability to process syntax. To address this issue, prior work has proposed adding stack data structures to neural networks, drawing inspiration from theoretical connections between syntax and stacks. However, these methods employ deterministic stacks that are designed to track one parse at a time, whereas syntactic ambiguity, which requires a nondeterministic stack to parse, is extremely common in language. In this dissertation, we remedy this discrepancy by proposing a method of incorporating nondeterministic stacks into neural networks. We develop a differentiable data structure that efficiently simulates a nondeterministic pushdown automaton, representing an exponential number of computations with a dynamic programming algorithm. We incorporate this module into two predominant architectures: recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and transformers. We show that this raises their formal recognition power to arbitrary context-free languages, and also aids training, even on deterministic context-free languages. Empirically, neural networks with nondeterministic stacks learn context-free languages much more effectively than prior stack-augmented models, including a language with theoretically maximal parsing difficulty.

We demonstrate improvements on natural language modeling and provide analysis on a syntactic generalization benchmark.

    "abstract": "Recently, there are increasing efforts on advancing optical neural networks (ONNs), which bring significant advantages for machine learning (ML) in terms of power efficiency, parallelism, and computational speed. With the considerable benefits in computation speed and energy efficiency, there are significant interests in leveraging ONNs into medical sensing, security screening, drug detection, and autonomous driving. However, due to the challenge of implementing reconfigurability, deploying multi-task learning (MTL) algorithms on ONNs requires re-building and duplicating the physical diffractive systems, which significantly degrades the energy and cost efficiency in practical application scenarios. This work presents a novel ONNs architecture, namely, \\textit{RubikONNs}, which utilizes the physical properties of optical systems to encode multiple feed-forward functions by physically rotating the hardware similarly to rotating a \\textit{Rubik's Cube}. To optimize MTL performance on RubikONNs, two domain-specific physics-aware training algorithms \\textit{RotAgg} and \\textit{RotSeq} are proposed. Our experimental results demonstrate more than 4$\\times$ improvements in energy and cost efficiency with marginal accuracy degradation compared to the state-of-the-art approaches. ",

    "abstract": "Multi-agent Reinforcement learning (MARL) studies the behaviour of multiple learning agents that coexist in a shared environment. MARL is more challenging than single-agent RL because it involves more complex learning dynamics: the observations and rewards of each agent are functions of all other agents. In the context of MARL, Real-Time Strategy (RTS) games represent very challenging environments where multiple players interact simultaneously and control many units of different natures all at once. In fact, RTS games are so challenging for the current RL methods, that just being able to tackle them with RL is interesting. This project provides the end-to-end experience of applying RL in the Lux AI v2 Kaggle competition, where competitors design agents to control variable-sized fleets of units and tackle a multi-variable optimization, resource gathering, and allocation problem in a 1v1 scenario against other competitors. We use a centralized approach for training the RL agents, and report multiple design decisions along the process.

    "abstract": "Nowadays, Presentation Attack Detection is a very active research area. Several databases are constituted in the state-of-the-art using images extracted from videos. One of the main problems identified is that many databases present a low-quality, small image size and do not represent an operational scenario in a real remote biometric system. Currently, these images are captured from smartphones with high-quality and bigger resolutions. In order to increase the diversity of image quality, this work presents a new PAD database based on open-access Flickr images called: \"Flickr-PAD\". Our new hand-made database shows high-quality printed and screen scenarios. This will help researchers to compare new approaches to existing algorithms on a wider database. This database will be available for other researchers. A leave-one-out protocol was used to train and evaluate three PAD models based on MobileNet-V3 (small and large) and EfficientNet-B0. The best result was reached with MobileNet-V3 large with BPCER10 of 7.08% and BPCER20 of 11.15%. ",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we study the problem of semi-supervised 3D object detection, which is of great importance considering the high annotation cost for cluttered 3D indoor scenes. We resort to the robust and principled framework of selfteaching, which has triggered notable progress for semisupervised learning recently. While this paradigm is natural for image-level or pixel-level prediction, adapting it to the detection problem is challenged by the issue of proposal matching. Prior methods are based upon two-stage pipelines, matching heuristically selected proposals generated in the first stage and resulting in spatially sparse training signals. In contrast, we propose the first semisupervised 3D detection algorithm that works in the singlestage manner and allows spatially dense training signals. A fundamental issue of this new design is the quantization error caused by point-to-voxel discretization, which inevitably leads to misalignment between two transformed views in the voxel domain. To this end, we derive and implement closed-form rules that compensate this misalignment onthe-fly. Our results are significant, e.g., promoting ScanNet mAP@0.5 from 35.2% to 48.5% using 20% annotation. Codes and data will be publicly available. ",

    "abstract": "In the field of antibody engineering, an essential task is to design a novel antibody whose paratopes bind to a specific antigen with correct epitopes. Understanding antibody structure and its paratope can facilitate a mechanistic understanding of its function. Therefore, antibody structure prediction from its sequence alone has always been a highly valuable problem for de novo antibody design. AlphaFold2, a breakthrough in the field of structural biology, provides a solution to predict protein structure based on protein sequences and computationally expensive coevolutionary multiple sequence alignments (MSAs). However, the computational efficiency and undesirable prediction accuracy of antibodies, especially on the complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) of antibodies limit their applications in the industrially high-throughput drug design. To learn an informative representation of antibodies, we employed a deep antibody language model (ALM) on curated sequences from the observed antibody space database via a transformer model. We also developed a novel model named xTrimoABFold to predict antibody structure from antibody sequence based on the pretrained ALM as well as efficient evoformers and structural modules. The model was trained end-to-end on the antibody structures in PDB by minimizing the ensemble loss of domain-specific focal loss on CDR and the frame-aligned point loss. xTrimoABFold outperforms AlphaFold2 and other protein language model based SOTAs, e.g., OmegaFold, HelixFold-Single, and IgFold with a large significant margin (30+\\% improvement on RMSD) while performing 151 times faster than AlphaFold2. To the best of our knowledge, xTrimoABFold achieved state-of-the-art antibody structure prediction. Its improvement in both accuracy and efficiency makes it a valuable tool for de novo antibody design and could make further improvements in immuno-theory. ",

    "abstract": "Graph signal processing (GSP) has emerged as a powerful tool for practical network applications, including power system monitoring. By representing power system voltages as smooth graph signals, recent research has focused on developing GSP-based methods for state estimation, attack detection, and topology identification. Included, efficient methods have been developed for detecting false data injection (FDI) attacks, which until now were perceived as non-smooth with respect to the graph Laplacian matrix. Consequently, these methods may not be effective against smooth FDI attacks. In this paper, we propose a graph FDI (GFDI) attack that minimizes the Laplacian-based graph total variation (TV) under practical constraints. In addition, we develop a low-complexity algorithm that solves the non-convex GDFI attack optimization problem using ell_1-norm relaxation, the projected gradient descent (PGD) algorithm, and the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). We then propose a protection scheme that identifies the minimal set of measurements necessary to constrain the GFDI output to high graph TV, thereby enabling its detection by existing GSP-based detectors. Our numerical simulations on the IEEE-57 bus test case reveal the potential threat posed by well-designed GSP-based FDI attacks. Moreover, we demonstrate that integrating the proposed protection design with GSP-based detection can lead to significant hardware cost savings compared to previous designs of protection methods against FDI attacks.

Most techniques have been developed for undirected graphs, and very few exist that handle directed and weighted networks effectively. Here we present such an algorithm based on Voronoi partitionings. As an added benefit, this method can directly employ edge weights that represent lengths, in contrast to algorithms that operate with connection strengths, requiring ad-hoc transformations of length data. We demonstrate the method on inter-areal brain connectivity, air transportation networks, as well as on randomly generated benchmark networks. The algorithm can handle dense graphs where weights are the main factor determining communities. The hierarchical structure of networks can also be detected, as shown for the brain. Its time efficiency is comparable with other state-of-the-art algorithms, the most costly part being Dijkstra's shortest paths algorithm. ",

We introduce a theoretically-grounded framework for emergent organization that, via data-driven algorithms, is constructive in practice. Its building blocks are spacetime lightcones that capture how information propagates across a system through local interactions. We show that predictive equivalence classes of lightcones, local causal states, capture organized behaviors and coherent structures in complex spatiotemporal systems. Using our unsupervised physics-informed machine learning algorithm and a high-performance computing implementation, we demonstrate the applicability of the local causal states for real-world domain science problems. We show that the local causal states capture vortices and their power-law decay behavior in two-dimensional turbulence. We then show that known (hurricanes and atmospheric rivers) and novel extreme weather events can be identified on a pixel-level basis and tracked through time in high-resolution climate data. ",

Inferring the placement of latent nodes in a tree by any optimality criterion (e.g., maximum likelihood) is an NP-hard problem, propelling the development of myriad heuristic approaches. Yet, these heuristics often lack a systematic means of uniformly sampling random trees or effectively exploring a tree space that grows factorially, which are crucial to optimisation problems such as machine learning. Accordingly, we present Phylo2Vec, a new parsimonious representation of a phylogenetic tree. Phylo2Vec maps any binary tree with $n$ leaves to an integer vector of length $n$. We prove that Phylo2Vec is both well-defined and bijective to the space of phylogenetic trees. The advantages of Phylo2Vec are twofold: i) easy uniform sampling of binary trees and ii) systematic ability to traverse tree space in very large or small jumps. As a proof of concept, we use Phylo2Vec for maximum likelihood inference on five real-world datasets and show that a simple hill climbing-based optimisation efficiently traverses the vastness of tree space from a random to an optimal tree.

However, the majority of CAD systems are data-driven but lack of medical prior knowledge which can be performance-friendly. In this regard, we innovatively proposed a human-in-the-loop (HITL) CAD system by leveraging ophthalmologists' eye-tracking information, which is more efficient and accurate. Concretely, the HITL CAD system was implemented on the multiple instance learning (MIL), where eye-tracking gaze maps were beneficial to cherry-pick diagnosis-related instances. Furthermore, the dual-cross-attention MIL (DCAMIL) network was utilized to curb the adverse effects of noisy instances. Meanwhile, both sequence augmentation module and domain adversarial module were introduced to enrich and standardize instances in the training bag, respectively, thereby enhancing the robustness of our method. We conduct comparative experiments on our newly constructed datasets (namely, AMD-Gaze and DR-Gaze), respectively for the AMD and early DR detection. Rigorous experiments demonstrate the feasibility of our HITL CAD system and the superiority of the proposed DCAMIL, fully exploring the ophthalmologists' eye-tracking information. These investigations indicate that physicians' gaze maps, as medical prior knowledge, is potential to contribute to the CAD systems of clinical diseases. ",

Another key idea is training in adversarial settings for foreground segmentation improvement through optimization of the region-based scores. This novel strategy boosts the performance of the segmentation network in terms of the Dice score (and correspondingly Jaccard index) while keeping the number of trainable parameters comparatively low.
