    "abstract": "Unsupervised point cloud shape correspondence aims to obtain dense point-to-point correspondences between point clouds without manually annotated pairs. However, humans and some animals have bilateral symmetry and various orientations, which lead to severe mispredictions of symmetrical parts. Besides, point cloud noise disrupts consistent representations for point cloud and thus degrades the shape correspondence accuracy. To address the above issues, we propose a Self-Ensembling ORientation-aware Network termed SE-ORNet. The key of our approach is to exploit an orientation estimation module with a domain adaptive discriminator to align the orientations of point cloud pairs, which significantly alleviates the mispredictions of symmetrical parts. Additionally, we design a selfensembling framework for unsupervised point cloud shape correspondence. In this framework, the disturbances of point cloud noise are overcome by perturbing the inputs of the student and teacher networks with different data augmentations and constraining the consistency of predictions. Extensive experiments on both human and animal datasets show that our SE-ORNet can surpass state-of-the-art unsupervised point cloud shape correspondence methods. ",

    "abstract": "The transferability of adversarial examples is a crucial aspect of evaluating the robustness of deep learning systems, particularly in black-box scenarios. Although several methods have been proposed to enhance cross-model transferability, little attention has been paid to the transferability of adversarial examples across different tasks. This issue has become increasingly relevant with the emergence of foundational multi-task AI systems such as Visual ChatGPT, rendering the utility of adversarial samples generated by a single task relatively limited. Furthermore, these systems often entail inferential functions beyond mere recognition-like tasks. To address this gap, we propose a novel Visual Relation-based cross-task Adversarial Patch generation method called VRAP, which aims to evaluate the robustness of various visual tasks, especially those involving visual reasoning, such as Visual Question Answering and Image Captioning. VRAP employs scene graphs to combine object recognition-based deception with predicate-based relations elimination, thereby disrupting the visual reasoning information shared among inferential tasks. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that VRAP significantly surpasses previous methods in terms of black-box transferability across diverse visual reasoning tasks. ",

In this research, we attempt to address these problems by learning the joint neural network and hardware features and transferring them to the new target hardware. We extensively study the existing state-of-the-art dataset, TenSet, perform comparative analysis on the test split strategies and propose methodologies to prune the dataset. We adopt an attention-inspired approach for tuning the tensor programs enabling them to embed neural network and hardware-specific features. Our approach could prune the dataset up to 45\\% of the baseline without compromising the Pairwise Comparison Accuracy (PCA).

We exploit these capabilities by developing an efficient recurrent neural network architecture, PixelRNN, that encodes spatio-temporal features on the sensor using purely binary operations. PixelRNN reduces the amount of data to be transmitted off the sensor by a factor of 64x compared to conventional systems while offering competitive accuracy for hand gesture recognition and lip reading tasks. We experimentally validate PixelRNN using a prototype implementation on the SCAMP-5 sensor-processor platform. ",

    "abstract": "The role of uncertainty in data management has become more prominent than ever before, especially because of the growing importance of machine learning-driven applications that produce large uncertain databases. A well-known approach to querying such databases is to blend rule-based reasoning with uncertainty. However, techniques proposed so far struggle with large databases. In this paper, we address this problem by presenting a new technique for probabilistic reasoning that exploits Trigger Graphs (TGs) -- a notion recently introduced for the non-probabilistic setting. The intuition is that TGs can effectively store a probabilistic model by avoiding an explicit materialization of the lineage and by grouping together similar derivations of the same fact. Firstly, we show how TGs can be adapted to support the possible world semantics. Then, we describe techniques for efficiently computing a probabilistic model, and formally establish the correctness of our approach. We also present an extensive empirical evaluation using a prototype called LTGs. Our comparison against other leading engines shows that LTGs is not only faster, even against approximate reasoning techniques, but can also reason over probabilistic databases that existing engines cannot scale to.

Arbitrary structural constraints can be imposed on the control solution, making this method suitable for distributed systems.

    "abstract": "The burgeoning field of camouflaged object detection (COD) seeks to identify objects that blend into their surroundings. Despite the impressive performance of recent models, we have identified a limitation in their robustness, where existing methods may misclassify salient objects as camouflaged ones, despite these two characteristics being contradictory. This limitation may stem from lacking multi-pattern training images, leading to less saliency robustness. To address this issue, we introduce CamDiff, a novel approach inspired by AI-Generated Content (AIGC) that overcomes the scarcity of multi-pattern training images. Specifically, we leverage the latent diffusion model to synthesize salient objects in camouflaged scenes, while using the zero-shot image classification ability of the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) model to prevent synthesis failures and ensure the synthesized object aligns with the input prompt. Consequently, the synthesized image retains its original camouflage label while incorporating salient objects, yielding camouflage samples with richer characteristics. The results of user studies show that the salient objects in the scenes synthesized by our framework attract the user's attention more; thus, such samples pose a greater challenge to the existing COD models. Our approach enables flexible editing and efficient large-scale dataset generation at a low cost. It significantly enhances COD baselines' training and testing phases, emphasizing robustness across diverse domains.

A well-known caveat is that producing the same is computationally heavy and relies on complex capture devices. Inspired by the success in quality and efficiency of recent volumetric neural rendering, we want to develop a physically-based neural shader to eliminate device dependency and significantly boost performance. However, no existing lighting and material models in the current neural rendering approaches can accurately represent the comprehensive lighting models and BRDFs properties required by the PBR process. Thus, this paper proposes a novel lighting representation that models direct and indirect light locally through a light sampling strategy in a learned light sampling field. We also propose BRDF models to separately represent surface/subsurface scattering details to enable complex objects such as translucent material (i.e., skin, jade). We then implement our proposed representations with an end-to-end physically-based neural face skin shader, which takes a standard face asset (i.e., geometry, albedo map, and normal map) and an HDRI for illumination as inputs and generates a photo-realistic rendering as output. Extensive experiments showcase the quality and efficiency of our PBR face skin shader, indicating the effectiveness of our proposed lighting and material representations. ",

It's supposed to be personalized from the perspective of both users and shows. Furthermore, the pursue of both instant (click) and long-time (view time) rewards, and the cold-start problem for new shows bring additional challenges. Such a problem is suitable for processing by heterogeneous graph models, because of the natural graph structure of data. But real-world networks usually have billions of nodes and various types of edges. Few existing methods focus on handling large-scale data and exploiting different types of edges, especially the latter. In this paper, we propose a two-stage audience expansion scheme based on an edge-prompted heterogeneous graph network which can take different double-sided interactions and features into account. In the offline stage, to construct the graph, user IDs and specific side information combinations of the shows are chosen to be the nodes, and click/co-click relations and view time are used to build the edges. Embeddings and clustered user groups are then calculated. When new shows arrive, their embeddings and subsequent matching users can be produced within a consistent space. In the online stage, posterior data including click/view users are employed as seeds to look for similar users. The results on the public datasets and our billion-scale data demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of our approach. ",

    "abstract": "We propose an algorithm for an optimal adaptive selection of points from the design domain of input random variables that are needed for an accurate estimation of failure probability and the determination of the boundary between safe and failure domains. The method is particularly useful when each evaluation of the performance function g(x) is very expensive and the function can be characterized as either highly nonlinear, noisy, or even discrete-state (e.g., binary). In such cases, only a limited number of calls is feasible, and gradients of g(x) cannot be used. The input design domain is progressively segmented by expanding and adaptively refining mesh-like lock-free geometrical structure. The proposed triangulation-based approach effectively combines the features of simulation and approximation methods. The algorithm performs two independent tasks: (i) the estimation of probabilities through an ingenious combination of deterministic cubature rules and the application of the divergence theorem and (ii) the sequential extension of the experimental design with new points. The sequential selection of points from the design domain for future evaluation of g(x) is carried out through a new learning function, which maximizes instantaneous information gain in terms of the probability classification that corresponds to the local region. The extension may be halted at any time, e.g., when sufficiently accurate estimations are obtained. Due to the use of the exact geometric representation in the input domain, the algorithm is most effective for problems of a low dimension, not exceeding eight. The method can handle random vectors with correlated non-Gaussian marginals. The estimation accuracy can be improved by employing a smooth surrogate model. Finally, we define new factors of global sensitivity to failure based on the entire failure surface weighted by the density of the input random vector. ",

To address these vulnerabilities, we propose Cascade-guided Adversarial training, a new adversarial training procedure that is specifically designed for sequential recommendation models. Our approach harnesses the intrinsic cascade effects present in sequential modeling to produce strategic adversarial perturbations to item embeddings during training. Experiments on training state-of-the-art sequential models on four public datasets from different domains show that our training approach produces superior model ranking accuracy and superior model robustness to real item replacement perturbations when compared to both standard model training and generic adversarial training.

Prior causal information such as the presence or absence of a causal edge can be leveraged to guide the discovery process towards a more restricted and accurate search space. In this study, we present KGS, a knowledge-guided greedy score-based causal discovery approach that uses observational data and structural priors (causal edges) as constraints to learn the causal graph. KGS is a novel application of knowledge constraints that can leverage any of the following prior edge information between any two variables: the presence of a directed edge, the absence of an edge, and the presence of an undirected edge. We extensively evaluate KGS across multiple settings in both synthetic and benchmark real-world datasets.

Our simulations demonstrate that the proposed POD-MLP modeling approach reduces computational complexity compared to the POD-only model for nonlinear systems.

Different privacy levels regarding users' attitudes need to be satisfied locally, while a strict privacy guarantee for the global model is also required centrally. Personalized Local Differential Privacy (PLDP) is suitable for preserving users' varying local privacy, yet only provides a central privacy guarantee equivalent to the worst-case local privacy level. Thus, achieving strong central privacy as well as personalized local privacy with a utility-promising model is a challenging problem. In this work, a general framework (APES) is built up to strengthen model privacy under personalized local privacy by leveraging the privacy amplification effect of the shuffle model. To tighten the privacy bound, we quantify the heterogeneous contributions to the central privacy user by user. The contributions are characterized by the ability of generating \"echos\" from the perturbation of each user, which is carefully measured by proposed methods Neighbor Divergence and Clip-Laplace Mechanism. Furthermore, we propose a refined framework (S-APES) with the post-sparsification technique to reduce privacy loss in high-dimension scenarios. To the best of our knowledge, the impact of shuffling on personalized local privacy is considered for the first time. We provide a strong privacy amplification effect, and the bound is tighter than the baseline result based on existing methods for uniform local privacy.

Each omics technique only provides a limited view of the underlying biological process and integrating heterogeneous omics layers simultaneously would lead to a more comprehensive and detailed understanding of diseases and phenotypes. However, one obstacle faced when performing multi-omics data integration is the existence of unpaired multi-omics data due to instrument sensitivity and cost. Studies may fail if certain aspects of the subjects are missing or incomplete. In this paper, we propose a deep learning method for multi-omics integration with incomplete data by Cross-omics Linked unified embedding with Contrastive Learning and Self Attention (CLCLSA). Utilizing complete multi-omics data as supervision, the model employs cross-omics autoencoders to learn the feature representation across different types of biological data. The multi-omics contrastive learning, which is used to maximize the mutual information between different types of omics, is employed before latent feature concatenation. In addition, the feature-level self-attention and omics-level self-attention are employed to dynamically identify the most informative features for multi-omics data integration. Extensive experiments were conducted on four public multi-omics datasets.

    "abstract": "Dynamic neural network is an emerging research topic in deep learning. With adaptive inference, dynamic models can achieve remarkable accuracy and computational efficiency. However, it is challenging to design a powerful dynamic detector, because of no suitable dynamic architecture and exiting criterion for object detection. To tackle these difficulties, we propose a dynamic framework for object detection, named DynamicDet. Firstly, we carefully design a dynamic architecture based on the nature of the object detection task. Then, we propose an adaptive router to analyze the multi-scale information and to decide the inference route automatically. We also present a novel optimization strategy with an exiting criterion based on the detection losses for our dynamic detectors. Last, we present a variable-speed inference strategy, which helps to realize a wide range of accuracy-speed trade-offs with only one dynamic detector. Extensive experiments conducted on the COCO benchmark demonstrate that the proposed DynamicDet achieves new state-of-the-art accuracy-speed trade-offs. For instance, with comparable accuracy, the inference speed of our dynamic detector Dy-YOLOv7-W6 surpasses YOLOv7-E6 by 12%, YOLOv7-D6 by 17%, and YOLOv7-E6E by 39%.

    "abstract": "Recent researches on unsupervised person re-identification~(reID) have demonstrated that pre-training on unlabeled person images achieves superior performance on downstream reID tasks than pre-training on ImageNet. However, those pre-trained methods are specifically designed for reID and suffer flexible adaption to other pedestrian analysis tasks. In this paper, we propose VAL-PAT, a novel framework that learns transferable representations to enhance various pedestrian analysis tasks with multimodal information. To train our framework, we introduce three learning objectives, \\emph{i.e.,} self-supervised contrastive learning, image-text contrastive learning and multi-attribute classification. The self-supervised contrastive learning facilitates the learning of the intrinsic pedestrian properties, while the image-text contrastive learning guides the model to focus on the appearance information of pedestrians.Meanwhile, multi-attribute classification encourages the model to recognize attributes to excavate fine-grained pedestrian information. We first perform pre-training on LUPerson-TA dataset, where each image contains text and attribute annotations, and then transfer the learned representations to various downstream tasks, including person reID, person attribute recognition and text-based person search. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework facilitates the learning of general pedestrian representations and thus leads to promising results on various pedestrian analysis tasks. ",

Existing upright adjustment models focus on how to estimate more accurate camera orientation, and attribute image reconstruction to offline or post-processing tasks. To this end, we propose an online end-to-end network for upright adjustment. Our network is designed to reconstruct the image while finding the angle. Our network consists of three modules: orientation estimation, LUT online generation, and upright reconstruction. Direction estimation estimates the tilt angle of the panoramic image. Then, a converter block with upsampling function is designed to generate angle to LUT. This module can output corresponding online LUT for different input angles. Finally, a lightweight generative adversarial network (GAN) aims to generate upright images from shallow features. The experimental results show that in terms of angles, we have improved the accuracy of small angle errors. In terms of image reconstruction, In image reconstruction, we have achieved the first real-time online upright reconstruction of panoramic images using deep learning networks. ",

In this paper, we investigate this claim on the specific example of deep neural network (DNN) embeddings. Inversion of DNN embeddings has been investigated for explaining deep image representations or synthesizing normalized images. Existing studies leverage full access to all layers of the original model, as well as all possible information on the original dataset. For the biometric authentication use case, we need to investigate this under adversarial settings where an attacker has access to a feature-space representation but no direct access to the exact original dataset nor the original learned model. Instead, we assume varying degree of attacker's background knowledge about the distribution of the dataset as well as the original learned model (architecture and training process). In these cases, we show that the attacker can exploit off-the-shelf DNN models and public datasets, to mimic the behaviour of the original learned model to varying degrees of success, based only on the obtained representation and attacker's prior knowledge. We propose a two-pronged attack that first infers the original DNN by exploiting the model footprint on the embedding, and then reconstructs the raw data by using the inferred model. We show the practicality of the attack on popular DNNs trained for two prominent biometric modalities, face and fingerprint recognition. The attack can effectively infer the original recognition model (mean accuracy 83\\% for faces, 86\\% for fingerprints), and can craft effective biometric reconstructions that are successfully authenticated with 1-vs-1 authentication accuracy of up to 92\\% for some models.

Aberration correction by sophisticated lens designs and special glass materials generally incurs high cost of manufacturing and the increase in the weight of optical systems, thus recent work has shifted to aberration correction with deep learning-based post-processing. Though real-world optical aberrations vary in degree, existing methods cannot eliminate variable-degree aberrations well, especially for the severe degrees of degradation. Also, previous methods use a single feed-forward neural network and suffer from information loss in the output. To address the issues, we propose a novel aberration correction method with an invertible architecture by leveraging its information-lossless property. Within the architecture, we develop conditional invertible blocks to allow the processing of aberrations with variable degrees. Our method is evaluated on both a synthetic dataset from physics-based imaging simulation and a real captured dataset.

    "abstract": "With the increasing development of neuromorphic platforms and their related software tools as well as the increasing scale of spiking neural network (SNN) models, there is a pressure for interoperable and scalable representations of network state. In response to this, we discuss a parallel extension of a widely used format for efficiently representing sparse matrices, the compressed sparse row (CSR), in the context of supporting the simulation and serialization of large-scale SNNs. Sparse matrices for graph adjacency structure provide a natural fit for describing the connectivity of an SNN, and prior work in the area of parallel graph partitioning has developed the distributed CSR (dCSR) format for storing and ingesting large graphs. We contend that organizing additional network information, such as neuron and synapse state, in alignment with its adjacency as dCSR provides a straightforward partition-based distribution of network state. For large-scale simulations, this means each parallel process is only responsible for its own partition of state, which becomes especially useful when the size of an SNN exceeds the memory resources of a single compute node. For potentially long-running simulations, this also enables network serialization to and from disk (e.g. for checkpoint/restart fault-tolerant computing) to be performed largely independently between parallel processes. We also provide a potential implementation, and put it forward for adoption within the neural computing community. ",

First, by providing a true power allocation (PA) constraint for conventional NOMA with practical constraints, we demonstrate that it cannot support massive connections. To this end, we propose BIMA where there are no strict PA constraints, unlike conventional NOMA, thus allowing a high number of devices. We provide a comprehensive analytical framework for BIMA for all key performance indicators (KPIs) (i.e., ergodic capacity [EC], outage probability [OP], and bit error rate [BER]). We evaluate Jain's fairness index and proportional fairness index in terms of all KPIs. Based on the extensive computer simulations, we reveal that BIMA outperforms conventional NOMA significantly, with a performance gain of up to 20-30dB. This performance gain becomes greater when more devices are supported. BIMA provides a full diversity order and enables the implementation of an arbitrary number of devices and modulation orders, which is crucial for IoT networks in dense areas. BIMA guarantees a fairness system where none of the devices gets a severe performance and the sum-rate is shared in a fair manner among devices by guarantying QoS satisfaction. Finally, we provide an intense complexity and latency analysis and demonstrate that BIMA provides lower latency compared to conventional NOMA since it allows parallel computing at the receivers and no iterative operations are required. We show that BIMA reduces latency by up to 350\\% for specific devices and 170\\% on average. ",

However, there are often multiple audio tracks that can correspond with a visual scene. Consider, for example, different conversations on the same crowded street. The effect of such counterfactual pairs on audiovisual representation learning has not been previously explored. To investigate this, we use dubbed versions of movies to augment cross-modal contrastive learning. Our approach learns to represent alternate audio tracks, differing only in speech content, similarly to the same video. Our results show that dub-augmented training improves performance on a range of auditory and audiovisual tasks, without significantly affecting linguistic task performance overall. We additionally compare this approach to a strong baseline where we remove speech before pretraining, and find that dub-augmented training is more effective, including for paralinguistic and audiovisual tasks where speech removal leads to worse performance. These findings highlight the importance of considering speech variation when learning scene-level audiovisual correspondences and suggest that dubbed audio can be a useful augmentation technique for training audiovisual models toward more robust performance.

    "abstract": "For driving safely and efficiently in highway scenarios, autonomous vehicles (AVs) must be able to predict future behaviors of surrounding object vehicles (OVs), and assess collision risk accurately for reasonable decision-making. Aiming at autonomous driving in highway scenarios, a predictive collision risk assessment method based on trajectory prediction of OVs is proposed in this paper. Firstly, the vehicle trajectory prediction is formulated as a sequence generation task with long short-term memory (LSTM) encoder-decoder framework. Convolutional social pooling (CSP) and graph attention network (GAN) are adopted for extracting local spatial vehicle interactions and distant spatial vehicle interactions, respectively. Then, two basic risk metrics, time-to-collision (TTC) and minimal distance margin (MDM), are calculated between the predicted trajectory of OV and the candidate trajectory of AV. Consequently, a time-continuous risk function is constructed with temporal and spatial risk metrics. Finally, the vehicle trajectory prediction model CSP-GAN-LSTM is evaluated on two public highway datasets. The quantitative results indicate that the proposed CSP-GAN-LSTM model outperforms the existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in terms of position prediction accuracy. Besides, simulation results in typical highway scenarios further validate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed predictive collision risk assessment method. ",

    "abstract": "Spiking neural networks (SNNs) are well known as the brain-inspired models with high computing efficiency, due to a key component that they utilize spikes as information units, close to the biological neural systems. Although spiking based models are energy efficient by taking advantage of discrete spike signals, their performance is limited by current network structures and their training methods. As discrete signals, typical SNNs cannot apply the gradient descent rules directly into parameters adjustment as artificial neural networks (ANNs). Aiming at this limitation, here we propose a novel method of constructing deep SNN models with knowledge distillation (KD) that uses ANN as teacher model and SNN as student model. Through ANN-SNN joint training algorithm, the student SNN model can learn rich feature information from the teacher ANN model through the KD method, yet it avoids training SNN from scratch when communicating with non-differentiable spikes. Our method can not only build a more efficient deep spiking structure feasibly and reasonably, but use few time steps to train whole model compared to direct training or ANN to SNN methods. More importantly, it has a superb ability of noise immunity for various types of artificial noises and natural signals. The proposed novel method provides efficient ways to improve the performance of SNN through constructing deeper structures in a high-throughput fashion, with potential usage for light and efficient brain-inspired computing of practical scenarios.

To cope with these problems, we propose a scene-adaptive infrared and visible image registration. Specifically, in regard of the discrepancy between multi-modality images, an invertible translation process is developed to establish a modality-invariant domain, which comprehensively embraces the feature intensity and distribution of both infrared and visible modalities. We employ homography to simulate the deformation between different planes and develop a hierarchical framework to rectify the deformation inferred from the proposed latent representation in a coarse-to-fine manner. For that, the advanced perception ability coupled with the residual estimation conducive to the regression of sparse offsets, and the alternate correlation search facilitates a more accurate correspondence matching. Moreover, we propose the first ground truth available misaligned infrared and visible image dataset, involving three synthetic sets and one real-world set.

    "abstract": "Most urban applications necessitate building footprints in the form of concise vector graphics with sharp boundaries rather than pixel-wise raster images. This need contrasts with the majority of existing methods, which typically generate over-smoothed footprint polygons. Editing these automatically produced polygons can be inefficient, if not more time-consuming than manual digitization. This paper introduces a semi-automatic approach for building footprint extraction through semantically-sensitive superpixels and neural graph networks. Drawing inspiration from object-based classification techniques, we first learn to generate superpixels that are not only boundary-preserving but also semantically-sensitive. The superpixels respond exclusively to building boundaries rather than other natural objects, while simultaneously producing semantic segmentation of the buildings. These intermediate superpixel representations can be naturally considered as nodes within a graph. Consequently, graph neural networks are employed to model the global interactions among all superpixels and enhance the representativeness of node features for building segmentation. Classical approaches are utilized to extract and regularize boundaries for the vectorized building footprints. Utilizing minimal clicks and straightforward strokes, we efficiently accomplish accurate segmentation outcomes, eliminating the necessity for editing polygon vertices. Our proposed approach demonstrates superior precision and efficacy, as validated by experimental assessments on various public benchmark datasets. We observe a 10\\% enhancement in the metric for superpixel clustering and an 8\\% increment in vector graphics evaluation, when compared with established techniques. Additionally, we have devised an optimized and sophisticated pipeline for interactive editing, poised to further augment the overall quality of the results. ",

Recent advancements in this area have mainly focused on learning-based methods, such as deep neural networks that use visual content or human pose.

Our framework employs a modified graph transformer module and graph clustering losses to detect social groups. Our experiments on the popular JRDBAct dataset reveal noticeable improvements in performance, with relative improvements ranging from 2% to 11%. Furthermore, our framework is significantly faster, with up to 12x faster inference times compared to state-of-the-art methods under the same computation resources.

    "abstract": "We have recently seen tremendous progress in diffusion advances for generating realistic human motions. Yet, they largely disregard the rich multi-human interactions. In this paper, we present InterGen, an effective diffusion-based approach that incorporates human-to-human interactions into the motion diffusion process, which enables layman users to customize high-quality two-person interaction motions, with only text guidance. We first contribute a multimodal dataset, named InterHuman. It consists of about 107M frames for diverse two-person interactions, with accurate skeletal motions and 16,756 natural language descriptions. For the algorithm side, we carefully tailor the motion diffusion model to our two-person interaction setting. To handle the symmetry of human identities during interactions, we propose two cooperative transformer-based denoisers that explicitly share weights, with a mutual attention mechanism to further connect the two denoising processes. Then, we propose a novel representation for motion input in our interaction diffusion model, which explicitly formulates the global relations between the two performers in the world frame. We further introduce two novel regularization terms to encode spatial relations, equipped with a corresponding damping scheme during the training of our interaction diffusion model. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness and generalizability of InterGen. Notably, it can generate more diverse and compelling two-person motions than previous methods and enables various downstream applications for human interactions. ",

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a game-theoretic method to address the problem of optimal detector placement in a networked control system under cyber-attacks. The networked control system is composed of interconnected agents where each agent is regulated by its local controller over unprotected communication, which leaves the system vulnerable to malicious cyber-attacks. To guarantee a given local performance, the defender optimally selects a single agent on which to place a detector at its local controller with the purpose of detecting cyber-attacks. On the other hand, an adversary optimally chooses a single agent on which to conduct a cyber-attack on its input with the aim of maximally worsening the local performance while remaining stealthy to the defender. First, we present a necessary and sufficient condition to ensure that the maximal attack impact on the local performance is bounded, which restricts the possible actions of the defender to a subset of available agents. Then, by considering the maximal attack impact on the local performance as a game payoff, we cast the problem of finding optimal actions of the defender and the adversary as a zero-sum game. Finally, with the possible action sets of the defender and the adversary, an algorithm is devoted to determining the Nash equilibria of the zero-sum game that yield the optimal detector placement. The proposed method is illustrated on an IEEE benchmark for power systems. ",

Mismatches between the explained model's decision strategy and the user's domain knowledge (e.g. Clever Hans effects) have also been recognized as a starting point for improving faulty models.

In this paper, we demonstrate that acceptance of explanations by the user is not a guarantee for a ML model to function well, in particular, some Clever Hans effects may remain undetected. Such hidden flaws of the model can nevertheless be mitigated, and we demonstrate this by contributing a new method, Explanation-Guided Exposure Minimization (EGEM), that premptively prunes variations in the ML model that have not been the subject of positive explanation feedback. Experiments on natural image data demonstrate that our approach leads to models that strongly reduce their reliance on hidden Clever Hans strategies, and consequently achieve higher accuracy on new data.

Dynamic graphs allow to efficiently handle applications such as social network prediction, recommender systems, traffic forecasting or electroencephalography analysis, that can not be adressed using standard numeric representations. As a direct consequence of the emergence of dynamic graph representations, dynamic graph learning has emerged as a new machine learning problem, combining challenges from both sequential/temporal data processing and static graph learning. In this research area, Dynamic Graph Neural Network (DGNN) has became the state of the art approach and plethora of models have been proposed in the very recent years. This paper aims at providing a review of problems and models related to dynamic graph learning. The various dynamic graph supervised learning settings are analysed and discussed. We identify the similarities and differences between existing models with respect to the way time information is modeled.

    "abstract": "Automatic speaker verification task has made great achievements using deep learning approaches with the large-scale manually annotated dataset. However, it's very difficult and expensive to collect a large amount of well-labeled data for system building. In this paper, we propose a novel and advanced self-supervised learning framework which can construct a high performance speaker verification system without using any labeled data. To avoid the impact of false negative pairs, we adopt the self-distillation with no labels (DINO) framework as the initial model, which can be trained without exploiting negative pairs. Then, we introduce a cluster-aware training strategy for DINO to improve the diversity of data. In the iteration learning stage, due to a mass of unreliable labels from clustering, the quality of pseudo labels is important for the system training. This motivates us to propose dynamic loss-gate and label correction (DLG-LC) methods to alleviate the performance degradation caused by unreliable labels. More specifically, we model the loss distribution with GMM and obtain the loss-gate threshold dynamically to distinguish the reliable and unreliable labels. Besides, we adopt the model predictions to correct the unreliable label, for better utilizing the unreliable data rather than dropping them directly. Moreover, we extend the DLG-LC to multi-modality to further improve the performance. The experiments are performed on the commonly used Voxceleb dataset. Compared to the best-known self-supervised speaker verification system, our proposed method obtain 22.17%, 27.94% and 25.56% relative EER improvement on Vox-O, Vox-E and Vox-H test sets, even with fewer iterations, smaller models, and simpler clustering methods. More importantly, the newly proposed system even achieves comparable results with the fully supervised system, but without using any human labeled data. ",

Our paper aims to learn a representation of visual artistic style more strongly disentangled from the semantic content depicted in an image. We use Neural Style Transfer (NST) to measure and drive the learning signal and achieve state-of-the-art representation learning on explicitly disentangled metrics. We show that strongly addressing the disentanglement of style and content leads to large gains in style-specific metrics, encoding far less semantic information and achieving state-of-the-art accuracy in downstream multimodal applications.

For enabling the combination of ChatGPT and RDF KGs, we present a research prototype, called GPToLODS, which is able to enrich any ChatGPT response with more information from hundreds of RDF KGs. In particular, it identifies and annotates each entity of the response with statistics and hyperlinks to LODsyndesis KG (which contains integrated data from 400 RDF KGs and over 412 million entities).

Virtualisation is one of the key drivers of that transformation and enables a massive deployment of computing resources, which exhausts server capacity limits. Furthermore, the increased network endpoints need to be handled dynamically and centrally to facilitate cloud computing functionalities. Traditional DCs barely satisfy those demands because of their inherent limitations based on the network topology. Software-Defined Networks (SDN) promise to meet the increasing network requirements for cloud applications by decoupling control functionalities from data forwarding. Although SDN solutions add more flexibility to DC networks, they also pose new vulnerabilities with a high impact due to the centralised architecture. In this paper we propose an evaluation framework for assessing the security level of SDN architectures in four different stages. Furthermore, we show in an experimental study, how the framework can be used for mapping SDN threats with associated vulnerabilities and necessary mitigations in conjunction with risk and impact classification. The proposed framework helps administrators to evaluate the network security level, to apply countermeasures for identified SDN threats, and to meet the networks security requirements. ",

More precisely, a set of dissimilarity measures is defined by elaborating the distributions, over the network, of a few egonet features, namely the degree, the clustering coefficient, and the egonet persistence. The method, which does not require the alignment of the two networks being compared, exploits the statistics of the three features to define one- or multi-dimensional distribution functions, which are then compared to define a distance between the networks. The effectiveness of the method is evaluated using a standard classification test, i.e., recognizing the graphs originating from the same synthetic model. Overall, the proposed distances have performances comparable to the best state-of-the-art techniques (graphlet-based methods) with similar computational requirements. Given its simplicity and flexibility, the method is proposed as a viable approach for network comparison tasks. ",

On the other hand, data are collected and processed in a distributed manner, which brings a novel development direction and new challenges to EC. In this paper, we intend to give a systematic review on distributed EC (DEC). First, a new taxonomy for DEC is proposed from top design mechanism to bottom implementation mechanism. Based on this taxonomy, existing studies on DEC are reviewed in terms of purpose, parallel structure of the algorithm, parallel model for implementation, and the implementation environment. Second, we clarify two major purposes of DEC, i.e., improving efficiency through parallel processing for centralized optimization and cooperating distributed individuals/sub-populations with partial information to perform distributed optimization. Third, noting that the latter purpose of DEC is an emerging and attractive trend for EC with the booming of spatially distributed paradigms, this paper gives a systematic definition of the distributed optimization and classifies it into dimension distributed-, data distributed-, and objective distributed-optimization problems. Formal formulations for these problems are provided and various DEC studies on these problems are reviewed.

In this paper, we find the maximum damage given a cost budget by modelling this problem with ATs, both in deterministic and probabilistic settings. We show that the general problem is NP-complete, and provide heuristics to solve it. For general ATs these are based on integer linear programming.

EC is helpful for optimization tasks of crowdsourcing and in turn, crowdsourcing can break the spatial limitation of EC for large-scale distributed optimization. Therefore, this paper firstly introduces the paradigm of crowdsourcing-based distributed optimization. Then, CEC is elaborated. CEC performs optimization based on a server and a group of workers, in which the server dispatches a large task to workers. Workers search for promising solutions through EC optimizers and cooperate with connected neighbors. To eliminate uncertainties brought by the heterogeneity of worker behaviors and devices, the server adopts the competitive ranking and uncertainty detection strategy to guide the cooperation of workers. To illustrate the satisfactory performance of CEC, a crowdsourcing-based swarm optimizer is implemented as an example for extensive experiments. Comparison results on benchmark functions and a distributed clustering optimization problem demonstrate the potential applications of CEC. ",

We circumvent these challenges by developing a non-invasive measurement technique, which is based on an algorithm that solves the inverse problem of resistor network, and implement this algorithm on a soft resistive, strain sensor network. Our algorithm works by iteratively computing the resistor values based on the applied boundary voltage and current responses, and we analyze the reconstruction error of the algorithm as a function of network size and measurement error. We further develop electronics setup to implement our algorithm on a stretchable resistive strain sensor network made of soft conductive silicone, and show the response of the measured network to different deformation modes. Our work opens a new path to address the challenge of measuring many sensor values in soft sensors, and could be applied to soft robotic sensor systems. ",

    "abstract": "Consider a dynamic network and a given distributed problem. At any point in time, there might exist several solutions that are equally good with respect to the problem specification, but that are different from an algorithmic perspective, because some could be easier to update than others when the network changes. In other words, one would prefer to have a solution that is more robust to topological changes in the network; and in this direction the best scenario would be that the solution remains correct despite the dynamic of the network. In~\\cite{CasteigtsDPR20}, the authors introduced a very strong robustness criterion: they required that for any removal of edges that maintain the network connected, the solution remains valid. They focus on the maximal independent set problem, and their approach consists in characterizing the graphs in which there exists a robust solution (the existential problem), or even stronger, where any solution is robust (the universal problem). As the robustness criteria is very demanding, few graphs have a robust solution, and even fewer are such that all of their solutions are robust. In this paper, we ask the following question: \\textit{Can we have robustness for a larger class of networks, if we bound the number $k$ of edge removals allowed}?

As being sparse, diverse, contextual, and often ambiguous, detecting abnormal events precisely is a very ambitious task. To this end, we rely only on the information-rich spatio-temporal data, and the reconstruction power of the diffusion models such that a high reconstruction error is utilized to decide the abnormality. Experiments performed on two large-scale video anomaly detection datasets demonstrate the consistent improvement of the proposed method over the state-of-the-art generative models while in some cases our method achieves better scores than the more complex models.

    "abstract": "It is desirable to predict the behavior of traffic participants conditioned on different planned trajectories of the autonomous vehicle. This allows the downstream planner to estimate the impact of its decisions. Recent approaches for conditional behavior prediction rely on a regression decoder, meaning that coordinates or polynomial coefficients are regressed. In this work we revisit set-based trajectory prediction, where the probability of each trajectory in a predefined trajectory set is determined by a classification model, and first-time employ it to the task of conditional behavior prediction. We propose RESET, which combines a new metric-driven algorithm for trajectory set generation with a graph-based encoder. For unconditional prediction, RESET achieves comparable performance to a regression-based approach. Due to the nature of set-based approaches, it has the advantageous property of being able to predict a flexible number of trajectories without influencing runtime or complexity. For conditional prediction, RESET achieves reasonable results with late fusion of the planned trajectory, which was not observed for regression-based approaches before. This means that RESET is computationally lightweight to combine with a planner that proposes multiple future plans of the autonomous vehicle, as large parts of the forward pass can be reused. ",

Let $X$ be a vertex set in the undirected graph $G$ such that for each subset $S$ of $X$ it holds $|N(S)|\\ge \\frac1k {|S|}$. Then $G$ has a matching of size at least $\\frac{|X|}{k+1}$. Using this statement, we derive tight bounds for the estimators of the matching size in planar graphs. These estimators are used in designing sublinear space algorithms for approximating the maching size in the data stream model of computation. In particular, we show the number of locally superior vertices, introduced in \\cite{Jowhari23}, is a $3$ factor approximation of the matching size in planar graphs. The previous analysis proved a $3.5$ approximation factor. In another consequence, we show a simple setting of an estimator by Esfandiari \\etal \\cite{EHLMO15} achieves $3$ factor approximation of the matching size in planar graphs. Namely, let $s$ be the number of edges with both endpoints having degree at most $2$ and let $h$ be the number of vertices with degree at least $3$.

While recent works leverage various word embedding approaches to differentiate word sense in NMT, they do not focus on the pivotal components in resolving ambiguities of homographs in NMT: the hidden states of an encoder. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to tackle homographic issues of NMT in the latent space. We first train an encoder (aka \"HDR-encoder\") to learn universal sentence representations in a natural language inference (NLI) task. We further fine-tune the encoder using homograph-based synset sentences from WordNet, enabling it to learn word-level homographic disambiguation representations (HDR). The pre-trained HDR-encoder is subsequently integrated with a transformer-based NMT in various schemes to improve translation accuracy. Experiments on four translation directions demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in enhancing the performance of NMT systems in the BLEU scores (up to +2.3 compared to a solid baseline). The effects can be verified by other metrics (F1, precision, and recall) of translation accuracy in an additional disambiguation task. Visualization methods like heatmaps, T-SNE and translation examples are also utilized to demonstrate the effects of the proposed method. ",

    "abstract": "The development of approaches for trajectory prediction requires metrics to validate and compare their performance. Currently established metrics are based on Euclidean distance, which means that errors are weighted equally in all directions. Euclidean metrics are insufficient for structured environments like roads, since they do not properly capture the agent's intent relative to the underlying lane. In order to provide a reasonable assessment of trajectory prediction approaches with regard to the downstream planning task, we propose a new metric that is lane distance-based: Lane Miss Rate (LMR). For the calculation of LMR, the ground-truth and predicted endpoints are assigned to lane segments, more precisely their centerlines. Measured by the distance along the lane segments, predictions that are within a certain threshold distance to the ground-truth count as hits, otherwise they count as misses. LMR is then defined as the ratio of sequences that yield a miss. Our results on three state-of-the-art trajectory prediction models show that LMR preserves the order of Euclidean distance-based metrics. In contrast to the Euclidean Miss Rate, qualitative results show that LMR yields misses for sequences where predictions are located on wrong lanes. Hits on the other hand result for sequences where predictions are located on the correct lane. This means that LMR implicitly weights Euclidean error relative to the lane and goes into the direction of capturing intents of traffic agents. The source code of LMR for Argoverse 1 is publicly available. ",

However, the most widely used models are pre-trained on ImageNet-1K with limited classes. The pre-trained feature representation is therefore not universal enough to generalize well to the diverse open-world classes. In this paper, we first cluster the large-scale LAION400M into one million pseudo classes based on the joint textual and visual features extracted by the CLIP model. Due to the confusion of label granularity, the automatically clustered dataset inevitably contains heavy inter-class conflict. To alleviate such conflict, we randomly select partial inter-class prototypes to construct the margin-based softmax loss. To further enhance the low-dimensional feature representation, we randomly select partial feature dimensions when calculating the similarities between embeddings and class-wise prototypes. The dual random partial selections are with respect to the class dimension and the feature dimension of the prototype matrix, making the classification conflict-robust and the feature embedding compact.

In this work, we propose to extend this later class of models to infer dynamic labeled networks under a mixed membership assumption.

We show that our method significantly differs from existing approaches, and allows to model more complex systems --dynamic labeled networks. We demonstrate the robustness of our method with several experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets. A key interest of our approach is that it needs very few training data to yield good results.

Much of the research on data augmentation (DA) has focused on improving existing techniques, examining its regularization effects in the context of neural network over-fitting, or investigating its impact on features. Here, we undertake a holistic examination of the effect of DA on three different classifiers, convolutional neural networks, support vector machines, and logistic regression models, which are commonly used in supervised classification of imbalanced data. We support our examination with testing on three image and five tabular datasets. Our research indicates that DA, when applied to imbalanced data, produces substantial changes in model weights, support vectors and feature selection; even though it may only yield relatively modest changes to global metrics, such as balanced accuracy or F1 measure. We hypothesize that DA works by facilitating variances in data, so that machine learning models can associate changes in the data with labels. By diversifying the range of feature amplitudes that a model must recognize to predict a label, DA improves a model's capacity to generalize when learning with imbalanced data. ",

However, there are different levels of severity of breast cancer requiring different treatment strategies, and hence, grading breast cancer has become a vital component of breast cancer diagnosis and treatment planning. Specifically, the gold-standard Scarff-Bloom-Richardson (SBR) grade has been shown to consistently indicate a patient's response to chemotherapy. Unfortunately, the current method to determine the SBR grade requires removal of some cancer cells from the patient which can lead to stress and discomfort along with costly expenses. In this paper, we study the efficacy of deep learning for breast cancer grading based on synthetic correlated diffusion (CDI$^s$) imaging, a new magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) modality and found that it achieves better performance on SBR grade prediction compared to those learnt using gold-standard imaging modalities. Hence, we introduce Cancer-Net BCa-S, a volumetric deep radiomics approach for predicting SBR grade based on volumetric CDI$^s$ data. Given the promising results, this proposed method to identify the severity of the cancer would allow for better treatment decisions without the need for a biopsy. Cancer-Net BCa-S has been made publicly available as part of a global open-source initiative for advancing machine learning for cancer care. ",

In this paper, we propose a method of finding note onsets of singing voice more accurately by leveraging the linguistic characteristics of singing, which are not seen in other instruments. The proposed model uses mel-scaled spectrogram and phonetic posteriorgram (PPG), a frame-wise likelihood of phoneme, as an input of the onset detection network while PPG is generated by the pre-trained network with singing and speech data. To verify how linguistic features affect onset detection, we compare the evaluation results through the dataset with different languages and divide onset types for detailed analysis. Our approach substantially improves the performance of singing transcription and therefore emphasizes the importance of linguistic features in singing analysis. ",

In typical approaches, models usually focus on predicting specific contents of masked patches, and their performances are highly related to pre-defined mask strategies. Intuitively, this procedure can be considered as training a student (the model) on solving given problems (predict masked patches). However, we argue that the model should not only focus on solving given problems, but also stand in the shoes of a teacher to produce a more challenging problem by itself. To this end, we propose Hard Patches Mining (HPM), a brand-new framework for MIM pre-training. We observe that the reconstruction loss can naturally be the metric of the difficulty of the pre-training task. Therefore, we introduce an auxiliary loss predictor, predicting patch-wise losses first and deciding where to mask next. It adopts a relative relationship learning strategy to prevent overfitting to exact reconstruction loss values. Experiments under various settings demonstrate the effectiveness of HPM in constructing masked images. Furthermore, we empirically find that solely introducing the loss prediction objective leads to powerful representations, verifying the efficacy of the ability to be aware of where is hard to reconstruct.

We address the problem of affordance categorization for class-agnostic objects with an open set of interactions; we achieve this by learning similarities between object interactions in an unsupervised way and thus inducing clusters of object affordances. A novel depth-informed qualitative spatial representation is proposed for the construction of Activity Graphs (AGs), which abstract from the continuous representation of spatio-temporal interactions in RGB-D videos. These AGs are clustered to obtain groups of objects with similar affordances. Our experiments in a real-world scenario demonstrate that our method learns to create object affordance clusters with a high V-measure even in cluttered scenes.

    "abstract": "The swift and precise detection of vehicles holds significant research significance in intelligent transportation systems (ITS). However, current vehicle detection algorithms encounter challenges such as high computational complexity, low detection rate, and limited feasibility on mobile devices. To address these issues, this paper proposes a lightweight vehicle detection algorithm for YOLOv7-tiny called Ghost-YOLOv7. The model first scales the width multiple to 0.5 and replaces the standard convolution of the backbone network with Ghost convolution to achieve a lighter network and improve the detection speed; secondly, a Ghost bi-directional feature pyramid network (Ghost-BiFPN) neck network is designed to enhance feature extraction capability of the algorithm and enrich semantic information; thirdly, a Ghost Decouoled Head (GDH) is employed for accurate prediction of vehicle location and class, enhancing model accuracy; finally, a coordinate attention mechanism is introduced in the output layer to suppress environmental interference, and the WIoU loss function is employed to enhance the detection accuracy further. Experimental results on the PASCAL VOC dataset demonstrate that Ghost-YOLOv7 outperforms the original YOLOv7-tiny model, achieving a 29.8% reduction in computation, 37.3% reduction in the number of parameters, 35.1% reduction in model weights, and 1.1% higher mean average precision (mAP), while achieving a detection speed of 428 FPS. These results validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. ",

    "abstract": "In the realm of 3D-computer vision applications, point cloud few-shot learning plays a critical role. However, it poses an arduous challenge due to the sparsity, irregularity, and unordered nature of the data. Current methods rely on complex local geometric extraction techniques such as convolution, graph, and attention mechanisms, along with extensive data-driven pre-training tasks. These approaches contradict the fundamental goal of few-shot learning, which is to facilitate efficient learning. To address this issue, we propose GPr-Net (Geometric Prototypical Network), a lightweight and computationally efficient geometric prototypical network that captures the intrinsic topology of point clouds and achieves superior performance. Our proposed method, IGI++ (Intrinsic Geometry Interpreter++) employs vector-based hand-crafted intrinsic geometry interpreters and Laplace vectors to extract and evaluate point cloud morphology, resulting in improved representations for FSL (Few-Shot Learning). Additionally, Laplace vectors enable the extraction of valuable features from point clouds with fewer points. To tackle the distribution drift challenge in few-shot metric learning, we leverage hyperbolic space and demonstrate that our approach handles intra and inter-class variance better than existing point cloud few-shot learning methods. Experimental results on the ModelNet40 dataset show that GPr-Net outperforms state-of-the-art methods in few-shot learning on point clouds, achieving utmost computational efficiency that is $170\\times$ better than all existing works.

Several cardiac failures, heart disease mortality, and diagnostic costs can all be reduced with early identification and treatment. Medical data is collected in large quantities by the healthcare industry, but it is not well mined. The discovery of previously unknown patterns and connections in this information can help with an improved decision when it comes to forecasting heart disorder risk. In the proposed study, we constructed an ML-based diagnostic system for heart illness forecasting, using a heart disorder dataset. We used data preprocessing techniques like outlier detection and removal, checking and removing missing entries, feature normalization, cross-validation, nine classification algorithms like RF, MLP, KNN, ETC, XGB, SVC, ADB, DT, and GBM, and eight classifier measuring performance metrics like ramification accuracy, precision, F1 score, specificity, ROC, sensitivity, log-loss, and Matthews' correlation coefficient, as well as eight classification performance evaluations. Our method can easily differentiate between people who have cardiac disease and those are normal. Receiver optimistic curves and also the region under the curves were determined by every classifier. Most of the classifiers, pretreatment strategies, validation methods, and performance assessment metrics for classification models have been discussed in this study. The performance of the proposed scheme has been confirmed, utilizing all of its capabilities. In this work, the impact of clinical decision support systems was evaluated using a stacked ensemble approach that included these nine algorithms ",

    "abstract": "Logic locking has been proposed to safeguard intellectual property (IP) during chip fabrication. Logic locking techniques protect hardware IP by making a subset of combinational modules in a design dependent on a secret key that is withheld from untrusted parties. If an incorrect secret key is used, a set of deterministic errors is produced in locked modules, restricting unauthorized use. A common target for logic locking is neural accelerators, especially as machine-learning-as-a-service becomes more prevalent. In this work, we explore how logic locking can be used to compromise the security of a neural accelerator it protects. Specifically, we show how the deterministic errors caused by incorrect keys can be harnessed to produce neural-trojan-style backdoors. To do so, we first outline a motivational attack scenario where a carefully chosen incorrect key, which we call a trojan key, produces misclassifications for an attacker-specified input class in a locked accelerator. We then develop a theoretically-robust attack methodology to automatically identify trojan keys. To evaluate this attack, we launch it on several locked accelerators. In our largest benchmark accelerator, our attack identified a trojan key that caused a 74\\% decrease in classification accuracy for attacker-specified trigger inputs, while degrading accuracy by only 1.7\\% for other inputs on average.

    "abstract": "Federated learning (FL) enables multiple sites to collaboratively train powerful deep models without compromising data privacy and security. The statistical heterogeneity (e.g., non-IID data and domain shifts) is a primary obstacle in FL, impairing the generalization performance of the global model. Weakly supervised segmentation, which uses sparsely-grained (i.e., point-, bounding box-, scribble-, block-wise) supervision, is increasingly being paid attention to due to its great potential of reducing annotation costs. However, there may exist label heterogeneity, i.e., different annotation forms across sites. In this paper, we propose a novel personalized FL framework for medical image segmentation, named FedICRA, which uniformly leverages heterogeneous weak supervision via adaptIve Contrastive Representation and Aggregation. Concretely, to facilitate personalized modeling and to avoid confusion, a channel selection based site contrastive representation module is employed to adaptively cluster intra-site embeddings and separate inter-site ones. To effectively integrate the common knowledge from the global model with the unique knowledge from each local model, an adaptive aggregation module is applied for updating and initializing local models at the element level. Additionally, a weakly supervised objective function that leverages a multiscale tree energy loss and a gated CRF loss is employed to generate more precise pseudo-labels and further boost the segmentation performance. Through extensive experiments on two distinct medical image segmentation tasks of different modalities, the proposed FedICRA demonstrates overwhelming performance over other state-of-the-art personalized FL methods. Its performance even approaches that of fully supervised training on centralized data. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/llmir/FedICRA. ",

    "abstract": "Sensory perception (e.g. vision) relies on a hierarchy of cortical areas, in which neural activity propagates in both directions, to convey information not only about sensory inputs but also about cognitive states, expectations and predictions. At the macroscopic scale, neurophysiological experiments have described the corresponding neural signals as both forward and backward-travelling waves, sometimes with characteristic oscillatory signatures. It remains unclear, however, how such activity patterns relate to specific functional properties of the perceptual apparatus. Here, we present a mathematical framework, inspired by neural network models of predictive coding, to systematically investigate neural dynamics in a hierarchical perceptual system. We show that stability of the system can be systematically derived from the values of hyper-parameters controlling the different signals (related to bottom-up inputs, top-down prediction and error correction). Similarly, it is possible to determine in which direction, and at what speed neural activity propagates in the system. Different neural assemblies (reflecting distinct eigenvectors of the connectivity matrices) can simultaneously and independently display different properties in terms of stability, propagation speed or direction. We also derive continuous-limit versions of the system, both in time and in neural space. Finally, we analyze the possible influence of transmission delays between layers, and reveal the emergence of oscillations at biologically plausible frequencies. ",

    "abstract": "In our study, we apply different statistical models to nowcast quarterly GDP growth for the US economy. Using the monthly FRED-MD database, we compare the nowcasting performance of the dynamic factor model (DFM) and four artificial neural networks (ANNs): the multilayer perceptron (MLP), the one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D CNN), the long short-term memory network (LSTM), and the gated recurrent unit (GRU). The empirical analysis presents the results from two distinctively different evaluation periods. The first (2010:Q1 -- 2019:Q4) is characterized by balanced economic growth, while the second (2010:Q1 -- 2022:Q3) also includes periods of the COVID-19 recession. According to our results, longer input sequences result in more accurate nowcasts in periods of balanced economic growth. However, this effect ceases above a relatively low threshold value of around six quarters (eighteen months). During periods of economic turbulence (e.g., during the COVID-19 recession), longer training sequences do not help the models' predictive performance; instead, they seem to weaken their generalization capability. Our results show that 1D CNN, with the same parameters, generates accurate nowcasts in both of our evaluation periods. Consequently, first in the literature, we propose the use of this specific neural network architecture for economic nowcasting. ",

Recent advances in neural network-based causal discovery methods have significantly improved causal discovery, including handling interventional data, improvements in performance and scalability. However, applying state-of-the-art (SOTA) causal discovery methods in biology poses challenges, such as noisy data and a large number of samples. Thus, adapting the causal discovery methods is necessary to handle these challenges. In this paper, we introduce DiscoGen, a neural network-based GRN discovery method that can denoise gene expression measurements and handle interventional data. We demonstrate that our model outperforms SOTA neural network-based causal discovery methods. ",

Previous studies have relied on functional connectivity methods to infer brain graph structures and used simple GNN architectures for the diagnosis of AD. In this work, we propose a novel adaptive gated graph convolutional network (AGGCN) that can provide explainable predictions. AGGCN adaptively learns graph structures by combining convolution-based node feature enhancement with a well-known correlation-based measure of functional connectivity. Furthermore, the gated graph convolution can dynamically weigh the contribution of various spatial scales. The proposed model achieves high accuracy in both eyes-closed and eyes-open conditions, indicating the stability of learned representations. Finally, we demonstrate that the proposed AGGCN model generates consistent explanations of its predictions that might be relevant for further study of AD-related alterations of brain networks. ",

It is desirable to automatically detect and remove them in recordings, as they affect the fluency, confidence, and professionalism of speech. Previous studies and our preliminary experiments reveal that the biggest challenge in filler word detection is that fillers can be easily confused with other hard categories like ``a\" or ``I\". In this paper, we propose a novel filler word detection method that effectively addresses this challenge by adding auxiliary categories dynamically and applying an additional inter-category focal loss. The auxiliary categories force the model to explicitly model the confusing words by mining hard categories. In addition, inter-category focal loss adaptively adjusts the penalty weight between ``filler\" and ``non-filler\" categories to deal with other confusing words left in the ``non-filler\" category. Our system achieves the best results, with a huge improvement compared to other methods on the PodcastFillers dataset. ",

Our heterogeneous computer successfully performs probabilistic inference and asynchronous Boltzmann learning despite device-to-device variations in sMTJs. A comprehensive comparison using a CMOS predictive process design kit (PDK) reveals that digital CMOS-based p-bits emulating high-quality randomness use over 10,000 transistors with the energy per generated random number being roughly two orders of magnitude greater than the sMTJ-based p-bits that dissipate only 2 fJ.

The grouping variable can be the confounding variable (the common cause of treatment and outcome), gender, case/control, ethnicity, etc. Given the covariates and a binary latent variable, the goal is to construct two directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), while sharing some common parameters. The set of nodes, which represent the variables, are the same for both groups but the directed edges between nodes, which represent the causal relationships between the variables, can be potentially different. For each group, we also estimate the effect size for each node. We assume that each group follows a Gaussian distribution under its DAG. Given the parent nodes, the joint distribution of DAG is conditionally independent due to the Markov property of DAGs. We introduce the concept of Gaussian DAG-probit model under two groups and hence doubly Gaussian DAG-probit model. To estimate the skeleton of the DAGs and the model parameters, we took samples from the posterior distribution of doubly Gaussian DAG-probit model via MCMC method. We validated the proposed method using a comprehensive simulation experiment and applied it on two real datasets. Furthermore, we validated the results of the real data analysis using well-known experimental studies to show the value of the proposed grouping variable in the causality domain. ",
