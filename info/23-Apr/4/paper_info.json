    "title": "Towards Reasonable Budget Allocation in Untargeted Graph Structure  Attacks via Gradient Debias",
    "abstract": "It has become cognitive inertia to employ cross-entropy loss function in classification related tasks. In the untargeted attacks on graph structure, the gradients derived from the attack objective are the attacker's basis for evaluating a perturbation scheme. Previous methods use negative cross-entropy loss as the attack objective in attacking node-level classification models. However, the suitability of the cross-entropy function for constructing the untargeted attack objective has yet been discussed in previous works. This paper argues about the previous unreasonable attack objective from the perspective of budget allocation. We demonstrate theoretically and empirically that negative cross-entropy tends to produce more significant gradients from nodes with lower confidence in the labeled classes, even if the predicted classes of these nodes have been misled. To free up these inefficient attack budgets, we propose a simple attack model for untargeted attacks on graph structure based on a novel attack objective which generates unweighted gradients on graph structures that are not affected by the node confidence. By conducting experiments in gray-box poisoning attack scenarios, we demonstrate that a reasonable budget allocation can significantly improve the effectiveness of gradient-based edge perturbations without any extra hyper-parameter.

    "abstract": "Scientific workflows have become integral tools in broad scientific computing use cases. Science discovery is increasingly dependent on workflows to orchestrate large and complex scientific experiments that range from execution of a cloud-based data preprocessing pipeline to multi-facility instrument-to-edge-to-HPC computational workflows. Given the changing landscape of scientific computing and the evolving needs of emerging scientific applications, it is paramount that the development of novel scientific workflows and system functionalities seek to increase the efficiency, resilience, and pervasiveness of existing systems and applications. Specifically, the proliferation of machine learning/artificial intelligence (ML/AI) workflows, need for processing large scale datasets produced by instruments at the edge, intensification of near real-time data processing, support for long-term experiment campaigns, and emergence of quantum computing as an adjunct to HPC, have significantly changed the functional and operational requirements of workflow systems. Workflow systems now need to, for example, support data streams from the edge-to-cloud-to-HPC enable the management of many small-sized files, allow data reduction while ensuring high accuracy, orchestrate distributed services (workflows, instruments, data movement, provenance, publication, etc.) across computing and user facilities, among others. Further, to accelerate science, it is also necessary that these systems implement specifications/standards and APIs for seamless (horizontal and vertical) integration between systems and applications, as well as enabling the publication of workflows and their associated products according to the FAIR principles. This document reports on discussions and findings from the 2022 international edition of the Workflows Community Summit that took place on November 29 and 30, 2022. ",

    "abstract": "Data-driven method for Structural Health Monitoring (SHM), that mine the hidden structural performance from the correlations among monitored time series data, has received widely concerns recently. However, missing data significantly impacts the conduction of this method. Missing data is a frequently encountered issue in time series data in SHM and many other real-world applications, that harms to the standardized data mining and downstream tasks, such as condition assessment. Imputation approaches based on spatiotemporal relations among monitoring data are developed to handle this issue, however, no additional information is added during imputation. This paper thus develops a robust method for damage identification that considers the missing data occasions, based on long-short term memory (LSTM) model and dropout mechanism in the autoencoder (AE) framework. Inputs channels are randomly dropped to simulate the missing data in training, and reconstruction errors are used as the loss function and the damage indicator. Quasi-static response (cable tension) of a cable-stayed bridge released in 1st IPC-SHM is employed to verify this proposed method, and results show that the missing data imputation and damage identification can be implemented together in a unified way.

Most reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms address this challenge by improved credit assignment, introducing memory capability, altering the agent's intrinsic motivation (i.e. exploration) or its worldview (i.e. knowledge representation). Many of these components could be learned from offline data. In this work, we follow the hypothesis that exploration and representation learning can be improved by separately learning two different models from a single offline dataset. We show that learning a state representation using noise-contrastive estimation and a model of auxiliary reward separately from a single collection of human demonstrations can significantly improve the sample efficiency on the challenging NetHack benchmark.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we present a residual neural network-based method for point set registration. Given a target and a reference point cloud, the goal is to learn a minimal transformation that aligns the target to the reference under the constraint that the topological structure of the target point cloud is preserved. Similar to coherent point drift (CPD), the registration (alignment) problem is viewed as the movement of data points sampled from a target distribution along a regularized displacement vector field. While the coherence constraint in CPD is stated in terms of local motion coherence, the proposed regularization term relies on a global smoothness constraint as a proxy for preserving local topology. This makes CPD less flexible when the deformation is locally rigid but globally non-rigid as in the case of multiple objects and articulate pose registration. To mitigate these issues, a Jacobian-based cost function along with geometric-aware statistical distances is proposed. The latter allows for measuring misalignment between the target and the reference. The justification for the kNN-graph preservation of target data, when the Jacobian cost is used, is also provided. Further, a stochastic approximation for high dimensional registration is introduced to make a high-dimensional alignment feasible. The proposed method is tested on high-dimensional Flow Cytometry to align two data distributions whilst preserving the kNN-graph of the data. The implementation of the proposed approach is available at https://github.com/MuhammadSaeedBatikh/kNN-Res_Demo/ under the MIT license. ",

To tackle this topic, in this paper, we study the problem of adversarial training and adversarial attack w.r.t. both metrics. We propose a unified structure for fairness attack which brings together common notions in group fairness, and we theoretically prove the equivalence of fairness attack against different notions. Moreover, we show the alignment of fairness and accuracy attack, and theoretically demonstrate that robustness w.r.t. one metric benefits from robustness w.r.t. the other metric. Our study suggests a novel way to unify adversarial training and attack w.r.t. fairness and accuracy, and experimental results show that our proposed method achieves better performance in terms of robustness w.r.t. both metrics.

    "abstract": "The expansion in technology and attainability of a large number of sensors has led to a huge amount of real-time streaming data. The real-time data in the electrical distribution system is collected through distribution-level phasor measurement units referred to as $\\mu$PMU which report high-resolution phasor measurements comprising various event signatures which provide situational awareness and enable a level of visibility into the distribution system. These events are infrequent, unschedule, and uncertain; it is a challenge to scrutinize, detect and predict the occurrence of such events. For electrical distribution systems, it is challenging to explicitly identify evolution functions that describe the complex, non-linear, and non-stationary signature patterns of events. In this paper, we seek to address this problem by developing a physics dynamics-based approach to detect anomalies in the $\\mu$PMU streaming data and simultaneously predict the events using governing equations. We propose a data-driven approach based on the Hankel alternative view of the Koopman (HAVOK) operator, called DynamoPMU, to analyze the underlying dynamics of the distribution system by representing them in a linear intrinsic space. The key technical idea is that the proposed method separates out the linear dynamical behaviour pattern and intermittent forcing (anomalous events) in sequential data which turns out to be very useful for anomaly detection and simultaneous data prediction. We demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed framework through analysis of real $\\mu$PMU data taken from the LBNL distribution grid. DynamoPMU is suitable for real-time event detection as well as prediction in an unsupervised way and adapts to varying statistics. ",

Secondly, an extra degree of freedom: a parameterization in terms of $\\tilde Q$, is added to this design framework. This extra design parameter is tuned iteratively from measured tracking cost function with the given disturbances and modeling uncertainties to achieve the best transient performance.

In this paper, we observe that the cosine similarity of the last layer's weight between the global model and each local update could be used effectively as an indicator of malicious model updates. Therefore, we propose CosDefense, a cosine-similarity-based attacker detection algorithm. Specifically, under CosDefense, the server calculates the cosine similarity score of the last layer's weight between the global model and each client update, labels malicious clients whose score is much higher than the average, and filters them out of the model aggregation in each round. Compared to existing defense schemes, CosDefense does not require any extra information besides the received model updates to operate and is compatible with client sampling. Experiment results on three real-world datasets demonstrate that CosDefense could provide robust performance under the state-of-the-art FL poisoning attack. ",

However, these perception maps are not perfect and result in state estimation errors that can lead to unsafe system behavior. Stochastic sensor noise can make matters worse and result in estimation errors that follow unknown distributions. We propose a perception-based control framework that i) quantifies estimation uncertainty of perception maps, and ii) integrates these uncertainty representations into the control design. To do so, we use conformal prediction to compute valid state estimation regions, which are sets that contain the unknown state with high probability. We then devise a sampled-data controller for continuous-time systems based on the notion of measurement robust control barrier functions. Our controller uses idea from self-triggered control and enables us to avoid using stochastic calculus. Our framework is agnostic to the choice of the perception map, independent of the noise distribution, and to the best of our knowledge the first to provide probabilistic safety guarantees in such a setting.

However, the original FAT suffers from catastrophic overfitting, which dramatically and suddenly reduces robustness after a few training epochs. Although various FAT variants have been proposed to prevent overfitting, they require high training costs. In this paper, we investigate the relationship between adversarial example quality and catastrophic overfitting by comparing the training processes of standard adversarial training and FAT. We find that catastrophic overfitting occurs when the attack success rate of adversarial examples becomes worse. Based on this observation, we propose a positive prior-guided adversarial initialization to prevent overfitting by improving adversarial example quality without extra training costs. This initialization is generated by using high-quality adversarial perturbations from the historical training process. We provide theoretical analysis for the proposed initialization and propose a prior-guided regularization method that boosts the smoothness of the loss function. Additionally, we design a prior-guided ensemble FAT method that averages the different model weights of historical models using different decay rates. Our proposed method, called FGSM-PGK, assembles the prior-guided knowledge, i.e., the prior-guided initialization and model weights, acquired during the historical training process. Evaluations of four datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method. ",

This paper proposes a novel method that captures both connections between entities and the intrinsic nature of entities, by simultaneously aggregating RElational Paths and cOntext with a unified hieRarchical Transformer framework, namely REPORT. REPORT relies solely on relation semantics and can naturally generalize to the fully-inductive setting, where KGs for training and inference have no common entities. In the experiments, REPORT performs consistently better than all baselines on almost all the eight version subsets of two fully-inductive datasets. Moreover.

    "title": "ConvBLS: An Effective and Efficient Incremental Convolutional Broad  Learning System for Image Classification",
    "abstract": "Deep learning generally suffers from enormous computational resources and time-consuming training processes. Broad Learning System (BLS) and its convolutional variants have been proposed to mitigate these issues and have achieved superb performance in image classification. However, the existing convolutional-based broad learning system (C-BLS) either lacks an efficient training method and incremental learning capability or suffers from poor performance. To this end, we propose a convolutional broad learning system (ConvBLS) based on the spherical K-means (SKM) algorithm and two-stage multi-scale (TSMS) feature fusion, which consists of the convolutional feature (CF) layer, convolutional enhancement (CE) layer, TSMS feature fusion layer, and output layer. First, unlike the current C-BLS, the simple yet efficient SKM algorithm is utilized to learn the weights of CF layers. Compared with random filters, the SKM algorithm makes the CF layer learn more comprehensive spatial features. Second, similar to the vanilla BLS, CE layers are established to expand the feature space. Third, the TSMS feature fusion layer is proposed to extract more effective multi-scale features through the integration of CF layers and CE layers. Thanks to the above design and the pseudo-inverse calculation of the output layer weights, our proposed ConvBLS method is unprecedentedly efficient and effective. Finally, the corresponding incremental learning algorithms are presented for rapid remodeling if the model deems to expand. Experiments and comparisons demonstrate the superiority of our method. ",

    "abstract": "We consider the problem of learning in a non-stationary reinforcement learning (RL) environment, where the setting can be fully described by a piecewise stationary discrete-time Markov decision process (MDP). We introduce a variant of the Restarted Bayesian Online Change-Point Detection algorithm (R-BOCPD) that operates on input streams originating from the more general multinomial distribution and provides near-optimal theoretical guarantees in terms of false-alarm rate and detection delay. Based on this, we propose an improved version of the UCRL2 algorithm for MDPs with state transition kernel sampled from a multinomial distribution, which we call R-BOCPD-UCRL2. We perform a finite-time performance analysis and show that R-BOCPD-UCRL2 enjoys a favorable regret bound of $O\\left(D O \\sqrt{A T K_T \\log\\left (\\frac{T}{\\delta} \\right) + \\frac{K_T \\log \\frac{K_T}{\\delta}}{\\min\\limits_\\ell \\: \\mathbf{KL}\\left( {\\mathbf{\\theta}^{(\\ell+1)}}\\mid\\mid{\\mathbf{\\theta}^{(\\ell)}}\\right)}}\\right)$, where $D$ is the largest MDP diameter from the set of MDPs defining the piecewise stationary MDP setting, $O$ is the finite number of states (constant over all changes), $A$ is the finite number of actions (constant over all changes), $K_T$ is the number of change points up to horizon $T$, and $\\mathbf{\\theta}^{(\\ell)}$ is the transition kernel during the interval $[c_\\ell, c_{\\ell+1})$, which we assume to be multinomially distributed over the set of states $\\mathbb{O}$. Interestingly, the performance bound does not directly scale with the variation in MDP state transition distributions and rewards, ie. can also model abrupt changes. In practice, R-BOCPD-UCRL2 outperforms the state-of-the-art in a variety of scenarios in synthetic environments. We provide a detailed experimental setup along with a code repository (upon publication) that can be used to easily reproduce our experiments. ",

In this paper, we propose an efficient defense strategy for cooperative defense against a group of attackers in a convex environment. The defenders aim to minimize the total number of attackers that successfully enter the target set without prior knowledge of the attacker's strategy. Our approach involves a two-scale method that decomposes the problem into coordination against a single attacker and assigning defenders to attackers. We first develop a coordination strategy for multiple defenders against a single attacker, implementing online convex programming. This results in the maximum defense-winning region of initial joint states from which the defender can successfully defend against a single attacker. We then propose an allocation algorithm that significantly reduces computational effort required to solve the induced integer linear programming problem. The allocation guarantees defense performance enhancement as the game progresses. We perform various simulations to verify the efficiency of our algorithm compared to the state-of-the-art approaches, including the one using the Gazabo platform with Robot Operating System. ",

Given a query node, the conventional approaches rely on the similarity matching with the vectorized node embeddings in the continuous Euclidean space. To efficiently manage intensive similarity computation, developing hashing techniques for graph structured data has recently become an emerging research direction. Despite the retrieval efficiency in Hamming space, prior work is however confronted with catastrophic performance decay. In this work, we investigate the problem of hashing with Graph Convolutional Network on bipartite graphs for effective Top-N search. We propose an end-to-end Bipartite Graph Convolutional Hashing approach, namely BGCH, which consists of three novel and effective modules: (1) adaptive graph convolutional hashing, (2) latent feature dispersion, and (3) Fourier serialized gradient estimation. Specifically, the former two modules achieve the substantial retention of the structural information against the inevitable information loss in hash encoding; the last module develops Fourier Series decomposition to the hashing function in the frequency domain mainly for more accurate gradient estimation. The extensive experiments on six real-world datasets not only show the performance superiority over the competing hashing-based counterparts, but also demonstrate the effectiveness of all proposed model components contained therein.

    "abstract": "Training deep neural network (DNN) models, which has become an important task in today's software development, is often costly in terms of computational resources and time. With the inspiration of software reuse, building DNN models through reusing existing ones has gained increasing attention recently. Prior approaches to DNN model reuse have two main limitations: 1) reusing the entire model, while only a small part of the model's functionalities (labels) are required, would cause much overhead (e.g., computational and time costs for inference), and 2) model reuse would inherit the defects and weaknesses of the reused model, and hence put the new system under threats of security attack. To solve the above problem, we propose SeaM, a tool that re-engineers a trained DNN model to improve its reusability. Specifically, given a target problem and a trained model, SeaM utilizes a gradient-based search method to search for the model's weights that are relevant to the target problem. The re-engineered model that only retains the relevant weights is then reused to solve the target problem. Evaluation results on widely-used models show that the re-engineered models produced by SeaM only contain 10.11% weights of the original models, resulting 42.41% reduction in terms of inference time. For the target problem, the re-engineered models even outperform the original models in classification accuracy by 5.85%. Moreover, reusing the re-engineered models inherits an average of 57% fewer defects than reusing the entire model. We believe our approach to reducing reuse overhead and defect inheritance is one important step forward for practical model reuse. ",

Such attacks compromise the RL system's reliability, leading to potentially catastrophic results in various key fields. In contrast, relatively limited research has investigated effective defenses against backdoor attacks in RL. This paper proposes the Recovery Triggered States (RTS) method, a novel approach that effectively protects the victim agents from backdoor attacks. RTS involves building a surrogate network to approximate the dynamics model. Developers can then recover the environment from the triggered state to a clean state, thereby preventing attackers from activating backdoors hidden in the agent by presenting the trigger. When training the surrogate to predict states, we incorporate agent action information to reduce the discrepancy between the actions taken by the agent on predicted states and the actions taken on real states. RTS is the first approach to defend against backdoor attacks in a single-agent setting. Our results show that using RTS, the cumulative reward only decreased by 1.41% under the backdoor attack. ",

    "abstract": "The recent detection transformer (DETR) has advanced object detection, but its application on resource-constrained devices requires massive computation and memory resources. Quantization stands out as a solution by representing the network in low-bit parameters and operations. However, there is a significant performance drop when performing low-bit quantized DETR (Q-DETR) with existing quantization methods. We find that the bottlenecks of Q-DETR come from the query information distortion through our empirical analyses. This paper addresses this problem based on a distribution rectification distillation (DRD). We formulate our DRD as a bi-level optimization problem, which can be derived by generalizing the information bottleneck (IB) principle to the learning of Q-DETR. At the inner level, we conduct a distribution alignment for the queries to maximize the self-information entropy. At the upper level, we introduce a new foreground-aware query matching scheme to effectively transfer the teacher information to distillation-desired features to minimize the conditional information entropy. Extensive experimental results show that our method performs much better than prior arts. For example, the 4-bit Q-DETR can theoretically accelerate DETR with ResNet-50 backbone by 6.6x and achieve 39.4% AP, with only 2.6% performance gaps than its real-valued counterpart on the COCO dataset.

Existing methods are mostly two-stage based, with one stage for person bounding box generation and the other stage for action recognition. However, such two-stage methods are generally with low efficiency. We observe that directly unifying detection and action recognition normally suffers from (i) inferior learning due to different desired properties of context representation for detection and action recognition; (ii) optimization difficulty with insufficient training data. In this work, we present a decoupled one-stage network dubbed DOAD, to mitigate above issues and improve the efficiency for spatio-temporal action detection. To achieve it, we decouple detection and action recognition into two branches. Specifically, one branch focuses on detection representation for actor detection, and the other one for action recognition. For the action branch, we design a transformer-based module (TransPC) to model pairwise relationships between people and context. Different from commonly used vector-based dot product in self-attention, it is built upon a novel matrix-based key and value for Hadamard attention to model person-context information. It not only exploits relationships between person pairs but also takes into account context and relative position information. The results on AVA and UCF101-24 datasets show that our method is competitive with two-stage state-of-the-art methods with significant efficiency improvement. ",

In the realization, the salience mechanism is used as a metric of channel salience to guide pruning. Therefore, salience-based channel pruning can dynamically adjust the channel width at run-time, which provides a flexible pruning scheme. However, there are two problems emerging: a gating function is often needed to truncate the specific salience entries to zero, which destabilizes the forward propagation; dynamic architecture brings more cost for indexing in inference which bottlenecks the inference speed. In this paper, we propose a Progressive Channel-Shrinking (PCS) method to compress the selected salience entries at run-time instead of roughly approximating them to zero. We also propose a Running Shrinking Policy to provide a testing-static pruning scheme that can reduce the memory access cost for filter indexing. We evaluate our method on ImageNet and CIFAR10 datasets over two prevalent networks: ResNet and VGG, and demonstrate that our PCS outperforms all baselines and achieves state-of-the-art in terms of compression-performance tradeoff.

Given the current biological sequencing data volume, learning an explicit representation is prohibitive due to the dimensionality of the resulting feature vectors. Kernel-based methods, e.g., SVM, are a proven efficient and useful alternative for several machine learning (ML) tasks such as sequence classification. Three challenges with kernel methods are (i) the computation time, (ii) the memory usage (storing an $n\\times n$ matrix), and (iii) the usage of kernel matrices limited to kernel-based ML methods (difficult to generalize on non-kernel classifiers). While (i) can be solved using approximate methods, challenge (ii) remains for typical kernel methods. Similarly, although non-kernel-based ML methods can be applied to kernel matrices by extracting principal components (kernel PCA), it may result in information loss, while being computationally expensive. In this paper, we propose a general-purpose representation learning approach that embodies kernel methods' qualities while avoiding computation, memory, and generalizability challenges. This involves computing a low-dimensional embedding of each sequence, using random projections of its $k$-mer frequency vectors, significantly reducing the computation needed to compute the dot product and the memory needed to store the resulting representation. Our proposed fast and alignment-free embedding method can be used as input to any distance (e.g., $k$ nearest neighbors) and non-distance (e.g., decision tree) based ML method for classification and clustering tasks. Using different forms of biological sequences as input, we perform a variety of real-world classification tasks, such as SARS-CoV-2 lineage and gene family classification, outperforming several state-of-the-art embedding and kernel methods in predictive performance.

    "title": "Improving the Performance of OFDMA-based Wi-Fi Network with Hybrid  Medium Access Control Protocol Design",
    "abstract": "Nowadays, IEEE 802.11, i.e., Wi-Fi has emerged as a prevailing technology for broadband wireless networking. To meet the tremendous rise of demand for future generation wireless LANs, a robust and efficient MAC protocol is required for the Wi-Fi network. However, traditional MAC mechanisms are not suitable for next-generation communications due to some inherent constraints. In this regard, OFDMA technology could be adopted to design an efficient MAC protocol for the Wi-Fi network. The purpose of this research is to provide a high-speed network for Wi-Fi users. The thesis presents three MAC protocols, namely, HTFA (High Throughput and Fair Access), ERA (Efficient Resource Allocation), and PRS (Proportional Resource Scheduling), by employing the OFDMA technology. The novel protocols improve Wi-Fi communication using the latest IEEE 802.11ax standard, i.e., Wi-Fi 6. In particular, the protocols improve several performance parameters of the MAC protocol, such as increasing the throughput, goodput, fairness index, and reducing the packet retransmissions, collisions, etc. Simulation results validate that the new protocols are far better than the existing protocols. The protocols designed in this thesis are compliant with the latest IEEE 802.11ax standard that promises to enhance the throughput at least four times per user and support ten times users. Thus, the new protocols can ensure uninterrupted and smooth communication in highly dense environments. The thesis contains a lot of resources such as the state of the art of MAC protocols, analysis of contemporary protocols and their performance matrix; architecture of Wi-Fi system, OFDMA constraints and regulations; framework of protocols; analytical models; relevant data, theory, and methods; etc. that would be the valuable resources to the future researchers for the research on the Wi-Fi network.

Context-based RL employs a context encoder to rapidly adapt the agent to new tasks by inferring about the task representation, and then adjusting the acting policy based on the inferred task representation. Here we consider context-based OMRL, in particular, the issue of task representation learning for OMRL. We empirically demonstrate that the context encoder trained on offline datasets could suffer from distribution shift between the contexts used for training and testing. To tackle this issue, we propose a hard sampling based strategy for learning a robust task context encoder. Experimental results, based on distinct continuous control tasks, demonstrate that the utilization of our technique results in more robust task representations and better testing performance in terms of accumulated returns, compared with baseline methods.

Inspired by CompoundE and Rotate3D, we leverage 3D compound geometric transformations, including translation, rotation, scaling, reflection, and shear and propose a family of KGE models, named CompoundE3D, in this work. CompoundE3D allows multiple design variants to match rich underlying characteristics of a KG. Since each variant has its own advantages on a subset of relations, an ensemble of multiple variants can yield superior performance. The effectiveness and flexibility of CompoundE3D are experimentally verified on four popular link prediction datasets. ",

    "abstract": "Supervised learning of skeleton sequence encoders for action recognition has received significant attention in recent times. However, learning such encoders without labels continues to be a challenging problem. While prior works have shown promising results by applying contrastive learning to pose sequences, the quality of the learned representations is often observed to be closely tied to data augmentations that are used to craft the positives. However, augmenting pose sequences is a difficult task as the geometric constraints among the skeleton joints need to be enforced to make the augmentations realistic for that action. In this work, we propose a new contrastive learning approach to train models for skeleton-based action recognition without labels. Our key contribution is a simple module, HaLP - to Hallucinate Latent Positives for contrastive learning. Specifically, HaLP explores the latent space of poses in suitable directions to generate new positives. To this end, we present a novel optimization formulation to solve for the synthetic positives with an explicit control on their hardness. We propose approximations to the objective, making them solvable in closed form with minimal overhead. We show via experiments that using these generated positives within a standard contrastive learning framework leads to consistent improvements across benchmarks such as NTU-60, NTU-120, and PKU-II on tasks like linear evaluation, transfer learning, and kNN evaluation.

    "abstract": "Serverless cloud is an innovative cloud service model that frees customers from most cloud management duties. It also offers the same advantages as other cloud models but at much lower costs. As a result, the serverless cloud has been increasingly employed in high-impact areas such as system security, banking, and health care. A big threat to the serverless cloud's performance is cold-start, which is when the time of provisioning the needed cloud resource to serve customers' requests incurs unacceptable costs to the service providers and/or the customers. This paper proposes a novel low-coupling, high-cohesion ensemble policy that addresses the cold-start problem at infrastructure- and function-levels of the serverless cloud stack, while the state of the art policies have a more narrowed focus. This ensemble policy anchors on the prediction of function instance arrivals, 10 to 15 minutes into the future. It is achievable by using the temporal convolutional network (TCN) deep-learning method. Bench-marking results on a real-world dataset from a large-scale serverless cloud provider show that TCN out-performs other popular machine learning algorithms for time series. Going beyond cold-start management, the proposed policy and publicly available codes can be adopted in solving other cloud problems such as optimizing the provisioning of virtual software-defined network assets.

Our new dataset contains 150 CWEs, 26,635 vulnerable functions, and 352,606 non-vulnerable functions extracted from 7,861 commits. Our dataset covers 305 more projects than all previous datasets combined. We show that increasing the diversity and volume of training data improves the performance of deep learning models for vulnerability detection. Combining our new dataset with previous datasets, we present an analysis of the challenges and promising research directions of using deep learning for detecting software vulnerabilities. We study 11 model architectures belonging to 4 families. Our results show that deep learning is still not ready for vulnerability detection, due to high false positive rate, low F1 score, and difficulty of detecting hard CWEs. In particular, we demonstrate an important generalization challenge for the deployment of deep learning-based models. However, we also identify hopeful future research directions. We demonstrate that large language models (LLMs) are the future for vulnerability detection, outperforming Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with manual feature engineering. Moreover, developing source code specific pre-training objectives is a promising research direction to improve the vulnerability detection performance. ",

To date, existing incomplete multi-view clustering methods usually bypass unavailable views according to prior missing information, which is considered as a second-best scheme based on evasion. Other methods that attempt to recover missing information are mostly applicable to specific two-view datasets. To handle these problems, in this paper, we propose an information recovery-driven deep incomplete multi-view clustering network, termed as RecFormer. Concretely, a two-stage autoencoder network with the self-attention structure is built to synchronously extract high-level semantic representations of multiple views and recover the missing data. Besides, we develop a recurrent graph reconstruction mechanism that cleverly leverages the restored views to promote the representation learning and the further data reconstruction. Visualization of recovery results are given and sufficient experimental results confirm that our RecFormer has obvious advantages over other top methods. ",

However, the impact of a Trojan attack is reduced during fine-tuning of the model, which involves transferring knowledge from a pretrained large-scale model like visual question answering (VQA) to the target model. To mitigate the effects of a Trojan attack, replacing and fine-tuning multiple layers of the pretrained model is possible. This research focuses on sample efficiency, stealthiness and variation, and robustness to model fine-tuning. To address these challenges, we propose an instance-level Trojan attack that generates diverse Trojans across input samples and modalities. Adversarial learning establishes a correlation between a specified perturbation layer and the misbehavior of the fine-tuned model. We conducted extensive experiments on the VQA-v2 dataset using a range of metrics. The results show that our proposed method can effectively adapt to a fine-tuned model with minimal samples. Specifically, we found that a model with a single fine-tuning layer can be compromised using a single shot of adversarial samples, while a model with more fine-tuning layers can be compromised using only a few shots.

However, inaccuracy in detecting an event can often result from its preceding or delayed effects reflected in neighboring detections. These detections are valuable to trigger necessary actions or help mitigate unwelcome consequences.

There is a demand for metrics that incorporate both the concept of time and temporal tolerance for neighboring detections. This paper introduces SoftED metrics, a new set of metrics designed for soft evaluating event detection methods. They enable the evaluation of both detection accuracy and the degree to which their detections represent events. They improved event detection evaluation by associating events and their representative detections, incorporating temporal tolerance in over 36\\% of experiments compared to the usual classification metrics. SoftED metrics were validated by domain specialists that indicated their contribution to detection evaluation and method selection. ",

Previous multiview registration methods rely on exhaustive pairwise registration to construct a densely-connected pose graph and apply Iteratively Reweighted Least Square (IRLS) on the pose graph to compute the scan poses. However, constructing a densely-connected graph is time-consuming and contains lots of outlier edges, which makes the subsequent IRLS struggle to find correct poses. To address the above problems, we first propose to use a neural network to estimate the overlap between scan pairs, which enables us to construct a sparse but reliable pose graph. Then, we design a novel history reweighting function in the IRLS scheme, which has strong robustness to outlier edges on the graph. In comparison with existing multiview registration methods, our method achieves 11% higher registration recall on the 3DMatch dataset and ~13% lower registration errors on the ScanNet dataset while reducing ~70% required pairwise registrations. Comprehensive ablation studies are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of our designs. ",

Earlier work in the optimal recovery literature has shown that minimizing a regularized objective produces optimal solutions for a general class of problems, but did not fully identify the regularization parameter. Our main contribution provides a way to compute regularization parameters that are optimal or near-optimal (depending on the setting), specifically for graph signal processing problems. Our results offer a new interpretation for classical optimization techniques in graph-based learning and also come with new insights for hyperparameter selection.

We explicitly characterise the visited saddles as well as the jumping times through a recursive algorithm reminiscent of the Homotopy algorithm used for computing the Lasso path. Our proof leverages a convenient arc-length time-reparametrisation which enables to keep track of the heteroclinic transitions between the jumps. Our analysis requires negligible assumptions on the data, applies to both under and overparametrised settings and covers complex cases where there is no monotonicity of the number of active coordinates.

Hence, the performance of ellipsoid fitting is affected by distance metric. In this paper, we proposed a novel distance metric called the axial distance, which is converted from the algebraic distance by introducing a scaling factor to solve nongeometric problems of the algebraic distance. There is complementarity between the axial distance and Sampson distance because their combination is a stricter metric when calculating the model score of sample consensus and the weight of the weighted least squares (WLS) fitting. Subsequently, a novel sample-consensus-based ellipsoid fitting method is proposed by using the combination between the axial distance and Sampson distance (CAS). We compare the proposed method with several representative fitting methods through experiments on synthetic and real datasets. The results show that the proposed method has a higher robustness against outliers, consistently high accuracy, and a speed close to that of the method based on sample consensus. ",

For recent methods targeting real-world denoising, they either suffer from ignoring this spatial correlation, or are limited by the destruction of fine textures for under-considering the correlation. In this paper, we present a novel method called LG-BPN for self-supervised real-world denoising, which takes the spatial correlation statistic into our network design for local detail restoration, and also brings the long-range dependencies modeling ability to previously CNN-based BSN methods. First, based on the correlation statistic, we propose a densely-sampled patch-masked convolution module. By taking more neighbor pixels with low noise correlation into account, we enable a denser local receptive field, preserving more useful information for enhanced fine structure recovery. Second, we propose a dilated Transformer block to allow distant context exploitation in BSN. This global perception addresses the intrinsic deficiency of BSN, whose receptive field is constrained by the blind spot requirement, which can not be fully resolved by the previous CNN-based BSNs. These two designs enable LG-BPN to fully exploit both the detailed structure and the global interaction in a blind manner. Extensive results on real-world datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our method. https://github.com/Wang-XIaoDingdd/LGBPN ",

    "title": "Dynamic Crowd Vetting: Collaborative Detection of Malicious Robots in  Dynamic Communication Networks",
    "abstract": "Coordination in a large number of networked robots is a challenging task, especially when robots are constantly moving around the environment and there are malicious attacks within the network. Various approaches in the literature exist for detecting malicious robots, such as message sampling or suspicious behavior analysis. However, these approaches require every robot to sample every other robot in the network, leading to a slow detection process that degrades team performance. This paper introduces a method that significantly decreases the detection time for legitimate robots to identify malicious robots in a scenario where legitimate robots are randomly moving around the environment. Our method leverages the concept of ``Dynamic Crowd Vetting\" by utilizing observations from random encounters and trusted neighboring robots' opinions to quickly improve the accuracy of detecting malicious robots. The key intuition is that as long as each legitimate robot accurately estimates the legitimacy of at least some fixed subset of the team, the second-hand information they receive from trusted neighbors is enough to correct any misclassifications and provide accurate trust estimations of the rest of the team. We show that the size of this fixed subset can be characterized as a function of fundamental graph and random walk properties. Furthermore, we formally show that as the number of robots in the team increases the detection time remains constant. We develop a closed form expression for the critical number of time-steps required for our algorithm to successfully identify the true legitimacy of each robot to within a specified failure probability. Our theoretical results are validated through simulations demonstrating significant reductions in detection time when compared to previous works that do not leverage trusted neighbor information. ",

However, most of the studies required a large parallel dataset which is scarce and expensive to construct and even unavailable for some languages. This paper presents a simple yet effective method to tackle this problem for low-resource languages by augmenting high-quality sentence pairs and training NMT models in a semi-supervised manner. Specifically, our approach combines the cross-entropy loss for supervised learning with KL Divergence for unsupervised fashion given pseudo and augmented target sentences derived from the model. We also introduce a SentenceBERT-based filter to enhance the quality of augmenting data by retaining semantically similar sentence pairs. Experimental results show that our approach significantly improves NMT baselines, especially on low-resource datasets with 0.46--2.03 BLEU scores. We also demonstrate that using unsupervised training for augmented data is more efficient than reusing the ground-truth target sentences for supervised learning. ",

    "abstract": "Many sequential decision-making problems that are currently automated, such as those in manufacturing or recommender systems, operate in an environment where there is either little uncertainty, or zero risk of catastrophe. As companies and researchers attempt to deploy autonomous systems in less constrained environments, it is increasingly important that we endow sequential decision-making algorithms with the ability to reason about uncertainty and risk. In this thesis, we will address both planning and reinforcement learning (RL) approaches to sequential decision-making. In the planning setting, it is assumed that a model of the environment is provided, and a policy is optimised within that model. Reinforcement learning relies upon extensive random exploration, and therefore usually requires a simulator in which to perform training. In many real-world domains, it is impossible to construct a perfectly accurate model or simulator. Therefore, the performance of any policy is inevitably uncertain due to the incomplete knowledge about the environment. Furthermore, in stochastic domains, the outcome of any given run is also uncertain due to the inherent randomness of the environment. These two sources of uncertainty are usually classified as epistemic, and aleatoric uncertainty, respectively. The over-arching goal of this thesis is to contribute to developing algorithms that mitigate both sources of uncertainty in sequential decision-making problems. We make a number of contributions towards this goal, with a focus on model-based algorithms... ",

    "abstract": "Scene graph generation is conventionally evaluated by (mean) Recall@K, which measures the ratio of correctly predicted triplets that appear in the ground truth. However, such triplet-oriented metrics cannot capture the global semantic information of scene graphs, and measure the similarity between images and generated scene graphs. The usability of scene graphs is therefore limited in downstream tasks. To address this issue, a framework that can measure the similarity of scene graphs and images is urgently required. Motivated by the successful application of Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP), we propose a novel contrastive learning framework consisting of a graph Transformer and an image Transformer to align scene graphs and their corresponding images in the shared latent space. To enable the graph Transformer to comprehend the scene graph structure and extract representative features, we introduce a graph serialization technique that transforms a scene graph into a sequence with structural encoding. Based on our framework, we introduce R-Precision measuring image retrieval accuracy as a new evaluation metric for scene graph generation and establish new benchmarks for the Visual Genome and Open Images datasets. A series of experiments are further conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the graph Transformer, which shows great potential as a scene graph encoder. ",

Finally, an academic dialogue benchmark is constructed to evaluate the quality of dialogue systems in academic scenarios and the source code is available online. ",

    "abstract": "We propose two distributed iterative algorithms that can be used to solve, in finite time, the distributed optimization problem over quadratic local cost functions in large-scale networks. The first algorithm exhibits synchronous operation whereas the second one exhibits asynchronous operation. Both algorithms share salient features. Specifically, the algorithms operate exclusively with quantized values, which means that the information stored, processed and exchanged between neighboring nodes is subject to deterministic uniform quantization. The algorithms rely on event-driven updates in order to reduce energy consumption, communication bandwidth, network congestion, and/or processor usage. Finally, once the algorithms converge, nodes distributively terminate their operation. We prove that our algorithms converge in a finite number of iterations to the exact optimal solution depending on the quantization level, and we present applications of our algorithms to (i) optimal task scheduling for data centers, and (ii) global model aggregation for distributed federated learning. We provide simulations of these applications to illustrate the operation, performance, and advantages of the proposed algorithms. Additionally, it is shown that our proposed algorithms compare favorably to algorithms in the current literature. Quantized communication and asynchronous updates increase the required time to completion, but finite-time operation is maintained. ",

    "abstract": "Cascaded computation, whereby predictions are recurrently refined over several stages, has been a persistent theme throughout the development of landmark detection models. In this work, we show that the recently proposed Deep Equilibrium Model (DEQ) can be naturally adapted to this form of computation. Our Landmark DEQ (LDEQ) achieves state-of-the-art performance on the challenging WFLW facial landmark dataset, reaching $3.92$ NME with fewer parameters and a training memory cost of $\\mathcal{O}(1)$ in the number of recurrent modules. Furthermore, we show that DEQs are particularly suited for landmark detection in videos. In this setting, it is typical to train on still images due to the lack of labelled videos. This can lead to a ``flickering'' effect at inference time on video, whereby a model can rapidly oscillate between different plausible solutions across consecutive frames. By rephrasing DEQs as a constrained optimization, we emulate recurrence at inference time, despite not having access to temporal data at training time. This Recurrence without Recurrence (RwR) paradigm helps in reducing landmark flicker, which we demonstrate by introducing a new metric, normalized mean flicker (NMF), and contributing a new facial landmark video dataset (WFLW-V) targeting landmark uncertainty. On the WFLW-V hard subset made up of $500$ videos, our LDEQ with RwR improves the NME and NMF by $10$ and $13\\%$ respectively, compared to the strongest previously published model using a hand-tuned conventional filter.

Most previous TKGC methods only consider predicting the missing links among the entities seen in the training set, while they are unable to achieve great performance in link prediction concerning newly-emerged unseen entities. Recently, a new task, i.e., TKG few-shot out-of-graph (OOG) link prediction, is proposed, where TKGC models are required to achieve great link prediction performance concerning newly-emerged entities that only have few-shot observed examples. In this work, we propose a TKGC method FITCARL that combines few-shot learning with reinforcement learning to solve this task. In FITCARL, an agent traverses through the whole TKG to search for the prediction answer. A policy network is designed to guide the search process based on the traversed path. To better address the data scarcity problem in the few-shot setting, we introduce a module that computes the confidence of each candidate action and integrate it into the policy for action selection. We also exploit the entity concept information with a novel concept regularizer to boost model performance. Experimental results show that FITCARL achieves stat-of-the-art performance on TKG few-shot OOG link prediction. ",

The authors developed ground truth data for rice field damage from the field level. At first, NDVI differences before and after the disaster are calculated to identify possible crop loss. The areas equal to and above the 0.33 threshold are marked as crop loss areas as significant changes are observed. The authors also verified crop loss areas by collecting data from local farmers. Later, different bands of satellite data (Red, Green, Blue) and (False Color Infrared) are useful to detect crop loss area. We used the NDVI different images as ground truth to train the DeepLabV3plus model. With RGB, we got IoU 0.41 and with FCI, we got IoU 0.51. As FCI uses NIR, Red, Blue bands and NDVI is normalized difference between NIR and Red bands, so greater FCI's IoU score than RGB is expected. But RGB does not perform very badly here. So, where other bands are not available, RGB can use to understand crop loss areas to some extent. The ground truth developed in this paper can be used for segmentation models with very high resolution RGB only images such as Bing, Google etc. ",

Automated network design usage becomes more critical to aid with planning the network by minimising the costs of planning and deployment. The main objective is to tackle this problem of optimisation of networks that requires taking into account multiple factors such as the equipment placement and their configuration, the optimisation of the cable routes, the optimisation of the clients' allocation and other constraints involved in the minimisation problem. An AI-based solution is proposed to automate network design, which is a task typically done manually by teams of engineers. It is a difficult task requiring significant time to complete manually.

To validate the approach, we compare the quality of the generated solutions with the handmade design ones that are deployed in the real world.

One of the primary QoS requirements of such applications is ultra-low end-to-end latency for video applications that necessitates rapid frame transfer between end-devices and edge servers using software-defined networking (SDN). Failing to guarantee such strict requirements leads to quality degradation of video applications and subsequently mission failure. In this paper, we show how a collaborative group of attackers can exploit SDN's control communications to launch Denial of Quality of Service (DQoS) attack that artificially increases end-to-end latency of video frames and yet evades detection. In particular, we show how Deep Neural Network (DNN) model training on all or partial network state information can help predict network packet drop rates with reasonable accuracy. We also show how such predictions can help design an attack model that can inflict just the right amount of added latency to the end-to-end video processing that is enough to cause considerable QoS degradation but not too much to raise suspicion. We use a realistic edge-cloud testbed on GENI platform for training data collection and demonstration of high model accuracy and attack success rate. ",

    "abstract": "With advances in image recognition technology based on deep learning, automatic video analysis by Artificial Intelligence is becoming more widespread. As the amount of video used for image recognition increases, efficient compression methods for such video data are necessary. In general, when the image quality deteriorates due to image encoding, the image recognition accuracy also falls. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a neural-network-based approach to improve image recognition accuracy, especially the object detection accuracy by applying post-processing to the encoded video. Versatile Video Coding (VVC) will be used for the video compression method, since it is the latest video coding method with the best encoding performance. The neural network is trained using the features of YOLO-v7, the latest object detection model. By using VVC as the video coding method and YOLO-v7 as the detection model, high object detection accuracy is achieved even at low bit rates. Experimental results show that the combination of the proposed method and VVC achieves better coding performance than regular VVC in object detection accuracy. ",

    "title": "A Post-Training Framework for Improving Heterogeneous Graph Neural  Networks",
    "abstract": "Recent years have witnessed the success of heterogeneous graph neural networks (HGNNs) in modeling heterogeneous information networks (HINs). In this paper, we focus on the benchmark task of HGNNs, i.e., node classification, and empirically find that typical HGNNs are not good at predicting the label of a test node whose receptive field (1) has few training nodes from the same category or (2) has multiple training nodes from different categories. A possible explanation is that their message passing mechanisms may involve noises from different categories, and cannot fully explore task-specific knowledge such as the label dependency between distant nodes. Therefore, instead of introducing a new HGNN model, we propose a general post-training framework that can be applied on any pretrained HGNNs to further inject task-specific knowledge and enhance their prediction performance. Specifically, we first design an auxiliary system that estimates node labels based on (1) a global inference module of multi-channel label propagation and (2) a local inference module of network schema-aware prediction. The mechanism of our auxiliary system can complement the pretrained HGNNs by providing extra task-specific knowledge. During the post-training process, we will strengthen both system-level and module-level consistencies to encourage the cooperation between a pretrained HGNN and our auxiliary system. In this way, both systems can learn from each other for better performance. In experiments, we apply our framework to four typical HGNNs. Experimental results on three benchmark datasets show that compared with pretrained HGNNs, our post-training framework can enhance Micro-F1 by a relative improvement of 3.9% on average.

    "abstract": "With the development of the massive satellite constellation and the on-orbit laser-based communication equipment, the wavelength routing optical satellite network (WROSN) becomes a potential solution for on-orbit, high-capacity, and high-speed communication. Since the inter-satellite links (ISLs) are time-varying, one of the fundamental considerations in the construction of the WROSN is assigning limited laser communication terminals for each satellite to establish ISLs with the visible satellites. Therefore, we propose a links assignment scheme (LAS) based on the potential edges importance matrix (PEIM) algorithm to construct a temporarily stable topology of the ISLs for a dual-layer constellation. The simulation results showed that the LAS based on the PEIM algorithm is better than LAS based on the random or Greedy algorithm in terms of node-to-node distance, node pair connectivity, wavelength demand, and transmission delay. The node pair connectivity and wavelength demand in WROSN is a trade-off problem. The research in this paper also brings a novel method for reduction of the cost of the on-board resources, that is through designing topology of the ISLs with links assignment algorithm. ",

    "abstract": "Autoencoders were widely used in many machine learning tasks thanks to their strong learning ability which has drawn great interest among researchers in the field of outlier detection. However, conventional autoencoder-based methods lacked considerations in two aspects. This limited their performance in outlier detection. First, the mean squared error used in conventional autoencoders ignored the judgment uncertainty of the autoencoder, which limited their representation ability. Second, autoencoders suffered from the abnormal reconstruction problem: some outliers can be unexpectedly reconstructed well, making them difficult to identify from the inliers. To mitigate the aforementioned issues, two novel methods were proposed in this paper. First, a novel loss function named Probabilistic Reconstruction Error (PRE) was constructed to factor in both reconstruction bias and judgment uncertainty. To further control the trade-off of these two factors, two weights were introduced in PRE producing Adjustable Probabilistic Reconstruction Error (APRE), which benefited the outlier detection in different applications. Second, a conceptually new outlier scoring method based on mean-shift (MSS) was proposed to reduce the false inliers caused by the autoencoder. Experiments on 32 real-world outlier detection datasets proved the effectiveness of the proposed methods. The combination of the proposed methods achieved 41% of the relative performance improvement compared to the best baseline. The MSS improved the performance of multiple autoencoder-based outlier detectors by an average of 20%. The proposed two methods have the potential to advance autoencoder's development in outlier detection. The code is available on www.OutlierNet.com for reproducibility. ",

Since our framework relies only on image-caption pairs with no fine-grained annotations, we identify the relevant regions to each word by computing the word-conditional visual attention using multi-modal encoder. Second, we encourage the model to focus more on hard but diverse examples by proposing a focal loss for the image-text contrastive learning (ITC) objective, which alleviates the inherent limitations of overfitting and bias issues. Last, we perform multi-modal data augmentations for self-supervised learning via mining various examples by masking texts and rendering distortions on images. We show that the combination of these three innovations is effective for learning a pretrained model, leading to outstanding performance on multiple vision-language downstream tasks. ",

The usual way to obtain interpretability is to build a black-box first and then explain it using the post-hoc methods. However, the explanations provided by the post-hoc method are not always reliable. Instead, we design an intrinsically interpretable model based on RRL(Rule Representation Learner) for the Lending Club dataset. Specifically, features can be divided into three categories according to their characteristics of themselves and build three sub-networks respectively, each of which is similar to a neural network with a single hidden layer but can be equivalently converted into a set of rules. During the training, we learned tricks from previous research to effectively train binary weights. Finally, our model is compared with the tree-based model. The results show that our model is much better than the interpretable decision tree in performance and close to other black-box, which is of practical significance to both financial institutions and borrowers. More importantly, our model is used to test the correctness of the explanations generated by the post-hoc method, the results show that the post-hoc method is not always reliable. ",

Existing methods for dynamic SGG have primarily focused on capturing spatio-temporal context using complex architectures without addressing the challenges mentioned above, especially the long-tailed distribution of relationships. This often leads to the generation of biased scene graphs. To address these challenges, we introduce a new framework called TEMPURA: TEmporal consistency and Memory Prototype guided UnceRtainty Attenuation for unbiased dynamic SGG. TEMPURA employs object-level temporal consistencies via transformer-based sequence modeling, learns to synthesize unbiased relationship representations using memory-guided training, and attenuates the predictive uncertainty of visual relations using a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM). Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves significant (up to 10% in some cases) performance gain over existing methods highlighting its superiority in generating more unbiased scene graphs.

Since VAE is used, domain expertise is not required and the framework can be quickly deployed on any new device and measurement. This is expected to be useful in the compact modeling of novel devices when only device cross-sectional images and electrical characteristics are available (e.g. novel emerging memory). Technology Computer-Aided Design (TCAD) generated and hand-drawn Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor (MOS) device images and noisy drain-current-gate-voltage curves (IDVG) are used for the demonstration. The framework is formed by stacking two VAEs (one for image manifold learning and one for IDVG manifold learning) which communicate with each other through the latent variables. Five independent variables with different strengths are used. It is shown that it can perform inverse design (generate a design structure for a given IDVG) and forward prediction (predict IDVG for a given structure image, which can be used for compact modeling if the image is treated as device parameters) successfully. Since manifold learning is used, the machine is shown to be robust against noise in the inputs (i.e. using hand-drawn images and noisy IDVG curves) and not confused by weak and irrelevant independent variables.

Manual counting is tedious and often leads to inter-observer variations among pathologists.

The features may be pathologist-provided or inferred directly from visual data. We validate our model on two publicly available datasets (CoNSeP and MoNuSAC), and on MuCeD, a novel dataset that we contribute. MuCeD consists of 55 biopsy images of the human duodenum for predicting celiac disease.

In an uplink massive access scenario, device traffic is sporadic in any given coherence time.

In this work, we develop a bilinear generalized approximate message passing (BiGAMP) algorithm based on the row sparse channel matrix structure. This algorithm can jointly detect device activities, estimate channels, and detect signals in massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems by alternating updates between channel matrices and signal matrices. The signal observation provides additional information for performance improvement compared to the existing algorithms. We further analyze state evolution (SE) to measure the performance of the proposed algorithm and characterize the convergence condition for SE. Moreover, we perform theoretical analysis on the error probability of device activity detection, the mean square error of channel estimation, and the symbol error rate of signal detection. The numerical results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithm over the state-of-the-art methods in DADCE-SD, and the numerical results are relatively close to the theoretical analysis results.

This decomposition enables the application of established tools from system level synthesis to convexly over-bound all the uncertainties online, leading to a tractable nonlinear optimization problem. With this novel controller parameterization, we can formulate a convex constraint to ensure robust performance guarantees for the nonlinear system. The presented method is relevant for numerous applications related to trajectory optimization, e.g., in robotics and aerospace engineering. We demonstrate the performance of the approach and its low conservatism through the simulation example of a post-capture satellite stabilization. ",

A code with locality $(r,\\delta)$ (also called an $(r,\\delta)$-LRC) can repair up to $\\delta-1$ symbols in a codeword simultaneously by accessing at most other $r$ symbols in the codeword. An optimal $(r,\\delta)$-LRC is a code that achieves the Singleton-type bound on $r,\\delta$, the code length, the code size and the minimum distance. Constructing optimal LRCs receives wide attention recently. In this paper, we give a new method to analyze the $(r,\\delta)$-locality of cyclic codes. Via the characterization of locality, we obtain several classes of optimal $(r,\\delta)$-LRCs. When the minimum distance $d$ is greater than or equal to $2\\delta+1$, we present a class of $q$-ary optimal $(r,\\delta)$-LRCs whose code lengths are unbounded. In contrast, the existing works only show the existence of $q$-ary optimal $(r,\\delta)$-LRCs of code lengths $O(q^{1+\\frac{\\delta}{2}})$. When $d$ is in between $\\delta$ and $2\\delta$, we present five classes of optimal $(r,\\delta)$-LRCs whose lengths are unbounded. Compared with the existing constructions of optimal $(r,\\delta)$-LRCs with unbounded code lengths, three classes of our LRCs do not have the restriction of the distance $d\\leq q$. In other words, our optimal $(r,\\delta)$-LRCs can have large distance over a relatively small field, which are desired by practical requirement of high repair capability and low computation cost. Besides, for the case of the minimal value $2$ of $\\delta$, we find out all the optimal cyclic $(r,2)$-LRCs of prime power lengths. ",

Specifically, we resort to rich image pre-trained models, by which the point-cloud detector learns localizing objects under the supervision of predicted 2D bounding boxes from 2D pre-trained detectors. Moreover, we propose a novel de-biased triplet cross-modal contrastive learning to connect the modalities of image, point-cloud and text, thereby enabling the point-cloud detector to benefit from vision-language pre-trained models,i.e.,CLIP.

In this paper, we develop a model-agnostic verification framework, called DeepAgn, and show that it can be applied to FNNs, Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), or a mixture of both. Under the assumption of Lipschitz continuity, DeepAgn analyses the reachability of DNNs based on a novel optimisation scheme with a global convergence guarantee. It does not require access to the network's internal structures, such as layers and parameters. Through reachability analysis, DeepAgn can tackle several well-known robustness problems, including computing the maximum safe radius for a given input, and generating the ground-truth adversarial examples. We also empirically demonstrate DeepAgn's superior capability and efficiency in handling a broader class of deep neural networks, including both FNNs, and RNNs with very deep layers and millions of neurons, than other state-of-the-art verification approaches.

    "abstract": "A temporal graph is a graph in which edges are assigned a time label. Two nodes u and v of a temporal graph are connected one to the other if there exists a path from u to v with increasing edge time labels. We consider the problem of assigning time labels to the edges of a digraph in order to maximize the total reachability of the resulting temporal graph (that is, the number of pairs of nodes which are connected one to the other). In particular, we prove that this problem is NP-hard. We then conjecture that the problem is approximable within a constant approximation ratio. This conjecture is a consequence of the following graph theoretic conjecture: any strongly connected directed graph with n nodes admits an out-arborescence and an in-arborescence that are edge-disjoint, have the same root, and each spans $\\Omega$(n) nodes.

    "abstract": "Document-level relation extraction (DocRE) predicts relations for entity pairs that rely on long-range context-dependent reasoning in a document. As a typical multi-label classification problem, DocRE faces the challenge of effectively distinguishing a small set of positive relations from the majority of negative ones. This challenge becomes even more difficult to overcome when there exists a significant number of annotation errors in the dataset. In this work, we aim to achieve better integration of both the discriminability and robustness for the DocRE problem. Specifically, we first design an effective loss function to endow high discriminability to both probabilistic outputs and internal representations. We innovatively customize entropy minimization and supervised contrastive learning for the challenging multi-label and long-tailed learning problems. To ameliorate the impact of label errors, we equipped our method with a novel negative label sampling strategy to strengthen the model robustness. In addition, we introduce two new data regimes to mimic more realistic scenarios with annotation errors and evaluate our sampling strategy. Experimental results verify the effectiveness of each component and show that our method achieves new state-of-the-art results on the DocRED dataset, its recently cleaned version, Re-DocRED, and the proposed data regimes.

    "abstract": "The easy sharing of multimedia content on social media has caused a rapid dissemination of fake news, which threatens society's stability and security. Therefore, fake news detection has garnered extensive research interest in the field of social forensics. Current methods primarily concentrate on the integration of textual and visual features but fail to effectively exploit multi-modal information at both fine-grained and coarse-grained levels. Furthermore, they suffer from an ambiguity problem due to a lack of correlation between modalities or a contradiction between the decisions made by each modality. To overcome these challenges, we present a Multi-grained Multi-modal Fusion Network (MMFN) for fake news detection. Inspired by the multi-grained process of human assessment of news authenticity, we respectively employ two Transformer-based pre-trained models to encode token-level features from text and images. The multi-modal module fuses fine-grained features, taking into account coarse-grained features encoded by the CLIP encoder. To address the ambiguity problem, we design uni-modal branches with similarity-based weighting to adaptively adjust the use of multi-modal features. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods on three prevalent datasets. ",

    "abstract": "Implicit neural representation (INR) characterizes the attributes of a signal as a function of corresponding coordinates which emerges as a sharp weapon for solving inverse problems. However, the expressive power of INR is limited by the spectral bias in the network training. In this paper, we find that such a frequency-related problem could be greatly solved by re-arranging the coordinates of the input signal, for which we propose the disorder-invariant implicit neural representation (DINER) by augmenting a hash-table to a traditional INR backbone. Given discrete signals sharing the same histogram of attributes and different arrangement orders, the hash-table could project the coordinates into the same distribution for which the mapped signal can be better modeled using the subsequent INR network, leading to significantly alleviated spectral bias. Furthermore, the expressive power of the DINER is determined by the width of the hash-table. Different width corresponds to different geometrical elements in the attribute space, \\textit{e.g.}, 1D curve, 2D curved-plane and 3D curved-volume when the width is set as $1$, $2$ and $3$, respectively. More covered areas of the geometrical elements result in stronger expressive power. Experiments not only reveal the generalization of the DINER for different INR backbones (MLP vs. SIREN) and various tasks (image/video representation, phase retrieval, refractive index recovery, and neural radiance field optimization) but also show the superiority over the state-of-the-art algorithms both in quality and speed. \\textit{Project page:} \\url{https://ezio77.github.io/DINER-website/} ",

Existing approaches cannot effectively remove the impact of viewpoint due to the implicit view-dependent representations. In this work, we propose a self-supervised framework called Focalized Contrastive View-invariant Learning (FoCoViL), which significantly suppresses the view-specific information on the representation space where the viewpoints are coarsely aligned. By maximizing mutual information with an effective contrastive loss between multi-view sample pairs, FoCoViL associates actions with common view-invariant properties and simultaneously separates the dissimilar ones. We further propose an adaptive focalization method based on pairwise similarity to enhance contrastive learning for a clearer cluster boundary in the learned space. Different from many existing self-supervised representation learning work that rely heavily on supervised classifiers, FoCoViL performs well on both unsupervised and supervised classifiers with superior recognition performance. Extensive experiments also show that the proposed contrastive-based focalization generates a more discriminative latent representation. ",

    "abstract": "Purpose: Academic citation and social attention measure different dimensions in the impact of research results. We quantify the contribution of funding to both indicators considering the differences attributable to the research field and access type. Design/methodology/approach: Citation and social attention accumulated until the year 2021 of more than 367 thousand research articles published in the year 2018, are studied. We consider funding acknowledgements in the research articles. The data source is Dimensions and the units of study are research articles in the UN Sustainable Development Goals. Findings: Most cited goals by researchers do not coincide with those that arouse greater social attention. A small proportion of articles accumulates a large part of the citations and most of the social attention. Both citation and social attention grow with funding. Thus, funded research has a greater probability of being cited in academic articles and mentioned in social media. Funded research receives on average two to three times more citations and 2.5 to 4.5 times more social attention than unfunded research. Moreover, the open access modalities gold and hybrid have the greatest advantages in citation and social attention due to funding. Originality: The joint evaluation of the effect of both funding and open access on social attention. Research limitations: Specific topics were studied in a specific period. Studying other topics and/or different time periods might result in different findings. Practical implications: When funding to publish in open or hybrid access journals is not available, it is advisable to self-archiving the pre-print or post-print version in a freely accessible repository. Social implications: Although cautiously, it is also advisable to consider the social impact of the research to complement the scientific impact in the evaluation of the research. ",

    "abstract": "Click-through rate (CTR) prediction is one of the fundamental tasks for online advertising and recommendation. While multi-layer perceptron (MLP) serves as a core component in many deep CTR prediction models, it has been widely recognized that applying a vanilla MLP network alone is inefficient in learning multiplicative feature interactions. As such, many two-stream interaction models (e.g., DeepFM and DCN) have been proposed by integrating an MLP network with another dedicated network for enhanced CTR prediction. As the MLP stream learns feature interactions implicitly, existing research focuses mainly on enhancing explicit feature interactions in the complementary stream. In contrast, our empirical study shows that a well-tuned two-stream MLP model that simply combines two MLPs can even achieve surprisingly good performance, which has never been reported before by existing work. Based on this observation, we further propose feature selection and interaction aggregation layers that can be easily plugged to make an enhanced two-stream MLP model, FinalMLP. In this way, it not only enables differentiated feature inputs but also effectively fuses stream-level interactions across two streams. Our evaluation results on four open benchmark datasets as well as an online A/B test in our industrial system show that FinalMLP achieves better performance than many sophisticated two-stream CTR models.

This approach avoids introducing a mass of auxiliary points and simplifies the loss function. We validate the effectiveness of the Laplace-fPINNs approach using several examples.

In that sense, the systems have to share a limited resource over a network. Such problems can arise in different areas and it is here motivated by a simplified district heating example. When the shared resource is insufficient for the combined need of all systems, the resource will have to be shared in an optimal fashion. In this scenario, we want the systems to automatically converge to an optimal equilibrium. The contribution of this paper is the proposal of a control architecture where each separate system is controlled by a local PI controller. The controllers are then coordinated through a global rank-one anti-windup signal. It is shown that the equilibrium of the proposed closed-loop system minimizes the infinity-norm of stationary state deviations. Convergence is investigated via a randomized numerical study, and a district heating-inspired example illustrates the utility of the proposed method. ",

One of the most common and useful representation of such an understanding is done in the form of BEV lane graphs. In this work, we use the video stream from an onboard camera for online extraction of the surrounding's lane graph. Using video, instead of a single image, as input poses both benefits and challenges in terms of combining the information from different timesteps. We study the emerged challenges using three different approaches. The first approach is a post-processing step that is capable of merging single frame lane graph estimates into a unified lane graph. The second approach uses the spatialtemporal embeddings in the transformer to enable the network to discover the best temporal aggregation strategy. Finally, the third, and the proposed method, is an early temporal aggregation through explicit BEV projection and alignment of framewise features. A single model of this proposed simple, yet effective, method can process any number of images, including one, to produce accurate lane graphs. The experiments on the Nuscenes and Argoverse datasets show the validity of all the approaches while highlighting the superiority of the proposed method. The code will be made public. ",

As a result, SRT is not directly applicable to large-scale scenes where the reference frame would need to be changed regularly. In this work, we propose Relative Pose Attention SRT (RePAST): Instead of fixing a reference frame at the input, we inject pairwise relative camera pose information directly into the attention mechanism of the Transformers. This leads to a model that is by definition invariant to the choice of any global reference frame, while still retaining the full capabilities of the original method. Empirical results show that adding this invariance to the model does not lead to a loss in quality.

Additionally, we provide an optimization of the Batch Normalization layer that both reduces latency and simplifies deployment. Finally, we present an optimized implementation of the Binary Direct Convolution for ARM instruction sets. Our experiments show a consistent improvement of the inference speed (up to 1.91 and 2.73x compared to two state-of-the-art BNNs frameworks) with no drop in accuracy for at least one full-precision model.

A pioneering work in text-driven image editing, StyleCLIP, finds an edit direction in the CLIP space and then edits the image by mapping the direction to the StyleGAN space. At the same time, it is difficult to tune appropriate inputs other than the original image and text instructions for image editing. In this study, we propose a method to construct the edit direction adaptively in the StyleGAN and CLIP spaces with SVM. Our model represents the edit direction as a normal vector in the CLIP space obtained by training a SVM to classify positive and negative images. The images are retrieved from a large-scale image corpus, originally used for pre-training StyleGAN, according to the CLIP similarity between the images and the text instruction. We confirmed that our model performed as well as the StyleCLIP baseline, whereas it allows simple inputs without increasing the computational time. ",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a new paradigm, named Historical Object Prediction (HoP) for multi-view 3D detection to leverage temporal information more effectively. The HoP approach is straightforward: given the current timestamp t, we generate a pseudo Bird's-Eye View (BEV) feature of timestamp t-k from its adjacent frames and utilize this feature to predict the object set at timestamp t-k. Our approach is motivated by the observation that enforcing the detector to capture both the spatial location and temporal motion of objects occurring at historical timestamps can lead to more accurate BEV feature learning. First, we elaborately design short-term and long-term temporal decoders, which can generate the pseudo BEV feature for timestamp t-k without the involvement of its corresponding camera images. Second, an additional object decoder is flexibly attached to predict the object targets using the generated pseudo BEV feature. Note that we only perform HoP during training, thus the proposed method does not introduce extra overheads during inference. As a plug-and-play approach, HoP can be easily incorporated into state-of-the-art BEV detection frameworks, including BEVFormer and BEVDet series. Furthermore, the auxiliary HoP approach is complementary to prevalent temporal modeling methods, leading to significant performance gains. Extensive experiments are conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed HoP on the nuScenes dataset. We choose the representative methods, including BEVFormer and BEVDet4D-Depth to evaluate our method. Surprisingly, HoP achieves 68.5% NDS and 62.4% mAP with ViT-L on nuScenes test, outperforming all the 3D object detectors on the leaderboard.

    "title": "Optimal Resource Allocation between Two Nonfully Cooperative Wireless  Networks under Malicious Attacks: A Gestalt Game Perspective",
    "abstract": "In this paper, the problem of seeking optimal distributed resource allocation (DRA) policies on cellular networks in the presence of an unknown malicious adding-edge attacker is investigated. This problem is described as the games of games (GoG) model. Specifically, two subnetwork policymakers constitute a Nash game, while the confrontation between each subnetwork policymaker and the attacker is captured by a Stackelberg game. First, we show that the communication resource allocation of cellular networks based on the Foschini-Miljanic (FM) algorithm can be transformed into a \\emph{geometric program} and be efficiently solved via convex optimization. Second, the upper limit of attack magnitude that can be tolerated by the network is calculated by the corresponding theory, and it is proved that the above geometric programming (GP) framework is solvable within the attack bound, that is, there exists a Gestalt Nash equilibrium (GNE) in our GoG. Third, a heuristic algorithm that iteratively uses GP is proposed to identify the optimal policy profiles of both subnetworks, for which asymptotic convergence is also confirmed. Fourth, a greedy heuristic adding-edge strategy is developed for the attacker to determine the set of the most vulnerable edges. Finally, simulation examples illustrate that the proposed theoretical results are robust and can achieve the GNE. It is verified that the transmission gains and interference gains of all channels are well tuned within a limited budget, despite the existence of malicious attacks. ",

Model training in federated learning is distributed over multiple clients giving access to lots of client data while maintaining privacy. Then, a server aggregates the training done on these multiple clients without access to their data, which could be emojis widely used in any social media service and instant messaging platforms to express users' sentiments. This paper proposes federated learning-based multilingual emoji prediction in both clean and attack scenarios. Emoji prediction data have been crawled from both Twitter and SemEval emoji datasets. This data is used to train and evaluate different transformer model sizes including a sparsely activated transformer with either the assumption of clean data in all clients or poisoned data via label flipping attack in some clients. Experimental results on these models show that federated learning in either clean or attacked scenarios performs similarly to centralized training in multilingual emoji prediction on seen and unseen languages under different data sources and distributions. Our trained transformers perform better than other techniques on the SemEval emoji dataset in addition to the privacy as well as distributed benefits of federated learning. ",

    "abstract": "Multimodal learning, which aims to understand and analyze information from multiple modalities, has achieved substantial progress in the supervised regime in recent years. However, the heavy dependence on data paired with expensive human annotations impedes scaling up models. Meanwhile, given the availability of large-scale unannotated data in the wild, self-supervised learning has become an attractive strategy to alleviate the annotation bottleneck. Building on these two directions, self-supervised multimodal learning (SSML) provides ways to leverage supervision from raw multimodal data. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of the state-of-the-art in SSML, which we categorize along three orthogonal axes: objective functions, data alignment, and model architectures. These axes correspond to the inherent characteristics of self-supervised learning methods and multimodal data. Specifically, we classify training objectives into instance discrimination, clustering, and masked prediction categories. We also discuss multimodal input data pairing and alignment strategies during training. Finally, we review model architectures including the design of encoders, fusion modules, and decoders, which are essential components of SSML methods. We review downstream multimodal application tasks, reporting the concrete performance of the state-of-the-art image-text models and multimodal video models, and also review real-world applications of SSML algorithms in diverse fields such as healthcare, remote sensing, and machine translation. Finally, we discuss challenges and future directions for SSML. A collection of related resources can be found at: https://github.com/ys-zong/awesome-self-supervised-multimodal-learning. ",

    "abstract": "The architecture design and multi-scale learning principles of the human brain that evolved over hundreds of millions of years are crucial to realizing human-like intelligence. Spiking Neural Network (SNN) based Liquid State Machine (LSM) serves as a suitable architecture to study brain-inspired intelligence because of its brain-inspired structure and the potential for integrating multiple biological principles. Existing researches on LSM focus on different certain perspectives, including high-dimensional encoding or optimization of the liquid layer, network architecture search, and application to hardware devices. There is still a lack of in-depth inspiration from the learning and structural evolution mechanism of the brain. Considering these limitations, this paper presents a novel LSM learning model that integrates adaptive structural evolution and multi-scale biological learning rules. For structural evolution, an adaptive evolvable LSM model is developed to optimize the neural architecture design of liquid layer with separation property. For brain-inspired learning of LSM, we propose a dopamine-modulated Bienenstock-Cooper-Munros (DA-BCM) method that incorporates global long-term dopamine regulation and local trace-based BCM synaptic plasticity. Comparative experimental results on different decision-making tasks show that introducing structural evolution of the liquid layer, and the DA-BCM regulation of the liquid layer and the readout layer could improve the decision-making ability of LSM and flexibly adapt to rule reversal. This work is committed to exploring how evolution can help to design more appropriate network architectures and how multi-scale neuroplasticity principles coordinated to enable the optimization and learning of LSMs for relatively complex decision-making tasks.

In this context, our work makes two important contributions: First, we provide a conceptual framework for organizing different approaches to cross-lingual retrieval using multi-stage architectures for mono-lingual retrieval as a scaffold. Second, we implement simple yet effective reproducible baselines in the Anserini and Pyserini IR toolkits for test collections from the TREC 2022 NeuCLIR Track, in Persian, Russian, and Chinese.

In the case of loss of communication, and given the sensor setup, agents are predicting the trajectories of other agents based on the available measurements and prior information. The predictions are then used as the reference inputs to DMPC. During the landing, the followers are tasked with avoidance of USV-dependent obstacles and inter-agent collisions. In the proposed distributed algorithm, all agents solve their local optimization problem in parallel and we prove the convergence of the proposed algorithm.

    "abstract": "In recent years, transformer-based detectors have demonstrated remarkable performance in 2D visual perception tasks. However, their performance in multi-view 3D object detection remains inferior to the state-of-the-art (SOTA) of convolutional neural network based detectors. In this work, we investigate this issue from the perspective of bird's-eye-view (BEV) feature generation. Specifically, we examine the BEV feature generation method employed by the transformer-based SOTA, BEVFormer, and identify its two limitations: (i) it only generates attention weights from BEV, which precludes the use of lidar points for supervision, and (ii) it aggregates camera view features to the BEV through deformable sampling, which only selects a small subset of features and fails to exploit all information. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel BEV feature generation method, dual-view attention, which generates attention weights from both the BEV and camera view. This method encodes all camera features into the BEV feature. By combining dual-view attention with the BEVFormer architecture, we build a new detector named VoxelFormer. Extensive experiments are conducted on the nuScenes benchmark to verify the superiority of dual-view attention and VoxelForer. We observe that even only adopting 3 encoders and 1 historical frame during training, VoxelFormer still outperforms BEVFormer significantly. When trained in the same setting, VoxelFormer can surpass BEVFormer by 4.9% NDS point. Code is available at: https://github.com/Lizhuoling/VoxelFormer-public.git. ",

    "abstract": "We focus on the problem of LiDAR point cloud based loop detection (or Finding) and closure (LDC) in a multi-agent setting. State-of-the-art (SOTA) techniques directly generate learned embeddings of a given point cloud, require large data transfers, and are not robust to wide variations in 6 Degrees-of-Freedom (DOF) viewpoint. Moreover, absence of strong priors in an unstructured point cloud leads to highly inaccurate LDC. In this original approach, we propose independent roll and pitch canonicalization of the point clouds using a common dominant ground plane. Discretization of the canonicalized point cloud along the axis perpendicular to the ground plane leads to an image similar to Digital Elevation Maps (DEMs), which exposes strong spatial priors in the scene. Our experiments show that LDC based on learnt embeddings of such DEMs is not only data efficient but also significantly more robust, and generalizable than the current SOTA. We report significant performance gain in terms of Average Precision for loop detection and absolute translation/rotation error for relative pose estimation (or loop closure) on Kitti, GPR and Oxford Robot Car over multiple SOTA LDC methods. Our encoder technique allows to compress the original point cloud by over 830 times. To further test the robustness of our technique we create and opensource a custom dataset called Lidar-UrbanFly Dataset (LUF) which consists of point clouds obtained from a LiDAR mounted on a quadrotor.

However, applying conformal prediction to time series data leads to conservative prediction regions. In fact, to obtain prediction regions over $T$ time steps with confidence $1-\\delta$, {previous works require that each individual prediction region is valid} with confidence $1-\\delta/T$. We propose an optimization-based method for reducing this conservatism to enable long horizon planning and verification when using learning-enabled time series predictors. Instead of considering prediction errors individually at each time step, we consider a parameterized prediction error over multiple time steps. By optimizing the parameters over an additional dataset, we find prediction regions that are not conservative. We show that this problem can be cast as a mixed integer linear complementarity program (MILCP), which we then relax into a linear complementarity program (LCP). Additionally, we prove that the relaxed LP has the same optimal cost as the original MILCP. Finally, we demonstrate the efficacy of our method on a case study using pedestrian trajectory predictors.

Most existing works embed graph data in the Euclidean space, while recent works extend the embedding models to hyperbolic or spherical spaces to achieve better performance on graphs with complex structures, such as hierarchical or ring structures. Fusing the embedding from different manifolds can further take advantage of the embedding capabilities over different graph structures. However, existing embedding fusion methods mostly focus on concatenating or summing up the output embeddings, without considering interacting and aligning the embeddings of the same vertices on different manifolds, which can lead to distortion and impression in the final fusion results. Besides, it is also challenging to fuse the embeddings of the same vertices from different coordinate systems. In face of these challenges, we propose the Fused Manifold Graph Neural Network (FMGNN), a novel GNN architecture that embeds graphs into different Riemannian manifolds with interaction and alignment among these manifolds during training and fuses the vertex embeddings through the distances on different manifolds between vertices and selected landmarks, geometric coresets.

Besides, considering the high cost of medical data annotation, it is often assumed that the target images are unlabeled. Existing approaches have made much progress for this unsupervised domain adaptation setting. However, this setting is still rarely plausible in the medical application since the source medical data are often not accessible due to the privacy concerns. This motivates us to propose a Source-free Unsupervised cross-domain method for Pulmonary nodule detection (SUP). It first adapts the source model to the target domain by utilizing instance-level contrastive learning. Then the adapted model is trained in a teacher-student interaction manner, and a weighted entropy loss is incorporated to further improve the accuracy. Extensive experiments by adapting a pre-trained source model to three popular pulmonary nodule datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. ",

While previous work focused on learning and pruning independently, in this work we propose a biologically plausible model that, thanks to a combination of Hebbian learning and pruning, aims to simulate the synaptogenesis process. In this way, while learning how to solve the task, the agent translates its experience into a particular network structure. Namely, the network structure builds itself during the execution of the task. We call this approach Self-building Neural Network (SBNN). We compare our proposed SBNN with traditional neural networks (NNs) over three classical control tasks from OpenAI. The results show that our model performs generally better than traditional NNs. Moreover, we observe that the performance decay while increasing the pruning rate is smaller in our model than with NNs. Finally, we perform a validation test, testing the models over tasks unseen during the learning phase. In this case, the results show that SBNNs can adapt to new tasks better than the traditional NNs, especially when over $80\\%$ of the weights are pruned. ",

In this study, we highlight the significance of accurately describing changes in remote sensing images and present a comparison of the change captioning task for natural and synthetic images and remote sensing images. To address the challenge of generating accurate captions, we propose an attentive changes-to-captions network, called Chg2Cap for short, for bi-temporal remote sensing images. The network comprises three main components: 1) a Siamese CNN-based feature extractor to collect high-level representations for each image pair; 2) an attentive decoder that includes a hierarchical self-attention block to locate change-related features and a residual block to generate the image embedding; and 3) a transformer-based caption generator to decode the relationship between the image embedding and the word embedding into a description. The proposed Chg2Cap network is evaluated on two representative remote sensing datasets, and a comprehensive experimental analysis is provided.

    "title": "Dsfer-Net: A Deep Supervision and Feature Retrieval Network for  Bitemporal Change Detection Using Modern Hopfield Networks",
    "abstract": "Change detection, as an important application for high-resolution remote sensing images, aims to monitor and analyze changes in the land surface over time. With the rapid growth in the quantity of high-resolution remote sensing data and the complexity of texture features, a number of quantitative deep learning-based methods have been proposed. Although these methods outperform traditional change detection methods by extracting deep features and combining spatial-temporal information, reasonable explanations about how deep features work on improving the detection performance are still lacking. In our investigations, we find that modern Hopfield network layers achieve considerable performance in semantic understandings. In this paper, we propose a Deep Supervision and FEature Retrieval network (Dsfer-Net) for bitemporal change detection. Specifically, the highly representative deep features of bitemporal images are jointly extracted through a fully convolutional Siamese network. Based on the sequential geo-information of the bitemporal images, we then design a feature retrieval module to retrieve the difference feature and leverage discriminative information in a deeply supervised manner. We also note that the deeply supervised feature retrieval module gives explainable proofs about the semantic understandings of the proposed network in its deep layers. Finally, this end-to-end network achieves a novel framework by aggregating the retrieved features and feature pairs from different layers. Experiments conducted on three public datasets (LEVIR-CD, WHU-CD, and CDD) confirm the superiority of the proposed Dsfer-Net over other state-of-the-art methods. Code will be available online (https://github.com/ShizhenChang/Dsfer-Net). ",

Starting from the partial differential Euler equations describing the dynamical flow of gas in a pipeline, the method of lines is employed to obtain a lumped-parameter model, which simplifies to a nonlinear third-order PHS. Parallels between gas networks and power systems are drawn by showing that the obtained pipeline PHS model has the same pi-representation as electrical transmission lines. Moreover, to assist future control design, additional passivity properties of the pipeline PHS model are analysed and discussed. By comparing the proposed PHS models against other models in a standard simulation, we show that the simplifying assumptions have no material effect on the model fidelity. The proposed pipeline and network models can serve as a basis for passivity-based control and analysis while the power system parallels facilitate the transfer of existing methods. ",

    "abstract": "\\textit{Intelligent Navigation Systems} (INS) are exposed to an increasing number of informational attack vectors, which often intercept through the communication channels between the INS and the transportation network during the data collecting process. To measure the resilience of INS, we use the concept of a Wardrop Non-Equilibrium Solution (WANES), which is characterized by the probabilistic outcome of learning within a bounded number of interactions. By using concentration arguments, we have discovered that any bounded feedback delaying attack only degrades the systematic performance up to order $\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(\\sqrt{{d^3}{T^{-1}}})$ along the traffic flow trajectory within the Delayed Mirror Descent (DMD) online-learning framework. This degradation in performance can occur with only mild assumptions imposed. Our result implies that learning-based INS infrastructures can achieve Wardrop Non-equilibrium even when experiencing a certain period of disruption in the information structure. These findings provide valuable insights for designing defense mechanisms against possible jamming attacks across different layers of the transportation ecosystem. ",

Furthermore, for each scenario, we set four vehicles along with one infrastructure to record data, thus providing diverse viewpoints for accident scenarios and enabling V2X (vehicle-to-everything) research on perception and prediction tasks. Finally, we present a baseline V2X model named V2XFormer that demonstrates superior performance for motion and accident prediction and 3D object detection compared to the single-vehicle model. ",

However, existing two-stream methods require passing a great number of (up to a hundred) image crops into the visuallanguage model, which is highly inefficient. To address the problem, we propose a network that only needs a single pass through the visual-language model for each input image. Specifically, we first propose a novel network adaptation approach, termed patch severance, to restrict the harmful interference between the patch embeddings in the pre-trained visual encoder. We then propose classification anchor learning to encourage the network to spatially focus on more discriminative features for classification. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method achieves outstanding performance, surpassing state-of-theart methods while being 4 to 7 times faster at inference.

In this work, we consider the difficult problem of locomotion on challenging terrains using a single forward-facing depth camera. Due to the partial observability of the problem, the robot has to rely on past observations to infer the terrain currently beneath it. To solve this problem, we follow the paradigm in computer vision that explicitly models the 3D geometry of the scene and propose Neural Volumetric Memory (NVM), a geometric memory architecture that explicitly accounts for the SE(3) equivariance of the 3D world. NVM aggregates feature volumes from multiple camera views by first bringing them back to the ego-centric frame of the robot. We test the learned visual-locomotion policy on a physical robot and show that our approach, which explicitly introduces geometric priors during training, offers superior performance than more na\\\"ive methods. We also include ablation studies and show that the representations stored in the neural volumetric memory capture sufficient geometric information to reconstruct the scene.

We develop a contest model for bug bounty programs with an arbitrary number of agents who decide whether to undertake a costly search for bugs or not. Search costs are private information. Besides characterizing the ensuing equilibria, we show that even inviting an unlimited crowd does not guarantee that bugs are found. Adding paid agents can increase the efficiency of the bug bounty scheme although the crowd that is attracted becomes smaller. Finally, adding (known) bugs increases the likelihood that unknown bugs are found, but to limit reward payments it may be optimal to add them only with some probability. ",

Most dynamical systems' models of spiking neural networks typically exhibit one of two major types of interactions: First, the response of a neuron's state variable to incoming pulse signals (spikes) may be additive and independent of its current state. Second, the response may depend on the current neuron's state and multiply a function of the state variable. Here we reveal that spiking neural network models with additive coupling are equivalent to models with multiplicative coupling for simultaneously modified intrinsic neuron time evolution. As a consequence, the same collective dynamics can be attained by state-dependent multiplicative and constant (state-independent) additive coupling. Such a mapping enables the transfer of theoretical insights between spiking neural network models with different types of interaction mechanisms as well as simpler and more effective engineering applications.

It has also been discovered that most networks are amplifiers under the birth-death updating combined with uniform initialization, which is a standard condition assumed widely in the literature. In the present study, we extend the birth-death processes to temporal (i.e., time-varying) networks. For the sake of tractability, we restrict ourselves to switching temporal networks, in which the network structure alternates between two static networks at constant time intervals. We show that, in a majority of cases, switching networks are less amplifying than both of the two static networks constituting the switching networks. Furthermore, most small switching networks are suppressors, which contrasts to the case of static networks. ",

The performance of the Bayesian Ideal Observer (IO) sets an upper limit among all observers, numerical or human, and has been advocated for use as a figure-of-merit (FOM) for evaluating and optimizing medical imaging systems. However, the IO test statistic corresponds to the likelihood ratio that is intractable to compute in the majority of cases. A sampling-based method that employs Markov-Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques was previously proposed to estimate the IO performance. However, current applications of MCMC methods for IO approximation have been limited to a small number of situations where the considered distribution of to-be-imaged objects can be described by a relatively simple stochastic object model (SOM). As such, there remains an important need to extend the domain of applicability of MCMC methods to address a large variety of scenarios where IO-based assessments are needed but the associated SOMs have not been available. In this study, a novel MCMC method that employs a generative adversarial network (GAN)-based SOM, referred to as MCMC-GAN, is described and evaluated. The MCMC-GAN method was quantitatively validated by use of test-cases for which reference solutions were available. The results demonstrate that the MCMC-GAN method can extend the domain of applicability of MCMC methods for conducting IO analyses of medical imaging systems. ",

While previous federated learning (FL) algorithms enable multi-institution collaborative training without the need of aggregating local data, addressing the large domain shift in the application of multi-institutional low-count PET denoising remains a challenge and is still highly under-explored. In this work, we propose FedFTN, a personalized federated learning strategy that addresses these challenges. FedFTN uses a local deep feature transformation network (FTN) to modulate the feature outputs of a globally shared denoising network, enabling personalized low-count PET denoising for each institution. During the federated learning process, only the denoising network's weights are communicated and aggregated, while the FTN remains at the local institutions for feature transformation. We evaluated our method using a large-scale dataset of multi-institutional low-count PET imaging data from three medical centers located across three continents, and showed that FedFTN provides high-quality low-count PET images, outperforming previous baseline FL reconstruction methods across all low-count levels at all three institutions.

    "abstract": "Lithium-ion batteries (LiBs) degrade slightly until the knee onset, after which the deterioration accelerates to end of life (EOL). The knee onset, which marks the initiation of the accelerated degradation rate, is crucial in providing an early warning of the battery's performance changes. However, there is only limited literature on online knee onset identification. Furthermore, it is good to perform such identification using easily collected measurements. To solve these challenges, an online knee onset identification method is developed by exploiting the temporal information within the discharge data. First, the temporal dynamics embedded in the discharge voltage cycles from the slight degradation stage are extracted by the dynamic time warping. Second, the anomaly is exposed by Matrix Profile during subsequence similarity search. The knee onset is detected when the temporal dynamics of the new cycle exceed the control limit and the profile index indicates a change in regime. Finally, the identified knee onset is utilized to categorize the battery into long-range or short-range categories by its strong correlation with the battery's EOL cycles. With the support of the battery categorization and the training data acquired under the same statistic distribution, the proposed SOH estimation model achieves enhanced estimation results with a root mean squared error as low as 0.22%.

    "abstract": "Positron emission tomography (PET) is the most sensitive molecular imaging modality routinely applied in our modern healthcare. High radioactivity caused by the injected tracer dose is a major concern in PET imaging and limits its clinical applications. However, reducing the dose leads to inadequate image quality for diagnostic practice. Motivated by the need to produce high quality images with minimum low-dose, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) based methods have been developed for high quality PET synthesis from its low-dose counterparts. Previous CNNs-based studies usually directly map low-dose PET into features space without consideration of different dose reduction level. In this study, a novel approach named CG-3DSRGAN (Classification-Guided Generative Adversarial Network with Super Resolution Refinement) is presented. Specifically, a multi-tasking coarse generator, guided by a classification head, allows for a more comprehensive understanding of the noise-level features present in the low-dose data, resulting in improved image synthesis. Moreover, to recover spatial details of standard PET, an auxiliary super resolution network - Contextual-Net - is proposed as a second-stage training to narrow the gap between coarse prediction and standard PET. We compared our method to the state-of-the-art methods on whole-body PET with different dose reduction factors (DRFs). Experiments demonstrate our method can outperform others on all DRF. ",

    "abstract": "The number of studies on deep learning for medical diagnosis is expanding, and these systems are often claimed to outperform clinicians. However, only a few systems have shown medical efficacy. From this perspective, we examine a wide range of deep learning algorithms for the assessment of glioblastoma - a common brain tumor in older adults that is lethal. Surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation are the standard treatments for glioblastoma patients. The methylation status of the MGMT promoter, a specific genetic sequence found in the tumor, affects chemotherapy's effectiveness. MGMT promoter methylation improves chemotherapy response and survival in several cancers. MGMT promoter methylation is determined by a tumor tissue biopsy, which is then genetically tested. This lengthy and invasive procedure increases the risk of infection and other complications. Thus, researchers have used deep learning models to examine the tumor from brain MRI scans to determine the MGMT promoter's methylation state. We employ deep learning models and one of the largest public MRI datasets of 585 participants to predict the methylation status of the MGMT promoter in glioblastoma tumors using MRI scans. We test these models using Grad-CAM, occlusion sensitivity, feature visualizations, and training loss landscapes. Our results show no correlation between these two, indicating that external cohort data should be used to verify these models' performance to assure the accuracy and reliability of deep learning systems in cancer diagnosis.

If each two vertices from $X$ are $X$-visible, then $X$ is a mutual-visibility set. The mutual-visibility number of $G$ is the cardinality of a largest mutual-visibility set of $G$ and has been already investigated. In this paper a variety of mutual-visibility problems is introduced based on which natural pairs of vertices are required to be $X$-visible. This yields the total, the dual, and the outer mutual-visibility numbers. We first show that these graph invariants are related to each other and to the classical mutual-visibility number, and then we prove that the three newly introduced mutual-visibility problems are computationally difficult. According to this result, we compute or bound their values for several graphs classes that include for instance grid graphs and tori. We conclude the study by presenting some inter-comparison between the values of such parameters, which is based on the computations we made for some specific families. ",

    "abstract": "The quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) regression model is a commonly used technique for predicting biological activities of compounds using their molecular descriptors. Predictions from QSAR models can help, for example, to optimize molecular structure; prioritize compounds for further experimental testing; and estimate their toxicity. In addition to the accurate estimation of the activity, it is highly desirable to obtain some estimate of the uncertainty associated with the prediction, e.g., calculate a prediction interval (PI) containing the true molecular activity with a pre-specified probability, say 70%, 90% or 95%. The challenge is that most machine learning (ML) algorithms that achieve superior predictive performance require some add-on methods for estimating uncertainty of their prediction. The development of these algorithms is an active area of research by statistical and ML communities but their implementation for QSAR modeling remains limited. Conformal prediction (CP) is a promising approach. It is agnostic to the prediction algorithm and can produce valid prediction intervals under some weak assumptions on the data distribution. We proposed computationally efficient CP algorithms tailored to the most advanced ML models, including Deep Neural Networks and Gradient Boosting Machines. The validity and efficiency of proposed conformal predictors are demonstrated on a diverse collection of QSAR datasets as well as simulation studies. ",

The model of our interest comprises of a feedback interconnection of two subsystems, one being a first-order linear ordinary differential equation and the other being a set of nonlinear differential algebraic equations (DAE). We prove the following three facts by analyzing the nonlinear DAE subsystem. First, a lossless transmission network is necessary for guaranteeing equilibrium-independent passivity of the DAE. Second, the convexity of a strain energy function characterizes the largest set of equilibria over which this DAE subsystem is equilibrium-independent passive. Finally, we prove that the strain energy function of a power system with two-axis generator models is convex if and only if its flux linkage dynamics are stable, and the strain energy function of a classical generator model derived by a singular perturbation approximation of the flux linkage dynamics is convex. These novel findings are derived by elaborating on linearization and Kron reduction properties of the power system model. Numerical simulation of the IEEE 9-bus power system model demonstrates the practical implications of the various mathematical results. ",
