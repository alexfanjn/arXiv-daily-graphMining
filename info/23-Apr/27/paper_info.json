    "title": "A Unified Active Learning Framework for Annotating Graph Data with  Application to Software Source Code Performance Prediction",
    "abstract": "Most machine learning and data analytics applications, including performance engineering in software systems, require a large number of annotations and labelled data, which might not be available in advance. Acquiring annotations often requires significant time, effort, and computational resources, making it challenging. We develop a unified active learning framework, specializing in software performance prediction, to address this task. We begin by parsing the source code to an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) and augmenting it with data and control flow edges. Then, we convert the tree representation of the source code to a Flow Augmented-AST graph (FA-AST) representation. Based on the graph representation, we construct various graph embeddings (unsupervised and supervised) into a latent space. Given such an embedding, the framework becomes task agnostic since active learning can be performed using any regression method and query strategy suited for regression. Within this framework, we investigate the impact of using different levels of information for active and passive learning, e.g., partially available labels and unlabeled test data. Our approach aims to improve the investment in AI models for different software performance predictions (execution time) based on the structure of the source code. Our real-world experiments reveal that respectable performance can be achieved by querying labels for only a small subset of all the data. ",

    "abstract": "In the last few years, the success of Transformers in computer vision has stimulated the discovery of many alternative models that compete with Transformers, such as the MLP-Mixer. Despite their weak induced bias, these models have achieved performance comparable to well-studied convolutional neural networks. Recent studies on modern Hopfield networks suggest the correspondence between certain energy-based associative memory models and Transformers or MLP-Mixer, and shed some light on the theoretical background of the Transformer-type architectures design. In this paper we generalize the correspondence to the recently introduced hierarchical Hopfield network, and find iMixer, a novel generalization of MLP-Mixer model. Unlike ordinary feedforward neural networks, iMixer involves MLP layers that propagate forward from the output side to the input side. We characterize the module as an example of invertible, implicit, and iterative mixing module. We evaluate the model performance with various datasets on image classification tasks, and find that iMixer reasonably achieves the improvement compared to the baseline vanilla MLP-Mixer. The results imply that the correspondence between the Hopfield networks and the Mixer models serves as a principle for understanding a broader class of Transformer-like architecture designs. ",

In this paper, we attempt to develop a theory of broadcast networks in which the processes can be well-structured transition systems. The resulting formalism is called well-structured broadcast networks. For various types of communication topologies, we prove the decidability of coverability in the static case, i.e, when the network topology is not allowed to change. We do this by showing that for these types of static communication topologies, the broadcast network itself is a well-structured transition system, hence proving the decidability of coverability in the broadcast network. We also give an algorithm to decide coverability of well-structured broadcast networks when reconfiguration of links between nodes is allowed. Finally, with minor modifications of this algorithm we prove decidability of coverability when the underlying process is a pushdown automaton. ",

This study proposes a new approach to identifying synthetic human voices by detecting artifacts of vocoders in audio signals. Most DeepFake audio synthesis models use a neural vocoder, a neural network that generates waveforms from temporal-frequency representations like mel-spectrograms. By identifying neural vocoder processing in audio, we can determine if a sample is synthesized. To detect synthetic human voices, we introduce a multi-task learning framework for a binary-class RawNet2 model that shares the feature extractor with a vocoder identification module. By treating vocoder identification as a pretext task, we constrain the feature extractor to focus on vocoder artifacts and provide discriminative features for the final binary classifier. Our experiments show that the improved RawNet2 model based on vocoder identification achieves high classification performance on the binary task overall.

Here, we aim to explain these differences by analyzing the impact of these objectives on the structure and transferability of the learned representations. Our analysis reveals that reconstruction-based learning features are significantly dissimilar to joint-embedding based learning features and that models trained with similar objectives learn similar features even across architectures. These differences arise early in the network and are primarily driven by attention and normalization layers. We find that joint-embedding features yield better linear probe transfer for classification because the different objectives drive different distributions of information and invariances in the learned representation. These differences explain opposite trends in transfer performance for downstream tasks that require spatial specificity in features. Finally, we address how fine-tuning changes reconstructive representations to enable better transfer, showing that fine-tuning re-organizes the information to be more similar to pre-trained joint embedding models.

    "abstract": "We introduce the problem of model-extraction attacks in cyber-physical systems in which an attacker attempts to estimate (or extract) the feedback controller of the system. Extracting (or estimating) the controller provides an unmatched edge to attackers since it allows them to predict the future control actions of the system and plan their attack accordingly. Hence, it is important to understand the ability of the attackers to perform such an attack. In this paper, we focus on the setting when a Deep Neural Network (DNN) controller is trained using Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms and is used to control a stochastic system. We play the role of the attacker that aims to estimate such an unknown DNN controller, and we propose a two-phase algorithm. In the first phase, also called the offline phase, the attacker uses side-channel information about the RL-reward function and the system dynamics to identify a set of candidate estimates of the unknown DNN. In the second phase, also called the online phase, the attacker observes the behavior of the unknown DNN and uses these observations to shortlist the set of final policy estimates. We provide theoretical analysis of the error between the unknown DNN and the estimated one. We also provide numerical results showing the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. ",

    "abstract": "Graph database users today face a choice between two technology stacks: the Resource Description Framework (RDF), on one side, is a data model with built-in semantics that was originally developed by the W3C to exchange interconnected data on the Web; on the other side, Labeled Property Graphs (LPGs) are geared towards efficient graph processing and have strong roots in developer and engineering communities. The two models look at graphs from different abstraction layers (triples in RDF vs. edges connecting vertices with inlined properties in LPGs), expose - at least at the surface - distinct features, come with different query languages, and are embedded into their own software ecosystems. In this short paper, we introduce a novel unifying graph data model called Statement Graphs, which combines the traits of both RDF and LPG and achieves interoperability at different levels: it (a) provides the ability to manage RDF and LPG data as a single, interconnected graph, (b) supports querying over the integrated graph using any RDF or LPG query language, while (c) clearing the way for graph stack independent data exchange mechanisms and formats. We formalize our new model as directed acyclic graphs and sketch a system of bidirectional mappings between RDF, LPGs, and Statement Graphs. Our mappings implicitly define read query semantics for RDF and LPGs query languages over the unified data model, thus providing graph users with the flexibility to use the query language of their choice for their graph use cases. As a proof of concept for our ideas, we also present the 1G Playground; an in-memory DBMS built on the concepts of Statement Graphs, which facilitates storage of both RDF and LPG data, and allows for cross-model querying using both SPARQL and Gremlin.

    "abstract": "Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are recognized as the candidate for the next-generation neural networks due to their bio-plausibility and energy efficiency. Recently, researchers have demonstrated that SNNs are able to achieve nearly state-of-the-art performance in image recognition tasks using surrogate gradient training. However, some essential questions exist pertaining to SNNs that are little studied: Do SNNs trained with surrogate gradient learn different representations from traditional Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs)? Does the time dimension in SNNs provide unique representation power? In this paper, we aim to answer these questions by conducting a representation similarity analysis between SNNs and ANNs using Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA). We start by analyzing the spatial dimension of the networks, including both the width and the depth. Furthermore, our analysis of residual connections shows that SNNs learn a periodic pattern, which rectifies the representations in SNNs to be ANN-like. We additionally investigate the effect of the time dimension on SNN representation, finding that deeper layers encourage more dynamics along the time dimension. We also investigate the impact of input data such as event-stream data and adversarial attacks. Our work uncovers a host of new findings of representations in SNNs. We hope this work will inspire future research to fully comprehend the representation power of SNNs. Code is released at https://github.com/Intelligent-Computing-Lab-Yale/SNNCKA. ",

The number of smart contracts has multiplied, and at the same time, the security of smart contracts has drawn considerable attention due to the monetary losses brought on by smart contract vulnerabilities. Existing analysis techniques are capable of identifying a large number of smart contract security flaws, but they rely too much on rigid criteria established by specialists, where the detection process takes much longer as the complexity of the smart contract rises. In this paper, we propose HyMo as a multi-modal hybrid deep learning model, which intelligently considers various input representations to consider multimodality and FastText word embedding technique, which represents each word as an n-gram of characters with BiGRU deep learning technique, as a sequence processing model that consists of two GRUs to achieve higher accuracy in smart contract vulnerability detection. The model gathers features using various deep learning models to identify the smart contract vulnerabilities. Through a series of studies on the currently publicly accessible dataset such as ScrawlD, we show that our hybrid HyMo model has excellent smart contract vulnerability detection performance. Therefore, HyMo performs better detection of smart contract vulnerabilities against other approaches. ",

The performance of the LSTM model is investigated under a black-box Gaussian noise attack with different SNRs. It is assumed that attackers have just access to the input data of the LSTM model. The results show that the noise attack affects the performance of the LSTM model. The load prediction means absolute error (MAE) is 0.047 MW for a healthy prediction, while this value increases up to 0.097 MW for a Gaussian noise insertion with SNR= 6 dB. To robustify the LSTM model against noise attack, a low-pass filter with optimal cut-off frequency is applied at the model's input to remove the noise attack. The filter performs better in case of noise with lower SNR and is less promising for small noises. ",

Additionally, we utilize a static feature to improve the accuracy of human presence detection in static states. We evaluate the proposed ALPD system by deploying a pair of WiFi access points (APs) for collecting CSI dataset, which is further compared with several benchmarks. The results demonstrate that our ALPD system outperforms the benchmarks in terms of accuracy, especially in the presence of interference. Moreover, bidirectional transmission data is beneficial to training improving stability and accuracy, as well as reducing the costs of data collection for training. Overall, our proposed ALPD system shows promising results for human presence detection using WiFi CSI signals. ",

While camera-based systems have traditionally been used for this purpose, they raise privacy concerns.

In this thesis, we propose a device-free human presence detection system for multi-room scenarios using a time-selective conditional dual feature extract recurrent Network (TCD-FERN). Our system is designed to capture significant time features with the condition on current human features using a dynamic and static (DaS) data preprocessing technique to extract moving and spatial features of people and differentiate between line-of-sight (LoS) path blocking and non-blocking cases. To mitigate the feature attenuation problem caused by room partitions, we employ a voting scheme. We conduct evaluation and real-time experiments to demonstrate that our proposed TCD-FERN system can achieve human presence detection for multi-room scenarios using fewer commodity WiFi APs. ",

In this paper, we propose a novel time series generator, named directed chain GANs (DC-GANs), which inserts a time series dataset (called a neighborhood process of the directed chain or input) into the drift and diffusion coefficients of the directed chain SDEs with distributional constraints. DC-GANs can generate new time series of the same distribution as the neighborhood process, and the neighborhood process will provide the key step in learning and generating multimodal distributed time series. The proposed DC-GANs are examined on four datasets, including two stochastic models from social sciences and computational neuroscience, and two real-world datasets on stock prices and energy consumption. To our best knowledge, DC-GANs are the first work that can generate multimodal time series data and consistently outperforms state-of-the-art benchmarks with respect to measures of distribution, data similarity, and predictive ability.

This process, also known as selective forgetting or unlearning, is often conducted by partitioning a dataset into shards, training fully independent models on each, then ensembling the resulting models. Increasing the number of shards reduces the expected cost to forget but at the same time it increases inference cost and reduces the final accuracy of the model since synergistic information between samples is lost during the independent model training. Rather than treating each shard as independent, SAFE introduces the notion of a shard graph, which allows incorporating limited information from other shards during training, trading off a modest increase in expected forgetting cost with a significant increase in accuracy, all while still attaining complete removal of residual influence after forgetting. SAFE uses a lightweight system of adapters which can be trained while reusing most of the computations. This allows SAFE to be trained on shards an order-of-magnitude smaller than current state-of-the-art methods (thus reducing the forgetting costs) while also maintaining high accuracy, as we demonstrate empirically on fine-grained computer vision datasets.

Our autoencoder-based architecture is designed to learn codes based on consecutive blocks of bits, which obtains de-noising advantages over bit-by-bit processing to help overcome the physical separation between the encoder and decoder over a noisy channel. Moreover, we develop a power control layer at the encoder to explicitly incorporate hardware constraints into the learning optimization, and prove that the resulting average power constraint is satisfied asymptotically. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our scheme outperforms state-of-the-art feedback codes by wide margins over practical forward and feedback noise regimes, and provide information-theoretic insights on the behavior of our non-linear codes. Moreover, we observe that, in a long blocklength regime, canonical error correction codes are still preferable to feedback codes when the feedback noise becomes high. ",

    "abstract": "Neural operator architectures approximate operators between infinite-dimensional Banach spaces of functions. They are gaining increased attention in computational science and engineering, due to their potential both to accelerate traditional numerical methods and to enable data-driven discovery. A popular variant of neural operators is the Fourier neural operator (FNO). Previous analysis proving universal operator approximation theorems for FNOs resorts to use of an unbounded number of Fourier modes and limits the basic form of the method to problems with periodic geometry. Prior work relies on intuition from traditional numerical methods, and interprets the FNO as a nonstandard and highly nonlinear spectral method. The present work challenges this point of view in two ways: (i) the work introduces a new broad class of operator approximators, termed nonlocal neural operators (NNOs), which allow for operator approximation between functions defined on arbitrary geometries, and includes the FNO as a special case; and (ii) analysis of the NNOs shows that, provided this architecture includes computation of a spatial average (corresponding to retaining only a single Fourier mode in the special case of the FNO) it benefits from universal approximation. It is demonstrated that this theoretical result unifies the analysis of a wide range of neural operator architectures. Furthermore, it sheds new light on the role of nonlocality, and its interaction with nonlinearity, thereby paving the way for a more systematic exploration of nonlocality, both through the development of new operator learning architectures and the analysis of existing and new architectures.

    "abstract": "Deep learning models, even the-state-of-the-art ones, are highly vulnerable to adversarial examples. Adversarial training is one of the most efficient methods to improve the model's robustness. The key factor for the success of adversarial training is the capability to generate qualified and divergent adversarial examples which satisfy some objectives/goals (e.g., finding adversarial examples that maximize the model losses for simultaneously attacking multiple models). Therefore, multi-objective optimization (MOO) is a natural tool for adversarial example generation to achieve multiple objectives/goals simultaneously. However, we observe that a naive application of MOO tends to maximize all objectives/goals equally, without caring if an objective/goal has been achieved yet. This leads to useless effort to further improve the goal-achieved tasks, while putting less focus on the goal-unachieved tasks. In this paper, we propose \\emph{Task Oriented MOO} to address this issue, in the context where we can explicitly define the goal achievement for a task. Our principle is to only maintain the goal-achieved tasks, while letting the optimizer spend more effort on improving the goal-unachieved tasks. We conduct comprehensive experiments for our Task Oriented MOO on various adversarial example generation schemes. The experimental results firmly demonstrate the merit of our proposed approach.

It has also become an important part of satellite-air-ground-sea integrated network (SAGS) for 6G communication. In order to achieve high mobility, UAV has strict requirements on communication latency, and it cannot be illegally controlled as weapons of attack with malicious intentions. Therefore, an efficient and secure communication method specifically designed for UAV network is required. This paper proposes a communication mechanism named ESCM for the above requirements. For high efficiency of communication, ESCM designs a routing protocol based on artificial bee colony algorithm (ABC) for UAV network to accelerate communication between UAVs. Meanwhile, we plan to use blockchain to guarantee the communication security of UAV networks. However, blockchain has unstable links in high mobility network scenarios, resulting in low consensus efficiency and high communication overhead. Therefore, ESCM also introduces the concept of the digital twin, mapping the UAVs from the physical world into Cyberspace, transforming the UAV network into a static network. And this virtual UAV network is called CyberUAV. Then, in CyberUAV, we design a blockchain system and propose a consensus algorithm based on network coding, named proof of network coding (PoNC). PoNC not only ensures the security of ESCM, but also further improves the performance of ESCM through network coding. Simulation results show that ESCM has obvious advantages in communication efficiency and security. Moreover, encoding messages through PoNC consensus can increase the network throughput, and make mobile blockchain static through digital twin can improve the consensus success rate. ",

However, the instruction steps in such videos are typically short and sparse, with most of the video being irrelevant to the procedure. This motivates the need to temporally localize the instruction steps in such videos, i.e. the task called key-step localization. Traditional methods for key-step localization require video-level human annotations and thus do not scale to large datasets. In this work, we tackle the problem with no human supervision and introduce StepFormer, a self-supervised model that discovers and localizes instruction steps in a video. StepFormer is a transformer decoder that attends to the video with learnable queries, and produces a sequence of slots capturing the key-steps in the video. We train our system on a large dataset of instructional videos, using their automatically-generated subtitles as the only source of supervision. In particular, we supervise our system with a sequence of text narrations using an order-aware loss function that filters out irrelevant phrases. We show that our model outperforms all previous unsupervised and weakly-supervised approaches on step detection and localization by a large margin on three challenging benchmarks. Moreover, our model demonstrates an emergent property to solve zero-shot multi-step localization and outperforms all relevant baselines at this task. ",

To that end, we reformulate the threat model of PI and use inference data privacy attacks (IDPAs) to evaluate data privacy. We then present an enhanced IDPA, named distillation-based inverse-network attack (DINA), for improved privacy evaluation. Finally, we leverage the findings from DINA and propose C2PI, a two-party PI framework presenting an efficient partitioning of the neural network model and requiring only the initial few layers to be performed with MPC protocols. Based on our experimental evaluations, relaxing the formal data privacy guarantees C2PI can speed up existing PI frameworks, including Delphi [1] and Cheetah [2], up to 2.89x and 3.88x under LAN and WAN settings, respectively, and save up to 2.75x communication costs.

    "abstract": "With the increasing development of e-commerce and online services, personalized recommendation systems have become crucial for enhancing user satisfaction and driving business revenue. Traditional sequential recommendation methods that rely on explicit item IDs encounter challenges in handling item cold start and domain transfer problems. Recent approaches have attempted to use modal features associated with items as a replacement for item IDs, enabling the transfer of learned knowledge across different datasets. However, these methods typically calculate the correlation between the model's output and item embeddings, which may suffer from inconsistencies between high-level feature vectors and low-level feature embeddings, thereby hindering further model learning. To address this issue, we propose a dual-tower retrieval architecture for sequence recommendation. In this architecture, the predicted embedding from the user encoder is used to retrieve the generated embedding from the item encoder, thereby alleviating the issue of inconsistent feature levels. Moreover, in order to further improve the retrieval performance of the model, we also propose a self-supervised multi-modal pretraining method inspired by the consistency property of contrastive learning. This pretraining method enables the model to align various feature combinations of items, thereby effectively generalizing to diverse datasets with different item features. We evaluate the proposed method on five publicly available datasets and conduct extensive experiments. The results demonstrate significant performance improvement of our method. ",

    "abstract": "Self-supervised learning (SSL) techniques have recently been integrated into the few-shot learning (FSL) framework and have shown promising results in improving the few-shot image classification performance. However, existing SSL approaches used in FSL typically seek the supervision signals from the global embedding of every single image. Therefore, during the episodic training of FSL, these methods cannot capture and fully utilize the local visual information in image samples and the data structure information of the whole episode, which are beneficial to FSL. To this end, we propose to augment the few-shot learning objective with a novel self-supervised Episodic Spatial Pretext Task (ESPT). Specifically, for each few-shot episode, we generate its corresponding transformed episode by applying a random geometric transformation to all the images in it. Based on these, our ESPT objective is defined as maximizing the local spatial relationship consistency between the original episode and the transformed one. With this definition, the ESPT-augmented FSL objective promotes learning more transferable feature representations that capture the local spatial features of different images and their inter-relational structural information in each input episode, thus enabling the model to generalize better to new categories with only a few samples. Extensive experiments indicate that our ESPT method achieves new state-of-the-art performance for few-shot image classification on three mainstay benchmark datasets.

We propose the parametric surrogate gradient (PSG) method to iteratively update SG and eventually determine an optimal surrogate gradient parameter, which calibrates the shape of candidate SGs. In SNNs, neural potential distribution tends to deviate unpredictably due to quantization error.

We further fine-tune UnixCoder, the best-performing model for zero-shot cross-programming language code search, for the Code Cloning task with the SBT IRs of C code-pairs, available in the CodeNet dataset. This allows us to learn latent representations for the IRs of the C codes, which are transferable to the IRs of the COBOL codes. With this fine-tuned UnixCoder, we get a performance improvement of 12.85 MAP@2 over the pre-trained UniXCoder model, in a zero-shot setting, on the COBOL test split synthesized from the CodeNet dataset. This demonstrates the efficacy of our meta-model based approach to facilitate cross-programming language transfer. ",

    "abstract": "The scene graph is a new data structure describing objects and their pairwise relationship within image scenes. As the size of scene graph in vision applications grows, how to losslessly and efficiently store such data on disks or transmit over the network becomes an inevitable problem. However, the compression of scene graph is seldom studied before because of the complicated data structures and distributions. Existing solutions usually involve general-purpose compressors or graph structure compression methods, which is weak at reducing redundancy for scene graph data. This paper introduces a new lossless compression framework with adaptive predictors for joint compression of objects and relations in scene graph data. The proposed framework consists of a unified prior extractor and specialized element predictors to adapt for different data elements. Furthermore, to exploit the context information within and between graph elements, Graph Context Convolution is proposed to support different graph context modeling schemes for different graph elements. Finally, a learned distribution model is devised to predict numerical data under complicated conditional constraints. Experiments conducted on labeled or generated scene graphs proves the effectiveness of the proposed framework in scene graph lossless compression task. ",

FL enables clients to train a global model collaboratively without accessing their local training data. However, the current FL schemes are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Its architecture makes detecting and defending against malicious model updates difficult. In addition, most recent studies to detect FL from malicious updates while maintaining the model's privacy have not been sufficiently explored. This paper proposed blockchain-based federated learning with SMPC model verification against poisoning attacks for healthcare systems. First, we check the machine learning model from the FL participants through an encrypted inference process and remove the compromised model. Once the participants' local models have been verified, the models are sent to the blockchain node to be securely aggregated. We conducted several experiments with different medical datasets to evaluate our proposed framework. ",

    "abstract": "Recently, 3D object detection has attracted significant attention and achieved continuous improvement in real road scenarios. The environmental information is collected from a single sensor or multi-sensor fusion to detect interested objects. However, most of the current 3D object detection approaches focus on developing advanced network architectures to improve the detection precision of the object rather than considering the dynamic driving scenes, where data collected from sensors equipped in the vehicle contain various perturbation features. As a result, existing work cannot still tackle the perturbation issue. In order to solve this problem, we propose a group equivariant bird's eye view network (GeqBevNet) based on the group equivariant theory, which introduces the concept of group equivariant into the BEV fusion object detection network. The group equivariant network is embedded into the fused BEV feature map to facilitate the BEV-level rotational equivariant feature extraction, thus leading to lower average orientation error. In order to demonstrate the effectiveness of the GeqBevNet, the network is verified on the nuScenes validation dataset in which mAOE can be decreased to 0.325. Experimental results demonstrate that GeqBevNet can extract more rotational equivariant features in the 3D object detection of the actual road scene and improve the performance of object orientation prediction.

This modeling concept arises in, e.g., endocrinology when episodic hormone secretion events and elimination rates are simultaneously estimated from sampled hormone concentration measurements. The pulsatile secretion is modeled with a train of Dirac impulses constituting the input to a linear plant, which represents stimulated hormone secretion and elimination. A previously developed one-step estimation algorithm effectively resolves the trade-off between data fit and impulsive input sparsity. The present work improves the algorithm so that it requires less manual tuning and produces more accurate results through the use of an information criterion. It is also extended to handle outliers and unknown basal levels that are commonly recognized issues in biomedical data. The algorithm performance is evaluated both theoretically and experimentally on synthetic and clinical data. ",

Existing methods in this category are normally formulated with two separate stages, where a directional guide is required to be determined at first and the scalar projection of the intermediate-level perturbation onto the directional guide is enlarged thereafter. The obtained perturbation deviates from the guide inevitably in the feature space, and it is revealed in this paper that such a deviation may lead to sub-optimal attack. To address this issue, we develop a novel intermediate-level method that crafts adversarial examples within a single stage of optimization. In particular, the proposed method, named intermediate-level perturbation decay (ILPD), encourages the intermediate-level perturbation to be in an effective adversarial direction and to possess a great magnitude simultaneously. In-depth discussion verifies the effectiveness of our method. Experimental results show that it outperforms state-of-the-arts by large margins in attacking various victim models on ImageNet (+10.07% on average) and CIFAR-10 (+3.88% on average).

Specifically, first, a novel sample-wise augmentation strategy is developed that generates semantically and counterfactually meaningful deep features with distinct augmentation strength for each sample. Second, we derive an easy-to-compute surrogate loss on the augmented feature set when the number of augmented samples becomes infinite. Third, two concrete schemes are proposed, including direct quantification and meta-learning, to derive the key parameters for the robust loss. In addition, ICDA is explained from a regularization aspect, with extensive experiments indicating that our method consistently improves the generalization performance of popular depth networks on multiple typical learning scenarios that require out-of-distribution generalization.

    "abstract": "Today, state-of-the-art deep neural networks that process events first convert them into dense, grid-like input representations before using an off-the-shelf network. However, selecting the appropriate representation for the task traditionally requires training a neural network for each representation and selecting the best one based on the validation score, which is very time-consuming. In this work, we eliminate this bottleneck by selecting the best representation based on the Gromov-Wasserstein Discrepancy (GWD) between the raw events and their representation. It is approximately 200 times faster to compute than training a neural network and preserves the task performance ranking of event representations across multiple representations, network backbones, and datasets. This means that finding a representation with a high task score is equivalent to finding a representation with a low GWD. We use this insight to, for the first time, perform a hyperparameter search on a large family of event representations, revealing new and powerful representations that exceed the state-of-the-art. On object detection, our optimized representation outperforms existing representations by 1.9% mAP on the 1 Mpx dataset and 8.6% mAP on the Gen1 dataset and even outperforms the state-of-the-art by 1.8% mAP on Gen1 and state-of-the-art feed-forward methods by 6.0% mAP on the 1 Mpx dataset.

    "abstract": "Nowadays, embedded devices are increasingly present in everyday life, often controlling and processing critical information. For this reason, these devices make use of cryptographic protocols. However, embedded devices are particularly vulnerable to attackers seeking to hijack their operation and extract sensitive information. Code-Reuse Attacks (CRAs) can steer the execution of a program to malicious outcomes, leveraging existing on-board code without direct access to the device memory. Moreover, Side-Channel Attacks (SCAs) may reveal secret information to the attacker based on mere observation of the device. In this paper, we are particularly concerned with thwarting CRAs and SCAs against embedded devices, while taking into account their resource limitations. Fine-grained code diversification can hinder CRAs by introducing uncertainty to the binary code; while software mechanisms can thwart timing or power SCAs. The resilience to either attack may come at the price of the overall efficiency. Moreover, a unified approach that preserves these mitigations against both CRAs and SCAs is not available. This is the main novelty of our approach, Secure Diversity by Construction (SecDivCon); a combinatorial compiler-based approach that combines software diversification against CRAs with software mitigations against SCAs. SecDivCon restricts the performance overhead in the generated code, offering a secure-by-design control on the performance-security trade-off. Our experiments show that SCA-aware diversification is effective against CRAs, while preserving SCA mitigation properties at a low, controllable overhead. Given the combinatorial nature of our approach, SecDivCon is suitable for small, performance-critical functions that are sensitive to SCAs. SecDivCon may be used as a building block to whole-program code diversification or in a re-randomization scheme of cryptographic code. ",

Recent work has shown that neural networks trained with supervised learning can achieve real-time optimal control in some specific scenarios. In these methods, the networks (termed G&CNets) are trained to learn the optimal state feedback from a dataset of optimal trajectories. An important problem with these methods is the reality gap encountered in the sim-to-real transfer. In this work, we trained G&CNets for energy-optimal end-to-end control on the Bebop drone and identified the unmodeled pitch moment as the main contributor to the reality gap. To mitigate this, we propose an adaptive control strategy that works by learning from optimal trajectories of a system affected by constant external pitch, roll and yaw moments. In real test flights, this model mismatch is estimated onboard and fed to the network to obtain the optimal rpm command. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by performing energy-optimal hover-to-hover flights with and without moment feedback. Finally, we compare the adaptive controller to a state-of-the-art differential-flatness-based controller in a consecutive waypoint flight and demonstrate the advantages of our method in terms of energy optimality and robustness.

The use of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) Amplify-and-Forward (AF) relaying as a moving access point or BS, on the other hand, has emerged as a potential solution to wireless networks' high traffic demands. In this paper, we study joint user pair and resource allocation-based distance to optimize fair throughput in a downlink scenario, which concentrates on UAV-aided communication from different wireless-powered nodes. Several transmission methods are proposed, including NOMA as well as UAV cooperative relaying and two representative node-pairing strategies. The simulation results illustrate that the proposed user pairing strategies for cooperative NOMA and UAV-based cellular networks enhance downlink transmission performance and ensure optimum use of power and bandwidth resources.

Since these networks can take advantage of scheduled contact plans, distributed algorithms like the Contact Graph Routing (CGR) can be utilized to optimize data delivery performance. However, despite the numerous improvements made to CGR, there is a lack of proposals to prioritize traffic with distinct quality of service (QoS) requirements. This study presents adaptations to CGR to improve QoS-compliant delivery ratio when transmitting traffic with different latency constraints, along with an integer linear programming optimization model that serves as a performance upper bound.

The TRNG is implemented by utilizing the crossbar's variation in device switching thresholds to generate random bits. The PUF is implemented using the same crossbar initialized as an entropy source for the TRNG. Additionally, the weights locking concept is introduced to enhance the security of NNs by preventing unauthorized access to the NN weights. The proposed architecture provides flexibility to configure the RRAM device in multiple modes to suit different applications. It shows promise in achieving a more efficient and compact design for the hardware implementation of NNs and security primitives. ",

GNNs are characterized by the ultra-sparse nature of their adjacency matrix that necessitates the development of dedicated hardware beyond general-purpose sparse matrix multipliers. While there has been extensive research on designing dedicated hardware accelerators for GNNs, few have extensively explored the impact of the sparse storage format on the efficiency of the GNN accelerators. This paper proposes SCV-GNN with the novel sparse compressed vectors (SCV) format optimized for the aggregation operation. We use Z-Morton ordering to derive a data-locality-based computation ordering and partitioning scheme. The paper also presents how the proposed SCV-GNN is scalable on a vector processing system. Experimental results over various datasets show that the proposed method achieves a geometric mean speedup of $7.96\\times$ and $7.04\\times$ over CSC and CSR aggregation operations, respectively. The proposed method also reduces the memory traffic by a factor of $3.29\\times$ and $4.37\\times$ over compressed sparse column (CSC) and compressed sparse row (CSR), respectively. Thus, the proposed novel aggregation format reduces the latency and memory access for GNN inference. ",

In this work, we employ established gaze event detection algorithms for fixations and saccades and quantitatively evaluate the impact of these events by determining their concept influence. Input features that belong to saccades are shown to be substantially more important than features that belong to fixations. By dissecting saccade events into sub-events, we are able to show that gaze samples that are close to the saccadic peak velocity are most influential. We further investigate the effect of event properties like saccadic amplitude or fixational dispersion on the resulting concept influence. ",

Most state-of-the-art neural networks are over-parameterized and require a high computational cost. One straightforward solution is to replace the layers of the networks with their low-rank tensor approximations using different tensor decomposition methods. This paper reviews six tensor decomposition methods and illustrates their ability to compress model parameters of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and Transformers. The accuracy of some compressed models can be higher than the original versions. Evaluations indicate that tensor decompositions can achieve significant reductions in model size, run-time and energy consumption, and are well suited for implementing neural networks on edge devices.

Such a drastic increase led to a growing interest in distributed ML, which in turn made worker failures and adversarial attacks an increasingly pressing concern. While distributed byzantine resilient algorithms have been proposed in a differentiable setting, none exist in a gradient-free setting. The goal of this work is to address this shortcoming. For that, we introduce a more general definition of byzantine-resilience in ML - the \\textit{model-consensus}, that extends the definition of the classical distributed consensus. We then leverage this definition to show that a general class of gradient-free ML algorithms - ($1,\\lambda$)-Evolutionary Search - can be combined with classical distributed consensus algorithms to generate gradient-free byzantine-resilient distributed learning algorithms. We provide proofs and pseudo-code for two specific cases - the Total Order Broadcast and proof-of-work leader election. ",

    "abstract": "Deep learning-based multi-view stereo has emerged as a powerful paradigm for reconstructing the complete geometrically-detailed objects from multi-views. Most of the existing approaches only estimate the pixel-wise depth value by minimizing the gap between the predicted point and the intersection of ray and surface, which usually ignore the surface topology. It is essential to the textureless regions and surface boundary that cannot be properly reconstructed. To address this issue, we suggest to take advantage of point-to-surface distance so that the model is able to perceive a wider range of surfaces. To this end, we predict the distance volume from cost volume to estimate the signed distance of points around the surface. Our proposed RA-MVSNet is patch-awared, since the perception range is enhanced by associating hypothetical planes with a patch of surface. Therefore, it could increase the completion of textureless regions and reduce the outliers at the boundary. Moreover, the mesh topologies with fine details can be generated by the introduced distance volume. Comparing to the conventional deep learning-based multi-view stereo methods, our proposed RA-MVSNet approach obtains more complete reconstruction results by taking advantage of signed distance supervision. The experiments on both the DTU and Tanks \\& Temples datasets demonstrate that our proposed approach achieves the state-of-the-art results. ",

As previous UDA&DG semantic segmentation methods are mostly based on outdated networks, we benchmark more recent architectures, reveal the potential of Transformers, and design the DAFormer network tailored for UDA&DG. It is enabled by three training strategies to avoid overfitting to the source domain: While (1) Rare Class Sampling mitigates the bias toward common source domain classes, (2) a Thing-Class ImageNet Feature Distance and (3) a learning rate warmup promote feature transfer from ImageNet pretraining. As UDA&DG are usually GPU memory intensive, most previous methods downscale or crop images. However, low-resolution predictions often fail to preserve fine details while models trained with cropped images fall short in capturing long-range, domain-robust context information. Therefore, we propose HRDA, a multi-resolution framework for UDA&DG, that combines the strengths of small high-resolution crops to preserve fine segmentation details and large low-resolution crops to capture long-range context dependencies with a learned scale attention. DAFormer and HRDA significantly improve the state-of-the-art UDA&DG by more than 10 mIoU on 5 different benchmarks. The implementation is available at https://github.com/lhoyer/HRDA. ",

Crafting a suitable observation, only containing crucial information, has been shown to be a challenging task itself. To improve data efficiency and generalization capabilities, we propose Compact Reshaped Observation Processing (CROP) to reduce the state information used for policy optimization. By providing only relevant information, overfitting to a specific training layout is precluded and generalization to unseen environments is improved. We formulate three CROPs that can be applied to fully observable observation- and action-spaces and provide methodical foundation. We empirically show the improvements of CROP in a distributionally shifted safety gridworld.

In this context, the authors' previous work proposed a robust measurement-based control scheme accounting for the uncertainties of the estimated models. In this scheme, a recursive least squares (RLS)-based method estimates the grid model (in the form of voltage magnitude sensitivity coefficients). Then, a robust control problem optimizes power set-points of distributed energy resources (DERs) such that the nodal voltage limits are satisfied. The estimated voltage sensitivity coefficients are used to model the nodal voltages, and the control robustness is achieved by accounting for their uncertainties. This work presents the first experimental validation of such a robust model-less control scheme on a real power distribution grid.

We focus on the design of efficient approximation schemes, i.e., with running time $f(\\varepsilon,\\mathcal{F}) \\cdot n^{O(1)}$, which are also of significant interest to both communities. Technically, our main contribution is a linear-time approximation-preserving reduction from (Induced) Subgraph Hitting on any graph class $\\mathcal{G}$ of bounded expansion to the same problem on bounded degree graphs within $\\mathcal{G}$. This yields a novel algorithmic technique to design (efficient) approximation schemes for the problem on very broad graph classes, well beyond the state-of-the-art. Specifically, applying this reduction, we derive approximation schemes with (almost) linear running time for the problem on any graph classes that have strongly sublinear separators and many important classes of geometric intersection graphs (such as fat-object graphs, pseudo-disk graphs, etc.). Our proofs introduce novel concepts and combinatorial observations that may be of independent interest (and, which we believe, will find other uses) for studies of approximation algorithms, parameterized complexity, sparse graph classes, and geometric intersection graphs. As a byproduct, we also obtain the first robust algorithm for $k$-Subgraph Isomorphism on intersection graphs of fat objects and pseudo-disks, with running time $f(k) \\cdot n \\log n + O(m)$. ",

With this paper, we address that gap by applying two popular sparsification methods on populations of models (so called model zoos) to create sparsified versions of the original zoos. We investigate the performance of these two methods for each zoo, compare sparsification layer-wise, and analyse agreement between original and sparsified populations. We find both methods to be very robust with magnitude pruning able outperform variational dropout with the exception of high sparsification ratios above 80%. Further, we find sparsified models agree to a high degree with their original non-sparsified counterpart, and that the performance of original and sparsified model is highly correlated.

Large deep networks have become increasingly effective at modeling complex video data in a self-supervised manner, as evaluated by metrics based on human perceptual similarity or pixel-wise comparison. However, it remains unclear whether current metrics are accurate indicators of performance on downstream tasks. We find empirically that for planning robotic manipulation, existing metrics can be unreliable at predicting execution success. To address this, we propose a benchmark for action-conditioned video prediction in the form of a control benchmark that evaluates a given model for simulated robotic manipulation through sampling-based planning. Our benchmark, Video Prediction for Visual Planning ($VP^2$), includes simulated environments with 11 task categories and 310 task instance definitions, a full planning implementation, and training datasets containing scripted interaction trajectories for each task category. A central design goal of our benchmark is to expose a simple interface -- a single forward prediction call -- so it is straightforward to evaluate almost any action-conditioned video prediction model. We then leverage our benchmark to study the effects of scaling model size, quantity of training data, and model ensembling by analyzing five highly-performant video prediction models, finding that while scale can improve perceptual quality when modeling visually diverse settings, other attributes such as uncertainty awareness can also aid planning performance.

While these features are not specific to HDR, and also augment the equality prediction performances of VQA models on SDR content, they are especially effective on HDR. HDRMAX features modify powerful priors drawn from Natural Video Statistics (NVS) models by enhancing their measurability where they visually impact the brightest and darkest local portions of videos, thereby capturing distortions that are often poorly accounted for by existing VQA models. As a demonstration of the efficacy of our approach, we show that, while current state-of-the-art VQA models perform poorly on 10-bit HDR databases, their performances are greatly improved by the inclusion of HDRMAX features when tested on HDR and 10-bit distorted videos.

There is a need for rapid COVID-19 diagnosis to identify high-risk patients and maximize the use of limited medical resources. Motivated by this fact, we proposed the deep learning framework MEDNC for automatic prediction and diagnosis of COVID-19 using computed tomography (CT) images. Our model was trained using two publicly available sets of COVID-19 data. And it was built with the inspiration of transfer learning. Results indicated that the MEDNC greatly enhanced the detection of COVID-19 infections, reaching an accuracy of 98.79% and 99.82% respectively. We tested MEDNC on a brain tumor and a blood cell dataset to show that our model applies to a wide range of problems. The outcomes demonstrated that our proposed models attained an accuracy of 99.39% and 99.28%, respectively. This COVID-19 recognition tool could help optimize healthcare resources and reduce clinicians' workload when screening for the virus. ",

    "abstract": "Surface roughness is a crucial factor influencing the performance and functionality of additive manufactured components. Accurate prediction of surface roughness is vital for optimizing manufacturing processes and ensuring the quality of the final product. Quantum computing has recently gained attention as a potential solution for tackling complex problems and creating precise predictive models. In this research paper, we conduct an in-depth comparison of three quantum algorithms i.e. the Quantum Neural Network (QNN), Quantum Forest (Q-Forest), and Variational Quantum Classifier (VQC) adapted for regression for predicting surface roughness in additive manufactured specimens for the first time. We assess the algorithms performance using Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Explained Variance Score (EVS) as evaluation metrics. Our findings show that the Q-Forest algorithm surpasses the other algorithms, achieving an MSE of 56.905, MAE of 7.479, and an EVS of 0.2957. In contrast, the QNN algorithm displays a higher MSE of 60.840 and MAE of 7.671, coupled with a negative EVS of -0.444, indicating that it may not be appropriate for predicting surface roughness in this application. The VQC adapted for regression exhibits an MSE of 59.121, MAE of 7.597, and an EVS of -0.0106, suggesting its performance is also inferior to the Q-Forest algorithm. ",

It offers a highly modular approach for estimating covariance functions of stationary processes. Our method can impose positive definiteness, as well as isotropy and monotonicity, on the estimators, and its hyperparameters can be decided using cross validation. We define our estimators by taking integral transforms of kernel-based distribution surrogates. We then use the iterated density estimation evolutionary algorithm, a variant of estimation of distribution algorithms, to fit the estimators. We also extend our method to estimate covariance functions for point-referenced data. Compared to alternative approaches, our method provides more reliable estimates for long-range dependence. Several numerical studies are performed to demonstrate the efficacy and performance of our method. Also, we illustrate our method using precipitation data from the Spatial Interpolation Comparison 97 project. ",

    "abstract": "The quest to find extraterrestrial life is a critical scientific endeavor with civilization-level implications. Icy moons in our solar system are promising targets for exploration because their liquid oceans make them potential habitats for microscopic life. However, the lack of a precise definition of life poses a fundamental challenge to formulating detection strategies. To increase the chances of unambiguous detection, a suite of complementary instruments must sample multiple independent biosignatures (e.g., composition, motility/behavior, and visible structure). Such an instrument suite could generate 10,000x more raw data than is possible to transmit from distant ocean worlds like Enceladus or Europa. To address this bandwidth limitation, Onboard Science Instrument Autonomy (OSIA) is an emerging discipline of flight systems capable of evaluating, summarizing, and prioritizing observational instrument data to maximize science return. We describe two OSIA implementations developed as part of the Ocean Worlds Life Surveyor (OWLS) prototype instrument suite at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. The first identifies life-like motion in digital holographic microscopy videos, and the second identifies cellular structure and composition via innate and dye-induced fluorescence. Flight-like requirements and computational constraints were used to lower barriers to infusion, similar to those available on the Mars helicopter, \"Ingenuity.\" We evaluated the OSIA's performance using simulated and laboratory data and conducted a live field test at the hypersaline Mono Lake planetary analog site. Our study demonstrates the potential of OSIA for enabling biosignature detection and provides insights and lessons learned for future mission concepts aimed at exploring the outer solar system. ",

The source module produces an excitation signal from the F0 information, then the resolution-wise convolutional filter module combines the excitation signal with processed acoustic features at various temporal resolutions and finally reconstructs the raw waveform. The experimental results show that our proposed SF-GAN vocoder outperforms the state-of-the-art HiFi-GAN and Fre-GAN in both analysis-synthesis (AS) and text-to-speech (TTS) tasks, and the synthesized speech quality of SF-GAN is comparable to the ground-truth audio.

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's Disease is a devastating neurological disorder that is increasingly affecting the elderly population. Early and accurate detection of Alzheimer's is crucial for providing effective treatment and support for patients and their families. In this study, we present a novel approach for detecting four different stages of Alzheimer's disease from MRI scan images based on inertia tensor analysis and machine learning. From each available MRI scan image for different classes of Dementia, we first compute a very simple 2 x 2 matrix, using the techniques of forming a moment of inertia tensor, which is largely used in different physical problems. Using the properties of the obtained inertia tensor and their eigenvalues, along with some other machine learning techniques, we were able to significantly classify the different types of Dementia. This process provides a new and unique approach to identifying and classifying different types of images using machine learning, with a classification accuracy of (90%) achieved. Our proposed method not only has the potential to be more cost-effective than current methods but also provides a new physical insight into the disease by reducing the dimension of the image matrix. The results of our study highlight the potential of this approach for advancing the field of Alzheimer's disease detection and improving patient outcomes. ",

However, they suffer from lower angular resolution due to being captured by fisheye lenses with the same sensor size for capturing planar images. To solve the above issues, we propose a two-stage framework for 360{\\deg} omnidirectional image superresolution. The first stage employs two branches: model A, which incorporates omnidirectional position-aware deformable blocks (OPDB) and Fourier upsampling, and model B, which adds a spatial frequency fusion module (SFF) to model A. Model A aims to enhance the feature extraction ability of 360{\\deg} image positional information, while Model B further focuses on the high-frequency information of 360{\\deg} images. The second stage performs same-resolution enhancement based on the structure of model A with a pixel unshuffle operation. In addition, we collected data from YouTube to improve the fitting ability of the transformer, and created pseudo low-resolution images using a degradation network. Our proposed method achieves superior performance and wins the NTIRE 2023 challenge of 360{\\deg} omnidirectional image super-resolution. ",

We proposed data augmentation methods designed to train a high accuracy deep learning network for medical image segmentation. The proposed data augmentation approaches are called KeepMask and KeepMix, which can create medical images by better identifying the boundary of the organ with no more parameters. Our methods achieved better performance and obtained more precise boundaries for medical image segmentation on datasets.

We investigate the performance of the deep neural network in a limited labelled dataset scenario and propose a novel contrastive pretraining strategy that learns invariant representation for phase and intensity data. We show that with 10% of the training set, our proposed pretraining strategy helps the model achieve an F1 score of 0.84 whereas the model achieves an F1 score of 0.60 without it. Further, we analyse the importance of phase and intensity individually towards tissue classification. ",

We analyze the learning performance by studying the phase diagram in terms of the training set size, the dataset noise and the inference temperature (i.e. the weight regularization). With a small but informative dataset the machine can learn by memorization. With a noisy dataset, an extensive number of examples above a critical threshold is needed. In this regime the memory storage limits of the system becomes an opportunity for the occurrence of a learning regime in which the system can generalize. ",
