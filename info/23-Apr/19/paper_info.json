In this research, the laser induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) technique is used for quantitative analysis of aluminum alloys by different Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) architecture. The fundamental harmonic (1064 nm) of a nanosecond Nd:YAG laser pulse is employed to generate the LIBS plasma for the prediction of constituent concentrations of the aluminum standard samples. Here, Recurrent Neural Networks based on different networks, such as Long Short Term Memory (LSTM), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), Simple Recurrent Neural Network (Simple RNN), and as well as Recurrent Convolutional Networks comprising of Conv-SimpleRNN, Conv-LSTM and Conv-GRU are utilized for concentration prediction. Then a comparison is performed among prediction by classical machine learning methods of support vector regressor (SVR), the Multi Layer Perceptron (MLP), Decision Tree algorithm, Gradient Boosting Regression (GBR), Random Forest Regression (RFR), Linear Regression, and k-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) algorithm. Results showed that the machine learning tools based on Convolutional Recurrent Networks had the best efficiencies in prediction of the most of the elements among other multivariate methods. ",

    "abstract": "Predicting the State-of-Health (SoH) of lithium-ion batteries is a fundamental task of battery management systems on electric vehicles. It aims at estimating future SoH based on historical aging data. Most existing deep learning methods rely on filter-based feature extractors (e.g., CNN or Kalman filters) and recurrent time sequence models. Though efficient, they generally ignore cyclic features and the domain gap between training and testing batteries. To address this problem, we present CyFormer, a transformer-based cyclic time sequence model for SoH prediction. Instead of the conventional CNN-RNN structure, we adopt an encoder-decoder architecture. In the encoder, row-wise and column-wise attention blocks effectively capture intra-cycle and inter-cycle connections and extract cyclic features. In the decoder, the SoH queries cross-attend to these features to form the final predictions. We further utilize a transfer learning strategy to narrow the domain gap between the training and testing set. To be specific, we use fine-tuning to shift the model to a target working condition. Finally, we made our model more efficient by pruning. The experiment shows that our method attains an MAE of 0.75\\% with only 10\\% data for fine-tuning on a testing battery, surpassing prior methods by a large margin. Effective and robust, our method provides a potential solution for all cyclic time sequence prediction tasks. ",

Uncertainty estimation-based control barrier functions (CBFs) are utilized to ensure robust safety in the presence of model uncertainties, which may depend on control input and states. We present a new uncertainty/disturbance estimator with theoretical upper bounds on estimation error and estimated outputs, which are used to ensure robust safety by formulating a convex optimization problem using a high-order CBF. The possibly unsafe nominal feedback controller is augmented with the proposed estimator in two frameworks (1) an uncertainty compensator and (2) a robustifying reformulation of CBF constraint with respect to the estimator outputs. The former scheme ensures safety with performance improvement by adaptively rejecting the matched uncertainty. The second method uses uncertainty estimation to robustify higher-order CBFs for safety-critical control. The proposed methods are demonstrated in simulations of an uncertain adaptive cruise control problem and a multirotor obstacle avoidance situation. ",

    "abstract": "Graph neural networks (GNNs) have emerged as a state-of-the-art approach to model and draw inferences from large scale graph-structured data in various application settings such as social networking. The primary goal of a GNN is to learn an embedding for each graph node in a dataset that encodes both the node features and the local graph structure around the node. Embeddings generated by a GNN for a graph node are unique to that GNN. Prior work has shown that GNNs are prone to model extraction attacks. Model extraction attacks and defenses have been explored extensively in other non-graph settings. While detecting or preventing model extraction appears to be difficult, deterring them via effective ownership verification techniques offer a potential defense. In non-graph settings, fingerprinting models, or the data used to build them, have shown to be a promising approach toward ownership verification. We present GrOVe, a state-of-the-art GNN model fingerprinting scheme that, given a target model and a suspect model, can reliably determine if the suspect model was trained independently of the target model or if it is a surrogate of the target model obtained via model extraction. We show that GrOVe can distinguish between surrogate and independent models even when the independent model uses the same training dataset and architecture as the original target model. Using six benchmark datasets and three model architectures, we show that consistently achieves low false-positive and false-negative rates. We demonstrate that is robust against known fingerprint evasion techniques while remaining computationally efficient. ",

This problem is motivated by the application of cooperative localization for accurately estimating positions of autonomous vehicles by choosing a set of relative position measurements and establishing associated communication links. We also examine an associated problem where every robot is limited by payload, budget, and communication to pick no more than a specified number of relative position measurements. The basic underlying formulation for these problems is nonlinear and is known to be NP-hard. We solve this network design problem by formulating it as a mixed-integer semi-definite program (MISDP) and reformulating it into a mixed-integer linear program to obtain optimal solutions using cutting plane algorithms. We propose a novel upper-bounding algorithm based on the hierarchy of principal minor characterization of positive semi-definite matrices. We further discuss a degree-constrained lower bounding formulation, inspired by robust network structures. In addition, we propose a maximum-cost heuristic with low computational complexity to find high-quality feasible solutions. We show extensive computational results corroborating our proposed methods.

    "abstract": "Human drivers naturally reason about interactions between road users to understand and safely navigate through traffic. Thus, developing autonomous vehicles necessitates the ability to mimic such knowledge and model interactions between road users to understand and navigate unpredictable, dynamic environments. However, since real-world scenarios often differ from training datasets, effectively modeling the behavior of various road users in an environment remains a significant research challenge. This reality necessitates models that generalize to a broad range of domains and explicitly model interactions between road users and the environment to improve scenario understanding. Graph learning methods address this problem by modeling interactions using graph representations of scenarios. However, existing methods cannot effectively transfer knowledge gained from the training domain to real-world scenarios. This constraint is caused by the domain-specific rules used for graph extraction that can vary in effectiveness across domains, limiting generalization ability. To address these limitations, we propose RoadScene2Graph (RS2G): a data-driven graph extraction and modeling approach that learns to extract the best graph representation of a road scene for solving autonomous scene understanding tasks. We show that RS2G enables better performance at subjective risk assessment than rule-based graph extraction methods and deep-learning-based models. RS2G also improves generalization and Sim2Real transfer learning, which denotes the ability to transfer knowledge gained from simulation datasets to unseen real-world scenarios. We also present ablation studies showing how RS2G produces a more useful graph representation for downstream classifiers. Finally, we show how RS2G can identify the relative importance of rule-based graph edges and enables intelligent graph sparsity tuning. ",

    "abstract": "This work addresses the block-diagonal semidefinite program (SDP) relaxations for the clique number of the Paley graphs. The size of the maximal clique (clique number) of a graph is a classic NP-complete problem; a Paley graph is a deterministic graph where two vertices are connected if their difference is a quadratic residue modulo certain prime powers. Improving the upper bound for the Paley graph clique number for odd prime powers is an open problem in combinatorics. Moreover, since quadratic residues exhibit pseudorandom properties, Paley graphs are related to the construction of deterministic restricted isometries, an open problem in compressed sensing and sparse recovery. Recent work provides evidence that the current upper bounds can be improved by the sum-of-squares (SOS) relaxations. In particular the bounds given by the SOS relaxations of degree 4 (SOS-4) are asymptotically growing at an order smaller than square root of the prime. However computations of SOS-4 become intractable with respect to large graphs. Gvozdenovic et al. introduced a more computationally efficient block-diagonal hierarchy of SDPs that refines the SOS hierarchy. They computed the values of these SDPs of degrees 2 and 3 (L2 and L3 respectively) for the Paley graph clique numbers associated with primes p less or equal to 809. These values bound from the above the values of the corresponding SOS-4 and SOS-6 relaxations respectively. We revisit these computations and determine the values of the L2 relaxation for larger p's. Our results provide additional numerical evidence that the L2 relaxations, and therefore also the SOS-4 relaxations, are asymptotically growing at an order smaller than the square root of p. ",

Although the literature is full of works addressing the energy consumption problem via cell-switching, where small cells with low or no load are turned off and the traffic is offloaded to either adjacent base stations or macro cells, in terrestrial communication networks, they may not be feasible when there is either a lack of infrastructure or insufficient capacity due to high demand. The integration of non-terrestrial networks (NTN) into the cell-switching process can be considered as a visionary approach to handle this problem. In this regard, high altitude platform station (HAPS) draws considerable attention with its massive footprint, high capacity, and ubiquitous connectivity. The aim of this study is to show the potential benefits of using HAPS in cell-switching methods by being a bountiful host for offloaded users from cell-switching operations. More specifically, HAPS is included in the network so that it can increase the switching off opportunities by providing extra coverage and capacity. The simulation results demonstrate that a significant amount of reduction in energy consumption (as high as 16%) is obtained while ensuring quality-of-service (QoS) requirements. ",

To incorporate graph structure information, graph-based approaches such as Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) can be naturally applied. However, applying GNNs to the accident prediction problem faces challenges due to the lack of suitable graph-structured traffic accident datasets. To bridge this gap, we have constructed a real-world graph-based Traffic Accident Prediction (TAP) data repository, along with two representative tasks: accident occurrence prediction and accident severity prediction. With nationwide coverage, real-world network topology, and rich geospatial features, this data repository can be used for a variety of traffic-related tasks.

In this paper, we investigate the use of UAV-mounted relays in order to help mitigate the reduced data rates of blocked links in maritime communications. Various communication architectures are considered based on the positioning mechanism of the UAV; in this regard, fixed, k-means algorithm-based, and landing spot-based positioning approaches are examined. On the other hand, since UAVs are predominantly battery-operated, the energy consumption performances of these approaches are also measured. Results reveal that the landing spot-based UAV relay positioning approach finds the best trade-off between the data rate and energy consumption. ",

Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT) and RAFT are seen as the most applicable consensus mechanisms (CMs) in blockchain-enabled wireless networks. However, previous studies on PBFT and RAFT rarely consider the channel performance of the physical layer, such as path loss and channel fading, resulting in research results that are far from real networks. Additionally, 6G communications will widely deploy high-frequency signals such as terahertz (THz) and millimeter wave (mmWave), while performances of PBFT and RAFT are still unknown when these signals are transmitted in wireless PBFT or RAFT networks. Therefore, it is urgent to study the performance of non-ideal wireless PBFT and RAFT networks with THz and mmWave signals, to better make PBFT and RAFT play a role in the 6G era. In this paper, we study and compare the performance of THz and mmWave signals in non-ideal wireless PBFT and RAFT networks, considering Rayleigh Fading (RF) and close-in Free Space (FS) reference distance path loss. Performance is evaluated by five metrics: consensus success rate, latency, throughput, reliability gain, and energy consumption. Meanwhile, we find and derive that there is a maximum distance between two nodes that can make CMs inevitably successful, and it is named the active distance of CMs. The research results not only analyze the performance of non-ideal wireless PBFT and RAFT networks, but also provide important references for the future transmission of THz and mmWave signals in PBFT and RAFT networks.

    "abstract": "Neural implicit methods have achieved high-quality 3D object surfaces under slight specular highlights. However, high specular reflections (HSR) often appear in front of target objects when we capture them through glasses. The complex ambiguity in these scenes violates the multi-view consistency, then makes it challenging for recent methods to reconstruct target objects correctly. To remedy this issue, we present a novel surface reconstruction framework, NeuS-HSR, based on implicit neural rendering. In NeuS-HSR, the object surface is parameterized as an implicit signed distance function (SDF). To reduce the interference of HSR, we propose decomposing the rendered image into two appearances: the target object and the auxiliary plane. We design a novel auxiliary plane module by combining physical assumptions and neural networks to generate the auxiliary plane appearance. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that NeuS-HSR outperforms state-of-the-art approaches for accurate and robust target surface reconstruction against HSR.

Among voice diseases, common diseases that cause hoarseness include spasmodic dysphonia, vocal cord paralysis, vocal nodule, and vocal cord polyp. This paper presents a voice disease detection method that can be applied in a wide range of clinical. We cooperated with Xiangya Hospital of Central South University to collect voice samples from sixty-one different patients. The Mel Frequency Cepstrum Coefficient (MFCC) parameters are extracted as input features to describe the voice in the form of data. An innovative model combining MFCC parameters and single convolution layer CNN is proposed for fast calculation and classification. The highest accuracy we achieved was 92%, it is fully ahead of the original research results and internationally advanced. And we use Advanced Voice Function Assessment Databases (AVFAD) to evaluate the generalization ability of the method we proposed, which achieved an accuracy rate of 98%. Experiments on clinical and standard datasets show that for the pathological detection of voice diseases, our method has greatly improved in accuracy and computational efficiency. ",

Most established reliable networks are unsuitable for all applications such as smart cities applications, and, in particular, Internet of Things (IoT) and Cyber Physical Systems (CPS) applications. The purpose of this paper is to provide a suitable DLT for IoT and CPS that could satisfy their requirements. The proposed work has been designed based on the requirements of Cyber Physical Systems. FlexiChain is proposed as a layer zero network that could be formed from independent blockchains. Also, NodeChain has been introduced to be a distributed (Unique ID) UID aggregation vault to secure all nodes' UIDs. Moreover, NodeChain is proposed to serve mainly FlexiChain for all node security requirements. NodeChain targets the security and integrity of each node. Also, the linked UIDs create a chain of narration that keeps track not merely for assets but also for who authenticated the assets. The security results present a higher resistance against four types of attacks. Furthermore, the strength of the network is presented from the early stages compared to blockchain and central authority. FlexiChain technology has been introduced to be a layer zero network for all CPS decentralized applications taking into accounts their requirements.

However, the use of simplified lighting models such as environment maps to represent non-distant illumination, or using a network to fit indirect light modeling without a solid basis, can lead to an undesirable decomposition between lighting and material. To address this, we propose a fully differentiable framework named neural ambient illumination (NeAI) that uses Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) as a lighting model to handle complex lighting in a physically based way. Together with integral lobe encoding for roughness-adaptive specular lobe and leveraging the pre-convoluted background for accurate decomposition, the proposed method represents a significant step towards integrating physically based rendering into the NeRF representation. The experiments demonstrate the superior performance of novel-view rendering compared to previous works, and the capability to re-render objects under arbitrary NeRF-style environments opens up exciting possibilities for bridging the gap between virtual and real-world scenes.

    "abstract": "Adversarial attacks are a serious threat to the reliable deployment of machine learning models in safety-critical applications. They can misguide current models to predict incorrectly by slightly modifying the inputs. Recently, substantial work has shown that adversarial examples tend to deviate from the underlying data manifold of normal examples, whereas pre-trained masked language models can fit the manifold of normal NLP data. To explore how to use the masked language model in adversarial detection, we propose a novel textual adversarial example detection method, namely Masked Language Model-based Detection (MLMD), which can produce clearly distinguishable signals between normal examples and adversarial examples by exploring the changes in manifolds induced by the masked language model. MLMD features a plug and play usage (i.e., no need to retrain the victim model) for adversarial defense and it is agnostic to classification tasks, victim model's architectures, and to-be-defended attack methods. We evaluate MLMD on various benchmark textual datasets, widely studied machine learning models, and state-of-the-art (SOTA) adversarial attacks (in total $3*4*4 = 48$ settings). Experimental results show that MLMD can achieve strong performance, with detection accuracy up to 0.984, 0.967, and 0.901 on AG-NEWS, IMDB, and SST-2 datasets, respectively. Additionally, MLMD is superior, or at least comparable to, the SOTA detection defenses in detection accuracy and F1 score. Among many defenses based on the off-manifold assumption of adversarial examples, this work offers a new angle for capturing the manifold change.

The drawback of such approximations is that they typically do not preserve stability and performance guarantees of the original MPC. However, such guarantees can be recovered if the maximum error with respect to the optimal control law and the Lipschitz constant of that error are known. We show in this work how to compute both values exactly when the control law is approximated by a maxout NN. We build upon related results for ReLU NN approximations and derive mixed-integer (MI) linear constraints that allow a computation of the output and the local gain of a maxout NN by solving an MI feasibility problem.

Most of the existing work focuses on supervised learning which requires a large number of labeled action sequences that are often expensive and time-consuming to annotate. In this paper, we address self-supervised 3D action representation learning for skeleton-based action recognition. We investigate self-supervised representation learning and design a novel skeleton cloud colorization technique that is capable of learning spatial and temporal skeleton representations from unlabeled skeleton sequence data. We represent a skeleton action sequence as a 3D skeleton cloud and colorize each point in the cloud according to its temporal and spatial orders in the original (unannotated) skeleton sequence. Leveraging the colorized skeleton point cloud, we design an auto-encoder framework that can learn spatial-temporal features from the artificial color labels of skeleton joints effectively. Specifically, we design a two-steam pretraining network that leverages fine-grained and coarse-grained colorization to learn multi-scale spatial-temporal features.In addition, we design a Masked Skeleton Cloud Repainting task that can pretrain the designed auto-encoder framework to learn informative representations. We evaluate our skeleton cloud colorization approach with linear classifiers trained under different configurations, including unsupervised, semi-supervised, fully-supervised, and transfer learning settings. Extensive experiments on NTU RGB+D, NTU RGB+D 120, PKU-MMD, NW-UCLA, and UWA3D datasets show that the proposed method outperforms existing unsupervised and semi-supervised 3D action recognition methods by large margins and achieves competitive performance in supervised 3D action recognition as well.

We also discuss the vulnerability of different DL systems and the irregular nature of decision boundaries. Our results show a remarkable difference in the transferability of AEs between speech and images, with the data relevance being low in images but opposite in speech recognition. Motivated by dropout-based ensemble approaches, we propose random gradient ensembles and dynamic gradient-weighted ensembles, and we evaluate the impact of ensembles on the transferability of AEs.

However, there still exist two main challenges including discovering indistinguishable objects and modeling the relationship between instances. To deal with these difficulties, we propose a novel object mining framework for instance segmentation. In this framework, we first introduce the semantics perceiving subnetwork to capture pixels that may belong to an obvious instance from the bottom up. Then, we propose an object excavating mechanism to discover indistinguishable objects. In the mechanism, preliminary perceived semantics are regarded as original instances with classifications and locations, and then indistinguishable objects around these original instances are mined, which ensures that hard objects are fully excavated. Next, an instance purifying strategy is put forward to model the relationship between instances, which pulls the similar instances close and pushes away different instances to keep intra-instance similarity and inter-instance discrimination. In this manner, the same objects are combined as the one instance and different objects are distinguished as independent instances. Extensive experiments on the COCO dataset show that the proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods, which validates the effectiveness of the proposed object mining framework. ",

    "abstract": "Source localization is the inverse problem of graph information dissemination and has broad practical applications. However, the inherent intricacy and uncertainty in information dissemination pose significant challenges, and the ill-posed nature of the source localization problem further exacerbates these challenges. Recently, deep generative models, particularly diffusion models inspired by classical non-equilibrium thermodynamics, have made significant progress. While diffusion models have proven to be powerful in solving inverse problems and producing high-quality reconstructions, applying them directly to the source localization is infeasible for two reasons. Firstly, it is impossible to calculate the posterior disseminated results on a large-scale network for iterative denoising sampling, which would incur enormous computational costs. Secondly, in the existing methods for this field, the training data itself are ill-posed (many-to-one); thus simply transferring the diffusion model would only lead to local optima. To address these challenges, we propose a two-stage optimization framework, the source localization denoising diffusion model (SL-Diff). In the coarse stage, we devise the source proximity degrees as the supervised signals to generate coarse-grained source predictions. This aims to efficiently initialize the next stage, significantly reducing its convergence time and calibrating the convergence process. Furthermore, the introduction of cascade temporal information in this training method transforms the many-to-one mapping relationship into a one-to-one relationship, perfectly addressing the ill-posed problem. In the fine stage, we design a diffusion model for the graph inverse problem that can quantify the uncertainty in the dissemination. The proposed SL-Diff yields excellent prediction results within a reasonable sampling time at extensive experiments. ",

    "abstract": "Federated learning (FL) enables multiple parties to collaboratively train a machine learning model without sharing their data; rather, they train their own model locally and send updates to a central server for aggregation. Depending on how the data is distributed among the participants, FL can be classified into Horizontal (HFL) and Vertical (VFL). In VFL, the participants share the same set of training instances but only host a different and non-overlapping subset of the whole feature space. Whereas in HFL, each participant shares the same set of features while the training set is split into locally owned training data subsets. VFL is increasingly used in applications like financial fraud detection; nonetheless, very little work has analyzed its security. In this paper, we focus on robustness in VFL, in particular, on backdoor attacks, whereby an adversary attempts to manipulate the aggregate model during the training process to trigger misclassifications. Performing backdoor attacks in VFL is more challenging than in HFL, as the adversary i) does not have access to the labels during training and ii) cannot change the labels as she only has access to the feature embeddings. We present a first-of-its-kind clean-label backdoor attack in VFL, which consists of two phases: a label inference and a backdoor phase. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the attack on three different datasets, investigate the factors involved in its success, and discuss countermeasures to mitigate its impact. ",

The overall framework is implemented in the theorem prover HOL4 to be able to obtain highly trustworthy verification results. We demonstrate our approach to establish sound execution time bounds for a control loop program implemented for an ARM Cortex-M0 processor. ",

    "title": "A Domain-Region Based Evaluation of ML Performance Robustness to  Covariate Shift",
    "abstract": "Most machine learning methods assume that the input data distribution is the same in the training and testing phases. However, in practice, this stationarity is usually not met and the distribution of inputs differs, leading to unexpected performance of the learned model in deployment. The issue in which the training and test data inputs follow different probability distributions while the input-output relationship remains unchanged is referred to as covariate shift. In this paper, the performance of conventional machine learning models was experimentally evaluated in the presence of covariate shift. Furthermore, a region-based evaluation was performed by decomposing the domain of probability density function of the input data to assess the classifier's performance per domain region. Distributional changes were simulated in a two-dimensional classification problem. Subsequently, a higher four-dimensional experiments were conducted. Based on the experimental analysis, the Random Forests algorithm is the most robust classifier in the two-dimensional case, showing the lowest degradation rate for accuracy and F1-score metrics, with a range between 0.1% and 2.08%. Moreover, the results reveal that in higher-dimensional experiments, the performance of the models is predominantly influenced by the complexity of the classification function, leading to degradation rates exceeding 25% in most cases. It is also concluded that the models exhibit high bias towards the region with high density in the input space domain of the training samples. ",

During training, given a reference query, we mine a number of similar phrases using approximate nearest neighbour search. These sampled phrases are then used as negative examples in the context list alongside random and ground truth contextual information. By including approximate nearest neighbour phrases (ANN-P) in the context list, we encourage the learned representation to disambiguate between similar, but not identical, biasing phrases. This improves biasing accuracy when there are several similar phrases in the biasing inventory. We carry out experiments in a large-scale data regime obtaining up to 7% relative word error rate reductions for the contextual portion of test data. We also extend and evaluate CATT approach in streaming applications. ",

At the same time, soft-output decoding is of critical importance for iterative receivers and decoders. In this paper, we focus on the soft-output DNN-based decoding problem. We start with the syndrome-based approach proposed by Bennatan et al. (2018) and modify it to provide soft output in the AWGN channel. The new decoder can be considered as an approximation of the MAP decoder with smaller computation complexity. We discuss various regularization functions for joint DNN-MAP training and compare the resulting distributions for [64, 45] BCH code. Finally, to demonstrate the soft-output quality we consider the turbo-product code with [64, 45] BCH codes as row and column codes. We show that the resulting DNN-based scheme is very close to the MAP-based performance and significantly outperforms the solution based on the Chase decoder. We come to the conclusion that the new method is prospective for the challenging problem of DNN-based decoding of long codes consisting of short component codes. ",

Despite the exploration of adaptive label assignment in recent oriented object detectors, the extreme geometry shape and limited feature of oriented tiny objects still induce severe mismatch and imbalance issues. Specifically, the position prior, positive sample feature, and instance are mismatched, and the learning of extreme-shaped objects is biased and unbalanced due to little proper feature supervision. To tackle these issues, we propose a dynamic prior along with the coarse-to-fine assigner, dubbed DCFL. For one thing, we model the prior, label assignment, and object representation all in a dynamic manner to alleviate the mismatch issue. For another, we leverage the coarse prior matching and finer posterior constraint to dynamically assign labels, providing appropriate and relatively balanced supervision for diverse instances. Extensive experiments on six datasets show substantial improvements to the baseline. Notably, we obtain the state-of-the-art performance for one-stage detectors on the DOTA-v1.5, DOTA-v2.0, and DIOR-R datasets under single-scale training and testing.

    "abstract": "With the end of Moore's Law, there is a growing demand for rapid architectural innovations in modern processors, such as RISC-V custom extensions, to continue performance scaling. Program sampling is a crucial step in microprocessor design, as it selects representative simulation points for workload simulation. While SimPoint has been the de-facto approach for decades, its limited expressiveness with Basic Block Vector (BBV) requires time-consuming human tuning, often taking months, which impedes fast innovation and agile hardware development. This paper introduces Neural Program Sampling (NPS), a novel framework that learns execution embeddings using dynamic snapshots of a Graph Neural Network. NPS deploys AssemblyNet for embedding generation, leveraging an application's code structures and runtime states. AssemblyNet serves as NPS's graph model and neural architecture, capturing a program's behavior in aspects such as data computation, code path, and data flow. AssemblyNet is trained with a data prefetch task that predicts consecutive memory addresses. In the experiments, NPS outperforms SimPoint by up to 63%, reducing the average error by 38%. Additionally, NPS demonstrates strong robustness with increased accuracy, reducing the expensive accuracy tuning overhead. Furthermore, NPS shows higher accuracy and generality than the state-of-the-art GNN approach in code behavior learning, enabling the generation of high-quality execution embeddings. ",

We subsequently analyzed trends in the manually annotated data and tested the extent to which ethical concerns can be automatically classified by means of natural language processing (NLP).

    "abstract": "Neural ranking models (NRMs) have demonstrated effective performance in several information retrieval (IR) tasks. However, training NRMs often requires large-scale training data, which is difficult and expensive to obtain. To address this issue, one can train NRMs via weak supervision, where a large dataset is automatically generated using an existing ranking model (called the weak labeler) for training NRMs. Weakly supervised NRMs can generalize from the observed data and significantly outperform the weak labeler. This paper generalizes this idea through an iterative re-labeling process, demonstrating that weakly supervised models can iteratively play the role of weak labeler and significantly improve ranking performance without using manually labeled data. The proposed Generalized Weak Supervision (GWS) solution is generic and orthogonal to the ranking model architecture. This paper offers four implementations of GWS: self-labeling, cross-labeling, joint cross- and self-labeling, and greedy multi-labeling. GWS also benefits from a query importance weighting mechanism based on query performance prediction methods to reduce noise in the generated training data. We further draw a theoretical connection between self-labeling and Expectation-Maximization. Our experiments on two passage retrieval benchmarks suggest that all implementations of GWS lead to substantial improvements compared to weak supervision in all cases. ",

    "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become a popular tool for learning on graphs, but their widespread use raises privacy concerns as graph data can contain personal or sensitive information. Differentially private GNN models have been recently proposed to preserve privacy while still allowing for effective learning over graph-structured datasets. However, achieving an ideal balance between accuracy and privacy in GNNs remains challenging due to the intrinsic structural connectivity of graphs. In this paper, we propose a new differentially private GNN called ProGAP that uses a progressive training scheme to improve such accuracy-privacy trade-offs. Combined with the aggregation perturbation technique to ensure differential privacy, ProGAP splits a GNN into a sequence of overlapping submodels that are trained progressively, expanding from the first submodel to the complete model. Specifically, each submodel is trained over the privately aggregated node embeddings learned and cached by the previous submodels, leading to an increased expressive power compared to previous approaches while limiting the incurred privacy costs. We formally prove that ProGAP ensures edge-level and node-level privacy guarantees for both training and inference stages, and evaluate its performance on benchmark graph datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that ProGAP can achieve up to 5%-10% higher accuracy than existing state-of-the-art differentially private GNNs. ",

    "abstract": "Young learners are increasingly introduced to programming, and one of the main challenges for educators is to achieve learning success while also creating enthusiasm. As it is particularly difficult to achieve this enthusiasm initially in young females, prior work has identified gender-specific differences in the programming behavior of young learners. Since pair programming, which turns programming into a more sociable activity, has been proposed as an approach to support programming education, in this paper we aim to investigate whether similar gender-specific characteristics can also be observed during pair programming. Therefore, we designed a gender-neutral introductory SCRATCH programming course tailored for integrating pair programming principles, and conducted it with a total of 139 students aged between 8 and 14 years. To identify gender-dependent differences and similarities, we measure the attitude towards programming and the course setting, observe the behavior of the students while programming, and analyze the code of the programs for different gender-combinations. Overall, our study demonstrates that pair programming is well suited for young learners and results in a positive attitude. While the resulting programs are similar in quality and complexity independent of gender, differences are evident when it comes to the compliance to pair programming roles, the exploration of code, and the creative customization of programs. These findings contribute to an in-depth understanding of social and technical gender specifics of pair programming, and provide educators with resources and guidance for implementing gender-sensitive pair programming in the classroom.

In cases where the number of training samples is limited, synthetic computer-generated data sets can be used to improve these methods. This requires the synthesis of cell shapes as well as corresponding microscopy images using generative models. To synthesize realistic living cell shapes, the shape representation used by the generative model should be able to accurately represent fine details and changes in topology, which are common in cells. These requirements are not met by 3D voxel masks, which are restricted in resolution, and polygon meshes, which do not easily model processes like cell growth and mitosis. In this work, we propose to represent living cell shapes as level sets of signed distance functions (SDFs) which are estimated by neural networks. We optimize a fully-connected neural network to provide an implicit representation of the SDF value at any point in a 3D+time domain, conditioned on a learned latent code that is disentangled from the rotation of the cell shape. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach on cells that exhibit rapid deformations (Platynereis dumerilii), cells that grow and divide (C. elegans), and cells that have growing and branching filopodial protrusions (A549 human lung carcinoma cells). A quantitative evaluation using shape features, Hausdorff distance, and Dice similarity coefficients of real and synthetic cell shapes shows that our model can generate topologically plausible complex cell shapes in 3D+time with high similarity to real living cell shapes. Finally, we show how microscopy images of living cells that correspond to our generated cell shapes can be synthesized using an image-to-image model. ",

Inspired by the complementary advantages of classical 3D reconstruction and NeRF, we thus investigate marrying explicit geometric representation with NeRF rendering to achieve efficient online reconstruction and high-quality rendering. We introduce SurfelNeRF, a variant of neural radiance field which employs a flexible and scalable neural surfel representation to store geometric attributes and extracted appearance features from input images. We further extend the conventional surfel-based fusion scheme to progressively integrate incoming input frames into the reconstructed global neural scene representation. In addition, we propose a highly-efficient differentiable rasterization scheme for rendering neural surfel radiance fields, which helps SurfelNeRF achieve $10\\times$ speedups in training and inference time, respectively.

We anticipate explanations to be invariant under certain transformations, such as changes to the colour map while responding in an equivariant manner to transformations like translation, object scaling, and rotation. We have found remarkable differences in robustness depending on the type of transformation, with some explainability methods (such as LRP composites and Guided Backprop) being more stable than others. We also explore the role of training with data augmentation. We provide evidence that explanations are typically less robust to augmentation than classification performance, regardless of whether data augmentation is used in training or not. ",

    "abstract": "Federated learning (FL) is a promising paradigm that enables distributed clients to collaboratively train a shared global model while keeping the training data locally. However, the performance of FL is often limited by poor communication links and slow convergence when FL is deployed over wireless networks. Besides, due to the limited radio resources, it is crucial to select clients and control resource allocation accurately for improved FL performance. Motivated by these challenges, a joint optimization problem of client selection and resource allocation is formulated in this paper, aiming to minimize the total time consumption of each round in FL over non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) enabled wireless network. Specifically, based on a metric termed the age of update (AoU), we first propose a novel client selection scheme by accounting for the staleness of the received local FL models. After that, the closed-form solutions of resource allocation are obtained by monotonicity analysis and dual decomposition method. Moreover, to further improve the performance of FL, the deployment of artificial neural network (ANN) at the server is proposed to predict the local FL models of the unselected clients at each round. Finally, extensive simulation results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed schemes. ",

    "abstract": "Learning disentangled representations is important in representation learning, aiming to learn a low dimensional representation of data where each dimension corresponds to one underlying generative factor. Due to the possibility of causal relationships between generative factors, causal disentangled representation learning has received widespread attention. In this paper, we first propose a new flows that can incorporate causal structure information into the model, called causal flows. Based on the variational autoencoders(VAE) commonly used in disentangled representation learning, we design a new model, CF-VAE, which enhances the disentanglement ability of the VAE encoder by utilizing the causal flows. By further introducing the supervision of ground-truth factors, we demonstrate the disentanglement identifiability of our model. Experimental results on both synthetic and real datasets show that CF-VAE can achieve causal disentanglement and perform intervention experiments. Moreover, CF-VAE exhibits outstanding performance on downstream tasks and has the potential to learn causal structure among factors. ",

In terms of quality management, the introduction of time restrictions brings new challenges to maintaining the temporal consistency of KGs and detecting potential temporal conflicts.

We start from the common pattern of temporal facts and constraints and propose a pattern-based temporal constraint mining method, PaTeCon. PaTeCon uses automatically determined graph patterns and their relevant statistical information over the given KG instead of human experts to generate time constraints. Specifically, PaTeCon dynamically attaches class restriction to candidate constraints according to their measuring scores.We evaluate PaTeCon on two large-scale datasets based on Wikidata and Freebase respectively. The experimental results show that pattern-based automatic constraint mining is powerful in generating valuable temporal constraints. ",

    "abstract": "Knowledge graphs and ontologies provide promising technical solutions for implementing the FAIR Principles for Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable data and metadata. However, they also come with their own challenges. Nine such challenges are discussed and associated with the criterion of cognitive interoperability and specific FAIREr principles (FAIR + Explorability raised) that they fail to meet. We introduce an easy-to-use, open source knowledge graph framework that is based on knowledge graph building blocks (KGBBs). KGBBs are small information modules for knowledge-processing, each based on a specific type of semantic unit. By interrelating several KGBBs, one can specify a KGBB-driven FAIREr knowledge graph. Besides implementing semantic units, the KGBB Framework clearly distinguishes and decouples an internal in-memory data model from data storage, data display, and data access/export models. We argue that this decoupling is essential for solving many problems of knowledge management systems. We discuss the architecture of the KGBB Framework as we envision it, comprising (i) an openly accessible KGBB-Repository for different types of KGBBs, (ii) a KGBB-Engine for managing and operating FAIREr knowledge graphs (including automatic provenance tracking, editing changelog, and versioning of semantic units); (iii) a repository for KGBB-Functions; (iv) a low-code KGBB-Editor with which domain experts can create new KGBBs and specify their own FAIREr knowledge graph without having to think about semantic modelling. We conclude with discussing the nine challenges and how the KGBB Framework provides solutions for the issues they raise. While most of what we discuss here is entirely conceptual, we can point to two prototypes that demonstrate the principle feasibility of using semantic units and KGBBs to manage and structure knowledge graphs.

Specifically, we develop schema-aware prompts that effectively utilize the semantic structure within the knowledge graph. As code inherently possesses structure, such as class and function definitions, it serves as a useful model for prior semantic structural knowledge.

    "abstract": "Click-through rate (CTR) prediction is of great importance in recommendation systems and online advertising platforms. When served in industrial scenarios, the user-generated data observed by the CTR model typically arrives as a stream. Streaming data has the characteristic that the underlying distribution drifts over time and may recur. This can lead to catastrophic forgetting if the model simply adapts to new data distribution all the time. Also, it's inefficient to relearn distribution that has been occurred. Due to memory constraints and diversity of data distributions in large-scale industrial applications, conventional strategies for catastrophic forgetting such as replay, parameter isolation, and knowledge distillation are difficult to be deployed. In this work, we design a novel drift-aware incremental learning framework based on ensemble learning to address catastrophic forgetting in CTR prediction. With explicit error-based drift detection on streaming data, the framework further strengthens well-adapted ensembles and freezes ensembles that do not match the input distribution avoiding catastrophic interference. Both evaluations on offline experiments and A/B test shows that our method outperforms all baselines considered. ",

However, the representations of the items and words are usually modeled in two separated semantic spaces, which leads to misalignment issue between them. Consequently, this will cause the CRS to only achieve a sub-optimal ranking performance, especially when there is a lack of sufficient information from the user's input. To address limitations of previous works, we propose a new CRS framework KLEVER, which jointly models items and their associated contextual words in the same semantic space. Particularly, we construct an item descriptive graph from the rich items' textual features, such as item description and categories. Based on the constructed descriptive graph, KLEVER jointly learns the embeddings of the words and items, towards enhancing both recommender and dialog generation modules. Extensive experiments on benchmarking CRS dataset demonstrate that KLEVER achieves superior performance, especially when the information from the users' responses is lacking. ",

The reason for Graph Neural Networks' superiority over other approaches is that many problems in recommendation systems can be naturally modeled as graphs, where nodes can be either users or items and edges represent preference relationships. In current Graph Neural Network approaches, nodes are represented with a static vector learned at training time. This static vector might only be suitable to capture some of the nuances of users or items they define. To overcome this limitation, we propose using a recently proposed model inspired by category theory: Sheaf Neural Networks. Sheaf Neural Networks, and its connected Laplacian, can address the previous problem by associating every node (and edge) with a vector space instead than a single vector. The vector space representation is richer and allows picking the proper representation at inference time. This approach can be generalized for different related tasks on graphs and achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of F1-Score@N in collaborative filtering and Hits@20 in link prediction. For collaborative filtering, the approach is evaluated on the MovieLens 100K with a 5.1% improvement, on MovieLens 1M with a 5.4% improvement and on Book-Crossing with a 2.8% improvement, while for link prediction on the ogbl-ddi dataset with a 1.6% refinement with respect to the respective baselines.

    "abstract": "Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are biologically realistic and practically promising in low-power computation because of their event-driven mechanism. Usually, the training of SNNs suffers accuracy loss on various tasks, yielding an inferior performance compared with ANNs. A conversion scheme is proposed to obtain competitive accuracy by mapping trained ANNs' parameters to SNNs with the same structures. However, an enormous number of time steps are required for these converted SNNs, thus losing the energy-efficient benefit. Utilizing both the accuracy advantages of ANNs and the computing efficiency of SNNs, a novel SNN training framework is proposed, namely layer-wise ANN-to-SNN knowledge distillation (LaSNN). In order to achieve competitive accuracy and reduced inference latency, LaSNN transfers the learning from a well-trained ANN to a small SNN by distilling the knowledge other than converting the parameters of ANN. The information gap between heterogeneous ANN and SNN is bridged by introducing the attention scheme, the knowledge in an ANN is effectively compressed and then efficiently transferred by utilizing our layer-wise distillation paradigm. We conduct detailed experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness, efficacy, and scalability of LaSNN on three benchmark data sets (CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny ImageNet). We achieve competitive top-1 accuracy compared to ANNs and 20x faster inference than converted SNNs with similar performance. More importantly, LaSNN is dexterous and extensible that can be effortlessly developed for SNNs with different architectures/depths and input encoding methods, contributing to their potential development.

We identify that the common speedup strategy in network architectures for coordinate networks has little effect on scene flow acceleration [see green (b)] unlike image reconstruction [see pink (b)]. With the dominant computational burden stemming instead from the Chamfer loss function, we propose to use a distance transform-based loss function to accelerate [see purple (b)], which achieves up to 30x speedup and on-par estimation performance compared to NSFP [see (c)].

    "abstract": "Real-scanned point clouds are often incomplete due to viewpoint, occlusion, and noise, which hampers 3D geometric modeling and perception. Existing point cloud completion methods tend to generate global shape skeletons and hence lack fine local details. Furthermore, they mostly learn a deterministic partial-to-complete mapping, but overlook structural relations in man-made objects. To tackle these challenges, this paper proposes a variational framework, Variational Relational point Completion Network (VRCNet) with two appealing properties: 1) Probabilistic Modeling. In particular, we propose a dual-path architecture to enable principled probabilistic modeling across partial and complete clouds. One path consumes complete point clouds for reconstruction by learning a point VAE. The other path generates complete shapes for partial point clouds, whose embedded distribution is guided by distribution obtained from the reconstruction path during training. 2) Relational Enhancement. Specifically, we carefully design point self-attention kernel and point selective kernel module to exploit relational point features, which refines local shape details conditioned on the coarse completion. In addition, we contribute multi-view partial point cloud datasets (MVP and MVP-40 dataset) containing over 200,000 high-quality scans, which render partial 3D shapes from 26 uniformly distributed camera poses for each 3D CAD model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VRCNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods on all standard point cloud completion benchmarks. Notably, VRCNet shows great generalizability and robustness on real-world point cloud scans. Moreover, we can achieve robust 3D classification for partial point clouds with the help of VRCNet, which can highly increase classification accuracy. ",

In this paper, we propose a Calibrate Proxy (CP) structure, which uses the real sample information to improve the similarity calculation in proxy-based loss and introduces a calibration loss to constraint the proxy optimization towards the center of the class features. At the same time, we set a small number of proxies for each class to alleviate the impact of intra-class differences on retrieval performance.

Adapting an explainable AI method in LIME (Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations), certain high-frequency waveform signatures of AE are to be attributed to two major pathways for pore formation in a DED process, namely, spatter events and insufficient fusion between adjacent printing tracks from low heat input. This approach opens an exciting possibility to predict, in real-time, the presence of a pore in every voxel (0.5 mm in size) as they are printed, a major leap forward compared to prior efforts. Synchronized multimodal sensor data including force, AE, vibration and temperature were gathered while an SS316L material sample was printed and subsequently machined. A deep convolution neural network classifier was used to identify the presence of pores on a voxel surface based on time-frequency patterns (spectrograms) of the sensor data collected during the process chain. The results suggest signals collected during DED were more sensitive compared to those from machining for detecting porosity in voxels (classification test accuracy of 87%). The underlying explanations drawn from LIME analysis suggests that energy captured in high frequency AE waveforms are 33% lower for porous voxels indicating a relatively lower laser-material interaction in the melt pool, and hence insufficient fusion and poor overlap between adjacent printing tracks. The porous voxels for which spatter events were prevalent during printing had about 27% higher energy contents in the high frequency AE band compared to other porous voxels. These signatures from AE signal can further the understanding of pore formation from spatter and insufficient fusion. ",

Each FSB-LSTM module consists of a full-band block to model spectro-temporal patterns at all frequencies and a sub-band block to model patterns within each sub-band, where each of the two blocks takes a down-sampled representation as input and returns an up-sampled discriminative representation to be added to the block input via a residual connection. The model is designed to have a low algorithmic complexity, a small run-time buffer and a very low algorithmic latency, at the same time producing a strong enhancement performance on a noisy-reverberant speech enhancement task even if the hop size is as low as $2$ ms.

    "abstract": "This paper presents a new observer-based approach to detect and isolate faulty sensors in industrial systems. Two types of sensor faults are considered: complete failure and sensor deterioration. The proposed method is applicable to general autonomous nonlinear systems without making any assumptions about its triangular and/or normal form, which is usually considered in the observer design literature. The key aspect of our approach is a learning-based design of the Luenberger observer, which involves using a neural network to approximate the injective map that transforms the nonlinear system into a stable linear system with output injection. This learning-based Luenberger observer accurately estimates the system's state, allowing for the detection of sensor faults through residual generation. The residual is computed as the norm of the difference between the system's measured output and the observer's predicted output vectors. Fault isolation is achieved by comparing each sensor's measurement with its corresponding predicted value. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in capturing and isolating sensor faults while remaining robust in the presence of measurement noise and system uncertainty. We validate our method through numerical simulations of sensor faults in a network of Kuramoto oscillators. ",

    "abstract": "Extent of resection after surgery is one of the main prognostic factors for patients diagnosed with glioblastoma. To achieve this, accurate segmentation and classification of residual tumor from post-operative MR images is essential. The current standard method for estimating it is subject to high inter- and intra-rater variability, and an automated method for segmentation of residual tumor in early post-operative MRI could lead to a more accurate estimation of extent of resection. In this study, two state-of-the-art neural network architectures for pre-operative segmentation were trained for the task. The models were extensively validated on a multicenter dataset with nearly 1000 patients, from 12 hospitals in Europe and the United States. The best performance achieved was a 61\\% Dice score, and the best classification performance was about 80\\% balanced accuracy, with a demonstrated ability to generalize across hospitals. In addition, the segmentation performance of the best models was on par with human expert raters. The predicted segmentations can be used to accurately classify the patients into those with residual tumor, and those with gross total resection. ",

In this sense, it may help to reduce the overfitting problem, since, after learning the model class over a larger data sample consisting of such different data sets, just a few parameters need to be adjusted for modeling a new, specific problem. After analyzing the method theoretically and by regression examples for different one-dimensional problems, we finally apply the approach to one of the standard problems asset managers and banks are facing: the calibration of spread curves. The presented results clearly show the potential that lies within this method. Furthermore, this application is of particular interest to financial practitioners, since nearly all asset managers and banks which are having solutions in place may need to adapt or even change their current methodologies when ESG ratings additionally affect the bond spreads.

    "abstract": "There exist very few ways to isolate cognitive processes, historically defined via highly controlled laboratory studies, in more ecologically valid contexts. Specifically, it remains unclear as to what extent patterns of neural activity observed under such constraints actually manifest outside the laboratory in a manner that can be used to make an accurate inference about the latent state, associated cognitive process, or proximal behavior of the individual. Improving our understanding of when and how specific patterns of neural activity manifest in ecologically valid scenarios would provide validation for laboratory-based approaches that study similar neural phenomena in isolation and meaningful insight into the latent states that occur during complex tasks. We argue that domain generalization methods from the brain-computer interface community have the potential to address this challenge. We previously used such an approach to decode phasic neural responses associated with visual target discrimination. Here, we extend that work to more tonic phenomena such as internal latent states. We use data from two highly controlled laboratory paradigms to train two separate domain-generalized models. We apply the trained models to an ecologically valid paradigm in which participants performed multiple, concurrent driving-related tasks. Using the pretrained models, we derive estimates of the underlying latent state and associated patterns of neural activity. Importantly, as the patterns of neural activity change along the axis defined by the original training data, we find changes in behavior and task performance consistent with the observations from the original, laboratory paradigms. We argue that these results lend ecological validity to those experimental designs and provide a methodology for understanding the relationship between observed neural activity and behavior during complex tasks.

Data augmentation is a typical methodology used in machine learning when confronted with a limited data set. In a classical approach image transformations i.e. rotations, cropping and brightness changes are used. In this work, a StyleGAN2-ADA model of Generative Adversarial Networks is trained on the limited COVID-19 chest X-ray image set. After assessing the quality of generated images they are used to increase the training data set improving its balance between classes. We consider the multi-class classification problem of chest X-ray images including the COVID-19 positive class that hasn't been yet thoroughly explored in the literature. Results of transfer learning-based classification of COVID-19 chest X-ray images are presented. The performance of several deep convolutional neural network models is compared. The impact on the detection performance of classical image augmentations i.e. rotations, cropping, and brightness changes are studied. Furthermore, classical image augmentation is compared with GAN-based augmentation. The most accurate model is an EfficientNet-B0 with an accuracy of 90.2 percent, trained on a dataset with a simple class balancing. The GAN augmentation approach is found to be subpar to classical methods for the considered dataset. ",

We are proposing two deep learning models in this paper, namely UNet and Deeplabv3, for the detection and segmentation of glioblastoma brain tumors using preprocessed brain MRI images. The performance evaluation is done for these models in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency. Our experimental results demonstrate that both UNet and Deeplabv3 models achieve accurate detection and segmentation of glioblastoma brain tumors. However, Deeplabv3 outperforms UNet in terms of accuracy, albeit at the cost of requiring more computational resources. Our proposed models offer a promising approach for the early detection and segmentation of glioblastoma brain tumors, which can aid in effective treatment strategies. Further research can focus on optimizing the computational efficiency of the Deeplabv3 model while maintaining its high accuracy for real-world clinical applications. Overall, our approach works and contributes to the field of medical image analysis and deep learning-based approaches for brain tumor detection and segmentation. Our suggested models can have a major influence on the prognosis and treatment of people with glioblastoma, a fatal form of brain cancer. It is necessary to conduct more research to examine the practical use of these models in real-life healthcare settings. ",

    "abstract": "Analysis of geospatial data has traditionally been model-based, with a mean model, customarily specified as a linear regression on the covariates, and a covariance model, encoding the spatial dependence. We relax the strong assumption of linearity and propose embedding neural networks directly within the traditional geostatistical models to accommodate non-linear mean functions while retaining all other advantages including use of Gaussian Processes to explicitly model the spatial covariance, enabling inference on the covariate effect through the mean and on the spatial dependence through the covariance, and offering predictions at new locations via kriging. We propose NN-GLS, a new neural network estimation algorithm for the non-linear mean in GP models that explicitly accounts for the spatial covariance through generalized least squares (GLS), the same loss used in the linear case. We show that NN-GLS admits a representation as a special type of graph neural network (GNN). This connection facilitates use of standard neural network computational techniques for irregular geospatial data, enabling novel and scalable mini-batching, backpropagation, and kriging schemes. Theoretically, we show that NN-GLS will be consistent for irregularly observed spatially correlated data processes. To our knowledge this is the first asymptotic consistency result for any neural network algorithm for spatial data. We demonstrate the methodology through simulated and real datasets. ",
