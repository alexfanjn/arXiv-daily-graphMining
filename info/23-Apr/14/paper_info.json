    "title": "Social Biases through the Text-to-Image Generation Lens",
    "abstract": "Text-to-Image (T2I) generation is enabling new applications that support creators, designers, and general end users of productivity software by generating illustrative content with high photorealism starting from a given descriptive text as a prompt. Such models are however trained on massive amounts of web data, which surfaces the peril of potential harmful biases that may leak in the generation process itself. In this paper, we take a multi-dimensional approach to studying and quantifying common social biases as reflected in the generated images, by focusing on how occupations, personality traits, and everyday situations are depicted across representations of (perceived) gender, age, race, and geographical location. Through an extensive set of both automated and human evaluation experiments we present findings for two popular T2I models: DALLE-v2 and Stable Diffusion. Our results reveal that there exist severe occupational biases of neutral prompts majorly excluding groups of people from results for both models. Such biases can get mitigated by increasing the amount of specification in the prompt itself, although the prompting mitigation will not address discrepancies in image quality or other usages of the model or its representations in other scenarios. Further, we observe personality traits being associated with only a limited set of people at the intersection of race, gender, and age. Finally, an analysis of geographical location representations on everyday situations (e.g., park, food, weddings) shows that for most situations, images generated through default location-neutral prompts are closer and more similar to images generated for locations of United States and Germany.

    "abstract": "In an era of knowledge-based economy, commercialized research and globalized competition for talent, the creation of innovation ecosystems and innovation networks is at the forefront of efforts of cities. In this context, public authorities, private organizations, and academics respond to the question of the most promising indicators that can predict innovation with various innovation scoreboards. The current paper aims at increasing the understanding of the existing indicators and complementing the various innovation assessment toolkits, using large datasets from non-traditional sources. The success of both top down implemented innovation districts and community-level innovation ecosystems is complex and has not been well examined. Yet, limited data shed light on the association between indicators and innovation performance at the neighborhood level. For this purpose, the city of Boston has been selected as a case study to reveal the importance of its neighborhood's different characteristics in achieving high innovation performance. The study uses a large geographically distributed dataset across Boston's 35 zip code areas, which contains various business, entrepreneurial-specific, socio-economic data and other types of data that can reveal contextual urban dimensions. Furthermore, in order to express the innovation performance of the zip code areas, new metrics are proposed connected to innovation locations. The outcomes of this analysis aim to introduce a 'Neighborhood Innovation Index' that will generate new planning models for higher innovation performance, which can be easily applied in other cases. By publishing this large-scale dataset of urban informatics, the goal is to contribute to the innovation discourse and enable a new theoretical framework that identifies the linkages among cities' socio-economic characteristics and innovation performance.

    "abstract": "We applied physics-informed neural networks to solve the constitutive relations for nonlinear, path-dependent material behavior. As a result, the trained network not only satisfies all thermodynamic constraints but also instantly provides information about the current material state (i.e., free energy, stress, and the evolution of internal variables) under any given loading scenario without requiring initial data. One advantage of this work is that it bypasses the repetitive Newton iterations needed to solve nonlinear equations in complex material models. Additionally, strategies are provided to reduce the required order of derivation for obtaining the tangent operator. The trained model can be directly used in any finite element package (or other numerical methods) as a user-defined material model. However, challenges remain in the proper definition of collocation points and in integrating several non-equality constraints that become active or non-active simultaneously. We tested this methodology on rate-independent processes such as the classical von Mises plasticity model with a nonlinear hardening law, as well as local damage models for interface cracking behavior with a nonlinear softening law. Finally, we discuss the potential and remaining challenges for future developments of this new approach. ",

    "abstract": "Combinatorial optimization (CO) aims to efficiently find the best solution to NP-hard problems ranging from statistical physics to social media marketing. A wide range of CO applications can benefit from local search methods because they allow reversible action over greedy policies. Deep Q-learning (DQN) using message-passing neural networks (MPNN) has shown promise in replicating the local search behavior and obtaining comparable results to the local search algorithms. However, the over-smoothing and the information loss during the iterations of message passing limit its robustness across applications, and the large message vectors result in memory inefficiency. Our paper introduces RELS-DQN, a lightweight DQN framework that exhibits the local search behavior while providing practical scalability. Using the RELS-DQN model trained on one application, it can generalize to various applications by providing solution values higher than or equal to both the local search algorithms and the existing DQN models while remaining efficient in runtime and memory.

However, their black-box nature and the risk of unexpected behaviors and surprising results pose a challenge to their deployment in real-world systems with strong guarantees of correctness and safety. We address these limitations by investigating the transformation of NN-based controllers into equivalent soft decision tree (SDT)-based controllers and its impact on verifiability. Differently from previous approaches, we focus on discrete-output NN controllers including rectified linear unit (ReLU) activation functions as well as argmax operations. We then devise an exact but cost-effective transformation algorithm, in that it can automatically prune redundant branches. We evaluate our approach using two benchmarks from the OpenAI Gym environment. Our results indicate that the SDT transformation can benefit formal verification, showing runtime improvements of up to 21x and 2x for MountainCar-v0 and CartPole-v0, respectively. ",

    "abstract": "Landslide susceptibility prediction has always been an important and challenging content. However, there are some uncertain problems to be solved in susceptibility modeling, such as the error of landslide samples and the complex nonlinear relationship between environmental factors. A self-screening graph convolutional network and long short-term memory network (SGCN-LSTM) is proposed int this paper to overcome the above problems in landslide susceptibility prediction. The SGCN-LSTM model has the advantages of wide width and good learning ability. The landslide samples with large errors outside the set threshold interval are eliminated by self-screening network, and the nonlinear relationship between environmental factors can be extracted from both spatial nodes and time series, so as to better simulate the nonlinear relationship between environmental factors. The SGCN-LSTM model was applied to landslide susceptibility prediction in Anyuan County, Jiangxi Province, China, and compared with Cascade-parallel Long Short-Term Memory and Conditional Random Fields (CPLSTM-CRF), Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and Logistic Regression (LR) models.The landslide prediction experiment in Anyuan County showed that the total accuracy and AUC of SGCN-LSTM model were the highest among the six models, and the total accuracy reached 92.38 %, which was 5.88%, 12.44%, 19.65%, 19.92% and 20.34% higher than those of CPLSTM-CRF, RF, SVM, SGD and LR models, respectively. The AUC value reached 0.9782, which was 0.0305,0.0532,0.1875,0.1909 and 0.1829 higher than the other five models, respectively. In conclusion, compared with some existing traditional machine learning, the SGCN-LSTM model proposed in this paper has higher landslide prediction accuracy and better robustness, and has a good application prospect in the LSP field.

    "abstract": "Simulation is essential to reinforcement learning (RL) before implementation in the real world, especially for safety-critical applications like robot manipulation. Conventionally, RL agents are sensitive to the discrepancies between the simulation and the real world, known as the sim-to-real gap. The application of domain randomization, a technique used to fill this gap, is limited to the imposition of heuristic-randomized models. We investigate the properties of intrinsic stochasticity of real-time simulation (RT-IS) of off-the-shelf simulation software and its potential to improve the robustness of RL methods and the performance of domain randomization. Firstly, we conduct analytical studies to measure the correlation of RT-IS with the occupation of the computer hardware and validate its comparability with the natural stochasticity of a physical robot. Then, we apply the RT-IS feature in the training of an RL agent. The simulation and physical experiment results verify the feasibility and applicability of RT-IS to robust RL agent design for robot manipulation tasks. The RT-IS-powered robust RL agent outperforms conventional RL agents on robots with modeling uncertainties. It requires fewer heuristic randomization and achieves better generalizability than the conventional domain-randomization-powered agents. Our findings provide a new perspective on the sim-to-real problem in practical applications like robot manipulation tasks. ",

In our work, we bridge the gap between EBMs and Entropy-regularized OT.

We validate the applicability of our method on toy 2D scenarios as well as standard unpaired image-to-image translation problems.

    "abstract": "We present Roto-Translation Equivariant Spherical Deconvolution (RT-ESD), an $E(3)\\times SO(3)$ equivariant framework for sparse deconvolution of volumes where each voxel contains a spherical signal. Such 6D data naturally arises in diffusion MRI (dMRI), a medical imaging modality widely used to measure microstructure and structural connectivity. As each dMRI voxel is typically a mixture of various overlapping structures, there is a need for blind deconvolution to recover crossing anatomical structures such as white matter tracts. Existing dMRI work takes either an iterative or deep learning approach to sparse spherical deconvolution, yet it typically does not account for relationships between neighboring measurements. This work constructs equivariant deep learning layers which respect to symmetries of spatial rotations, reflections, and translations, alongside the symmetries of voxelwise spherical rotations. As a result, RT-ESD improves on previous work across several tasks including fiber recovery on the DiSCo dataset, deconvolution-derived partial volume estimation on real-world \\textit{in vivo} human brain dMRI, and improved downstream reconstruction of fiber tractograms on the Tractometer dataset.

The algorithm includes GAN artificial face generation, forgery detection, and face recognition. Initially, a dataset of 120 images of actual facial drug abuse is used. By preserving, the drug traits, the 3DG-GA provides a dataset containing 3000 synthetic facial drug abuse images.

    "abstract": "Social media offers a unique lens to observe users emotions and subjective feelings toward critical events or topics and has been widely used to investigate public sentiment during crises, e.g., the COVID-19 pandemic. However, social media use varies across demographic groups, with younger people being more inclined to use social media than the older population. This digital divide could lead to biases in data representativeness and analysis results, causing a persistent challenge in research based on social media data. This study aims to tackle this challenge through a case study of estimating the public sentiment about the COVID-19 using social media data. We analyzed the pandemic-related Twitter data in the United States from January 2020 to December 2021. The objectives are: (1) to elucidate the uneven social media usage among various demographic groups and the disparities of their emotions toward COVID-19, (2) to construct an unbiased measurement for public sentiment based on social media data, the Sentiment Adjusted by Demographics (SAD) index, through the post-stratification method, and (3) to evaluate the spatially and temporally evolved public sentiment toward COVID-19 using the SAD index. The results show significant discrepancies among demographic groups in their COVID-19-related emotions. Female and under or equal to 18 years old Twitter users expressed long-term negative sentiment toward COVID-19. The proposed SAD index in this study corrected the underestimation of negative sentiment in 31 states, especially in Vermont. According to the SAD index, Twitter users in Wyoming (Vermont) posted the largest (smallest) percentage of negative tweets toward the pandemic. ",

To counteract the malicious usage of such techniques, deep learning-based deepfake detection methods have been employed and have exhibited remarkable performance. However, the performance of such detectors is often assessed on related benchmarks that hardly reflect real-world situations. For example, the impact of various image and video processing operations and typical workflow distortions on detection accuracy has not been systematically measured. In this paper, a more reliable assessment framework is proposed to evaluate the performance of learning-based deepfake detectors in more realistic settings. To the best of our acknowledgment, it is the first systematic assessment approach for deepfake detectors that not only reports the general performance under real-world conditions but also quantitatively measures their robustness toward different processing operations. To demonstrate the effectiveness and usage of the framework, extensive experiments and detailed analysis of three popular deepfake detection methods are further presented in this paper. In addition, a stochastic degradation-based data augmentation method driven by realistic processing operations is designed, which significantly improves the robustness of deepfake detectors. ",

Both the time-switching protocol (TS) and energy splitting (ES) protocol are considered for the STAR-RIS. To characterize system performance, the channel statistics are first provided, and the Gamma approximation is adopted for general cascaded $\\kappa$-$\\mu$ fading. Afterward, the closed-form expressions for both the secrecy outage probability and secrecy ergodic rate are derived. To obtain further insights, the asymptotic performance for the secrecy diversity order and the secrecy slope are deduced. The theoretical results show that 1) the secrecy diversity orders of the strong user and the weak user depend on the path loss exponent and the distribution of the received signal-to-noise ratio, respectively; 2) the secrecy slope of the ES protocol achieves the value of one, higher than the slope of the TS protocol which is the mode operation parameter of TS. The numerical results demonstrate that: 1) there is an optimal STAR-RIS mode operation parameter to maximize the system performance; 2) the STAR-RIS-NOMA significantly outperforms the STAR-RIS-orthogonal multiple access.

    "abstract": "We present a quasi-conforming embedded reproducing kernel particle method (QCE-RKPM) for modeling heterogeneous materials that makes use of techniques not available to mesh-based methods such as the finite element method (FEM) and avoids many of the drawbacks in current embedded and immersed formulations which are based on meshed methods. The different material domains are discretized independently thus avoiding time-consuming, conformal meshing. In this approach, the superposition of foreground (inclusion) and background (matrix) domain integration smoothing cells are corrected by a quasi-conforming quadtree subdivision on the background integration smoothing cells. Due to the non-conforming nature of the background integration smoothing cells near the material interfaces, a variationally consistent (VC) correction for domain integration is introduced to restore integration constraints and thus optimal convergence rates at a minor computational cost. Additional interface integration smoothing cells with area (volume) correction, while non-conforming, can be easily introduced to further enhance the accuracy and stability of the Galerkin solution using VC integration on non-conforming cells. To properly approximate the weak discontinuity across the material interface by a penalty-free Nitsche's method with enhanced coercivity, the interface nodes on the surface of the foreground discretization are also shared with the background discretization. As such, there are no tunable parameters, such as those involved in the penalty type method, to enforce interface compatibility in this approach. The advantage of this meshfree formulation is that it avoids many of the instabilities in mesh-based immersed and embedded methods. The effectiveness of QCE-RKPM is illustrated with several examples.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we consider the problem of learning a neural network controller for a system required to satisfy a Signal Temporal Logic (STL) specification. We exploit STL quantitative semantics to define a notion of robust satisfaction. Guaranteeing the correctness of a neural network controller, i.e., ensuring the satisfaction of the specification by the controlled system, is a difficult problem that received a lot of attention recently. We provide a general procedure to construct a set of trainable High Order Control Barrier Functions (HOCBFs) enforcing the satisfaction of formulas in a fragment of STL. We use the BarrierNet, implemented by a differentiable Quadratic Program (dQP) with HOCBF constraints, as the last layer of the neural network controller, to guarantee the satisfaction of the STL formulas. We train the HOCBFs together with other neural network parameters to further improve the robustness of the controller. Simulation results demonstrate that our approach ensures satisfaction and outperforms existing algorithms. ",

    "abstract": "As more connected devices are implemented in a cyber-physical world and data is expected to be collected and processed in real time, the ability to handle time series data has become increasingly significant. To help analyze time series in data mining applications, many time series representation approaches have been proposed to convert a raw time series into another series for representing the original time series. However, existing approaches are not designed for open-ended time series (which is a sequence of data points being continuously collected at a fixed interval without any length limit) because these approaches need to know the total length of the target time series in advance and pre-process the entire time series using normalization methods. Furthermore, many representation approaches require users to configure and tune some parameters beforehand in order to achieve satisfactory representation results. In this paper, we propose NP-Free, a real-time Normalization-free and Parameter-tuning-free representation approach for open-ended time series. Without needing to use any normalization method or tune any parameter, NP-Free can generate a representation for a raw time series on the fly by converting each data point of the time series into a root-mean-square error (RMSE) value based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and a Look-Back and Predict-Forward strategy. To demonstrate the capability of NP-Free in representing time series, we conducted several experiments based on real-world open-source time series datasets. We also evaluated the time consumption of NP-Free in generating representations. ",

Enabling dynamic gesture commands is useful when the human needs to avoid direct contact with the robot or the object handled by the robot. However, the key challenge lies in the heterogeneity in human behaviors and the stochasticity in the perception of dynamic gestures, which requires the robot handling policy to be adaptable and robust. To address these challenges, we introduce Conditional Collaborative Handling Process (CCHP) to encode a contextaware cobot handling policy and a procedure to learn such policy from human-human collaboration. We thoroughly evaluate the adaptability and robustness of CCHP and apply our approach to a real-time cobot assembly task with Kinova Gen3 robot arm. Results show that our method leads to significantly less human effort and smoother human-robot collaboration than state-of-the-art rule-based approach even with first-time users. ",

    "abstract": "Early warning systems (EWS) are prediction algorithms that have recently taken a central role in efforts to improve graduation rates in public schools across the US. These systems assist in targeting interventions at individual students by predicting which students are at risk of dropping out. Despite significant investments and adoption, there remain significant gaps in our understanding of the efficacy of EWS. In this work, we draw on nearly a decade's worth of data from a system used throughout Wisconsin to provide the first large-scale evaluation of the long-term impact of EWS on graduation outcomes. We present evidence that risk assessments made by the prediction system are highly accurate, including for students from marginalized backgrounds. Despite the system's accuracy and widespread use, we find no evidence that it has led to improved graduation rates. We surface a robust statistical pattern that can explain why these seemingly contradictory insights hold. Namely, environmental features, measured at the level of schools, contain significant signal about dropout risk. Within each school, however, academic outcomes are essentially independent of individual student performance. This empirical observation indicates that assigning all students within the same school the same probability of graduation is a nearly optimal prediction. Our work provides an empirical backbone for the robust, qualitative understanding among education researchers and policy-makers that dropout is structurally determined. The primary barrier to improving outcomes lies not in identifying students at risk of dropping out within specific schools, but rather in overcoming structural differences across different school districts. Our findings indicate that we should carefully evaluate the decision to fund early warning systems without also devoting resources to interventions tackling structural barriers. ",

Therein, each agent can predict the consensus value with the minimum number of observable historical outputs of its own. Accordingly, compared to most existing algorithms only yielding asymptotic convergence, the present method can attain deadbeat consensus instead. Moreover, based on the consensus value prediction, instant individual disagreement degree value of MASs can be calculated in advance as well. Sufficient conditions are derived to guarantee both the minimal-time deadbeat consensus and the instant individual disagreement degree prediction.

However, few studies focus on accurate travel demand forecasting in large-scale emergency evacuations. Therefore, this study develops and tests a new methodological framework for modeling trip generation in wildfire evacuations by using (a) large-scale GPS data generated by mobile devices and (b) state-of-the-art AI technologies. The proposed methodology aims at forecasting evacuation trips and other types of trips. Based on the travel demand inferred from the GPS data, we develop a new deep learning model, i.e., Situational-Aware Multi-Graph Convolutional Recurrent Network (SA-MGCRN), along with a model updating scheme to achieve real-time forecasting of travel demand during wildfire evacuations. The proposed methodological framework is tested in this study for a real-world case study: the 2019 Kincade Fire in Sonoma County, CA. The results show that SA-MGCRN significantly outperforms all the selected state-of-the-art benchmarks in terms of prediction performance. Our finding suggests that the most important model components of SA-MGCRN are evacuation order/warning information, proximity to fire, and population change, which are consistent with behavioral theories and empirical findings.

Under appropriate conditions, we demonstrated that the training of PIRBNs using gradient descendent methods can converge to Gaussian processes. Besides, we studied the training dynamics of PIRBN via the neural tangent kernel (NTK) theory. In addition, comprehensive investigations regarding the initialisation strategies of PIRBN were conducted. Based on numerical examples, PIRBN has been demonstrated to be more effective and efficient than PINN in solving PDEs with high-frequency features and ill-posed computational domains. Moreover, the existing PINN numerical techniques, such as adaptive learning, decomposition and different types of loss functions, are applicable to PIRBN.

To attain superior performance, many methods have prioritized designing complex modules to fuse similar information across views, yet overlooking the importance of intra-view information for high-resolution reconstruction. It also leads to problems of wrong texture in recovered images. To address this issue, we explore the interdependencies between various hierarchies from intra-view and propose a novel method, named Cross-View-Hierarchy Network for Stereo Image Super-Resolution (CVHSSR). Specifically, we design a cross-hierarchy information mining block (CHIMB) that leverages channel attention and large kernel convolution attention to extract both global and local features from the intra-view, enabling the efficient restoration of accurate texture details. Additionally, a cross-view interaction module (CVIM) is proposed to fuse similar features from different views by utilizing cross-view attention mechanisms, effectively adapting to the binocular scene. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. CVHSSR achieves the best stereo image super-resolution performance than other state-of-the-art methods while using fewer parameters.

    "abstract": "As mobile robots become more ubiquitous, their deployments grow across use cases where GNSS positioning is either unavailable or unreliable. This has led to increased interest in multi-modal relative localization methods. Complementing onboard odometry, ranging allows for relative state estimation, with ultra-wideband (UWB) ranging having gained widespread recognition due to its low cost and centimeter-level out-of-box accuracy. Infrastructure-free localization methods allow for more dynamic, ad-hoc, and flexible deployments, yet they have received less attention from the research community. In this work, we propose a cooperative relative multi-robot localization where we leverage inter-robot ranging and simultaneous spatial detections of objects in the environment. To achieve this, we equip robots with a single UWB transceiver and a stereo camera. We propose a novel Monte-Carlo approach to estimate relative states by either employing only UWB ranges or dynamically integrating simultaneous spatial detections from the stereo cameras. We also address the challenges for UWB ranging error mitigation, especially in non-line-of-sight, with a study on different LSTM networks to estimate the ranging error. The proposed approach has multiple benefits. First, we show that a single range is enough to estimate the accurate relative states of two robots when fusing odometry measurements. Second, our experiments also demonstrate that our approach surpasses traditional methods such as multilateration in terms of accuracy. Third, to increase accuracy even further, we allow for the integration of cooperative spatial detections. Finally, we show how ROS 2 and Zenoh can be integrated to build a scalable wireless communication solution for multi-robot systems. The experimental validation includes real-time deployment and autonomous navigation based on the relative positioning method. ",

However, advanced Twitter bots often attempt to mimic the characteristics of genuine users through feature manipulation and disguise themselves to fit in diverse user communities, posing challenges for existing Twitter bot detection models. To this end, we propose BotMoE, a Twitter bot detection framework that jointly utilizes multiple user information modalities (metadata, textual content, network structure) to improve the detection of deceptive bots. Furthermore, BotMoE incorporates a community-aware Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) layer to improve domain generalization and adapt to different Twitter communities. Specifically, BotMoE constructs modal-specific encoders for metadata features, textual content, and graphical structure, which jointly model Twitter users from three modal-specific perspectives. We then employ a community-aware MoE layer to automatically assign users to different communities and leverage the corresponding expert networks. Finally, user representations from metadata, text, and graph perspectives are fused with an expert fusion layer, combining all three modalities while measuring the consistency of user information. Extensive experiments demonstrate that BotMoE significantly advances the state-of-the-art on three Twitter bot detection benchmarks. Studies also confirm that BotMoE captures advanced and evasive bots, alleviates the reliance on training data, and better generalizes to new and previously unseen user communities. ",

Concretely, an off-the-shelf neural reconstruction method is leveraged to generate a geometry scaffold. Then, two loss functions based on the holistic priors are proposed to improve the learning of NeRF: 1) A robust depth loss that can tolerate the error of the pseudo depth map to guide the geometry learning of NeRF; 2) A variance loss to regularize the variance of implicit neural representations to reduce the geometry and color ambiguity in the learning procedure. These two loss functions are modulated during NeRF optimization according to the view coverage information to reduce the negative influence brought by the view coverage imbalance. Extensive results demonstrate that our NeRFVS outperforms state-of-the-art view synthesis methods quantitatively and qualitatively on indoor scenes, achieving high-fidelity free navigation results.

It explores the broad \"middle spectrum\" area between channel pruning and conventional grouped convolution. Compared with channel pruning, MSGC can retain most of the information from the input feature maps due to the group mechanism; compared with grouped convolution, MSGC benefits from the learnability, the core of channel pruning, for constructing its group topology, leading to better channel division. The middle spectrum area is unfolded along four dimensions: group-wise, layer-wise, sample-wise, and attention-wise, making it possible to reveal more powerful and interpretable structures. As a result, the proposed module acts as a booster that can reduce the computational cost of the host backbones for general image recognition with even improved predictive accuracy. For example, in the experiments on ImageNet dataset for image classification, MSGC can reduce the multiply-accumulates (MACs) of ResNet-18 and ResNet-50 by half but still increase the Top-1 accuracy by more than 1%. With 35% reduction of MACs, MSGC can also increase the Top-1 accuracy of the MobileNetV2 backbone. Results on MS COCO dataset for object detection show similar observations.

    "title": "An Automotive Case Study on the Limits of Approximation for Object  Detection",
    "abstract": "The accuracy of camera-based object detection (CBOD) built upon deep learning is often evaluated against the real objects in frames only. However, such simplistic evaluation ignores the fact that many unimportant objects are small, distant, or background, and hence, their misdetections have less impact than those for closer, larger, and foreground objects in domains such as autonomous driving. Moreover, sporadic misdetections are irrelevant since confidence on detections is typically averaged across consecutive frames, and detection devices (e.g. cameras, LiDARs) are often redundant, thus providing fault tolerance. This paper exploits such intrinsic fault tolerance of the CBOD process, and assesses in an automotive case study to what extent CBOD can tolerate approximation coming from multiple sources such as lower precision arithmetic, approximate arithmetic units, and even random faults due to, for instance, low voltage operation. We show that the accuracy impact of those sources of approximation is within 1% of the baseline even when considering the three approximate domains simultaneously, and hence, multiple sources of approximation can be exploited to build highly efficient accelerators for CBOD in cars.

    "abstract": "Falls are the public health issue for the elderly all over the world since the fall-induced injuries are associated with a large amount of healthcare cost. Falls can cause serious injuries, even leading to death if the elderly suffers a \"long-lie\". Hence, a reliable fall detection (FD) system is required to provide an emergency alarm for first aid. Due to the advances in wearable device technology and artificial intelligence, some fall detection systems have been developed using machine learning and deep learning methods to analyze the signal collected from accelerometer and gyroscopes. In order to achieve better fall detection performance, an ensemble model that combines a coarse-fine convolutional neural network and gated recurrent unit is proposed in this study. The parallel structure design used in this model restores the different grains of spatial characteristics and capture temporal dependencies for feature representation. This study applies the FallAllD public dataset to validate the reliability of the proposed model, which achieves a recall, precision, and F-score of 92.54%, 96.13%, and 94.26%, respectively. The results demonstrate the reliability of the proposed ensemble model in discriminating falls from daily living activities and its superior performance compared to the state-of-the-art convolutional neural network long short-term memory (CNN-LSTM) for FD.

The proposed model first builds different orders of adjacency matrices from manually designed node connections. After that, an intact multi-order adjacency matrix is attached from the automatic fusion of various orders of adjacency matrices. This process is supervised by the node semantic information, which is extracted from the node homophily evaluated by attributes. Eventually, we utilize a one-layer simplifying graph convolutional network with the learned multi-order adjacency matrix, which is equivalent to the cross-hop node information propagation with multi-layer graph neural networks. Substantial experiments reveal that AMOGCN gains superior semi-supervised classification performance compared with state-of-the-art competitors. ",

Utilizing the gradients of detector targets flowing into the intermediate feature maps, ODAM produces heat maps that show the influence of regions on the detector's decision for each predicted attribute. Compared to previous works classification activation maps (CAM), ODAM generates instance-specific explanations rather than class-specific ones. We show that ODAM is applicable to both one-stage detectors and two-stage detectors with different types of detector backbones and heads, and produces higher-quality visual explanations than the state-of-the-art both effectively and efficiently. We next propose a training scheme, Odam-Train, to improve the explanation ability on object discrimination of the detector through encouraging consistency between explanations for detections on the same object, and distinct explanations for detections on different objects. Based on the heat maps produced by ODAM with Odam-Train, we propose Odam-NMS, which considers the information of the model's explanation for each prediction to distinguish the duplicate detected objects.

To address these limitations, we propose a novel multiview multimodal driver monitoring system based on feature-level fusion through multi-head self-attention (MHSA).

We also present a novel GPU-friendly supervised contrastive learning framework SuMoCo to learn better representations.

    "abstract": "Semantic networks provide a useful tool to understand how related concepts are retrieved from memory. However, most current network approaches use pairwise links to represent memory recall patterns. Pairwise connections neglect higher-order associations, i.e. relationships between more than two concepts at a time. These higher-order interactions might covariate with (and thus contain information about) how similar concepts are along psycholinguistic dimensions like arousal, valence, familiarity, gender and others. We overcome these limits by introducing feature-rich cognitive hypergraphs as quantitative models of human memory where: (i) concepts recalled together can all engage in hyperlinks involving also more than two concepts at once (cognitive hypergraph aspect), and (ii) each concept is endowed with a vector of psycholinguistic features (feature-rich aspect). We build hypergraphs from word association data and use evaluation methods from machine learning features to predict concept concreteness. Since concepts with similar concreteness tend to cluster together in human memory, we expect to be able to leverage this structure. Using word association data from the Small World of Words dataset, we compared a pairwise network and a hypergraph with N=3586 concepts/nodes. Interpretable artificial intelligence models trained on (1) psycholinguistic features only, (2) pairwise-based feature aggregations, and on (3) hypergraph-based aggregations show significant differences between pairwise and hypergraph links. Specifically, our results show that higher-order and feature-rich hypergraph models contain richer information than pairwise networks leading to improved prediction of word concreteness. The relation with previous studies about conceptual clustering and compartmentalisation in associative knowledge and human memory are discussed. ",

SEA-net generates symbols that dynamically configure the network to perform specific tasks. These symbols capture compositional semantic information that enables the system to acquire new functions purely by symbolic manipulation or communication. In addition, we found that these self-generated symbols exhibit an intrinsic structure resembling that of natural language, suggesting a common framework underlying the generation and understanding of symbols in both human brains and artificial neural networks.

Therefore, early diagnosis and medical treatment of sepsis in critically ill populations at high risk for sepsis and sepsis-associated mortality are vital to providing the patient with rapid therapy. Studies show that advancing sepsis detection by 6 hours leads to earlier administration of antibiotics, which is associated with improved mortality. However, clinical scores like Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) are not applicable for early prediction, while machine learning algorithms can help capture the progressing pattern for early prediction. Therefore, we aim to develop a machine learning algorithm that predicts sepsis onset 6 hours before it is suspected clinically. Although some machine learning algorithms have been applied to sepsis prediction, many of them did not consider the fact that six hours is not a small gap. To overcome this big gap challenge, we explore a multi-subset approach in which the likelihood of sepsis occurring earlier than 6 hours is output from a previous subset and feed to the target subset as additional features. Moreover, we use the hourly sampled data like vital signs in an observation window to derive a temporal change trend to further assist, which however is often ignored by previous studies. Our empirical study shows that both the multi-subset approach to alleviating the 6-hour gap and the added temporal trend features can help improve the performance of sepsis-related early prediction.

Deep end-to-end learning approaches, which typically train a generic pre-trained model on external datasets and then directly apply it to all test samples, emerge as the dominant solution to solve this issue. Despite encouraging progress, they remain non-optimal, as the unique properties (e.g., motion style, rhythm) of a specific sequence cannot be adapted. More generally, at test-time, once encountering unseen motion categories (out-of-distribution), the predicted poses tend to be unreliable. Motivated by this observation, we propose a novel test-time adaptation framework that leverages two self-supervised auxiliary tasks to help the primary forecasting network adapt to the test sequence. In the testing phase, our model can adjust the model parameters by several gradient updates to improve the generation quality. However, due to catastrophic forgetting, both auxiliary tasks typically tend to the low ability to automatically present the desired positive incentives for the final prediction performance. For this reason, we also propose a meta-auxiliary learning scheme for better adaptation. In terms of general setup, our approach obtains higher accuracy, and under two new experimental designs for out-of-distribution data (unseen subjects and categories), achieves significant improvements.

We then perform a comprehensive set of experiments using different augmentations and parameters to evaluate the effectiveness of various SSL methods, namely SimCRL, BYOL, and SwAV, for ECG representation learning, where we observe the best performance achieved by SwAV. Furthermore, our analysis shows that SSL methods achieve highly competitive results to those achieved by supervised state-of-the-art methods. To further assess the performance of these methods on both In-Distribution (ID) and Out-of-Distribution (OOD) ECG data, we conduct cross-dataset training and testing experiments. Our comprehensive experiments show almost identical results when comparing ID and OOD schemes, indicating that SSL techniques can learn highly effective representations that generalize well across different OOD datasets. This finding can have major implications for ECG-based arrhythmia detection.

The existing TV-IMPC design usually requires a complete knowledge of the plant I/O (input/output) model, leading to the lack of structural robustness. To tackle this issue, we, in the paper, design a gray-box extended state observer (ESO) to estimate and compensate unknown model uncertainties and external disturbances. By means of the ESO feedback, the plant model is kept as nominal, and hence the structural robustness is achieved for the time-varying internal model. It is shown that the proposed design has bounded ESO estimation errors, which can be further adjusted by modifying the corresponding control gains. To stabilize the ESO-based TV-IMPC, a time-varying stabilizer is developed by employing Linear Matrix Inequalities (LMIs). Extensive simulation and experimental studies are conducted on a direct-drive servo stage to validate the proposed robust TV-IMPC with ultra-precision tracking performance ($\\sim 60$nm RMSE out of $\\pm80$mm stroke).

    "abstract": "With the development of high-definition display devices, the practical scenario of Super-Resolution (SR) usually needs to super-resolve large input like 2K to higher resolution (4K/8K). To reduce the computational and memory cost, current methods first split the large input into local patches and then merge the SR patches into the output. These methods adaptively allocate a subnet for each patch. Quantization is a very important technique for network acceleration and has been used to design the subnets. Current methods train an MLP bit selector to determine the propoer bit for each layer. However, they uniformly sample subnets for training, making simple subnets overfitted and complicated subnets underfitted. Therefore, the trained bit selector fails to determine the optimal bit. Apart from this, the introduced bit selector brings additional cost to each layer of the SR network. In this paper, we propose a novel method named Content-Aware Bit Mapping (CABM), which can remove the bit selector without any performance loss. CABM also learns a bit selector for each layer during training. After training, we analyze the relation between the edge information of an input patch and the bit of each layer. We observe that the edge information can be an effective metric for the selected bit. Therefore, we design a strategy to build an Edge-to-Bit lookup table that maps the edge score of a patch to the bit of each layer during inference. The bit configuration of SR network can be determined by the lookup tables of all layers. Our strategy can find better bit configuration, resulting in more efficient mixed precision networks. We conduct detailed experiments to demonstrate the generalization ability of our method. The code will be released. ",

    "abstract": "Self-supervised learning (SSL) has made remarkable progress in visual representation learning. Some studies combine SSL with knowledge distillation (SSL-KD) to boost the representation learning performance of small models. In this study, we propose a Multi-mode Online Knowledge Distillation method (MOKD) to boost self-supervised visual representation learning. Different from existing SSL-KD methods that transfer knowledge from a static pre-trained teacher to a student, in MOKD, two different models learn collaboratively in a self-supervised manner. Specifically, MOKD consists of two distillation modes: self-distillation and cross-distillation modes. Among them, self-distillation performs self-supervised learning for each model independently, while cross-distillation realizes knowledge interaction between different models. In cross-distillation, a cross-attention feature search strategy is proposed to enhance the semantic feature alignment between different models. As a result, the two models can absorb knowledge from each other to boost their representation learning performance. Extensive experimental results on different backbones and datasets demonstrate that two heterogeneous models can benefit from MOKD and outperform their independently trained baseline. In addition, MOKD also outperforms existing SSL-KD methods for both the student and teacher models. ",

The first works of neural networks consisted of simple systems of a few neurons that were commonly simulated through analogue electronic circuits. The passage from the equations to the circuits was carried out directly without justification and subsequent formalisation. The present work shows a way to formally obtain the equivalence between an analogue circuit and a neural network and formalizes the connection between both systems. We also show which are the properties that these electrical networks must satisfy. We can have confidence that the representation in terms of circuits is mathematically equivalent to the equations that represent the network. ",

Health informatics is built upon patient health data leading to the need to codify patient health information. Such standardization is required to compute population statistics (such as prevalence, incidence, etc.) that are common metrics used in fields such as epidemiology. Reliable decision-making about health and disease rests on our ability to organize, analyze, and assess data repositories that contain patient health data. While standards exist to structure and analyze patient data across patient data sources such as health information exchanges, clinical data repositories, and health data marketplaces, analogous best practices for rigorously defining patient populations in health informatics contexts do not exist. Codifying best practices for developing disease definitions could support the effective development of clinical guidelines, inform algorithms used in clinical decision support systems, and additional patient guidelines. In this paper, we present a workflow for the development of phenotype definitions. This workflow presents a series of recommendations for defining health and disease.

    "abstract": "Spiking neural networks have attracted extensive attention from researchers in many fields due to their brain-like information processing mechanism. The proposal of surrogate gradient enables the spiking neural networks to migrate to more complex tasks, and gradually close the gap with the conventional artificial neural networks. Current spiking neural networks utilize the output of all moments to produce the final prediction, which compromises their temporal characteristics and causes a reduction in performance and efficiency. We propose a temporal knowledge sharing approach (TKS) that enables the interaction of information between different moments, by selecting the output of specific moments to compose teacher signals to guide the training of the network along with the real labels. We have validated TKS on both static datasets CIFAR10, CIFAR100, ImageNet-1k and neuromorphic datasets DVS-CIFAR10, NCALTECH101. Our experimental results indicate that we have achieved the current optimal performance in comparison with other algorithms. Experiments on Fine-grained classification datasets further demonstrate our algorithm's superiority with CUB-200-2011, StanfordDogs, and StanfordCars. TKS algorithm helps the model to have stronger temporal generalization capability, allowing the network to guarantee performance with large time steps in the training phase and with small time steps in the testing phase. This greatly facilitates the deployment of SNNs on edge devices. ",

Therefore, recent efforts focused on the use of radar sensors in addition to camera and lidar sensors for perception applications. However, the sparsity of radar point clouds and the poor data availability remain challenging for current perception methods. To address these challenges, a novel graph neural network is proposed that does not just use the information of the points themselves but also the relationships between the points. The model is designed to consider both point features and point-pair features, embedded in the edges of the graph. Furthermore, a general approach for achieving transformation invariance is proposed which is robust against unseen scenarios and also counteracts the limited data availability. The transformation invariance is achieved by an invariant data representation rather than an invariant model architecture, making it applicable to other methods. The proposed RadarGNN model outperforms all previous methods on the RadarScenes dataset. In addition, the effects of different invariances on the object detection and semantic segmentation quality are investigated.

    "abstract": "Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) or drones play many roles in a modern smart city such as the delivery of goods, mapping real-time road traffic and monitoring pollution. The ability of drones to perform these functions often requires the support of machine learning technology. However, traditional machine learning models for drones encounter data privacy problems, communication costs and energy limitations. Federated Learning, an emerging distributed machine learning approach, is an excellent solution to address these issues. Federated learning (FL) allows drones to train local models without transmitting raw data. However, existing FL requires a central server to aggregate the trained model parameters of the UAV. A failure of the central server can significantly impact the overall training. In this paper, we propose two aggregation methods: Commutative FL and Alternate FL, based on the existing architecture of decentralised Federated Learning for UAV Networks (DFL-UN) by adding a unique aggregation method of decentralised FL. Those two methods can effectively control energy consumption and communication cost by controlling the number of local training epochs, local communication, and global communication. The simulation results of the proposed training methods are also presented to verify the feasibility and efficiency of the architecture compared with two benchmark methods (e.g. standard machine learning training and standard single aggregation server training). The simulation results show that the proposed methods outperform the benchmark methods in terms of operational stability, energy consumption and communication cost. ",

This represented a natural culmination of this line of work because the algorithmic techniques used can enumerate $\\Theta(n^2)$ (near)-minimum cuts. In this paper, we go beyond this quadratic barrier and obtain a faster algorithm for the network unreliability problem. Our algorithm runs in $m^{1+o(1)} + \\tilde{O}(n^{1.5})$ time. Our main contribution is a new estimator for network unreliability in very reliable graphs. These graphs are usually the bottleneck for network unreliability since the disconnection event is elusive. Our estimator is obtained by defining an appropriate importance sampling subroutine on a dual spanning tree packing of the graph. To complement this estimator for very reliable graphs, we use recursive contraction for moderately reliable graphs. We show that an interleaving of sparsification and contraction can be used to obtain a better parametrization of the recursive contraction algorithm that yields a faster running time matching the one obtained for the very reliable case.

Hereto, a mathematical description of the concept of balanced growth in terms of cell mass distribution is presented. The cell mass distribution, quantified by the Number Density Function (NDF), is affected by cell growth and cell division. An optimization program is formulated in which the NDF, average cell culture growth rate and reaction rates per cell mass are treated as optimization variables. As qualitative proof of concept, the methodology is illustrated on a core carbon model of Escherichia coli under aerobic growth conditions.

However, these approaches suffer from the inability to select appropriate parameters and incomplete models that overlook the quantitative relation between words with topics and topics with text. To solve these issues, we propose graph to topic (G2T), a simple but effective framework for topic modelling. The framework is composed of four modules. First, document representation is acquired using pretrained language models. Second, a semantic graph is constructed according to the similarity between document representations. Third, communities in document semantic graphs are identified, and the relationship between topics and documents is quantified accordingly. Fourth, the word--topic distribution is computed based on a variant of TFIDF. Automatic evaluation suggests that G2T achieved state-of-the-art performance on both English and Chinese documents with different lengths. Human judgements demonstrate that G2T can produce topics with better interpretability and coverage than baselines. In addition, G2T can not only determine the topic number automatically but also give the probabilistic distribution of words in topics and topics in documents. Finally, G2T is publicly available, and the distillation experiments provide instruction on how it works. ",

    "abstract": "One of the most important and well-studied settings for network design is edge-connectivity requirements. This encompasses uniform demands such as the Minimum $k$-Edge-Connected Spanning Subgraph problem as well as nonuniform demands such as the Survivable Network Design problem (SND). In a recent paper by [Dinitz, Koranteng, Kortsarz APPROX '22] , the authors observed that a weakness of these formulations is that it does not enable one to consider fault-tolerance in graphs that have just one small cut. To remedy this, they introduced new variants of these problems under the notion \"relative\" fault-tolerance. Informally, this requires not that two nodes are connected if there are a bounded number of faults (as in the classical setting), but that two nodes are connected if there are a bounded number of faults and the two nodes are connected in the underlying graph post-faults. The problem is already highly non-trivial even for the case of a single demand. Due to difficulties introduced by this new notion of fault-tolerance, the results in [Dinitz, Koranteng, Kortsarz APPROX '22] are quite limited. For the Relative Survivable Network Design problem (RSND), when the demands are not uniform they give a nontrivial result only when there is a single demand with a connectivity requirement of $3$: a non-optimal $27/4$-approximation. We strengthen this result in two significant ways: We give a $2$-approximation for RSND where all requirements are at most $3$, and a $2^{O(k^2)}$-approximation for RSND with a single demand of arbitrary value $k$. To achieve these results, we first use the \"cactus representation'' of minimum cuts to give a lossless reduction to normal SND. Second, we extend the techniques of [Dinitz, Koranteng, Kortsarz APPROX '22] to prove a generalized and more complex version of their structure theorem, which we then use to design a recursive approximation algorithm.

To disentangle these three components, we apply a Bayesian picture, based on the functions expressed by a DNN, to supervised learning. The prior over functions is determined by the network, and is varied by exploiting a transition between ordered and chaotic regimes. For Boolean function classification, we approximate the likelihood using the error spectrum of functions on data. When combined with the prior, this accurately predicts the posterior, measured for DNNs trained with stochastic gradient descent. This analysis reveals that structured data, combined with an intrinsic Occam's razor-like inductive bias towards (Kolmogorov) simple functions that is strong enough to counteract the exponential growth of the number of functions with complexity, is a key to the success of DNNs.

The discriminative models were evaluated by their accuracy on trained and novel classes. In terms of sample generation quality, the GAN is significantly better than a random distribution (noise) in mean distance, for all classes. In the classification tests, the baseline neural network was not capable of identifying untrained gestures. When the proposed methodology was implemented, we found that there is a trade-off between the detection of trained and untrained gestures, with some trained samples being mistaken as novelty. Nevertheless, a novelty detection accuracy of 95.4% or 90.2% (depending on the data set) was achieved with just 5% loss of accuracy on trained classes. ",

    "abstract": "Burst image processing is becoming increasingly popular in recent years. However, it is a challenging task since individual burst images undergo multiple degradations and often have mutual misalignments resulting in ghosting and zipper artifacts. Existing burst restoration methods usually do not consider the mutual correlation and non-local contextual information among burst frames, which tends to limit these approaches in challenging cases. Another key challenge lies in the robust up-sampling of burst frames. The existing up-sampling methods cannot effectively utilize the advantages of single-stage and progressive up-sampling strategies with conventional and/or recent up-samplers at the same time. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Gated Multi-Resolution Transfer Network (GMTNet) to reconstruct a spatially precise high-quality image from a burst of low-quality raw images. GMTNet consists of three modules optimized for burst processing tasks: Multi-scale Burst Feature Alignment (MBFA) for feature denoising and alignment, Transposed-Attention Feature Merging (TAFM) for multi-frame feature aggregation, and Resolution Transfer Feature Up-sampler (RTFU) to up-scale merged features and construct a high-quality output image. Detailed experimental analysis on five datasets validates our approach and sets a state-of-the-art for burst super-resolution, burst denoising, and low-light burst enhancement. ",

However, these grid-based approaches lack an explicit understanding of scale and therefore often introduce aliasing, usually in the form of jaggies or missing scene content. Anti-aliasing has previously been addressed by mip-NeRF 360, which reasons about sub-volumes along a cone rather than points along a ray, but this approach is not natively compatible with current grid-based techniques. We show how ideas from rendering and signal processing can be used to construct a technique that combines mip-NeRF 360 and grid-based models such as Instant NGP to yield error rates that are 8% - 76% lower than either prior technique, and that trains 22x faster than mip-NeRF 360.

    "abstract": "Current transformer-based change detection (CD) approaches either employ a pre-trained model trained on large-scale image classification ImageNet dataset or rely on first pre-training on another CD dataset and then fine-tuning on the target benchmark. This current strategy is driven by the fact that transformers typically require a large amount of training data to learn inductive biases, which is insufficient in standard CD datasets due to their small size. We develop an end-to-end CD approach with transformers that is trained from scratch and yet achieves state-of-the-art performance on four public benchmarks. Instead of using conventional self-attention that struggles to capture inductive biases when trained from scratch, our architecture utilizes a shuffled sparse-attention operation that focuses on selected sparse informative regions to capture the inherent characteristics of the CD data. Moreover, we introduce a change-enhanced feature fusion (CEFF) module to fuse the features from input image pairs by performing a per-channel re-weighting. Our CEFF module aids in enhancing the relevant semantic changes while suppressing the noisy ones. Extensive experiments on four CD datasets reveal the merits of the proposed contributions, achieving gains as high as 14.27\\% in intersection-over-union (IoU) score, compared to the best-published results in the literature.

In this work, we consider neural networks whose predictions are invariant under a specific symmetry group. This includes popular architectures, ranging from convolutional to graph neural networks. Any explanation that faithfully explains this type of model needs to be in agreement with this invariance property. We formalize this intuition through the notion of explanation invariance and equivariance by leveraging the formalism from geometric deep learning. Through this rigorous formalism, we derive (1) two metrics to measure the robustness of any interpretability method with respect to the model symmetry group; (2) theoretical robustness guarantees for some popular interpretability methods and (3) a systematic approach to increase the invariance of any interpretability method with respect to a symmetry group. By empirically measuring our metrics for explanations of models associated with various modalities and symmetry groups, we derive a set of 5 guidelines to allow users and developers of interpretability methods to produce robust explanations.

Based on it, we undertake extensive evaluations across a wide range of BEV-based models to understand their resilience and reliability. Our findings indicate a strong correlation between absolute performance on in-distribution and out-of-distribution datasets. Nonetheless, there are considerable variations in relative performance across different approaches. Our experiments further demonstrate that pre-training and depth-free BEV transformation has the potential to enhance out-of-distribution robustness. Additionally, utilizing long and rich temporal information largely helps with robustness.

However, existing solutions that mostly rely on full electrode set of electroencephalogram (EEG) measurements could be inconvenient for every day use. In this paper, we propose a novel knowledge distillation approach to transfer the knowledge from a sophisticated seizure detector (called the teacher) trained on data from the full set of electrodes to learn new detectors (called the student). They are both providing lightweight implementations and significantly reducing the number of electrodes needed for recording the EEG. We consider the case where the teacher and the student seizure detectors are graph neural networks (GNN), since these architectures actively use the connectivity information. We consider two cases (a) when a single student is learnt for all the patients using preselected channels; and (b) when personalized students are learnt for every individual patient, with personalized channel selection using a Gumbelsoftmax approach. Our experiments on the publicly available Temple University Hospital EEG Seizure Data Corpus (TUSZ) show that both knowledge-distillation and personalization play significant roles in improving performance of seizure detection, particularly for patients with scarce EEG data. We observe that using as few as two channels, we are able to obtain competitive seizure detection performance. This, in turn, shows the potential of our approach in more realistic scenario of wearable devices for personalized monitoring of seizures, even with few recordings. ",

However, they suffer orders of magnitude higher computational complexity compared to traditional codecs, which stands in the way of real-world deployment. This paper takes a step forward in closing this gap in decoding complexity by adopting shallow or even linear decoding transforms. To compensate for the resulting drop in compression performance, we exploit the often asymmetrical computation budget between encoding and decoding, by adopting more powerful encoder networks and iterative encoding. We theoretically formalize the intuition behind, and our experimental results establish a new frontier in the trade-off between rate-distortion and decoding complexity for neural image compression. Specifically, we achieve rate-distortion performance competitive with the established mean-scale hyperprior architecture of Minnen et al.

    "abstract": "Graph neural networks (GNNs) demonstrate great performance in compound property and activity prediction due to their capability to efficiently learn complex molecular graph structures. However, two main limitations persist including compound representation and model interpretability. While atom-level molecular graph representations are commonly used because of their ability to capture natural topology, they may not fully express important substructures or functional groups which significantly influence molecular properties. Consequently, recent research proposes alternative representations employing reduction techniques to integrate higher-level information and leverages both representations for model learning. However, there is still a lack of study about different molecular graph representations on model learning and interpretation. Interpretability is also crucial for drug discovery as it can offer chemical insights and inspiration for optimization. Numerous studies attempt to include model interpretation to explain the rationale behind predictions, but most of them focus solely on individual prediction with little analysis of the interpretation on different molecular graph representations. This research introduces multiple molecular graph representations that incorporate higher-level information and investigates their effects on model learning and interpretation from diverse perspectives. The results indicate that combining atom graph representation with reduced molecular graph representation can yield promising model performance. Furthermore, the interpretation results can provide significant features and potential substructures consistently aligning with background knowledge. These multiple molecular graph representations and interpretation analysis can bolster model comprehension and facilitate relevant applications in drug discovery. ",

This paper investigates adversarial training and data augmentation with noise in the context of regularized regression in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). We establish the limiting formula for these techniques as the attack and noise size, as well as the regularization parameter, tend to zero. Based on this limiting formula, we analyze specific scenarios and demonstrate that, without appropriate regularization, these two methods may have larger generalization error and Lipschitz constant than standard kernel regression. However, by selecting the appropriate regularization parameter, these two methods can outperform standard kernel regression and achieve smaller generalization error and Lipschitz constant. These findings support the empirical observations that adversarial training can lead to overfitting, and appropriate regularization methods, such as early stopping, can alleviate this issue. ",

This can be particularly beneficial when the EEG recordings are noisy or even missing completely. In this paper, we propose CoRe-Sleep, a Coordinated Representation multimodal fusion network that is particularly focused on improving the robustness of signal analysis on imperfect data. We demonstrate how appropriately handling multimodal information can be the key to achieving such robustness. CoRe-Sleep tolerates noisy or missing modalities segments, allowing training on incomplete data. Additionally, it shows state-of-the-art performance when testing on both multimodal and unimodal data using a single model on SHHS-1, the largest publicly available study that includes sleep stage labels. The results indicate that training the model on multimodal data does positively influence performance when tested on unimodal data.

However, current methods for fault diagnosis based on I-V characteristic curves only utilize partial feature information and often rely on calibrating the field characteristic curves to standard test conditions (STC). It is difficult to apply it in practice and to accurately identify multiple complex faults with similarities in different blocking diodes configurations of PV arrays under the influence of dust. Therefore, a novel fault diagnosis method for PV arrays considering dust impact is proposed. In the preprocessing stage, the Isc-Voc normalized Gramian angular difference field (GADF) method is presented, which normalizes and transforms the resampled PV array characteristic curves from the field including I-V and P-V to obtain the transformed graphical feature matrices. Then, in the fault diagnosis stage, the model of convolutional neural network (CNN) with convolutional block attention modules (CBAM) is designed to extract fault differentiation information from the transformed graphical matrices containing full feature information and to classify faults. And different graphical feature transformation methods are compared through simulation cases, and different CNN-based classification methods are also analyzed. The results indicate that the developed method for PV arrays with different blocking diodes configurations under various operating conditions has high fault diagnosis accuracy and reliability. ",

    "abstract": "Neurophysiological time series recordings like the electroencephalogram (EEG) or local field potentials are obtained from multiple sensors. They can be decoded by machine learning models in order to estimate the ongoing brain state of a patient or healthy user. In a brain-computer interface (BCI), this decoded brain state information can be used with minimal time delay to either control an application, e.g., for communication or for rehabilitation after stroke, or to passively monitor the ongoing brain state of the subject, e.g., in a demanding work environment. A specific challenge in such decoding tasks is posed by the small dataset sizes in BCI compared to other domains of machine learning like computer vision or natural language processing. A possibility to tackle classification or regression problems in BCI despite small training data sets is through transfer learning, which utilizes data from other sessions, subjects or even datasets to train a model. In this exploratory study, we propose novel domain-specific embeddings for neurophysiological data. Our approach is based on metric learning and builds upon the recently proposed ladder loss. Using embeddings allowed us to benefit, both from the good generalisation abilities and robustness of deep learning and from the fast training of classical machine learning models for subject-specific calibration. In offline analyses using EEG data of 14 subjects, we tested the embeddings' feasibility and compared their efficiency with state-of-the-art deep learning models and conventional machine learning pipelines. In summary, we propose the use of metric learning to obtain pre-trained embeddings of EEG-BCI data as a means to incorporate domain knowledge and to reach competitive performance on novel subjects with minimal calibration requirements.
