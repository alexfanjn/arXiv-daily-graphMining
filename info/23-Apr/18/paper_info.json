    "title": "Road Network Representation Learning: A Dual Graph based Approach",
    "abstract": "Road network is a critical infrastructure powering many applications including transportation, mobility and logistics in real life. To leverage the input of a road network across these different applications, it is necessary to learn the representations of the roads in the form of vectors, which is named \\emph{road network representation learning} (RNRL). While several models have been proposed for RNRL, they capture the pairwise relationships/connections among roads only (i.e., as a simple graph), and fail to capture among roads the high-order relationships (e.g., those roads that jointly form a local region usually have similar features such as speed limit) and long-range relationships (e.g., some roads that are far apart may have similar semantics such as being roads in residential areas). Motivated by this, we propose to construct a \\emph{hypergraph}, where each hyperedge corresponds to a set of multiple roads forming a region. The constructed hypergraph would naturally capture the high-order relationships among roads with hyperedges. We then allow information propagation via both the edges in the simple graph and the hyperedges in the hypergraph in a graph neural network context. The graph reconstruction and hypergraph reconstruction tasks are conventional ones and can capture structural information. The hyperedge classification task can capture long-range relationships between pairs of roads that belong to hyperedges with the same label. We call the resulting model \\emph{HyperRoad}. We further extend HyperRoad to problem settings when additional inputs of road attributes and/or trajectories that are generated on the roads are available. ",

To predict the chances of a patient surviving, a variety of techniques were employed, such as statistical, machine learning, and deep learning models. In the current study, 1904 patient records from the METABRIC dataset were utilized to predict a 5-year breast cancer survival using a machine learning approach. In this study, we compare the outcomes of seven classification models to evaluate how well they perform using the following metrics: recall, AUC, confusion matrix, accuracy, precision, false positive rate, and true positive rate. The findings demonstrate that the classifiers for Logistic Regression (LR), Support Vector Machines (SVM), Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RD), Extremely Randomized Trees (ET), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), and Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost) can accurately predict the survival rate of the tested samples, which is 75,4\\%, 74,7\\%, 71,5\\%, 75,5\\%, 70,3\\%, and 78 percent.

    "abstract": "Temporal link prediction, aiming to predict future edges between paired nodes in a dynamic graph, is of vital importance in diverse applications. However, existing methods are mainly built upon uniform Euclidean space, which has been found to be conflict with the power-law distributions of real-world graphs and unable to represent the hierarchical connections between nodes effectively. With respect to the special data characteristic, hyperbolic geometry offers an ideal alternative due to its exponential expansion property. In this paper, we propose HGWaveNet, a novel hyperbolic graph neural network that fully exploits the fitness between hyperbolic spaces and data distributions for temporal link prediction. Specifically, we design two key modules to learn the spatial topological structures and temporal evolutionary information separately. On the one hand, a hyperbolic diffusion graph convolution (HDGC) module effectively aggregates information from a wider range of neighbors. On the other hand, the internal order of causal correlation between historical states is captured by hyperbolic dilated causal convolution (HDCC) modules. The whole model is built upon the hyperbolic spaces to preserve the hierarchical structural information in the entire data flow. To prove the superiority of HGWaveNet, extensive experiments are conducted on six real-world graph datasets and the results show a relative improvement by up to 6.67% on AUC for temporal link prediction over SOTA methods.

    "abstract": "In recent years, self-supervised learning (SSL) frameworks have been extensively applied to sensor-based Human Activity Recognition (HAR) in order to learn deep representations without data annotations. While SSL frameworks reach performance almost comparable to supervised models, studies on interpreting representations learnt by SSL models are limited. Nevertheless, modern explainability methods could help to unravel the differences between SSL and supervised representations: how they are being learnt, what properties of input data they preserve, and when SSL can be chosen over supervised training. In this paper, we aim to analyze deep representations of two recent SSL frameworks, namely SimCLR and VICReg. Specifically, the emphasis is made on (i) comparing the robustness of supervised and SSL models to corruptions in input data; (ii) explaining predictions of deep learning models using saliency maps and highlighting what input channels are mostly used for predicting various activities; (iii) exploring properties encoded in SSL and supervised representations using probing. Extensive experiments on two single-device datasets (MobiAct and UCI-HAR) have shown that self-supervised learning representations are significantly more robust to noise in unseen data compared to supervised models. In contrast, features learnt by the supervised approaches are more homogeneous across subjects and better encode the nature of activities. ",

Experts rely on robust scientific visualization techniques to extract valuable insights from the data. Recent years have shown path tracing to be the preferred approach for volumetric rendering, given its high levels of realism. However, real-time volumetric path tracing often suffers from stochastic noise and long convergence times, limiting interactive exploration. In this paper, we present a novel method to enable real-time global illumination for volume data visualization. We develop Photon Field Networks -- a phase-function-aware, multi-light neural representation of indirect volumetric global illumination. The fields are trained on multi-phase photon caches that we compute a priori. Training can be done within seconds, after which the fields can be used in various rendering tasks. To showcase their potential, we develop a custom neural path tracer, with which our photon fields achieve interactive framerates even on large datasets. We conduct in-depth evaluations of the method's performance, including visual quality, stochastic noise, inference and rendering speeds, and accuracy regarding illumination and phase function awareness. Results are compared to ray marching, path tracing and photon mapping. Our findings show that Photon Field Networks can faithfully represent indirect global illumination across the phase spectrum while exhibiting less stochastic noise and rendering at a significantly faster rate than traditional methods.

While machine learning achieves cutting-edge outcomes in many fields, it also has weaknesses that are exploited by several adversarial attack techniques. Many authors have presented both white-box and black-box generators of adversarial malware examples capable of bypassing malware detectors with varying success. We propose to combine contemporary generators in order to increase their potential. Combining different generators can create more sophisticated adversarial examples that are more likely to evade anti-malware tools. We demonstrated this technique on five well-known generators and recorded promising results. The best-performing combination of AMG-random and MAB-Malware generators achieved an average evasion rate of 15.9% against top-tier antivirus products. This represents an average improvement of more than 36% and 627% over using only the AMG-random and MAB-Malware generators, respectively. The generator that benefited the most from having another generator follow its procedure was the FGSM injection attack, which improved the evasion rate on average between 91.97% and 1,304.73%, depending on the second generator used. These results demonstrate that combining different generators can significantly improve their effectiveness against leading antivirus programs. ",

    "abstract": "The research in self-supervised domain adaptation in semantic segmentation has recently received considerable attention. Although GAN-based methods have become one of the most popular approaches to domain adaptation, they have suffered from some limitations. They are insufficient to model both global and local structures of a given image, especially in small regions of tail classes. Moreover, they perform bad on the tail classes containing limited number of pixels or less training samples. In order to address these issues, we present a new self-supervised domain adaptation approach to tackle long-tail semantic segmentation in this paper. Firstly, a new metric is introduced to formulate long-tail domain adaptation in the segmentation problem. Secondly, a new Conditional Maximum Likelihood (CoMaL) approach in an autoregressive framework is presented to solve the problem of long-tail domain adaptation. Although other segmentation methods work under the pixel independence assumption, the long-tailed pixel distributions in CoMaL are generally solved in the context of structural dependency, as that is more realistic. Finally, the proposed method is evaluated on popular large-scale semantic segmentation benchmarks, i.e., \"SYNTHIA to Cityscapes\" and \"GTA to Cityscapes\", and outperforms the prior methods by a large margin in both the standard and the proposed evaluation protocols.

Training and evaluating such neural networks rely on heavy computational resources, resulting in significant system latency and power consumption. To overcome these issues, analog computing using optical interferometric-based linear processors have recently appeared as promising candidates in accelerating matrix-vector multiplication and lowering power consumption. On the other hand, radio frequency (RF) electromagnetic waves can also exhibit similar advantages as the optical counterpart by performing analog computation at light speed with lower power. Furthermore, RF devices have extra benefits such as lower cost, mature fabrication, and analog-digital mixed design simplicity, which has great potential in realizing affordable, scalable, low latency, low power, near-sensor radio frequency neural network (RFNN) that may greatly enrich RF signal processing capability. In this work, we propose a 2X2 reconfigurable linear RF analog processor in theory and experiment, which can be applied as a matrix multiplier in an artificial neural network (ANN). The proposed device can be utilized to realize a 2X2 simple RFNN for data classification. An 8X8 linear analog processor formed by 28 RFNN devices are also applied in a 4-layer ANN for Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology (MNIST) dataset classification. ",

The existing research works carry out the learning of such space by assuming that all the image-recipe training example pairs belong to the same cuisine. As a result, despite the excellent performance reported in the literature, such space is not transferable for retrieving recipes of different cuisine. In this paper, we aim to address this issue by cross-domain food image-to-recipe retrieval, such that by leveraging abundant image-recipe pairs in source domain (one cuisine), the embedding space is generalizable to a target domain (the other cuisine) that does not have images to pair with recipes for training. With the intuition that the importance of different source samples should vary, this paper proposes two novel mechanisms for cross-domain food image-to-recipe retrieval, i.e., source data selector and weighted cross-modal adversarial learning. The former aims to select source samples similar to the target data and filter out distinctive ones for training. The latter is capable to assign higher weights to the source samples more similar to the target data and lower weights to suppress the distinctive ones for both cross-modal and adversarial learning. The weights are computed from the recipe features extracted from a pre-trained source model. Experiments on three different cuisines (Chuan, Yue and Washoku) demonstrate that the proposed method manages to achieve state-of-the-art performances in all the transfers. ",

The goal is to achieve robustness and good generalization ability by leveraging ensembles of models that specialize in different manipulation categories.

In this model, assuming the widely believed 1-vs-2-cycles conjecture, it is not possible to solve many basic graph problems in constant rounds with strongly sublinear memory size per machine. Recently, Holm and T\\v{e}tek [SODA 2023] showed that it is possible to get around this barrier for planar graphs when a planar straight-line embedding of the graph is given. For such inputs on $n$ vertices, they obtained constant-round MPC algorithms for connected components, minimum spanning tree (MST), and $O(1)$-approximation of $st$-shortest path, diameter, and radius, as long as the memory size per machine is $\\mathcal{S} = n^{2/3 + \\Omega(1)}$. In this work, we provide an improved recursive framework to obtain constant-round algorithms in the more challenging \\emph{fully scalable} regime where memory size per machine can be $\\mathcal{S} = n^\\delta$ for any given constant $\\delta > 0$. This gives the first constant-round algorithms in this regime for fundamental problems such as connected components, MST, and EMST. Moreover, we show that $\\varepsilon$-emulators can be incorporated into our recursive framework to obtain constant-round $(1+\\varepsilon)$-approximation algorithms for single source shortest path (SSSP) and shortest cycle in embedded planar graphs. We show that it is possible to construct a dual graph of the given embedded planar graph in constant rounds, which allows us to solve the $(1+\\varepsilon)$-approximate $st$-maximum flow and minimum cut problem as both reduce to a shortest cycle problem in the dual graph. Using $O(n^2)$ total space, we also obtain constant-round algorithms for $(1+\\varepsilon)$-approximate all-pairs shortest paths (APSP), diameter, and radius. ",

In this study, we propose a model that builds on the self-supervised learning approach to address the similarity-based retrieval challenge by introducing our method of metric learning with a self-supervised auxiliary loss. Furthermore, diverging from conventional self-supervised learning methodologies, we discovered the advantages of concurrently training the model with both self-supervision and supervision signals, without freezing pre-trained models. We also found that refraining from employing augmentation during the fine-tuning phase yields better results.

Due to label sparsity, training a deep anomaly detector often relies on unsupervised approaches. Recent efforts have been devoted to time series domain adaptation to leverage knowledge from similar domains. However, existing solutions may suffer from negative knowledge transfer on anomalies due to their diversity and sparsity. Motivated by the empirical study of context alignment between two domains, we aim to transfer knowledge between two domains via adaptively sampling context information for two domains. This is challenging because it requires simultaneously modeling the complex in-domain temporal dependencies and cross-domain correlations while exploiting label information from the source domain. To this end, we propose a framework that combines context sampling and anomaly detection into a joint learning procedure. We formulate context sampling into the Markov decision process and exploit deep reinforcement learning to optimize the time series domain adaptation process via context sampling and design a tailored reward function to generate domain-invariant features that better align two domains for anomaly detection. Experiments on three public datasets show promise for knowledge transfer between two similar domains and two entirely different domains. ",

We obtain a simplified computable expression for the measure and show that it satisfies several basic properties such as monotonicity in $\\beta$ for a fixed $\\alpha$, non-negativity, data processing inequalities, and additivity over independent releases. We highlight the relevance of this family by showing that it bridges several known leakage measures, including maximal $\\alpha$-leakage $(\\beta=1)$, maximal leakage $(\\alpha=\\infty,\\beta=1)$, local differential privacy [LDP] $(\\alpha=\\infty,\\beta=\\infty)$, and local Renyi differential privacy [LRDP] $(\\alpha=\\beta)$, thereby giving an operational interpretation to local Renyi differential privacy. We also study a conditional version of maximal $(\\alpha,\\beta)$-leakage on leveraging which we recover differential privacy and Renyi differential privacy. A new variant of LRDP, which we call maximal Renyi leakage, appears as a special case of maximal $(\\alpha,\\beta)$-leakage for $\\alpha=\\infty$ that smoothly tunes between maximal leakage ($\\beta=1$) and LDP ($\\beta=\\infty$).

However, a small change may propagate over the whole graph and lead to large-scale iterative computations. To address this problem, we propose Layph, a two-layered graph framework. The upper layer is a skeleton of the graph, which is much smaller than the original graph, and the lower layer has some disjointed subgraphs. Layph limits costly global iterative computations on the original graph to the small graph skeleton and a few subgraphs updated with the input graph changes. In this way, many vertices and edges are not involved in iterative computations, significantly reducing the communication overhead and improving incremental graph processing performance. Our experimental results show that Layph outperforms current state-of-the-art incremental graph systems by 9.08X on average (up to 36.66X) in response time. ",

    "abstract": "Few-shot learning is proposed to tackle the problem of scarce training data in novel classes. However, prior works in instance-level few-shot learning have paid less attention to effectively utilizing the relationship between categories. In this paper, we exploit the hierarchical information to leverage discriminative and relevant features of base classes to effectively classify novel objects. These features are extracted from abundant data of base classes, which could be utilized to reasonably describe classes with scarce data. Specifically, we propose a novel superclass approach that automatically creates a hierarchy considering base and novel classes as fine-grained classes for few-shot instance segmentation (FSIS). Based on the hierarchical information, we design a novel framework called Soft Multiple Superclass (SMS) to extract relevant features or characteristics of classes in the same superclass. A new class assigned to the superclass is easier to classify by leveraging these relevant features. Besides, in order to effectively train the hierarchy-based-detector in FSIS, we apply the label refinement to further describe the associations between fine-grained classes. The extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on FSIS benchmarks. Code is available online. ",

    "abstract": "Federated Learning (FL) is a collaborative learning framework that enables edge devices to collaboratively learn a global model while keeping raw data locally. Although FL avoids leaking direct information from local datasets, sensitive information can still be inferred from the shared models. To address the privacy issue in FL, differential privacy (DP) mechanisms are leveraged to provide formal privacy guarantee. However, when deploying FL at the wireless edge with over-the-air computation, ensuring client-level DP faces significant challenges. In this paper, we propose a novel wireless FL scheme called private federated edge learning with sparsification (PFELS) to provide client-level DP guarantee with intrinsic channel noise while reducing communication and energy overhead and improving model accuracy. The key idea of PFELS is for each device to first compress its model update and then adaptively design the transmit power of the compressed model update according to the wireless channel status without any artificial noise addition. We provide a privacy analysis for PFELS and prove the convergence of PFELS under general non-convex and non-IID settings. Experimental results show that compared with prior work, PFELS can improve the accuracy with the same DP guarantee and save communication and energy costs simultaneously. ",

    "abstract": "As deep neural networks include a high number of parameters and operations, it can be a challenge to implement these models on devices with limited computational resources. Despite the development of novel pruning methods toward resource-efficient models, it has become evident that these models are not capable of handling \"imbalanced\" and \"limited number of data points\". With input and output information, along with the values of the filters, a novel filter pruning method is proposed. Our pruning method considers the fact that all information about the importance of a filter may not be reflected in the value of the filter. Instead, it is reflected in the changes made to the data after the filter is applied to it. In this work, three methods are compared with the same training conditions except for the ranking of each method. We demonstrated that our model performed significantly better than other methods for medical datasets which are inherently imbalanced. When we removed up to 58% of FLOPs for the IDRID dataset and up to 45% for the ISIC dataset, our model was able to yield an equivalent (or even superior) result to the baseline model while other models were unable to achieve similar results. To evaluate FLOP and parameter reduction using our model in real-world settings, we built a smartphone app, where we demonstrated a reduction of up to 79% in memory usage and 72% in prediction time.

The traditional defense mechanisms may not be sufficiently equipped to handle the complex and ever-changing new threats. The significant breakthroughs in the machine learning methods including deep learning, had attracted interests from the cybersecurity research community for further enhancements in the existing anomaly detection methods. Unfortunately, collecting labelled anomaly data for all new evolving and sophisticated attacks is not practical. Training and tuning the machine learning model for anomaly detection using only a handful of labelled data samples is a pragmatic approach. Therefore, few-shot weakly supervised anomaly detection is an encouraging research direction. In this paper, we propose an enhancement to an existing few-shot weakly-supervised deep learning anomaly detection framework. This framework incorporates data augmentation, representation learning and ordinal regression. We then evaluated and showed the performance of our implemented framework on three benchmark datasets: NSL-KDD, CIC-IDS2018, and TON_IoT. ",

In this paper, we propose a novel Hierarchical InTeractive Video CS Reconstruction Network(HIT-VCSNet), which can cooperatively exploit the deep priors in both spatial and temporal domains to improve the reconstruction quality. Specifically, in the spatial domain, a novel hierarchical structure is designed, which can hierarchically extract deep features from keyframes and non-keyframes. In the temporal domain, a novel hierarchical interaction mechanism is proposed, which can cooperatively learn the correlations among different frames in the multiscale space.

In this work, we propose to explore this problem based on a design approach. Starting from a small initial set of samples, we adaptively discover critical samples to achieve increasingly accurate learning of the system evolution. One central challenge here is that we do not know the network modeling error since the ground-truth system state is unknown, which is however needed for critical sampling. To address this challenge, we introduce a multi-step reciprocal prediction network where forward and backward evolution networks are designed to learn the temporal evolution behavior in the forward and backward time directions, respectively. Very interestingly, we find that the desired network modeling error is highly correlated with the multi-step reciprocal prediction error, which can be directly computed from the current system state. This allows us to perform a dynamic selection of critical samples from regions with high network modeling errors for dynamical systems. Additionally, a joint spatial-temporal evolution network is introduced which incorporates spatial dynamics modeling into the temporal evolution prediction for robust learning of the system evolution operator with few samples. Our extensive experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method is able to dramatically reduce the number of samples needed for effective learning and accurate prediction of evolution behaviors of unknown dynamical systems by up to hundreds of times.

    "abstract": "In recent years, with the explosive growth of data traffic, communication base stations (BSs) need to serve more and more users. Offloading traffic from BSs has become an efficient way to reduce the burden on BSs. Device-to-Device (D2D) communications have emerged to improve spectrum utilization by reusing the frequency spectrum of the cellular frequency band. In the general environment, Heterogeneous Cellular Networks (HCNs) including millimeter wave (mm-wave) have appeared. Since the D2D link allows to share of spectrum resources with the cellular user, it will bring potential interference to the cellular user. Fortunately, an emerging technology called Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS) can mitigate the severe interference caused by D2D links by shaping the incident beam and improving the multipath phase shift. In this paper, we study the resource allocation scheme to maximize the system sum rate, in the RISassisted single-cell heterogeneous D2D communication scenario. To solve the Block Coordinate Descent (BCD) problem, the problem of maximizing the sum rate is decomposed into three sub-problems. The resource allocation sub-problem is solved by a coalitional game method based on the game theory. The power allocation problem of the coalition converts the concave function into a convex optimization by mathematical transformation. The problem is solved by the gradient descent method. The local search method is adopted to find the optimum for the phase conversion problem. Then iterate until the difference of sum rate is less than the threshold. The simulation results show that the designed algorithm is superior to other benchmark schemes in the literature. ",

Current interventions for improving the social skills of individuals with ASD fail to represent the complexity of real-life social settings and situations. Virtual reality (VR) may facilitate social skills training in social environments and situations proximal to real life, however, more research is needed for elucidating aspects such as the acceptability, usability, and user experience of VR systems in ASD. Twenty-five participants with ASD attended a neuropsychological evaluation and three sessions of VR social skills training, incorporating five (5) social scenarios with three difficulty levels for each. Participants reported high acceptability, system usability, and user experience. Significant correlations were observed between performance in social scenarios, self-reports, and executive functions. Working memory and planning ability were significant predictors of functionality level in ASD and the VR system's perceived usability respectively. Yet, performance in social scenarios was the best predictor of usability, acceptability, and functionality level in ASD. Planning ability substantially predicted performance in social scenarios, postulating an implication in social skills. Immersive VR social skills training appears effective in individuals with ASD, yet an error-less approach, which is adaptive to the individual's needs, should be preferred. ",

Automating the identification of DAs in tutoring dialogues is significant to the design of dialogue-based intelligent tutoring systems. Many prior studies employ machine learning models to classify DAs in tutoring dialogues and invest much effort to optimize the classification accuracy by using limited amounts of training data (i.e., low-resource data scenario). However, beyond the classification accuracy, the robustness of the classifier is also important, which can reflect the capability of the classifier on learning the patterns from different class distributions. We note that many prior studies on classifying educational DAs employ cross entropy (CE) loss to optimize DA classifiers on low-resource data with imbalanced DA distribution. The DA classifiers in these studies tend to prioritize accuracy on the majority class at the expense of the minority class which might not be robust to the data with imbalanced ratios of different DA classes. To optimize the robustness of classifiers on imbalanced class distributions, we propose to optimize the performance of the DA classifier by maximizing the area under the ROC curve (AUC) score (i.e., AUC maximization). Through extensive experiments, our study provides evidence that (i) by maximizing AUC in the training process, the DA classifier achieves significant performance improvement compared to the CE approach under low-resource data, and (ii) AUC maximization approaches can improve the robustness of the DA classifier under different class imbalance ratios.

    "abstract": "Researchers of temporal networks (e.g., social networks and transaction networks) have been interested in mining dynamic patterns of nodes from their diverse interactions. Inspired by recently powerful graph mining methods like skip-gram models and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), existing approaches focus on generating temporal node embeddings sequentially with nodes' sequential interactions. However, the sequential modeling of previous approaches cannot handle the transition structure between nodes' neighbors with limited memorization capacity. Detailedly, an effective method for the transition structures is required to both model nodes' personalized patterns adaptively and capture node dynamics accordingly. In this paper, we propose a method, namely Transition Propagation Graph Neural Networks (TIP-GNN), to tackle the challenges of encoding nodes' transition structures. The proposed TIP-GNN focuses on the bilevel graph structure in temporal networks: besides the explicit interaction graph, a node's sequential interactions can also be constructed as a transition graph. Based on the bilevel graph, TIP-GNN further encodes transition structures by multi-step transition propagation and distills information from neighborhoods by a bilevel graph convolution. Experimental results over various temporal networks reveal the efficiency of our TIP-GNN, with at most 7.2\\% improvements of accuracy on temporal link prediction. Extensive ablation studies further verify the effectiveness and limitations of the transition propagation module. Our code is available at \\url{https://github.com/doujiang-zheng/TIP-GNN}. ",

The whole temporal neighborhood of nodes reveals the varying preferences of nodes.

Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel method of temporal graph convolution with the whole neighborhood, namely Temporal Aggregation and Propagation Graph Neural Networks (TAP-GNN). Specifically, we firstly analyze the computational complexity of the dynamic representation problem by unfolding the temporal graph in a message-passing paradigm. The expensive complexity motivates us to design the AP (aggregation and propagation) block, which significantly reduces the repeated computation of historical neighbors. The final TAP-GNN supports online inference in the graph stream scenario, which incorporates the temporal information into node embeddings with a temporal activation function and a projection layer besides several AP blocks. Experimental results on various real-life temporal networks show that our proposed TAP-GNN outperforms existing temporal graph methods by a large margin in terms of both predictive performance and online inference latency.

    "abstract": "Incorporating knowledge graph into recommendation is an effective way to alleviate data sparsity. Most existing knowledge-aware methods usually perform recursive embedding propagation by enumerating graph neighbors. However, the number of nodes' neighbors grows exponentially as the hop number increases, forcing the nodes to be aware of vast neighbors under this recursive propagation for distilling the high-order semantic relatedness. This may induce more harmful noise than useful information into recommendation, leading the learned node representations to be indistinguishable from each other, that is, the well-known over-smoothing issue. To relieve this issue, we propose a Hierarchical and CONtrastive representation learning framework for knowledge-aware recommendation named HiCON. Specifically, for avoiding the exponential expansion of neighbors, we propose a hierarchical message aggregation mechanism to interact separately with low-order neighbors and meta-path-constrained high-order neighbors. Moreover, we also perform cross-order contrastive learning to enforce the representations to be more discriminative. Extensive experiments on three datasets show the remarkable superiority of HiCON over state-of-the-art approaches. ",

Due to a lack of support from labels, recent representation learning methods usually adopt self-supervised learning, and embeddings are learned by solving a handcrafted auxiliary task(so-called pretext task). However, partially due to the irregular non-Euclidean data in graphs, the pretext tasks are generally designed under homophily assumptions and cornered in the low-frequency signals, which results in significant loss of other signals, especially high-frequency signals widespread in graphs with heterophily. Motivated by this limitation, we propose a multi-view perspective and the usage of diverse pretext tasks to capture different signals in graphs into embeddings. A novel framework, denoted as Multi-view Graph Encoder(MVGE), is proposed, and a set of key designs are identified. More specifically, a set of new pretext tasks are designed to encode different types of signals, and a straightforward operation is propxwosed to maintain both the commodity and personalization in both the attribute and the structural levels.

Therefore, it is surprising that no empirical evidence has been collected to determine whether cost awareness permeates the development process and how it manifests in practice. Objective: This study aims to provide empirical evidence of cost awareness by mining open source repositories of cloud-based applications. The focus is on Infrastructure as Code artifacts that automate software (re)deployment on the cloud. Methods: A systematic search through 152,735 repositories resulted in the selection of 2,010 relevant ones. We then analyzed 538 relevant commits and 208 relevant issues using a combination of inductive and deductive coding. Results: The findings indicate that developers are not only concerned with the cost of their application deployments but also take actions to reduce these costs beyond selecting cheaper cloud services. We also identify research areas for future consideration. Conclusion: Although we focus on a particular Infrastructure as Code technology (Terraform), the findings can be applicable to cloud-based application development in general. The provided empirical grounding can serve developers seeking to reduce costs through service selection, resource allocation, deployment optimization, and other techniques. ",

    "abstract": "Online Social Networks have revolutionized how we consume and share information, but they have also led to a proliferation of content not always reliable and accurate. One particular type of social accounts is known to promote unreputable content, hyperpartisan, and propagandistic information. They are automated accounts, commonly called bots. Focusing on Twitter accounts, we propose a novel approach to bot detection: we first propose a new algorithm that transforms the sequence of actions that an account performs into an image; then, we leverage the strength of Convolutional Neural Networks to proceed with image classification. We compare our performances with state-of-the-art results for bot detection on genuine accounts / bot accounts datasets well known in the literature. The results confirm the effectiveness of the proposal, because the detection capability is on par with the state of the art, if not better in some cases. ",

    "abstract": "Pre-trained models of code have gained widespread popularity in many code intelligence tasks. Recently, with the scaling of the model and corpus size, large language models have shown the ability of in-context learning. These models employ task instructions and a few demonstration examples as prompts to learn the semantics of the task and make predictions for test samples. This new learning paradigm is training-free and has shown impressive performance in various natural language processing and code intelligence tasks. However, the performance of in-context learning heavily relies on the quality of demonstration, and there has been no systematic investigation into how to construct a good demonstration for code-related tasks with in-context learning. In this paper, by analyzing the design space of in-context demonstration, we empirically explore the impact of three key factors on the performance of in-context learning in code intelligence tasks: the selection of demonstration examples, the order of demonstration examples, and the number of demonstration examples. We conduct extensive experiments on three code intelligence tasks including bug fixing, code summarization, and program synthesis. Our experimental results demonstrate that all the above three factors dramatically impact the performance of in-context learning in code intelligence tasks. Additionally, we summarize our findings and provide takeaway suggestions on how to construct effective demonstrations, taking into account these three perspectives. We show that a well-constructed demonstration can lead to significant improvements over simple demonstrations and previous fine-tuned state-of-the-art models, e.g., improving EM, BLEU-4, and EM by at least 11.91%, 36.88%, and 37.18% on code summarization, bug fixing and program synthesis, respectively.

Specifically, compared with FAS in traditional scenes such as phone unlocking, face payment, and self-service security inspection, FAS in long-distance such as station squares, parks, and self-service supermarkets are equally important, but it has not been sufficiently explored yet. In order to fill this gap in the FAS community, we collect a large-scale Surveillance High-Fidelity Mask (SuHiFiMask). SuHiFiMask contains $10,195$ videos from $101$ subjects of different age groups, which are collected by $7$ mainstream surveillance cameras. Based on this dataset and protocol-$3$ for evaluating the robustness of the algorithm under quality changes, we organized a face presentation attack detection challenge in surveillance scenarios. It attracted 180 teams for the development phase with a total of 37 teams qualifying for the final round. The organization team re-verified and re-ran the submitted code and used the results as the final ranking. In this paper, we present an overview of the challenge, including an introduction to the dataset used, the definition of the protocol, the evaluation metrics, and the announcement of the competition results. Finally, we present the top-ranked algorithms and the research ideas provided by the competition for attack detection in long-range surveillance scenarios. ",

To achieve fast and accurate detection of fires, this paper proposes a detection network called FSDNet (Fire Smoke Detection Network), which consists of a feature extraction module, a fire classification module, and a fire detection module. Firstly, a dense connection structure is introduced in the basic feature extraction module to enhance the feature extraction ability of the backbone network and alleviate the gradient disappearance problem. Secondly, a spatial pyramid pooling structure is introduced in the fire detection module, and the Mosaic data augmentation method and CIoU loss function are used in the training process to comprehensively improve the flame feature extraction ability. Finally, in view of the shortcomings of public fire datasets, a fire dataset called MS-FS (Multi-scene Fire And Smoke) containing 11938 fire images was created through data collection, screening, and object annotation. To prove the effectiveness of the proposed method, the accuracy of the method was evaluated on two benchmark fire datasets and MS-FS. The experimental results show that the accuracy of FSDNet on the two benchmark datasets is 99.82% and 91.15%, respectively, and the average precision on MS-FS is 86.80%, which is better than the mainstream fire detection methods.

Nevertheless, existing code generation approaches usually concentrate on a single stage of the software development process (i.e., the coding stage) and do not take into consideration other stages that are crucial in reducing complexity and ensuring quality assurance. The organization and conduction of multiple stages in software development require collaborative teamwork. To this end, this paper presents a self-collaboration code generation framework employing large language models (LLMs), exemplified by ChatGPT. Specifically, multiple LLMs play distinct roles through role instructions to form teams, addressing code generation tasks collaboratively and interactively without the need for human intervention. To showcase our framework, we assemble an elementary team consisting of three ChatGPT roles (i.e., analyst, coder, and tester) corresponding to the analysis, coding, and testing stages of software development. We conduct comprehensive experiments on various code-generation benchmarks. The experimental results indicate that self-collaboration code generation improves 29.9%-47.1% relative performance compared to naive direct code generation, achieving state-of-the-art performance and even surpassing GPT-4.

As image size is a deciding factor for the computational load of computer vision applications, CQKD notably reduces the requirements by only using the student network at inference time. Our experimental results show that CQKD outperforms supervised learning in large-scale image classification problems. We also highlight the importance of calibrating neural networks: we show that with higher temperature smoothing of the teacher's output distribution, the student distribution exhibits a higher entropy, which leads to both, a lower calibration error and a higher network accuracy.

Neural operators specifically employ deep neural networks to approximate mappings between infinite-dimensional Banach spaces. As data-driven models, neural operators require the generation of labeled observations, which in cases of complex high-fidelity models result in high-dimensional datasets containing redundant and noisy features, which can hinder gradient-based optimization. Mapping these high-dimensional datasets to a low-dimensional latent space of salient features can make it easier to work with the data and also enhance learning. In this work, we investigate the latent deep operator network (L-DeepONet), an extension of standard DeepONet, which leverages latent representations of high-dimensional PDE input and output functions identified with suitable autoencoders. We illustrate that L-DeepONet outperforms the standard approach in terms of both accuracy and computational efficiency across diverse time-dependent PDEs, e.g., modeling the growth of fracture in brittle materials, convective fluid flows, and large-scale atmospheric flows exhibiting multiscale dynamical features.

This is a very challenging area due to unstructured nature of the language, with many ambiguous and corner cases. In this thesis we address a very specific area of NLP that involves the understanding of entities (e.g., names of people, organizations, locations) in text. First, we introduce a radically different, entity-centric view of the information in text. We argue that instead of using individual mentions in text to understand their meaning, we should build applications that would work in terms of entity concepts. Next, we present a more detailed model on how the entity-centric approach can be used for the entity linking task. In our work, we show that this task can be improved by considering performing entity linking at the coreference cluster level rather than each of the mentions individually. In our next work, we further study how information from Knowledge Base entities can be integrated into text. Finally, we analyze the evolution of the entities from the evolving temporal perspective.

    "abstract": "The framework of causal models provides a principled approach to causal reasoning, applied today across many scientific domains. Here we present this framework in the language of string diagrams, interpreted formally using category theory. A class of string diagrams, called network diagrams, are in 1-to-1 correspondence with directed acyclic graphs. A causal model is given by such a diagram with its components interpreted as stochastic maps, functions, or general channels in a symmetric monoidal category with a 'copy-discard' structure (cd-category), turning a model into a single mathematical object that can be reasoned with intuitively and yet rigorously. Building on prior works by Fong and Jacobs, Kissinger and Zanasi, as well as Fritz and Klingler, we present diagrammatic definitions of causal models and functional causal models in a cd-category, generalising causal Bayesian networks and structural causal models, respectively. We formalise general interventions on a model, including but beyond do-interventions, and present the natural notion of an open causal model with inputs. We also give an approach to conditioning based on a normalisation box, allowing for causal inference calculations to be done fully diagrammatically. We define counterfactuals in this setup, and treat the problems of the identifiability of causal effects and counterfactuals fully diagrammatically. The benefits of such a presentation of causal models lie in foundational questions in causal reasoning and in their clarificatory role and pedagogical value. This work aims to be accessible to different communities, from causal model practitioners to researchers in applied category theory, and discusses many examples from the literature for illustration. Overall, we argue and demonstrate that causal reasoning according to the causal model framework is most naturally and intuitively done as diagrammatic reasoning. ",

However, conventional approaches that rely on precise vision-language alignment are not always feasible in complex clinical imaging modalities, such as cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR). CMR provides a comprehensive visualization of cardiac anatomy, physiology, and microstructure, making it challenging to interpret. Additionally, CMR reports require synthesizing information from sequences of images and different views, resulting in potentially weak alignment between the study and diagnosis report pair. To overcome these challenges, we propose \\textbf{CMRformer}, a multimodal learning framework to jointly learn sequences of CMR images and associated cardiologist's reports. Moreover, one of the major obstacles to improving CMR study is the lack of large, publicly available datasets. To bridge this gap, we collected a large \\textbf{CMR dataset}, which consists of 13,787 studies from clinical cases. By utilizing our proposed CMRformer and our collected dataset, we achieved remarkable performance in real-world clinical tasks, such as CMR image retrieval and diagnosis report retrieval. Furthermore, the learned representations are evaluated to be practically helpful for downstream applications, such as disease classification. Our work could potentially expedite progress in the CMR study and lead to more accurate and effective diagnosis and treatment. ",

The data is then transmitted to an aggregator, where an obfuscation method is applied to ensure individual anonymity. Furthermore, we implement the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) technique at the aggregator level and apply differential privacy to the private data received from smart homes.

    "abstract": "Research on the theoretical expressiveness of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) has developed rapidly, and many methods have been proposed to enhance the expressiveness. However, most methods do not have a uniform expressiveness measure except for a few that strictly follow the $k$-dimensional Weisfeiler-Lehman ($k$-WL) test hierarchy. Their theoretical analyses are often limited to distinguishing certain families of non-isomorphic graphs, leading to difficulties in quantitatively comparing their expressiveness. In contrast to theoretical analysis, another way to measure expressiveness is by evaluating model performance on certain datasets containing 1-WL-indistinguishable graphs. Previous datasets specifically designed for this purpose, however, face problems with difficulty (any model surpassing 1-WL has nearly 100% accuracy), granularity (models tend to be either 100% correct or near random guess), and scale (only a few essentially different graphs in each dataset). To address these limitations, we propose a new expressiveness dataset, $\\textbf{BREC}$, which includes 400 pairs of non-isomorphic graphs carefully selected from four primary categories (Basic, Regular, Extension, and CFI). These graphs have higher difficulty (up to 4-WL), finer granularity (able to compare models between 1-WL and 3-WL), and a larger scale (400 pairs). Further, we synthetically test 16 models with higher-than-1-WL expressiveness on our BREC dataset. Our experiment gives the first thorough comparison of the expressiveness of those state-of-the-art beyond-1-WL GNN models. We expect this dataset to serve as a benchmark for testing the expressiveness of future GNNs. Our dataset and evaluation code are released at: https://github.com/GraphPKU/BREC. ",

    "abstract": "Non-exemplar class-incremental learning refers to classifying new and old classes without storing samples of old classes. Since only new class samples are available for optimization, it often occurs catastrophic forgetting of old knowledge. To alleviate this problem, many new methods are proposed such as model distillation, class augmentation. In this paper, we propose an effective non-exemplar method called RAMF consisting of Random Auxiliary classes augmentation and Mixed Feature. On the one hand, we design a novel random auxiliary classes augmentation method, where one augmentation is randomly selected from three augmentations and applied on the input to generate augmented samples and extra class labels. By extending data and label space, it allows the model to learn more diverse representations, which can prevent the model from being biased towards learning task-specific features. When learning new tasks, it will reduce the change of feature space and improve model generalization. On the other hand, we employ mixed feature to replace the new features since only using new feature to optimize the model will affect the representation that was previously embedded in the feature space. Instead, by mixing new and old features, old knowledge can be retained without increasing the computational complexity. Extensive experiments on three benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our approach, which outperforms the state-of-the-art non-exemplar methods and is comparable to high-performance replay-based methods.

    "abstract": "Recurrent Neural Network, Long Short-Term Memory, and Transformer have made great progress in predicting the trajectories of moving objects. Although the trajectory element with the surrounding scene features has been merged to improve performance, there still exist some problems to be solved. One is that the time series processing models will increase the inference time with the increase of the number of prediction sequences. Another lies in which the features can not be extracted from the scene's image and point cloud in some situations. Therefore, this paper proposes an Obstacle-Transformer to predict trajectory in a constant inference time. An ``obstacle'' is designed by the surrounding trajectory rather than images or point clouds, making Obstacle-Transformer more applicable in a wider range of scenarios. Experiments are conducted on ETH and UCY data sets to verify the performance of our model. ",

Existing RNN models obtain higher performance by deepening or widening the model. They obtain the multi-scale features of the video only by stacking layers, which is inefficient and brings unbearable training costs (such as memory, FLOPs, and training time). Different from them, this paper proposes a spatiotemporal multi-scale model called MS-LSTM wholly from a multi-scale perspective. On the basis of stacked layers, MS-LSTM incorporates two additional efficient multi-scale designs to fully capture spatiotemporal context information. Concretely, we employ LSTMs with mirrored pyramid structures to construct spatial multi-scale representations and LSTMs with different convolution kernels to construct temporal multi-scale representations. Detailed comparison experiments with eight baseline models on four video datasets show that MS-LSTM has better performance but lower training costs. ",

Existing tensor compilation and Neural Architecture Search (NAS) techniques orthogonally optimize the two goals but actually share many similarities in their concrete strategies. We exploit such opportunities by combining the two into one and make a case for Kernel Architecture Search (KAS). KAS reviews NAS from a system perspective and zooms into a more fine-grained level to generate neural kernels with both high performance and good accuracy. To demonstrate the potential of KAS, we build an end-to-end framework, Canvas, to find high-quality kernels as convolution replacements. Canvas samples from a rich set of fine-grained primitives to stochastically and iteratively construct new kernels and evaluate them according to user-specified constraints. Canvas supports freely adjustable tensor dimension sizes inside the kernel and uses two levels of solvers to satisfy structural legality and fully utilize model budgets. The evaluation shows that by replacing standard convolutions with generated new kernels in common NNs, Canvas achieves average 1.5x speedups compared to the previous state-of-the-art with acceptable accuracy loss and search efficiency. Canvas verifies the practicability of KAS by rediscovering many manually designed kernels in the past and producing new structures that may inspire future machine learning innovations. ",

Thus far, NeRF and its variants have ignored these cases. However, since the NeRF framework is based on volumetric rendering, it has inherent capability to account for the medium's effects, once modeled appropriately. We develop a new rendering model for NeRFs in scattering media, which is based on the SeaThru image formation model, and suggest a suitable architecture for learning both scene information and medium parameters. We demonstrate the strength of our method using simulated and real-world scenes, correctly rendering novel photorealistic views underwater. Even more excitingly, we can render clear views of these scenes, removing the medium between the camera and the scene and reconstructing the appearance and depth of far objects, which are severely occluded by the medium.

    "abstract": "Craters are amongst the most important morphological features in planetary exploration. To that extent, detecting, mapping and counting craters is a mainstream process in planetary science, done primarily manually, which is a very laborious and time-consuming process. Recently, machine learning (ML) and computer vision have been successfully applied for both detecting craters and estimating their size. Existing ML approaches for automated crater detection have been trained in specific types of data e.g. digital elevation model (DEM), images and associated metadata for orbiters such as the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter Camera (LROC) etc.. Due to that, each of the resulting ML schemes is applicable and reliable only to the type of data used during the training process. Data from different sources, angles and setups can compromise the reliability of these ML schemes. In this paper we present a universal crater detection scheme that is based on the recently proposed Segment Anything Model (SAM) from META AI. SAM is a prompt-able segmentation system with zero-shot generalization to unfamiliar objects and images without the need for additional training. Using SAM we can successfully identify crater-looking objects in any type of data (e,g, raw satellite images Level-1 and 2 products, DEMs etc.) for different setups (e.g. Lunar, Mars) and different capturing angles. Moreover, using shape indexes, we only keep the segmentation masks of crater-like features. These masks are subsequently fitted with an ellipse, recovering both the location and the size/geometry of the detected craters. ",

Additionally, RCALAD employs a supplementary distribution in the input space to steer reconstructions toward the normal data distribution, effectively separating anomalous samples from their reconstructions and facilitating more accurate anomaly detection. To further enhance the performance of the model, two novel anomaly scores are introduced.

Recent studies highly relate the temporal synchronization between vision and sound to the semantic consistency for cross-modal distillation. However, such semantic consistency from the synchronization is hard to guarantee in unconstrained videos, due to the irrelevant modality noise and differentiated semantic correlation. To this end, we first propose a \\textit{Modality Noise Filter} (MNF) module to erase the irrelevant noise in teacher modality with cross-modal context. After this purification, we then design a \\textit{Contrastive Semantic Calibration} (CSC) module to adaptively distill useful knowledge for target modality, by referring to the differentiated sample-wise semantic correlation in a contrastive fashion. Extensive experiments show that our method could bring a performance boost compared with other distillation methods in both visual action recognition and video retrieval task.

Although the digitalization progress of the media brings many advantages, it also increases the risk of spreading disinformation, misinformation, and malformation through the use of fake news. The emergence of this harmful phenomenon has managed to polarize society and manipulate public opinion on particular topics, e.g., elections, vaccinations, etc. Such information propagated on social media can distort public perceptions and generate social unrest while lacking the rigor of traditional journalism. Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning techniques are essential for developing efficient tools that can detect fake news. Models that use the context of textual data are essential for resolving the fake news detection problem, as they manage to encode linguistic features within the vector representation of words. In this paper, we propose a new approach that uses document embeddings to build multiple models that accurately label news articles as reliable or fake. We also present a benchmark on different architectures that detect fake news using binary or multi-labeled classification. We evaluated the models on five large news corpora using accuracy, precision, and recall. We obtained better results than more complex state-of-the-art Deep Neural Network models. We observe that the most important factor for obtaining high accuracy is the document encoding, not the classification model's complexity. ",

    "abstract": "Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is a chronic, food antigen-driven, allergic inflammatory condition of the esophagus associated with elevated esophageal eosinophils. EoE is a top cause of chronic dysphagia after GERD. Diagnosis of EoE relies on counting eosinophils in histological slides, a manual and time-consuming task that limits the ability to extract complex patient-dependent features. The treatment of EoE includes medication and food elimination. A personalized food elimination plan is crucial for engagement and efficiency, but previous attempts failed to produce significant results. In this work, on the one hand, we utilize AI for inferring histological features from the entire biopsy slide, features that cannot be extracted manually. On the other hand, we develop causal learning models that can process this wealth of data. We applied our approach to the 'Six-Food vs. One-Food Eosinophilic Esophagitis Diet Study', where 112 symptomatic adults aged 18-60 years with active EoE were assigned to either a six-food elimination diet (6FED) or a one-food elimination diet (1FED) for six weeks. Our results show that the average treatment effect (ATE) of the 6FED treatment compared with the 1FED treatment is not significant, that is, neither diet was superior to the other. We examined several causal models and show that the best treatment strategy was obtained using T-learner with two XGBoost modules. While 1FED only and 6FED only provide improvement for 35%-38% of the patients, which is not significantly different from a random treatment assignment, our causal model yields a significantly better improvement rate of 58.4%. This study illustrates the significance of AI in enhancing treatment planning by analyzing molecular features' distribution in histological slides through causal learning.

    "abstract": "In this paper we introduce a multistep generalization of the guess-and-determine or hybrid strategy for solving a system of multivariate polynomial equations over a finite field. In particular, we propose performing the exhaustive evaluation of a subset of variables stepwise, that is, by incrementing the size of such subset each time that an evaluation leads to a polynomial system which is possibly unfeasible to solve. The decision about which evaluation to extend is based on a preprocessing consisting in computing an incomplete Grobner basis after the current evaluation, which possibly generates linear polynomials that are used to eliminate further variables. If the number of remaining variables in the system is deemed still too high, the evaluation is extended and the preprocessing is iterated. Otherwise, we solve the system by a Grobner basis computation. Having in mind cryptanalytic applications, we present an implementation of this strategy in an algorithm called MultiSolve which is designed for polynomial systems having at most one solution. We prove explicit formulas for its complexity which are based on probability distributions that can be easily estimated by performing the proposed preprocessing on a testset of evaluations for different subsets of variables. We prove that an optimal complexity of MultiSolve is achieved by using a full multistep strategy with a maximum number of steps and in turn the classical guess-and-determine strategy, which essentially is a strategy consisting of a single step, is the worst choice. Finally, we extensively study the behaviour of MultiSolve when performing an algebraic attack on the well-known stream cipher Trivium. ",

Extensive experimental results on the employed datasets show the superiority of the proposed defense method on detecting white-box attacks and adaptive attacks which attack both FRS and the defense method. Additionally, due to the simpleness yet robustness of our method, it can be easily applied to the real world face recognition system and extended to other defense methods to boost the detection performance.

    "title": "Automated Program Repair Based on Code Review: How do Pre-trained  Transformer Models Perform?",
    "abstract": "Sequence-to-sequence models have been used to transform erroneous programs into correct ones when trained with a large enough dataset. Some recent studies also demonstrated strong empirical evidence that code review (natural language instruction about suggestive changes in code) can improve the program repair further. Large language models, trained with Natural Language (NL) and computer program corpora, have the capacity to contain inherent knowledge of both. In this study, we investigate if this inherent knowledge of code and NL can be utilized to improve automated program repair. We applied PLBART and CodeT5, two state-of-the-art language models that are pre-trained with both Programming Language (PL) and Natural Language (NL), on two such natural language-based program repair datasets and found that the pre-trained language models fine-tuned with datasets containing both code review and subsequent code changes notably outperform each of the previous models. We observed that the pre-trained models improve the previously best-reported results by 9.91% on the Review4Repair dataset and by 24.72% on the dataset by Tufano et al. This suggests that a pre-trained sequential model has a better understanding of natural language and can utilize it much better. We performed an ablation study to assess the contribution of the pre-training mechanism and the model architecture. We found that pre-training was significantly more important in the performance gain than the model architecture. The practical application of using pre-trained transformer models in the context of automated program repair is still a long way off. However, our study demonstrates the substantial value of employing pre-trained models, paving the path for future studies to use more of these. ",

We introduce a parametric approach that allows us to estimate the effect of mismatches on the stability of the synchronous solution in terms of contributions of pairs of eigenvalues of the Laplacian. For cases in which synchronization occurs in a bounded interval of a parameter, we study the effects of parameter heterogeneity on both transitions (asynchronous to synchronous and synchronous to asynchronous.)

In this paper, we focus on the multi-scenario click-through rate (CTR) prediction, i.e., training a unified model to serve all scenarios. Existing multi-scenario based CTR methods struggle in the context of OTP setting due to the ignorance of the cold-start users who have very limited data. To fill this gap, we propose a novel method named Cold-Start based Multi-scenario Network (CSMN). Specifically, it consists of two basic components including: 1) User Interest Projection Network (UIPN), which firstly purifies users' behaviors by eliminating the scenario-irrelevant information in behaviors with respect to the visiting scenario, followed by obtaining users' scenario-specific interests by summarizing the purified behaviors with respect to the target item via an attention mechanism; and 2) User Representation Memory Network (URMN), which benefits cold-start users from users with rich behaviors through a memory read and write mechanism. CSMN seamlessly integrates both components in an end-to-end learning framework. Extensive experiments on real-world offline dataset and online A/B test demonstrate the superiority of CSMN over state-of-the-art methods. ",

This paper introduces a new configuration based on coupled inductors as a power electronic converter in three case studies to verify the high reliability of the proposed converter by using just a simple controller that is substantial for recycling brake energy in the propulsion system of Electric Vehicles and grid-following inverters. This topology with a straightforward structure, computation, and wide voltage gain, provides a proper connection between the components of its network that obtains appropriate paths for leakage energy, and likewise helps soft-switching in some conditions. Additionally, the performance of other previously related constructions is compared with the suggested topology.

    "abstract": "Heterogeneity and uncertainty in a composite microstructure lead to either computational bottlenecks if modeled rigorously, or to solution inaccuracies in the stress field and failure predictions if approximated. Although methods suitable for analyzing arbitrary and non-linear microstructures exist, their computational cost makes them impractical to use in large-scale structural analysis. Surrogate models or Reduced Order Models (ROM), commonly enhance efficiencies, but they are typically calibrated with a single microstructure. Homogenization methods, such as the Mori-Tanaka method, offer rapid homogenization for a wide range of constituent properties. However, simplifying assumptions, like stress and strain averaging in phases, render the consideration of both deterministic and stochastic variations in microstructure infeasible. This paper illustrates a transformer neural network architecture that captures the knowledge of various microstructures and constituents, enabling it to function as a computationally efficient homogenization surrogate model. Given an image or an abstraction of an arbitrary composite microstructure, the transformer network predicts the homogenized stress-strain response. Two methods were tested that encode features of the microstructure. The first method calculates two-point statistics of the microstructure and uses Principal Component Analysis for dimensionality reduction. The second method uses an autoencoder with a Convolutional Neural Network. Both microstructure encoding methods accurately predict the homogenized material response. The paper describes the network architecture, training and testing data generation and the performance of the transformer network under cycling and random loadings. ",

    "abstract": "Detecting anomalies in temporal data is challenging due to anomalies being dependent on temporal dynamics. One-class classification methods are commonly used for anomaly detection tasks, but they have limitations when applied to temporal data. In particular, mapping all normal instances into a single hypersphere to capture their global characteristics can lead to poor performance in detecting context-based anomalies where the abnormality is defined with respect to local information. To address this limitation, we propose a novel approach inspired by the loss function of DeepSVDD. Instead of mapping all normal instances into a single hypersphere center, each normal instance is pulled toward a recent context window. However, this approach is prone to a representation collapse issue where the neural network that encodes a given instance and its context is optimized towards a constant encoder solution. To overcome this problem, we combine our approach with a deterministic contrastive loss from Neutral AD, a promising self-supervised learning anomaly detection approach. We provide a theoretical analysis to demonstrate that the incorporation of the deterministic contrastive loss can effectively prevent the occurrence of a constant encoder solution. Experimental results show superior performance of our model over various baselines and model variants on real-world industrial datasets. ",

Such attacks promote certain keywords to push them to Twitter trends to make them visible to a broader audience. Past work on such fake trends revealed a new astroturfing attack named ephemeral astroturfing that employs a very unique bot behavior in which bots post and delete generated tweets in a coordinated manner. As such, it is easy to mass-annotate such bots reliably, making them a convenient source of ground truth for bot research. In this paper, we detect and disclose over 212,000 such bots targeting Turkish trends, which we name astrobots. We also analyze their activity and suspension patterns. We found that Twitter purged those bots en-masse 6 times since June 2018. However, the adversaries reacted quickly and deployed new bots that were created years ago. We also found that many such bots do not post tweets apart from promoting fake trends, which makes it challenging for bot detection methods to detect them. Our work provides insights into platforms' content moderation practices and bot detection research. The dataset is publicly available at https://github.com/tugrulz/EphemeralAstroturfing. ",

    "abstract": "Cross-domain recommendation (CDR) is an effective way to alleviate the data sparsity problem. Content-based CDR is one of the most promising branches since most kinds of products can be described by a piece of text, especially when cold-start users or items have few interactions. However, two vital issues are still under-explored: (1) From the content modeling perspective, sufficient long-text descriptions are usually scarce in a real recommender system, more often the light-weight textual features, such as a few keywords or tags, are more accessible, which is improperly modeled by existing methods. (2) From the CDR perspective, not all inter-domain interests are helpful to infer intra-domain interests. Caused by domain-specific features, there are part of signals benefiting for recommendation in the source domain but harmful for that in the target domain. Therefore, how to distill useful interests is crucial. To tackle the above two problems, we propose a metapath and multi-interest aggregated graph neural network (M2GNN). Specifically, to model the tag-based contents, we construct a heterogeneous information network to hold the semantic relatedness between users, items, and tags in all domains. The metapath schema is predefined according to domain-specific knowledge, with one metapath for one domain. User representations are learned by GNN with a hierarchical aggregation framework, where the intra-metapath aggregation firstly filters out trivial tags and the inter-metapath aggregation further filters out useless interests. Offline experiments and online A/B tests demonstrate that M2GNN achieves significant improvements over the state-of-the-art methods and current industrial recommender system in Dianping, respectively. Further analysis shows that M2GNN offers an interpretable recommendation. ",

    "abstract": "Reinforcement learning-based recommender systems have recently gained popularity. However, the design of the reward function, on which the agent relies to optimize its recommendation policy, is often not straightforward. Exploring the causality underlying users' behavior can take the place of the reward function in guiding the agent to capture the dynamic interests of users. Moreover, due to the typical limitations of simulation environments (e.g., data inefficiency), most of the work cannot be broadly applied in large-scale situations. Although some works attempt to convert the offline dataset into a simulator, data inefficiency makes the learning process even slower. Because of the nature of reinforcement learning (i.e., learning by interaction), it cannot collect enough data to train during a single interaction. Furthermore, traditional reinforcement learning algorithms do not have a solid capability like supervised learning methods to learn from offline datasets directly. In this paper, we propose a new model named the causal decision transformer for recommender systems (CDT4Rec). CDT4Rec is an offline reinforcement learning system that can learn from a dataset rather than from online interaction. Moreover, CDT4Rec employs the transformer architecture, which is capable of processing large offline datasets and capturing both short-term and long-term dependencies within the data to estimate the causal relationship between action, state, and reward. To demonstrate the feasibility and superiority of our model, we have conducted experiments on six real-world offline datasets and one online simulator. ",

The EVR paradigm first estimates the privacy parameter of a mechanism, then verifies whether it meets this guarantee, and finally releases the query output based on the verification result. The core component of the EVR is privacy verification. We develop a randomized privacy verifier using Monte Carlo (MC) technique. Furthermore, we propose an MC-based DP accountant that outperforms existing DP accounting techniques in terms of accuracy and efficiency.

Assuming each supervised task only depends on an unknown subset of the factors of variation, we disentangle the feature space of a supervised multi-task model, with features activating sparsely across different tasks and information being shared as appropriate. Importantly, we never directly observe the factors of variations but establish that access to multiple tasks is sufficient for identifiability under sufficiency and minimality assumptions. We validate our approach on six real world distribution shift benchmarks, and different data modalities (images, text), demonstrating how disentangled representations can be transferred to real settings.

    "abstract": "As the content on the Internet continues to grow, many new dynamically changing and heterogeneous sources of data constantly emerge. A conventional search engine cannot crawl and index at the same pace as the expansion of the Internet. Moreover, a large portion of the data on the Internet is not accessible to traditional search engines. Distributed Information Retrieval (DIR) is a viable solution to this as it integrates multiple shards (resources) and provides a unified access to them. Resource selection is a key component of DIR systems. There is a rich body of literature on resource selection approaches for DIR. A key limitation of the existing approaches is that they primarily use term-based statistical features and do not generally model resource-query and resource-resource relationships. In this paper, we propose a graph neural network (GNN) based approach to learning-to-rank that is capable of modeling resource-query and resource-resource relationships. Specifically, we utilize a pre-trained language model (PTLM) to obtain semantic information from queries and resources. Then, we explicitly build a heterogeneous graph to preserve structural information of query-resource relationships and employ GNN to extract structural information. In addition, the heterogeneous graph is enriched with resource-resource type of edges to further enhance the ranking accuracy. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets show that our proposed approach is highly effective in resource selection. Our method outperforms the state-of-the-art by 6.4% to 42% on various performance metrics. ",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we focus on approximating a natural class of functions that are compositions of smooth functions. Unlike the low-dimensional support assumption on the covariate, we demonstrate that composition functions have an intrinsic sparse structure if we assume each layer in the composition has a small degree of freedom. This fact can alleviate the curse of dimensionality in approximation errors by neural networks. Specifically, by using mathematical induction and the multivariate Faa di Bruno formula, we extend the approximation theory of deep neural networks to the composition functions case. Furthermore, combining recent results on the statistical error of deep learning, we provide a general convergence rate analysis for the PINNs method in solving elliptic equations with compositional solutions. We also present two simple illustrative numerical examples to demonstrate the effect of the intrinsic sparse structure in regression and solving PDEs. ",

    "abstract": "Heterogeneous unsupervised domain adaptation (HUDA) is the most challenging domain adaptation setting where the feature space differs between source and target domains, and the target domain has only unlabeled data. Existing HUDA methods assume that both positive and negative examples are available in the source domain, which may not be satisfied in some real applications. This paper addresses a new challenging setting called positive and unlabeled heterogeneous domain adaptation (PU-HDA), a HUDA setting where the source domain only has positives. PU-HDA can also be viewed as an extension of PU learning where the positive and unlabeled examples are sampled from different domains. A naive combination of existing HUDA and PU learning methods is ineffective in PU-HDA due to the gap in label distribution between the source and target domains. To overcome this issue, we propose a novel method, positive-adversarial domain adaptation (PADA), which can predict likely positive examples from the unlabeled target data and simultaneously align the feature spaces to reduce the distribution divergence between the whole source data and the likely positive target data. PADA achieves this by a unified adversarial training framework for learning a classifier to predict positive examples and a feature transformer to transform the target feature space to that of the source. Specifically, they are both trained to fool a common discriminator that determines whether the likely positive examples are from the target or source domain. We experimentally show that PADA outperforms several baseline methods, such as the naive combination of HUDA and PU learning. ",

    "abstract": "Convolutional neural networks have demonstrated impressive results in many computer vision tasks. However, the increasing size of these networks raises concerns about the information redundancy within the network parameters. In this paper, we proposed the Frequency Regularization to restrict the non-zero elements of the network parameters in frequency domain. The proposed approach operates at the tensor level, and can be applied to almost any kind of network architectures. Specifically, the tensors of parameters are maintained in the frequency domain, where high frequency components can be eliminated by zigzag setting tensor elements to zero. Then, the inverse discrete cosine transform (IDCT) is used to reconstruct the spatial tensors for matrix operations during network training. Since high frequency components of images are known to be non-critical, a large proportion of the parameters can be set to zero when networks are trained with proposed frequency regularization. Comprehensive evaluations on various state-of-the-art network architectures, including LeNet, Alexnet, VGG, Resnet, UNet, GAN, and VAE, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed frequency regularization. Under the condition with tiny accuracy decrease (less than 2\\%), a LeNet5 with 0.4M parameters can be represented by 776 float16 numbers(over 1100$\\times$), a UNet with 34M parameters can be represented by 2936 float16 numbers (over 20000$\\times$).

    "abstract": "It is well-known that recurrent neural networks (RNNs), although widely used, are vulnerable to adversarial attacks including one-frame attacks and multi-frame attacks. Though a few certified defenses exist to provide guaranteed robustness against one-frame attacks, we prove that defending against multi-frame attacks remains a challenging problem due to their enormous perturbation space. In this paper, we propose the first certified defense against multi-frame attacks for RNNs called RNN-Guard. To address the above challenge, we adopt the perturb-all-frame strategy to construct perturbation spaces consistent with those in multi-frame attacks. However, the perturb-all-frame strategy causes a precision issue in linear relaxations. To address this issue, we introduce a novel abstract domain called InterZono and design tighter relaxations. We prove that InterZono is more precise than Zonotope yet carries the same time complexity. Experimental evaluations across various datasets and model structures show that the certified robust accuracy calculated by RNN-Guard with InterZono is up to 2.18 times higher than that with Zonotope. In addition, we extend RNN-Guard as the first certified training method against multi-frame attacks to directly enhance RNNs' robustness. The results show that the certified robust accuracy of models trained with RNN-Guard against multi-frame attacks is 15.47 to 67.65 percentage points higher than those with other training methods. ",

However, when images are not object-centric, the semantics of the image can be significantly altered due to geometric transformations such as random crops and multi-crops. Furthermore, the model may struggle to capture location information. For this reason, we propose a Geometric Transformation Sensitive Architecture that learns features sensitive to geometric transformation like four-fold rotation, random crop, and multi-crop. Our method encourages the student to learn sensitive features by increasing the similarity between overlapping regions not entire views. and applying rotations to the target feature map. Additionally, we use a patch correspondence loss to capture long-term dependencies. Our approach demonstrates improved performance when using non-object-centric images as pretraining data compared to other methods that learn geometric transformation-invariant representations.

Nevertheless, the information interactions that occur in the communication network may make privacy information be revealed. In this paper, we develop a new privacy-preserving average consensus method for unbalanced digraphs. Specifically, we ensure privacy preservation by carefully embedding randomness in mixing weights to confuse communications and introducing an extra auxiliary parameter to mask the state-updated rule in initial several iterations. In parallel, we exploit the intrinsic robustness of consensus dynamics to guarantee that the average consensus is precisely achieved. Theoretical results demonstrate that the designed algorithms can converge linearly to the exact average consensus value and can guarantee privacy preservation of agents against both honest-but-curious and eavesdropping attacks. The designed algorithms are fundamentally different compared to differential privacy based algorithms that enable privacy preservation via sacrificing consensus performance. Finally, numerical experiments validate the correctness of the theoretical findings. ",

One of these parts is the intelligence lighting system that personalizes the light for each person. This paper proposes an intelligent system based on machine learning that personalizes lighting in the instant future location of a recognized user, inferred by trajectory prediction. Our proposed system consists of the following modules: (I) human detection to detect and localize the person in each given video frame, (II) face recognition to identify the detected person, (III) human tracking to track the person in the sequence of video frames and (IV) trajectory prediction to forecast the future location of the user in the environment using Inverse Reinforcement Learning. The proposed method provides a unique profile for each person, including specifications, face images, and custom lighting settings. This profile is used in the lighting adjustment process. Unlike other methods that consider constant lighting for every person, our system can apply each 'person's desired lighting in terms of color and light intensity without direct user intervention. Therefore, the lighting is adjusted with higher speed and better efficiency. In addition, the predicted trajectory path makes the proposed system apply the desired lighting, creating more pleasant and comfortable conditions for the home residents. In the experimental results, the system applied the desired lighting in an average time of 1.4 seconds from the moment of entry, as well as a performance of 22.1mAp in human detection, 95.12% accuracy in face recognition, 93.3% MDP in human tracking, and 10.80 MinADE20, 18.55 MinFDE20, 15.8 MinADE5 and 30.50 MinFDE5 in trajectory prediction.

However, the issue of the high computational cost of DETRs has not been effectively addressed, limiting their practical application and preventing them from fully exploiting the benefits of no post-processing, such as non-maximum suppression (NMS). In this paper, we first analyze the influence of NMS in modern real-time object detectors on inference speed, and establish an end-to-end speed benchmark. To avoid the inference delay caused by NMS, we propose a Real-Time DEtection TRansformer (RT-DETR), the first real-time end-to-end object detector to our best knowledge. Specifically, we design an efficient hybrid encoder to efficiently process multi-scale features by decoupling the intra-scale interaction and cross-scale fusion, and propose IoU-aware query selection to improve the initialization of object queries. In addition, our proposed detector supports flexibly adjustment of the inference speed by using different decoder layers without the need for retraining, which facilitates the practical application of real-time object detectors. Our RT-DETR-L achieves 53.0% AP on COCO val2017 and 114 FPS on T4 GPU, while RT-DETR-X achieves 54.8% AP and 74 FPS, outperforming all YOLO detectors of the same scale in both speed and accuracy.

This drives us to not only focus on the forgery detection but also fine-grained falsified region segmentation. In this paper, we propose a collaborative feature learning approach to simultaneously detect manipulation and segment the falsified components. With the collaborative manner, detection and segmentation can boost each other efficiently. To enable our study of forgery detection and segmentation, we build a facial forgery dataset consisting of both entire and partial face forgeries with their pixel-level manipulation ground-truth. Experiment results have justified the mutual promotion between forgery detection and manipulated region segmentation.

Although two-stage HOI detectors have advantages of high efficiency in training and inference, they suffer from lower performance than one-stage methods due to the old backbone networks and the lack of considerations for the HOI perception process of humans in the interaction classifiers. In this paper, we propose Vision Transformer based Pose-Conditioned Self-Loop Graph (ViPLO) to resolve these problems. First, we propose a novel feature extraction method suitable for the Vision Transformer backbone, called masking with overlapped area (MOA) module. The MOA module utilizes the overlapped area between each patch and the given region in the attention function, which addresses the quantization problem when using the Vision Transformer backbone. In addition, we design a graph with a pose-conditioned self-loop structure, which updates the human node encoding with local features of human joints. This allows the classifier to focus on specific human joints to effectively identify the type of interaction, which is motivated by the human perception process for HOI. As a result, ViPLO achieves the state-of-the-art results on two public benchmarks, especially obtaining a +2.07 mAP performance gain on the HICO-DET dataset.

We study a hypergraph version of the problem. Let $G^r(n,p)$ denote the $r$-uniform Erd\\H{o}s-R\\'enyi hypergraph model with $n$ vertices and edge density $p$. We consider detecting the presence of a planted $G^r(n^\\gamma, n^{-\\alpha})$ subhypergraph in a $G^r(n, n^{-\\beta})$ hypergraph, where $0< \\alpha < \\beta < r-1$ and $0 < \\gamma < 1$. Focusing on tests that are degree-$n^{o(1)}$ polynomials of the entries of the adjacency tensor, we determine the threshold between the easy and hard regimes for the detection problem.

    "abstract": "Current dense retrievers (DRs) are limited in their ability to effectively process misspelled queries, which constitute a significant portion of query traffic in commercial search engines. The main issue is that the pre-trained language model-based encoders used by DRs are typically trained and fine-tuned using clean, well-curated text data. Misspelled queries are typically not found in the data used for training these models, and thus misspelled queries observed at inference time are out-of-distribution compared to the data used for training and fine-tuning. Previous efforts to address this issue have focused on \\textit{fine-tuning} strategies, but their effectiveness on misspelled queries remains lower than that of pipelines that employ separate state-of-the-art spell-checking components. To address this challenge, we propose ToRoDer (TypOs-aware bottlenecked pre-training for RObust DEnse Retrieval), a novel \\textit{pre-training} strategy for DRs that increases their robustness to misspelled queries while preserving their effectiveness in downstream retrieval tasks. ToRoDer utilizes an encoder-decoder architecture where the encoder takes misspelled text with masked tokens as input and outputs bottlenecked information to the decoder. The decoder then takes as input the bottlenecked embeddings, along with token embeddings of the original text with the misspelled tokens masked out. The pre-training task is to recover the masked tokens for both the encoder and decoder. Our extensive experimental results and detailed ablation studies show that DRs pre-trained with ToRoDer exhibit significantly higher effectiveness on misspelled queries, sensibly closing the gap with pipelines that use a separate, complex spell-checker component, while retaining their effectiveness on correctly spelled queries.

    "abstract": "Knowledge graphs (KGs), as a structured form of knowledge representation, have been widely applied in the real world. Recently, few-shot knowledge graph completion (FKGC), which aims to predict missing facts for unseen relations with few-shot associated facts, has attracted increasing attention from practitioners and researchers. However, existing FKGC methods are based on metric learning or meta-learning, which often suffer from the out-of-distribution and overfitting problems. Meanwhile, they are incompetent at estimating uncertainties in predictions, which is critically important as model predictions could be very unreliable in few-shot settings. Furthermore, most of them cannot handle complex relations and ignore path information in KGs, which largely limits their performance. In this paper, we propose a normalizing flow-based neural process for few-shot knowledge graph completion (NP-FKGC). Specifically, we unify normalizing flows and neural processes to model a complex distribution of KG completion functions. This offers a novel way to predict facts for few-shot relations while estimating the uncertainty. Then, we propose a stochastic ManifoldE decoder to incorporate the neural process and handle complex relations in few-shot settings. To further improve performance, we introduce an attentive relation path-based graph neural network to capture path information in KGs. Extensive experiments on three public datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms the existing FKGC methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance.

    "abstract": "Emotion Recognition in Conversations (ERC) has been gaining increasing importance as conversational agents become more and more common. Recognizing emotions is key for effective communication, being a crucial component in the development of effective and empathetic conversational agents. Knowledge and understanding of the conversational context are extremely valuable for identifying the emotions of the interlocutor. We thus approach Emotion Recognition in Conversations leveraging the conversational context, i.e., taking into attention previous conversational turns. The usual approach to model the conversational context has been to produce context-independent representations of each utterance and subsequently perform contextual modeling of these. Here we propose context-dependent embedding representations of each utterance by leveraging the contextual representational power of pre-trained transformer language models. In our approach, we feed the conversational context appended to the utterance to be classified as input to the RoBERTa encoder, to which we append a simple classification module, thus discarding the need to deal with context after obtaining the embeddings since these constitute already an efficient representation of such context. We also investigate how the number of introduced conversational turns influences our model performance. The effectiveness of our approach is validated on the widely used open-domain DailyDialog dataset and on the task-oriented EmoWOZ dataset, for which we attain state-of-the-art results, surpassing ERC models also resorting to RoBERTa but with more complex classification modules, indicating that our context-dependent embedding utterance representation approach with a simple classification model can be more effective than context-independent utterance representation approaches with more complex classification modules.

Due to extreme scarcity of energy intakes and limited energy buffers, their executions become intermittent, alternating periods of active operation with periods of recharging their energy buffer while the device is off. We demonstrate that by exerting a limited control on the ambient supply of energy to the system, one can create situations of livelock, denial of service, and priority inversion, without requiring physical access to a device. Using machine learning and concepts of approximate computing, we design a technique that can detect energy attacks with 92%+ accuracy, corresponding to a 73+% improvement in accuracy over the baselines we consider, and run on extremely resource-constrained devices by imposing a limited overhead.

    "abstract": "Public transportation has been essential in people's lives in recent years. Bus ridership is a factor in people's choice to board the bus. Therefore, from the perspective of improving service quality, it is important to inform passengers who have not boarded the bus yet about future bus ridership. However, there is a concern that providing inaccurate information may cause a negative experience. Against this backdrop, there is a need to provide bus passengers who have not boarded yet with highly accurate predictions. Many researchers are working on studies on this. However, two issues summarize related studies. The first is that the correlation of bus ridership between consecutive bus stops should be considered for the prediction. The second is that the prediction has yet to be made using all of the features shown to be useful in each related study. This study proposes a prediction method that addresses both of these issues. We solve the first issue by designing an LSTM-based architecture for each bus stop and a single model for the entire bus stop. We solve the second issue by inputting all useful data, the past bus ridership, day of the week, time section, weather, and precipitation, as features. Bus ridership at each bus stop collected from buses operated by Minato Kanko Bus Inc, in Kobe city, Hyogo, Japan, from October 1, 2021, to September 30, 2022, were used to compare accuracy. The proposed method improved RMSE by 23% on average and up to 27% compared to existing methods. ",

Specifically, different subgraphs are constructed as different training sets through node sampling, feature selection, and edge dropout. Then, GNN base classifiers are trained using various subgraphs, and the remaining features are used for training Fully Connected Netural Network (FCN). The outputs of GNN and FCN are aligned in each branch. Finally, the outputs of all branches are aggregated to produce the final result. Moreover, RF-GNN is compatible with various widely-used GNNs for node classification.

To address both issues, we introduce Deep-LPTM, a model-based clustering strategy relying on a variational graph auto-encoder approach as well as a probabilistic model to characterise the topics of discussion. Deep-LPTM allows to build a joint representation of the nodes and of the edges in two embeddings spaces. The parameters are inferred using a variational inference algorithm.

An extensive benchmark study on synthetic data is provided. In particular, we find that Deep-LPTM better recovers the partitions of the nodes than the state-of-the art ETSBM and STBM.

Players and their win-loss relationships are modeled as a skill gap graph, which is an undirected weighted graph. The player embeddings are learned from the graph using a random walk-based graph embedding method and can reflect the relative skill levels among players. Embeddings are low-dimensional vector representations that can be conveniently applied to subsequent tasks while still preserving the topological relationships in a graph. In the latter part of this paper, Graphical Elo (GElo) is introduced as an application of player embeddings when rating player skills. GElo is an extension of the classic Elo rating system. It constructs a skill gap graph based on player match histories and learns player embeddings from it. Afterward, the rating scores that were calculated by Elo are adjusted according to player activeness and cosine similarities among player embeddings. GElo can be executed offline and in parallel, and it is non-intrusive to existing rating systems. Experiments on public datasets show that GElo makes a more reliable evaluation of player skill levels than vanilla Elo. The experimental results suggest potential applications of player embeddings in competitive games and events. ",

To solve these two problems, we present a new concept, Voxel Region (VR), which is obtained by projecting the sparse local point clouds in each voxel dynamically. And we propose a novel fusion method, named Sparse-to-Dense Voxel Region Fusion (SDVRF). Specifically, more pixels of the image feature map inside the VR are gathered to supplement the voxel feature extracted from sparse points and achieve denser fusion. Meanwhile, different from prior methods, which project the size-fixed grids, our strategy of generating dynamic regions achieves better alignment and avoids introducing too much background noise. Furthermore, we propose a multi-scale fusion framework to extract more contextual information and capture the features of objects of different sizes. Experiments on the KITTI dataset show that our method improves the performance of different baselines, especially on classes of small size, including Pedestrian and Cyclist. ",

Thus, drift detectors must meet computational requirements or constraints with a comprehensive performance evaluation. However, so far, the focus of developing drift detectors is on detection quality, e.g.~accuracy, but not on computational performance, such as running time. We show that the previous works consider computational performance only as a secondary objective and do not have a benchmark for such evaluation. Hence, we propose a novel benchmark suite for drift detectors that accounts both detection quality and computational performance to ensure a detector's applicability in various AI systems. In this work, we focus on unsupervised drift detectors that are not restricted to the availability of labeled data and thus being widely applicable. Our benchmark suite supports configurable synthetic and real world data streams. Moreover, it provides means for simulating a machine learning model's output to unify the performance evaluation across different drift detectors. This allows a fair and comprehensive comparison of drift detectors proposed in related work. Our benchmark suite is integrated in the existing framework, Massive Online Analysis (MOA). To evaluate our benchmark suite's capability, we integrate two representative unsupervised drift detectors. Our work enables the scientific community to achieve a baseline for unsupervised drift detectors with respect to both detection quality and computational performance. ",

Contrary to standard inverse problems, these approaches are \\emph{goal-oriented} in that the goal is to estimate some quantities of interest (QoI) that are functions of the solution of an inverse problem, rather than the solution itself. Moreover, we are interested in computing uncertainty metrics associated with the QoI, thus utilizing a Bayesian approach for inverse problems that incorporates the prediction operator and techniques for exploring the posterior. This may be particularly challenging, especially for nonlinear, possibly unknown, operators and nonstandard prior assumptions. We harness recent advances in machine learning, i.e., VED networks, to describe a data-driven approach to large-scale inverse problems. This enables a real-time goal-oriented uncertainty quantification for the QoI. One of the advantages of our approach is that we avoid the need to solve challenging inversion problems by training a network to approximate the mapping from observations to QoI. Another main benefit is that we enable uncertainty quantification for the QoI by leveraging probability distributions in the latent space. This allows us to efficiently generate QoI samples and circumvent complicated or even unknown forward models and prediction operators. Numerical results from medical tomography reconstruction and nonlinear hydraulic tomography demonstrate the potential and broad applicability of the approach. ",

    "abstract": "Autism diagnosis presents a major challenge due to the vast heterogeneity of the condition and the elusive nature of early detection. Atypical gait and gesture patterns are dominant behavioral characteristics of autism and can provide crucial insights for diagnosis. Furthermore, these data can be collected efficiently in a non-intrusive way, facilitating early intervention to optimize positive outcomes. Existing research mainly focuses on associating facial and eye-gaze features with autism. However, very few studies have investigated movement and gesture patterns which can reveal subtle variations and characteristics that are specific to autism. To address this gap, we present an analysis of gesture and gait activity in videos to identify children with autism and quantify the severity of their condition by regressing autism diagnostic observation schedule scores. Our proposed architecture addresses two key factors: (1) an effective feature representation to manifest irregular gesture patterns and (2) a two-stream co-learning framework to enable a comprehensive understanding of its relation to autism from diverse perspectives without explicitly using additional data modality. Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of utilizing gesture and gait-activity videos for autism analysis. ",

    "abstract": "Robots are increasingly present in our lives, sharing the workspace and tasks with human co-workers. However, existing interfaces for human-robot interaction / cooperation (HRI/C) have limited levels of intuitiveness to use and safety is a major concern when humans and robots share the same workspace. Many times, this is due to the lack of a reliable estimation of the human pose in space which is the primary input to calculate the human-robot minimum distance (required for safety and collision avoidance) and HRI/C featuring machine learning algorithms classifying human behaviours / gestures. Each sensor type has its own characteristics resulting in problems such as occlusions (vision) and drift (inertial) when used in an isolated fashion. In this paper, it is proposed a combined system that merges the human tracking provided by a 3D vision sensor with the pose estimation provided by a set of inertial measurement units (IMUs) placed in human body limbs. The IMUs compensate the gaps in occluded areas to have tracking continuity. To mitigate the lingering effects of the IMU offset we propose a continuous online calculation of the offset value. Experimental tests were designed to simulate human motion in a human-robot collaborative environment where the robot moves away to avoid unexpected collisions with de human. Results indicate that our approach is able to capture the human\\textsc's position, for example the forearm, with a precision in the millimetre range and robustness to occlusions. ",

    "abstract": "Attacks against computer systems exploiting software vulnerabilities can cause substantial damage to the cyber-infrastructure of our modern society and economy. To minimize the consequences, it is vital to detect and fix vulnerabilities as soon as possible. Just-in-time vulnerability detection (JIT-VD) discovers vulnerability-prone (\"dangerous\") commits to prevent them from being merged into source code and causing vulnerabilities. By JIT-VD, the commits' authors, who understand the commits properly, can review these dangerous commits and fix them if necessary while the relevant modifications are still fresh in their minds. In this paper, we propose CodeJIT, a novel code-centric learning-based approach for just-in-time vulnerability detection. The key idea of CodeJIT is that the meaning of the code changes of a commit is the direct and deciding factor for determining if the commit is dangerous for the code. Based on that idea, we design a novel graph-based representation to represent the semantics of code changes in terms of both code structures and program dependencies. A graph neural network model is developed to capture the meaning of the code changes represented by our graph-based representation and learn to discriminate between dangerous and safe commits. We conducted experiments to evaluate the JIT-VD performance of CodeJIT on a dataset of 20K+ dangerous and safe commits in 506 real-world projects from 1998 to 2022. Our results show that CodeJIT significantly improves the state-of-the-art JIT-VD methods by up to 66% in Recall, 136% in Precision, and 68% in F1. Moreover, CodeJIT correctly classifies nearly 9/10 of dangerous/safe (benign) commits and even detects 69 commits that fix a vulnerability yet produce other issues in source code ",

These include the creation of hand-crafted networks and the use of quantization and pruning to reduce extraneous network parameters. However, with the potential of static solutions already well exploited, we propose to shift the focus to using the varying difficulty of individual data samples to further improve efficiency and reduce average compute for classification. Input-dependent computation allows for the network to make runtime decisions to finish a task early if the result meets a confidence threshold. Early-Exit network architectures have become an increasingly popular way to implement such behaviour in software. We create: A Toolflow for Hardware Early-Exit Network Automation (ATHEENA), an automated FPGA toolflow that leverages the probability of samples exiting early from such networks to scale the resources allocated to different sections of the network. The toolflow uses the data-flow model of fpgaConvNet, extended to support Early-Exit networks as well as Design Space Exploration to optimize the generated streaming architecture hardware with the goal of increasing throughput/reducing area while maintaining accuracy. Experimental results on three different networks demonstrate a throughput increase of $2.00\\times$ to $2.78\\times$ compared to an optimized baseline network implementation with no early exits. Additionally, the toolflow can achieve a throughput matching the same baseline with as low as $46\\%$ of the resources the baseline requires. ",

However, it is not easy to distinguish short video rumors due to the great amount of information and features contained in short videos, as well as the serious homogenization and similarity of features among videos. In order to mitigate the spread of short video rumors, our group decides to detect short video rumors by constructing multimodal feature fusion and introducing external knowledge after considering the advantages and disadvantages of each algorithm. The ideas of detection are as follows: (1) dataset creation: to build a short video dataset with multiple features; (2) multimodal rumor detection model: firstly, we use TSN (Temporal Segment Networks) video coding model to extract video features; then, we use OCR (Optical Character Recognition) and ASR (Automatic Character Recognition) to extract video features. Recognition) and ASR (Automatic Speech Recognition) fusion to extract text, and then use the BERT model to fuse text features with video features (3) Finally, use contrast learning to achieve distinction: first crawl external knowledge, then use the vector database to achieve the introduction of external knowledge and the final structure of the classification output. Our research process is always oriented to practical needs, and the related knowledge results will play an important role in many practical scenarios such as short video rumor identification and social opinion control.

Existing homogeneous dehazing methods struggle to handle the non-uniform distribution of haze in a robust manner. The crucial challenge of non-homogeneous dehazing is to effectively extract the non-uniform distribution features and reconstruct the details of hazy areas with high quality. In this paper, we propose a novel self-paced semi-curricular attention network, called SCANet, for non-homogeneous image dehazing that focuses on enhancing haze-occluded regions. Our approach consists of an attention generator network and a scene reconstruction network. We use the luminance differences of images to restrict the attention map and introduce a self-paced semi-curricular learning strategy to reduce learning ambiguity in the early stages of training. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that our SCANet outperforms many state-of-the-art methods. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/gy65896/SCANet. ",

    "abstract": "The performance of perception systems developed for autonomous driving vehicles has seen significant improvements over the last few years. This improvement was associated with the increasing use of LiDAR sensors and point cloud data to facilitate the task of object detection and recognition in autonomous driving. However, LiDAR and camera systems show deteriorating performances when used in unfavorable conditions like dusty and rainy weather. Radars on the other hand operate on relatively longer wavelengths which allows for much more robust measurements in these conditions. Despite that, radar-centric data sets do not get a lot of attention in the development of deep learning techniques for radar perception. In this work, we consider the radar object detection problem, in which the radar frequency data is the only input into the detection framework. We further investigate the challenges of using radar-only data in deep learning models. We propose a transformers-based model, named RadarFormer, that utilizes state-of-the-art developments in vision deep learning. Our model also introduces a channel-chirp-time merging module that reduces the size and complexity of our models by more than 10 times without compromising accuracy. Comprehensive experiments on the CRUW radar dataset demonstrate the advantages of the proposed method. Our RadarFormer performs favorably against the state-of-the-art methods while being 2x faster during inference and requiring only one-tenth of their model parameters.

    "abstract": "Streaming video clips with large-scale video tokens impede vision transformers (ViTs) for efficient recognition, especially in video action detection where sufficient spatiotemporal representations are required for precise actor identification. In this work, we propose an end-to-end framework for efficient video action detection (EVAD) based on vanilla ViTs. Our EVAD consists of two specialized designs for video action detection. First, we propose a spatiotemporal token dropout from a keyframe-centric perspective. In a video clip, we maintain all tokens from its keyframe, preserve tokens relevant to actor motions from other frames, and drop out the remaining tokens in this clip. Second, we refine scene context by leveraging remaining tokens for better recognizing actor identities. The region of interest (RoI) in our action detector is expanded into temporal domain. The captured spatiotemporal actor identity representations are refined via scene context in a decoder with the attention mechanism. These two designs make our EVAD efficient while maintaining accuracy, which is validated on three benchmark datasets (i.e., AVA, UCF101-24, JHMDB). Compared to the vanilla ViT backbone, our EVAD reduces the overall GFLOPs by 43% and improves real-time inference speed by 40% with no performance degradation. Moreover, even at similar computational costs, our EVAD can improve the performance by 1.0 mAP with higher resolution inputs. Code is available at https://github.com/MCG-NJU/EVAD. ",

Furthermore, in order to improve the secrecy without any knowledge of the channel state information (CSI) of the eavesdropper, a novel LED arrangement is introduced to reduce the overlapping area covered by LED units supporting different users. We also propose two LED operation strategies, called simple and smart LED linking, and evaluate their performance against the conventional broadcasting in terms of transmission sum rate and secrecy sum rate.

In this work, we first define two types of robustness to distribution shift on VLMs, namely, robustness on base classes (the classes included in the support set of prompts) and robustness on novel classes. Then, we study the robustness of existing in-context learning and prompt learning approaches, where we find that prompt learning performs robustly on test images from base classes, while it does not generalize well on images from novel classes. We propose robust prompt learning by integrating multiple-scale image features into the prompt, which improves both types of robustness.

Traditional offline HD maps, created through labor-intensive manual annotation processes, are both costly and incapable of accommodating timely updates. Recently, researchers have proposed inferring local maps based on online sensor observations; however, this approach is constrained by the sensor perception range and is susceptible to occlusions. In this work, we propose Neural Map Prior (NMP), a neural representation of global maps that facilitates automatic global map updates and improves local map inference performance. To incorporate the strong map prior into local map inference, we employ cross-attention that dynamically captures correlations between current features and prior features. For updating the global neural map prior, we use a learning-based fusion module to guide the network in fusing features from previous traversals. This design allows the network to capture a global neural map prior during sequential online map predictions. Experimental results on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate that our framework is highly compatible with various map segmentation and detection architectures and considerably strengthens map prediction performance, even under adverse weather conditions and across longer horizons. To the best of our knowledge, this represents the first learning-based system for constructing a global map prior. ",

With the increasing integration of the ICSs and information technology (IT) components, ensuring the security of ICSs is of paramount importance. Typically, a cyberattack in ICS aims to impose physical damage on the ICSs by exploiting a sequence of vulnerabilities that leads to compromising the system's sensors and/or controllers. Due to the physics of the ICSs operation, maliciously accessing different sensors or components may cause varying levels of risk. Therefore, identifying cyberattacks with the highest risks is essential for effectively designing detection schemes and mitigation strategies. In this paper, we develop an optimization-based holistic cybersecurity risk assessment framework by integrating the cyber and physical systems of ICSs to understand 1) the vulnerabilities of the ICS network with holistic consideration of cyber and physical components and their interactions, and 2) the attack strategies that can lead to significant physical damage to the critical assets in ICS. We formulate a novel optimization problem that accounts for the attacker's objective and limitation in both the physical and cyber systems of ICSs. This allows us to jointly model the interactions between the cyber and physical components and study the critical cyberattacks that cause the highest impact on the physical components under certain resource constraints. We verified the effectiveness of our proposed method in a numerical study, and the results show that a strategic attacker causes almost 19% further acceleration in the failure time of the physical system compared to a random attacker.

This extension from classical to quantum domain has been made possible due to the development of hybrid quantum-classical algorithms that allow a parameterized quantum circuit to be optimized using gradient based algorithms that run on a classical computer. The similarities in training of these hybrid algorithms and classical neural networks has further led to the development of Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs). However, in the current training regime for QNNs, the gradients w.r.t objective function have to be computed on the quantum device. This computation is highly non-scalable and is affected by hardware and sampling noise present in the current generation of quantum hardware. In this paper, we propose a training algorithm that does not rely on gradient information. Specifically, we introduce a novel meta-optimization algorithm that trains a \\emph{meta-optimizer} network to output parameters for the quantum circuit such that the objective function is minimized. We empirically and theoretically show that we achieve a better quality minima in fewer circuit evaluations than existing gradient based algorithms on different datasets. ",

    "abstract": "The modeling of opinion dynamics has seen much study in varying academic disciplines. Understanding the complex ways information can be disseminated is a complicated problem for mathematicians as well as social scientists. Inspired by the Cucker-Smale system of flocking dynamics, we present a nonlinear model of opinion dynamics that utilizes an environmental averaging protocol similar to the DeGroot and Freidkin-Johnsen models. Indeed, the way opinions evolve is complex and nonlinear effects ought to be considered when modelling. For this model, the nonlinearity destroys the translation invariance of the equations, as well as the convexity of the associated payout functions. The standard theory for well-posedness and convergence no longer applies and we must utilize the Brouwer topological degree and nonconvex analysis in order to achieve these results. Numerical simulations of the model reveal that the nonlinearity behaves similarly to the well-known Friedkin-Johnsen for so-called \"reasonable\" opinions, but better models the way agents that hold \"extreme\" opinions are more stubborn than their reasonable counterparts.

    "title": "Singleton Coalition Graph Chains",
    "abstract": "Let $G$ be graph with vertex set $V$ and order $n=|V|$. A coalition in $G$ is a combination of two distinct sets, $A\\subseteq V$ and $B\\subseteq V$, which are disjoint and are not dominating sets of $G$, but $A\\cup B$ is a dominating set of $G$. A coalition partition of $G$ is a partition $\\mathcal{P}=\\{S_1,\\ldots,S_k\\}$ of its vertex set $V$, where each set $S_i\\in \\mathcal{P}$ is either a dominating set of $G$ with only one vertex, or it is not a dominating set but forms a coalition with some other set $S_j \\in \\mathcal{P}$. The coalition number $C(G)$ is the maximum cardinality of a coalition partition of $G$. To represent a coalition partition $\\mathcal{P}$ of $G$, a coalition graph $\\CG(G, \\mathcal{P})$ is created, where each vertex of the graph corresponds to a member of $\\mathcal{P}$ and two vertices are adjacent if and only if their corresponding sets form a coalition in $G$. A coalition partition $\\mathcal{P}$ of $G$ is a singleton coalition partition if every set in $\\mathcal{P}$ consists of a single vertex. If a graph $G$ has a singleton coalition partition, then $G$ is referred to as a singleton-partition graph. A graph $H$ is called a singleton coalition graph of a graph $G$ if there exists a singleton coalition partition $\\mathcal{P}$ of $G$ such that the coalition graph $\\CG(G,\\mathcal{P})$ is isomorphic to $H$. A singleton coalition graph chain with an initial graph $G_1$ is defined as the sequence $G_1\\rightarrow G_2\\rightarrow G_3\\rightarrow\\cdots$ where all graphs $G_i$ are singleton-partition graphs, and $\\CG(G_i,\\Gamma_1)=G_{i+1}$, where $\\Gamma_1$ represents a singleton coalition partition of $G_i$. In this paper, we address two open problems posed by Haynes et al. We characterize all graphs $G$ of order $n$ and minimum degree $\\delta(G)=2$ such that $C(G)=n$ and investigate the singleton coalition graph chain starting with graphs $G$ where $\\delta(G)\\le 2$.

    "abstract": "As Industry 4.0 and digitalization continue to advance, the reliance on information technology increases, making the world more vulnerable to cyber-attacks, especially cyber-physical attacks that can manipulate physical systems and compromise operational data integrity. Detecting cyber-attacks in multistage manufacturing systems (MMS) is crucial due to the growing sophistication of attacks and the complexity of MMS. Attacks can propagate throughout the system, affecting subsequent stages and making detection more challenging than in single-stage systems. Localization is also critical due to the complex interactions in MMS. To address these challenges, a group lasso regression-based framework is proposed to detect and localize attacks in MMS. The proposed algorithm outperforms traditional hypothesis testing-based methods in expected detection delay and localization accuracy, as demonstrated in a linear multistage manufacturing system. ",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a learning-based detection framework for uplink massive multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) systems with one-bit analog-to-digital converters. The learning-based detection only requires counting the occurrences of the quantized outputs of -1 and +1 for estimating a likelihood probability at each antenna. Accordingly, the key advantage of this approach is to perform maximum likelihood detection without explicit channel estimation which has been one of the primary challenges of one-bit quantized systems. The learning in the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime, however, needs excessive training to estimate the extremely small likelihood probabilities. To address this drawback, we propose a dither-and-learning technique to estimate likelihood functions from dithered signals. First, we add a dithering signal to artificially decrease the SNR and then infer the likelihood function from the quantized dithered signals by using an SNR estimate derived from a deep neural network-based offline estimator. We extend our technique by developing an adaptive dither-and-learning method that updates the dithering power according the patterns observed in the quantized dithered signals. The proposed framework is also applied to state-of-the-art channel-coded MIMO systems by computing a bit-wise and user-wise log-likelihood ratio from the refined likelihood probabilities. Simulation results validate the detection performance of the proposed methods in both uncoded and coded systems. ",

    "abstract": "With nearly one million new cases diagnosed worldwide in 2020, head \\& neck cancer is a deadly and common malignity. There are challenges to decision making and treatment of such cancer, due to lesions in multiple locations and outcome variability between patients. Therefore, automated segmentation and prognosis estimation approaches can help ensure each patient gets the most effective treatment. This paper presents a framework to perform these functions on arbitrary field of view (FoV) PET and CT registered scans, thus approaching tasks 1 and 2 of the HECKTOR 2022 challenge as team \\texttt{VokCow}. The method consists of three stages: localization, segmentation and survival prediction. First, the scans with arbitrary FoV are cropped to the head and neck region and a u-shaped convolutional neural network (CNN) is trained to segment the region of interest. Then, using the obtained regions, another CNN is combined with a support vector machine classifier to obtain the semantic segmentation of the tumours, which results in an aggregated Dice score of 0.57 in task 1. Finally, survival prediction is approached with an ensemble of Weibull accelerated failure times model and deep learning methods. In addition to patient health record data, we explore whether processing graphs of image patches centred at the tumours via graph convolutions can improve the prognostic predictions. A concordance index of 0.64 was achieved in the test set, ranking 6th in the challenge leaderboard for this task. ",

For this, several time- and frequency-domain features have been proposed already in the past. However, these features are usually evaluated on data originating from relatively simple scenarios and a significant performance loss can be observed if more realistic scenarios are considered. To overcome this, we introduce Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) and features extracted from the Amplitude Modulation Spectrogram (AMS) as features for the detection of bearing faults. Both AMS and MFCCs were originally introduced in the context of audio signal processing but it is demonstrated that a significantly improved classification performance can be obtained by using these features. Furthermore, to tackle the characteristic data imbalance problem in the context of bearing fault detection, i.e., typically much more data from healthy bearings than from damaged bearings is available, we propose to train a One-class \\ac{SVM} with data from healthy bearings only. Bearing faults are then classified by the detection of outliers. Our approach is evaluated with data measured in a highly challenging scenario comprising a state-of-the-art commuter railway engine which is supplied by an industrial power converter and coupled to a load machine.

This research introduces a lightweight graph representation learning scheme that efficiently analyzes the microenvironment of wild-type proteins and recommends practical higher-order mutations exclusive to the user-specified protein and function of interest. Our method enables continuous improvement of the inference model by limited computational resources and a few hundred mutational training samples, resulting in accurate prediction of variant effects that exhibit near-perfect correlation with the ground truth across deep mutational scanning assays of 19 proteins. With its affordability and applicability to both computer scientists and biochemical laboratories, our solution offers a wide range of benefits that make it an ideal choice for the community. ",

Most current earthquake detection methods are designed for moderate and large events and, consequently, they tend to miss many of the low-magnitude earthquake that are masked by the seismic noise.

    "abstract": "Knee OsteoArthritis (KOA) is a prevalent musculoskeletal disorder that causes decreased mobility in seniors. The lack of sufficient data in the medical field is always a challenge for training a learning model due to the high cost of labelling. At present, deep neural network training strongly depends on data augmentation to improve the model's generalization capability and avoid over-fitting. However, existing data augmentation operations, such as rotation, gamma correction, etc., are designed based on the data itself, which does not substantially increase the data diversity. In this paper, we proposed a novel approach based on the Vision Transformer (ViT) model with Selective Shuffled Position Embedding (SSPE) and a ROI-exchange strategy to obtain different input sequences as a method of data augmentation for early detection of KOA (KL-0 vs KL-2). More specifically, we fixed and shuffled the position embedding of ROI and non-ROI patches, respectively. Then, for the input image, we randomly selected other images from the training set to exchange their ROI patches and thus obtained different input sequences. Finally, a hybrid loss function was derived using different loss functions with optimized weights. Experimental results show that our proposed approach is a valid method of data augmentation as it can significantly improve the model's classification performance. ",

Here, we explore the potential of graph convolutional networks to learn patterns among networked criminals and to predict various properties of criminal networks. Using empirical data from political corruption, criminal police intelligence, and criminal financial networks, we develop a series of deep learning models based on the GraphSAGE framework that are capable to recover missing criminal partnerships, distinguish among types of associations, predict the amount of money exchanged among criminal agents, and even anticipate partnerships and recidivism of criminals during the growth dynamics of corruption networks, all with impressive accuracy. Our deep learning models significantly outperform previous shallow learning approaches and produce high-quality embeddings for node and edge properties. Moreover, these models inherit all the advantages of the GraphSAGE framework, including the generalization to unseen nodes and scaling up to large graph structures. ",
