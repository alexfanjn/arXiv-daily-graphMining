    "abstract": "Cybersecurity has emerged as a critical challenge for the industry. With the large complexity of the security landscape, sophisticated and costly deep learning models often fail to provide timely detection of cyber threats on edge devices. Brain-inspired hyperdimensional computing (HDC) has been introduced as a promising solution to address this issue. However, existing HDC approaches use static encoders and require very high dimensionality and hundreds of training iterations to achieve reasonable accuracy. This results in a serious loss of learning efficiency and causes huge latency for detecting attacks. In this paper, we propose CyberHD, an innovative HDC learning framework that identifies and regenerates insignificant dimensions to capture complicated patterns of cyber threats with remarkably lower dimensionality. Additionally, the holographic distribution of patterns in high dimensional space provides CyberHD with notably high robustness against hardware errors. ",

There are considerable differences in the complexity of synapses, the processing of information, and the learning mechanisms in biological neural networks and their artificial counterparts, which may explain the mismatch in performance. We consider a biologically plausible framework that constitutes separate populations of exclusively excitatory and inhibitory neurons that adhere to Dale's principle, and the excitatory pyramidal neurons are augmented with dendritic-like structures for context-dependent processing of stimuli. We then conduct a comprehensive study on the role and interactions of different mechanisms inspired by the brain, including sparse non-overlapping representations, Hebbian learning, synaptic consolidation, and replay of past activations that accompanied the learning event. Our study suggests that the employing of multiple complementary mechanisms in a biologically plausible architecture, similar to the brain, may be effective in enabling continual learning in ANNs. ",

To integrate large populations of EVs into electricity market operations, aggregators must express the aggregate flexibility of the EVs under their control in the form of a small number of energy storage (battery) resources that accurately capture the supply/demand capabilities of the individual EVs as a collective. To this end, we propose a novel multi-battery flexibility model defined as a linear combination of a small number of base sets (termed batteries) that reflect the differing geometric shapes of the individual EV flexibility sets, and suggest a clustering approach to identify these base sets. We study the problem of computing a multi-battery flexibility set that has minimum Hausdorff distance to the aggregate flexibility set, subject to the constraint that the multi-battery flexibility set be a subset of the aggregate flexibility set. We show how to conservatively approximate this problem with a tractable convex program, and illustrate the performance achievable by our method with several numerical experiments. ",

    "abstract": "The decision tree ensembles use a single data feature at each node for splitting the data. However, splitting in this manner may fail to capture the geometric properties of the data. Thus, oblique decision trees generate the oblique hyperplane for splitting the data at each non-leaf node. Oblique decision trees capture the geometric properties of the data and hence, show better generalization. The performance of the oblique decision trees depends on the way oblique hyperplanes are generate and the data used for the generation of those hyperplanes. Recently, multiple classifiers have been used in a heterogeneous random forest (RaF) classifier, however, it fails to generate the trees of proper depth. Moreover, double RaF studies highlighted that larger trees can be generated via bootstrapping the data at each non-leaf node and splitting the original data instead of the bootstrapped data recently. The study of heterogeneous RaF lacks the generation of larger trees while as the double RaF based model fails to take over the geometric characteristics of the data. To address these shortcomings, we propose heterogeneous oblique double RaF. The proposed model employs several linear classifiers at each non-leaf node on the bootstrapped data and splits the original data based on the optimal linear classifier. The optimal hyperplane corresponds to the models based on the optimized impurity criterion. The experimental analysis indicates that the performance of the introduced heterogeneous double random forest is comparatively better than the baseline models. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed heterogeneous double random forest, we used it for the diagnosis of Schizophrenia disease. The proposed model predicted the disease more accurately compared to the baseline models. ",

This is due to the increasing number of smart devices that require sensory processing for their application on the edge. To tackle this problem, we present a smart vision sensor System on Chip (Soc), featuring an event-based camera and a low power asynchronous spiking Convolutional Neuronal Network (sCNN) computing architecture embedded on a single chip. By combining both sensor and processing on a single die, we can lower unit production costs significantly. Moreover, the simple end-to-end nature of the SoC facilitates small stand-alone applications as well as functioning as an edge node in a larger systems. The event-driven nature of the vision sensor delivers high-speed signals in a sparse data stream. This is reflected in the processing pipeline, focuses on optimising highly sparse computation and minimising latency for 9 sCNN layers to $3.36\\mu s$. Overall, this results in an extremely low-latency visual processing pipeline deployed on a small form factor with a low energy budget and sensor cost. We present the asynchronous architecture, the individual blocks, the sCNN processing principle and benchmark against other sCNN capable processors. ",

However, this multimodal task is particularly challenging due to the different nature of these data: WSIs represent a very high-dimensional spatial description of a tumor, while bulk transcriptomics represent a global description of gene expression levels within that tumor. In this context, our work aims to address two key challenges: (1) how can we tokenize transcriptomics in a semantically meaningful and interpretable way?, and (2) how can we capture dense multimodal interactions between these two modalities? Specifically, we propose to learn biological pathway tokens from transcriptomics that can encode specific cellular functions. Together with histology patch tokens that encode the different morphological patterns in the WSI, we argue that they form appropriate reasoning units for downstream interpretability analyses. We propose fusing both modalities using a memory-efficient multimodal Transformer that can model interactions between pathway and histology patch tokens. Our proposed model, SURVPATH, achieves state-of-the-art performance when evaluated against both unimodal and multimodal baselines on five datasets from The Cancer Genome Atlas. Our interpretability framework identifies key multimodal prognostic factors, and, as such, can provide valuable insights into the interaction between genotype and phenotype, enabling a deeper understanding of the underlying biological mechanisms at play.

However, hardware deployment of DGNNs still remains a challenge. First, DGNNs do not fully utilize hardware resources because temporal data dependencies cause low hardware parallelism. Additionally, there is currently a lack of generic DGNN hardware accelerator frameworks, and existing GNN accelerator frameworks have limited ability to handle dynamic graphs with changing topologies and node features. To address the aforementioned challenges, in this paper, we propose DGNN-Booster, which is a novel Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) accelerator framework for real-time DGNN inference using High-Level Synthesis (HLS). It includes two different FPGA accelerator designs with different dataflows that can support the most widely used DGNNs. We showcase the effectiveness of our designs by implementing and evaluating two representative DGNN models on ZCU102 board and measuring the end-to-end performance. The experiment results demonstrate that DGNN-Booster can achieve a speedup of up to 5.6x compared to the CPU baseline (6226R), 8.4x compared to the GPU baseline (A6000) and 2.1x compared to the FPGA baseline without applying optimizations proposed in this paper. Moreover, DGNN-Booster can achieve over 100x and over 1000x runtime energy efficiency than the CPU and GPU baseline respectively.

In this work, we investigate the effectiveness of structured pruning on multi-task models. We use an existing single-task filter pruning criterion and also introduce an MTL-based filter pruning criterion for estimating the filter importance scores. We prune the model using an iterative pruning strategy with both pruning methods. We show that, with careful hyper-parameter tuning, architectures obtained from different pruning methods do not have significant differences in their performances across tasks when the number of parameters is similar. We also show that iterative structure pruning may not be the best way to achieve a well-performing pruned model because, at extreme pruning levels, there is a high drop in performance across all tasks. But when the same models are randomly initialized and re-trained, they show better results. ",

Three recent models ( ELECTRA, DeBERTa, and DistilBERT) are chosen and evaluated against two bias benchmarks, StereoSet and CrowS-Pairs. They are compared to the baseline of BERT using the associated metrics. We explore whether as advancements are made and newer, faster, lighter models are released: are they being developed responsibly such that their inherent social biases have been reduced compared to their older counterparts?

Satellites such as Sentinel-2 feature characteristics that are favorable for super-resolution algorithms such as aliasing and band-misalignment.

In this work we propose L1BSR, a deep learning-based method for single-image super-resolution and band alignment of Sentinel-2 L1B 10m bands. The method is trained with self-supervision directly on real L1B data by leveraging overlapping areas in L1B images produced by adjacent CMOS detectors, thus not requiring HR ground truth. Our self-supervised loss is designed to enforce the super-resolved output image to have all the bands correctly aligned. This is achieved via a novel cross-spectral registration network (CSR) which computes an optical flow between images of different spectral bands. The CSR network is also trained with self-supervision using an Anchor-Consistency loss, which we also introduce in this work. We demonstrate the performance of the proposed approach on synthetic and real L1B data, where we show that it obtains comparable results to supervised methods. ",

A possible solution is to establish a generic system that directly predicts some metrics for large models solely based on the results and hyperparameters from small models. Existing methods based on scaling laws require hyperparameter search on the largest models, which is impractical with limited resources. We address this issue by presenting our discoveries indicating that Maximal Update parametrization (muP) enables accurate fitting of scaling laws for hyperparameters close to common loss basins, without any search. Thus, different models can be directly compared on large scales with loss prediction even before the training starts. We propose a new paradigm as a first step towards reliable academic research for any model scale without heavy computation. Code will be publicly available shortly. ",

We focus on finding classifiers that are performatively stable, i.e. optimal for the data distribution they induce. Standard convergence results for finding a performatively stable classifier with the method of repeated risk minimization assume that the data distribution is Lipschitz continuous to the model's parameters. Under this assumption, the loss must be strongly convex and smooth in these parameters; otherwise, the method will diverge for some problems. In this work, we instead assume that the data distribution is Lipschitz continuous with respect to the model's predictions, a more natural assumption for performative systems. As a result, we are able to significantly relax the assumptions on the loss function. In particular, we do not need to assume convexity with respect to the model's parameters. As an illustration, we introduce a resampling procedure that models realistic distribution shifts and show that it satisfies our assumptions. We support our theory by showing that one can learn performatively stable classifiers with neural networks making predictions about real data that shift according to our proposed procedure. ",

Our results demonstrated that PFs consistently outperformed SFs in terms of cumulative reward and average step length, with higher resilience to noise. This superiority could be due to PFs' ability to transmit temporal difference errors to more preceding states. We also discuss the biological mechanisms involved in PFs learning for spatial navigation. This study contributes to the theoretical research on computational neuroscience using reinforcement learning algorithms, and highlights the practical potential of PFs in robotics, game AI, and autonomous vehicle navigation.

    "abstract": "Neuromorphic computing and spiking neural networks aim to leverage biological inspiration to achieve greater energy efficiency and computational power beyond traditional von Neumann architectured machines. In particular, spiking neural networks hold the potential to advance artificial intelligence as the basis of third-generation neural networks. Aided by developments in memristive and compute-in-memory technologies, neuromorphic computing hardware is transitioning from laboratory prototype devices to commercial chipsets; ushering in an era of low-power computing. As a nexus of biological, computing, and material sciences, the literature surrounding these concepts is vast, varied, and somewhat distinct from artificial neural network sources. This article uses bibliometric analysis to survey the last 22 years of literature, seeking to establish trends in publication and citation volumes (III-A); analyze impactful authors, journals and institutions (III-B); generate an introductory reading list (III-C); survey collaborations between countries, institutes and authors (III-D), and to analyze changes in research topics over the years (III-E). We analyze literature data from the Clarivate Web of Science using standard bibliometric methods. By briefly introducing the most impactful literature in this field from the last two decades, we encourage AI practitioners and researchers to look beyond contemporary technologies toward a potentially spiking future of computing.

    "abstract": "Deep neural networks (DNNs) have been shown to be vulnerable to adversarial examples. Moreover, the transferability of the adversarial examples has received broad attention in recent years, which means that adversarial examples crafted by a surrogate model can also attack unknown models. This phenomenon gave birth to the transfer-based adversarial attacks, which aim to improve the transferability of the generated adversarial examples. In this paper, we propose to improve the transferability of adversarial examples in the transfer-based attack via masking unimportant parameters (MUP). The key idea in MUP is to refine the pretrained surrogate models to boost the transfer-based attack. Based on this idea, a Taylor expansion-based metric is used to evaluate the parameter importance score and the unimportant parameters are masked during the generation of adversarial examples. This process is simple, yet can be naturally combined with various existing gradient-based optimizers for generating adversarial examples, thus further improving the transferability of the generated adversarial examples. Extensive experiments are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed MUP-based methods. ",

Unlike MAEs used in the image domain, where the pretext task is to restore features at the masked pixels, such as colors, the existing 3D MAE works reconstruct the missing geometry only, i.e, the location of the masked points. In contrast to previous studies, we advocate that point location recovery is inessential and restoring intrinsic point features is much superior. To this end, we propose to ignore point position reconstruction and recover high-order features at masked points including surface normals and surface variations, through a novel attention-based decoder which is independent of the encoder design. We validate the effectiveness of our pretext task and decoder design using different encoder structures for 3D training and demonstrate the advantages of our pretrained networks on various point cloud analysis tasks.

    "abstract": "While having achieved great success in rich real-life applications, deep neural network (DNN) models have long been criticized for their vulnerability to adversarial attacks. Tremendous research efforts have been dedicated to mitigating the threats of adversarial attacks, but the essential trait of adversarial examples is not yet clear, and most existing methods are yet vulnerable to hybrid attacks and suffer from counterattacks. In light of this, in this paper, we first reveal a gradient-based correlation between sensitivity analysis-based DNN interpreters and the generation process of adversarial examples, which indicates the Achilles's heel of adversarial attacks and sheds light on linking together the two long-standing challenges of DNN: fragility and unexplainability. We then propose an interpreter-based ensemble framework called X-Ensemble for robust adversary defense. X-Ensemble adopts a novel detection-rectification process and features in building multiple sub-detectors and a rectifier upon various types of interpretation information toward target classifiers. Moreover, X-Ensemble employs the Random Forests (RF) model to combine sub-detectors into an ensemble detector for adversarial hybrid attacks defense. The non-differentiable property of RF further makes it a precious choice against the counterattack of adversaries. Extensive experiments under various types of state-of-the-art attacks and diverse attack scenarios demonstrate the advantages of X-Ensemble to competitive baseline methods. ",

    "abstract": "Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), specifically drones equipped with remote sensing object detection technology, have rapidly gained a broad spectrum of applications and emerged as one of the primary research focuses in the field of computer vision. Although UAV remote sensing systems have the ability to detect various objects, small-scale objects can be challenging to detect reliably due to factors such as object size, image degradation, and real-time limitations. To tackle these issues, a real-time object detection algorithm (YOLO-Drone) is proposed and applied to two new UAV platforms as well as a specific light source (silicon-based golden LED). YOLO-Drone presents several novelties: 1) including a new backbone Darknet59; 2) a new complex feature aggregation module MSPP-FPN that incorporated one spatial pyramid pooling and three atrous spatial pyramid pooling modules; 3) and the use of Generalized Intersection over Union (GIoU) as the loss function. To evaluate performance, two benchmark datasets, UAVDT and VisDrone, along with one homemade dataset acquired at night under silicon-based golden LEDs, are utilized. The experimental results show that, in both UAVDT and VisDrone, the proposed YOLO-Drone outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) object detection methods by improving the mAP of 10.13% and 8.59%, respectively. With regards to UAVDT, the YOLO-Drone exhibits both high real-time inference speed of 53 FPS and a maximum mAP of 34.04%. Notably, YOLO-Drone achieves high performance under the silicon-based golden LEDs, with a mAP of up to 87.71%, surpassing the performance of YOLO series under ordinary light sources. To conclude, the proposed YOLO-Drone is a highly effective solution for object detection in UAV applications, particularly for night detection tasks where silicon-based golden light LED technology exhibits significant superiority.

    "abstract": "Scene Dynamic Recovery (SDR) by inverting distorted Rolling Shutter (RS) images to an undistorted high frame-rate Global Shutter (GS) video is a severely ill-posed problem, particularly when prior knowledge about camera/object motions is unavailable. Commonly used artificial assumptions on motion linearity and data-specific characteristics, regarding the temporal dynamics information embedded in the RS scanlines, are prone to producing sub-optimal solutions in real-world scenarios. To address this challenge, we propose an event-based RS2GS framework within a self-supervised learning paradigm that leverages the extremely high temporal resolution of event cameras to provide accurate inter/intra-frame information. % In this paper, we propose to leverage the event camera to provide inter/intra-frame information as the emitted events have an extremely high temporal resolution and learn an event-based RS2GS network within a self-supervised learning framework, where real-world events and RS images can be exploited to alleviate the performance degradation caused by the domain gap between the synthesized and real data. Specifically, an Event-based Inter/intra-frame Compensator (E-IC) is proposed to predict the per-pixel dynamic between arbitrary time intervals, including the temporal transition and spatial translation. Exploring connections in terms of RS-RS, RS-GS, and GS-RS, we explicitly formulate mutual constraints with the proposed E-IC, resulting in supervisions without ground-truth GS images. Extensive evaluations over synthetic and real datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art and shows remarkable performance for event-based RS2GS inversion in real-world scenarios.

In recent years, state-of-the-art reconstruction methods have been developed based on recent advances in deep learning. Especially for highly underdetermined problems, maintaining data consistency is a key goal. This can be achieved either by iterative network architectures or by a subsequent projection of the network reconstruction. However, for such approaches to be used in safety-critical domains such as medical imaging, the network reconstruction should not only provide the user with a reconstructed image, but also with some level of confidence in the reconstruction. In order to meet these two key requirements, this paper combines deep null-space networks with uncertainty quantification. Evaluation of the proposed method includes image reconstruction from undersampled Radon measurements on a toy CT dataset and accelerated MRI reconstruction on the fastMRI dataset. This work is the first approach to solving inverse problems that additionally models data-dependent uncertainty by estimating an input-dependent scale map, providing a robust assessment of reconstruction quality.

Despite the fact that many existing studies optimize the performance of GDRWs on multi-core CPUs, massive random memory accesses and costly synchronizations cause severe resource underutilization, and the processing of GDRWs is usually the key performance bottleneck in many graph applications. This paper studies an alternative architecture, FPGA, to address these issues in GDRWs, as FPGA has the ability of hardware customization so that we are able to explore fine-grained pipeline execution and specialized memory access optimizations. Specifically, we propose {LightRW}, a novel FPGA-based accelerator for GDRWs. LightRW embraces a series of optimizations to enable fine-grained pipeline execution on the chip and to exploit the massive parallelism of FPGA while significantly reducing memory accesses. As current commonly used sampling methods in GDRWs do not efficiently support fine-grained pipeline execution, we develop a parallelized reservoir sampling method to sample multiple vertices per cycle for efficient pipeline execution. To address the random memory access issues, we propose a degree-aware configurable caching method that buffers hot vertices on-chip to alleviate random memory accesses and a dynamic burst access engine that efficiently retrieves neighbors. Experimental results show that our optimization techniques are able to improve the performance of GDRWs on FPGA significantly. Moreover, LightRW delivers up to 9.55x and 9.10x speedup over the state-of-the-art CPU-based MetaPath and Node2vec random walks, respectively.

Nonetheless, most of the existing GCN-based models suffer from the notorious over-smoothing issue, owing to which shallow networks are extensively adopted. This may be problematic for complex graph datasets because a deeper GCN should be beneficial to propagating information across remote neighbors. Recent works have devoted effort to addressing over-smoothing problems, including establishing residual connection structure or fusing predictions from multi-layer models. Because of the indistinguishable embeddings from deep layers, it is reasonable to generate more reliable predictions before conducting the combination of outputs from various layers. In light of this, we propose an Alternating Graph-regularized Neural Network (AGNN) composed of Graph Convolutional Layer (GCL) and Graph Embedding Layer (GEL). GEL is derived from the graph-regularized optimization containing Laplacian embedding term, which can alleviate the over-smoothing problem by periodic projection from the low-order feature space onto the high-order space. With more distinguishable features of distinct layers, an improved Adaboost strategy is utilized to aggregate outputs from each layer, which explores integrated embeddings of multi-hop neighbors. The proposed model is evaluated via a large number of experiments including performance comparison with some multi-layer or multi-order graph neural networks, which reveals the superior performance improvement of AGNN compared with state-of-the-art models.

However, the labels in training dataset are unordered. We propose to treat it as a direct set prediction problem and don't need to consider the order of labels. Besides, in order to model the correlation between labels, the adjacency matrix is constructed through the statistical relations between labels and GCN is employed to learn the label information. Based on the learned label information, the set prediction networks can both utilize the sentence information and label information for multi-label text classification simultaneously. Furthermore, the Bhattacharyya distance is imposed on the output probability distributions of the set prediction networks to increase the recall ability. Experimental results on four multi-label datasets show the effectiveness of the proposed method and it outperforms previous method a substantial margin. ",

    "abstract": "Sequential recommendation aims at understanding user preference by capturing successive behavior correlations, which are usually represented as the item purchasing sequences based on their past interactions. Existing efforts generally predict the next item via modeling the sequential patterns. Despite effectiveness, there exist two natural deficiencies: (i) user preference is dynamic in nature, and the evolution of collaborative signals is often ignored; and (ii) the observed interactions are often irregularly-sampled, while existing methods model item transitions assuming uniform intervals. Thus, how to effectively model and predict the underlying dynamics for user preference becomes a critical research problem. To tackle the above challenges, in this paper, we focus on continuous-time sequential recommendation and propose a principled graph ordinary differential equation framework named GDERec. Technically, GDERec is characterized by an autoregressive graph ordinary differential equation consisting of two components, which are parameterized by two tailored graph neural networks (GNNs) respectively to capture user preference from the perspective of hybrid dynamical systems. The two customized GNNs are trained alternately in an autoregressive manner to track the evolution of the underlying system from irregular observations, and thus learn effective representations of users and items beneficial to the sequential recommendation. Extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of our model over various state-of-the-art recommendation methods. ",

Though there has been much research following the same methodology, it lacks a systematic inspection from the standpoint of logic. In this paper, we characterize the scope of queries investigated previously and precisely identify the gap between it and the whole family of existential formulas.

Overcoming less suitable local minima is an important prerequisite and often momentum methods are employed to achieve this. As in other non local optimization procedures, this however creates the necessity to balance between exploration and exploitation. In this work, we suggest an event based control mechanism for switching from exploration to exploitation based on reaching a predefined reduction of the loss function. As we give the momentum method a port Hamiltonian interpretation, we apply the 'heavy ball with friction' interpretation and trigger breaking (or friction) when achieving certain goals. We benchmark our method against standard stochastic gradient descent and provide experimental evidence for improved performance of deep neural networks when our strategy is applied. ",

Current transformer-based approaches tackle this challenging problem in a two-stage manner, which detect corners in the first model and classify the proposed edges (corner-pairs) in the second model. However, they separate two-stage into different models and only share the backbone encoder. Unlike the existing modeling strategies, we present an enhanced corner representation method: 1) It fuses knowledge between the corner detection and edge prediction by sharing feature in different granularity; 2) Corner candidates are proposed in four heatmap channels w.r.t its direction. Both qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrate that our proposed method can better reconstruct fine-grained structures, such as adjacent corners and tiny edges. Consequently, it outperforms the state-of-the-art model by +1.9\\%@F-1 on Corner and +3.0\\%@F-1 on Edge. ",

Therefore, an improvement of energy efficiency in the traffic sector is crucial to reducing the carbon footprint. Efficiency is typically measured in terms of energy use per traveled distance, e.g. liters of fuel per kilometer. Leading factors that impact the energy efficiency are the type of vehicle, environment, driver behavior, and weather conditions. These varying factors introduce uncertainty in estimating the vehicles' energy efficiency. We propose in this paper an ensemble learning approach based on deep neural networks (ENN) that is designed to reduce the predictive uncertainty and to output measures of such uncertainty. We evaluated it using the publicly available Vehicle Energy Dataset (VED) and compared it with several baselines per vehicle and energy type. The results showed a high predictive performance and they allowed to output a measure of predictive uncertainty. ",

This paper presents Chop Chop, a Byzantine Atomic Broadcast system that amortizes the cost of ordering, authenticating and deduplicating messages, achieving \"line rate\" (i.e., closely matching the complexity of a protocol that does not ensure any ordering, authentication or Byzantine resilience) even when processing messages as small as 8 bytes. Chop Chop attains this performance by means of a new form of batching we call distillation. A distilled batch is a set of messages that are fast to authenticate and deduplicate, as well as order. Batches are distilled using a novel interactive mechanism involving brokers, an untrusted layer of facilitating processes between clients and servers. In a geo-distributed deployment of 64 medium-sized servers, with clients situated cross-cloud, Chop Chop processes 43,600,000 messages per second with an average latency of 3.6 seconds. Under the same conditions, state-of-the-art alternatives offer two orders of magnitude less throughput for the same latency. We showcase three simple Chop Chop applications: a Payment system, an Auction house and a \"Pixel war\" game, respectively achieving 32, 2.3 and 35 million operations per second. ",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a DETR-based method for cross-domain weakly supervised object detection (CDWSOD), aiming at adapting the detector from source to target domain through weak supervision. We think DETR has strong potential for CDWSOD due to an insight: the encoder and the decoder in DETR are both based on the attention mechanism and are thus capable of aggregating semantics across the entire image. The aggregation results, i.e., image-level predictions, can naturally exploit the weak supervision for domain alignment. Such motivated, we propose DETR with additional Global Aggregation (DETR-GA), a CDWSOD detector that simultaneously makes \"instance-level + image-level\" predictions and utilizes \"strong + weak\" supervisions. The key point of DETR-GA is very simple: for the encoder / decoder, we respectively add multiple class queries / a foreground query to aggregate the semantics into image-level predictions. Our query-based aggregation has two advantages. First, in the encoder, the weakly-supervised class queries are capable of roughly locating the corresponding positions and excluding the distraction from non-relevant regions. Second, through our design, the object queries and the foreground query in the decoder share consensus on the class semantics, therefore making the strong and weak supervision mutually benefit each other for domain alignment. Extensive experiments on four popular cross-domain benchmarks show that DETR-GA significantly improves CSWSOD and advances the states of the art (e.g., 29.0% --> 79.4% mAP on PASCAL VOC --> Clipart_all dataset).

    "abstract": "Explainability in yield prediction helps us fully explore the potential of machine learning models that are already able to achieve high accuracy for a variety of yield prediction scenarios. The data included for the prediction of yields are intricate and the models are often difficult to understand. However, understanding the models can be simplified by using natural groupings of the input features. Grouping can be achieved, for example, by the time the features are captured or by the sensor used to do so. The state-of-the-art for interpreting machine learning models is currently defined by the game-theoretic approach of Shapley values. To handle groups of features, the calculated Shapley values are typically added together, ignoring the theoretical limitations of this approach. We explain the concept of Shapley values directly computed for predefined groups of features and introduce an algorithm to compute them efficiently on tree structures. We provide a blueprint for designing swarm plots that combine many local explanations for global understanding. Extensive evaluation of two different yield prediction problems shows the worth of our approach and demonstrates how we can enable a better understanding of yield prediction models in the future, ultimately leading to mutual enrichment of research and application.

The PJITD assignments problem is formulated as a spatio-temporal multi-task assignment (STMTA) problem. The physical constraints on the map and vehicle dynamics are incorporated in the cost formulation. The linear sum assignment problem is formulated for the heterogeneous STMTA problem. The recently proposed Dynamic Resource Allocation with Multi-task assignments (DREAM) approach has been modified to solve the heterogeneous PJITD problem. At the start, it computes the minimum number of robots required (with their types) to execute given heterogeneous PJITD tasks. These required robots are added to the team to guarantee the feasibility of all PJITD tasks. Then robots in an updated team are assigned to execute the PJITD tasks while minimizing the total cost for the team to execute all PJITD tasks. The performance of the proposed non-iterative approach has been validated using high-fidelity software-in-loop simulations and hardware experiments. The simulations and experimental results clearly indicate that the proposed approach is scalable and provides optimal resource utilization. ",

    "abstract": "Behavioral data generated by users' devices, ranging from emoji use to pages visited, are collected at scale to improve apps and services. These data, however, contain fine-grained records and can reveal sensitive information about individual users. Local differential privacy has been used by companies as a solution to collect data from users while preserving privacy. We here first introduce pool inference attacks, where an adversary has access to a user's obfuscated data, defines pools of objects, and exploits the user's polarized behavior in multiple data collections to infer the user's preferred pool. Second, we instantiate this attack against Count Mean Sketch, a local differential privacy mechanism proposed by Apple and deployed in iOS and Mac OS devices, using a Bayesian model. Using Apple's parameters for the privacy loss $\\varepsilon$, we then consider two specific attacks: one in the emojis setting -- where an adversary aims at inferring a user's preferred skin tone for emojis -- and one against visited websites -- where an adversary wants to learn the political orientation of a user from the news websites they visit. In both cases, we show the attack to be much more effective than a random guess when the adversary collects enough data. We find that users with high polarization and relevant interest are significantly more vulnerable, and we show that our attack is well-calibrated, allowing the adversary to target such vulnerable users. We finally validate our results for the emojis setting using user data from Twitter. Taken together, our results show that pool inference attacks are a concern for data protected by local differential privacy mechanisms with a large $\\varepsilon$, emphasizing the need for additional technical safeguards and the need for more research on how to apply local differential privacy for multiple collections.

Deep neural network (DNN) models have attained the best performance on many speech separation benchmarks. Some of these models can take significant time to train and have high memory requirements. Previous work has proposed shortening training examples to address these issues but the impact of this on model performance is not yet well understood. In this work, the impact of applying these training signal length (TSL) limits is analysed for two speech separation models: SepFormer, a transformer model, and Conv-TasNet, a convolutional model. The WJS0-2Mix, WHAMR and Libri2Mix datasets are analysed in terms of signal length distribution and its impact on training efficiency. It is demonstrated that, for specific distributions, applying specific TSL limits results in better performance. This is shown to be mainly due to randomly sampling the start index of the waveforms resulting in more unique examples for training. A SepFormer model trained using a TSL limit of 4.42s and dynamic mixing (DM) is shown to match the best-performing SepFormer model trained with DM and unlimited signal lengths. Furthermore, the 4.42s TSL limit results in a 44% reduction in training time with WHAMR. ",

Repeat measurements of these data allow for the observation of deforestation or degradation of existing forests, natural forest regeneration, and the implementation of sustainable agricultural practices like agroforestry. Assessments of tree canopy height and crown projected area at a high spatial resolution are also important for monitoring carbon fluxes and assessing tree-based land uses, since forest structures can be highly spatially heterogeneous, especially in agroforestry systems. Very high resolution satellite imagery (less than one meter (1m) ground sample distance) makes it possible to extract information at the tree level while allowing monitoring at a very large scale. This paper presents the first high-resolution canopy height map concurrently produced for multiple sub-national jurisdictions. Specifically, we produce canopy height maps for the states of California and S\\~{a}o Paolo, at sub-meter resolution, a significant improvement over the ten meter (10m) resolution of previous Sentinel / GEDI based worldwide maps of canopy height. The maps are generated by applying a vision transformer to features extracted from a self-supervised model in Maxar imagery from 2017 to 2020, and are trained against aerial lidar and GEDI observations. We evaluate the proposed maps with set-aside validation lidar data as well as by comparing with other remotely sensed maps and field-collected data, and find our model produces an average Mean Absolute Error (MAE) within set-aside validation areas of 3.0 meters.

    "abstract": "Over the last few years, we have not seen any major developments in model-free or model-based learning methods that would make one obsolete relative to the other. In most cases, the used technique is heavily dependent on the use case scenario or other attributes, e.g. the environment. Both approaches have their own advantages, for example, sample efficiency or computational efficiency. However, when combining the two, the advantages of each can be combined and hence achieve better performance. The TD-MPC framework is an example of this approach. On the one hand, a world model in combination with model predictive control is used to get a good initial estimate of the value function. On the other hand, a Q function is used to provide a good long-term estimate. Similar to algorithms like MuZero a latent state representation is used, where only task-relevant information is encoded to reduce the complexity. In this paper, we propose the use of a reconstruction function within the TD-MPC framework, so that the agent can reconstruct the original observation given the internal state representation. This allows our agent to have a more stable learning signal during training and also improves sample efficiency. Our proposed addition of another loss term leads to improved performance on both state- and image-based tasks from the DeepMind-Control suite. ",

    "abstract": "With the development of the Internet of Things (IoT), network intrusion detection is becoming more complex and extensive. It is essential to investigate an intelligent, automated, and robust network intrusion detection method. Graph neural networks based network intrusion detection methods have been proposed. However, it still needs further studies because the graph construction method of the existing methods does not fully adapt to the characteristics of the practical network intrusion datasets. To address the above issue, this paper proposes a graph neural network algorithm based on behavior similarity (BS-GAT) using graph attention network. First, a novel graph construction method is developed using the behavior similarity by analyzing the characteristics of the practical datasets. The data flows are treated as nodes in the graph, and the behavior rules of nodes are used as edges in the graph, constructing a graph with a relatively uniform number of neighbors for each node. Then, the edge behavior relationship weights are incorporated into the graph attention network to utilize the relationship between data flows and the structure information of the graph, which is used to improve the performance of the network intrusion detection. Finally, experiments are conducted based on the latest datasets to evaluate the performance of the proposed behavior similarity based graph attention network for the network intrusion detection. The results show that the proposed method is effective and has superior performance comparing to existing solutions. ",

    "abstract": "Pedestrian attribute recognition (PAR) has received increasing attention because of its wide application in video surveillance and pedestrian analysis. Extracting robust feature representation is one of the key challenges in this task. The existing methods mainly use the convolutional neural network (CNN) as the backbone network to extract features. However, these methods mainly focus on small discriminative regions while ignoring the global perspective. To overcome these limitations, we propose a pure transformer-based multi-task PAR network named PARFormer, which includes four modules. In the feature extraction module, we build a transformer-based strong baseline for feature extraction, which achieves competitive results on several PAR benchmarks compared with the existing CNN-based baseline methods. In the feature processing module, we propose an effective data augmentation strategy named batch random mask (BRM) block to reinforce the attentive feature learning of random patches. Furthermore, we propose a multi-attribute center loss (MACL) to enhance the inter-attribute discriminability in the feature representations. In the viewpoint perception module, we explore the impact of viewpoints on pedestrian attributes, and propose a multi-view contrastive loss (MCVL) that enables the network to exploit the viewpoint information. In the attribute recognition module, we alleviate the negative-positive imbalance problem to generate the attribute predictions. The above modules interact and jointly learn a highly discriminative feature space, and supervise the generation of the final features. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed PARFormer network performs well compared to the state-of-the-art methods on several public datasets, including PETA, RAP, and PA100K.

We show that any efficient, computationally differentially private protocol that has black-box access to key agreement (and nothing stronger), is also an efficient, information-theoretically differentially private protocol. In other words, the existence of efficient key agreement protocols is insufficient for efficient, computationally differentially private protocols. In doing so, we make progress in answering an open question posed by Vadhan about the minimal computational assumption needed for computational differential privacy. Combined with the information-theoretic lower bound due to McGregor, Mironov, Pitassi, Reingold, Talwar, and Vadhan in [FOCS'10], we show that there is no fully black-box reduction from efficient, computationally differentially private protocols for computing the Hamming distance (or equivalently inner product over the integers) on $n$ bits, with additive error lower than $O\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{n}}{e^{\\epsilon}\\log(n)}\\right)$, to key agreement. This complements the result by Haitner, Mazor, Silbak, and Tsfadia in [STOC'22], which showed that computing the Hamming distance implies key agreement. We conclude that key agreement is \\emph{strictly} weaker than computational differential privacy for computing the inner product, thereby answering their open question on whether key agreement is sufficient.

    "abstract": "The strength of machine learning models stems from their ability to learn complex function approximations from data; however, this strength also makes training deep neural networks challenging. Notably, the complex models tend to memorize the training data, which results in poor regularization performance on test data. The regularization techniques such as L1, L2, dropout, etc. are proposed to reduce the overfitting effect; however, they bring in additional hyperparameters tuning complexity. These methods also fall short when the inter-class similarity is high due to the underlying data distribution, leading to a less accurate model. In this paper, we present a novel approach to regularize the models by leveraging the information-rich latent embeddings and their high intra-class correlation. We create phantom embeddings from a subset of homogenous samples and use these phantom embeddings to decrease the inter-class similarity of instances in their latent embedding space. The resulting models generalize better as a combination of their embedding and regularize them without requiring an expensive hyperparameter search. We evaluate our method on two popular and challenging image classification datasets (CIFAR and FashionMNIST) and show how our approach outperforms the standard baselines while displaying better training behavior.

This class of graphs includes the Johnson and Grassmann graphs, which have played a pivotal role in recent PCP constructions for UG, and their generalizations via high-dimensional expanders. Our algorithm shows how to round \"low-entropy\" solutions to sum-of-squares (SoS) semidefinite programs, broadly extending the algorithmic framework of [BBKSS'21]. We give a new rounding scheme for SoS, which eliminates global correlations in a given pseudodistribution so that it retains various good properties even after conditioning. Getting structural control over a pseudodistribution after conditioning is a fundamental challenge in many SoS based algorithms. Due to these challenges, [BBKSS] were not able to establish strong algorithms for globally hypercontractive graphs, and could only do so for certifiable small-set expanders. Our results improve upon the results of [BBKSS] in various aspects: we are able to deal with instances with arbitrarily small (but constant) completeness, and most importantly, their algorithm gets a soundness guarantee that degrades with other parameters of the graph (which in all PCP constructions grow with the alphabet size), whereas our doesn't. Our result suggests that UG is easy on globally hypercontractive graphs, and therefore highlights the importance of graphs that lack such a characterization in the context of PCP reductions for UG.

The underlying probability distribution of the disturbance process is unknown, but assumed to lie in a given ball of distributions defined in terms of the type-2 Wasserstein distance. In this framework, strictly causal linear disturbance feedback controllers are designed to minimize the worst-case expected regret. The regret incurred by a controller is defined as the difference between the cost it incurs in response to a realization of the disturbance process and the cost incurred by the optimal noncausal controller which has perfect knowledge of the disturbance process realization at the outset. Building on a well-established duality theory for optimal transport problems, we show how to equivalently reformulate this minimax regret optimal control problem as a tractable semidefinite program. The equivalent dual reformulation also allows us to characterize a worst-case distribution achieving the worst-case expected regret in relation to the distribution at the center of the Wasserstein ball.

We are also particularly interested in graphs with locality, where only nearby items can be connected by edges; our analysis identifies conditions under which locality does not hurt, i.e. comparing the scores between a pair of items that are far apart in the graph is nearly as easy as comparing a pair of nearby items. We further explore divide-and-conquer algorithms that can provably achieve similar guarantees even in the regime with the sparsest samples, while enjoying certain computational advantages.

However, usually large amounts of high-fidelity data are required to describe and accurately predict the complex physical information, while in reality, only limited high-fidelity data is available due to the high experiment/computational cost. Therefore, this work proposes a novel multi-fidelity learning method based on the Fourier Neural Operator by jointing abundant low-fidelity data and limited high-fidelity data under transfer learning paradigm. First, as a resolution-invariant operator, the Fourier Neural Operator is first and gainfully applied to integrate multi-fidelity data directly, which can utilize the scarce high-fidelity data and abundant low-fidelity data simultaneously. Then, the transfer learning framework is developed for the current task by extracting the rich low-fidelity data knowledge to assist high-fidelity modeling training, to further improve data-driven prediction accuracy. Finally, three typical fluid and temperature prediction problems are chosen to validate the accuracy of the proposed multi-fidelity model. The results demonstrate that our proposed method has high effectiveness when compared with other high-fidelity models, and has the high modeling accuracy of 99% for all the selected physical field problems. Significantly, the proposed multi-fidelity learning method has the potential of a simple structure with high precision, which can provide a reference for the construction of the subsequent model. ",

This provides challenges in model choice, often necessitating imputation or similar strategies. Continuous time autoregressive recurrent neural networks (CTRNNs) are a deep learning model that account for irregular observations through incorporating continuous evolution of the hidden states between observations. This is achieved using a neural ordinary differential equation (ODE) or neural flow layer. In this manuscript, we give an overview of these models, including the varying architectures that have been proposed to account for issues such as ongoing medical interventions. Further, we demonstrate the application of these models to probabilistic forecasting of blood glucose in a critical care setting using electronic medical record and simulated data. The experiments confirm that addition of a neural ODE or neural flow layer generally improves the performance of autoregressive recurrent neural networks in the irregular measurement setting.

Early detection of the disease is crucial for making treatment decisions. However, most of the literature on computer-assisted detection of AD focuses on classifying brain images into one of three major categories: healthy, MCI, and AD; or categorising MCI patients into one of (1) progressive: those who progress from MCI to AD at a future examination time during a given study period, and (2) stable: those who stay as MCI and never progress to AD. This misses the opportunity to accurately identify the trajectory of progressive MCI patients. In this paper, we revisit the brain image classification task for AD identification and re-frame it as an ordinal classification task to predict how close a patient is to the severe AD stage. To this end, we select progressive MCI patients from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset and construct an ordinal dataset with a prediction target that indicates the time to progression to AD. We train a siamese network model to predict the time to onset of AD based on MRI brain images. We also propose a weighted variety of siamese networks and compare its performance to a baseline model. Our evaluations show that incorporating a weighting factor to siamese networks brings considerable performance gain at predicting how close input brain MRI images are to progressing to AD. ",

    "abstract": "Cancer is a highly heterogeneous condition that can occur almost anywhere in the human body. 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose is an imaging modality commonly used to detect cancer due to its high sensitivity and clear visualisation of the pattern of metabolic activity. Nonetheless, as cancer is highly heterogeneous, it is challenging to train general-purpose discriminative cancer detection models, with data availability and disease complexity often cited as a limiting factor. Unsupervised anomaly detection models have been suggested as a putative solution. These models learn a healthy representation of tissue and detect cancer by predicting deviations from the healthy norm, which requires models capable of accurately learning long-range interactions between organs and their imaging patterns with high levels of expressivity. Such characteristics are suitably satisfied by transformers, which have been shown to generate state-of-the-art results in unsupervised anomaly detection by training on normal data. This work expands upon such approaches by introducing multi-modal conditioning of the transformer via cross-attention i.e. supplying anatomical reference from paired CT. Using 294 whole-body PET/CT samples, we show that our anomaly detection method is robust and capable of achieving accurate cancer localization results even in cases where normal training data is unavailable. In addition, we show the efficacy of this approach on out-of-sample data showcasing the generalizability of this approach with limited training data. Lastly, we propose to combine model uncertainty with a new kernel density estimation approach, and show that it provides clinically and statistically significant improvements when compared to the classic residual-based anomaly maps. Overall, a superior performance is demonstrated against leading state-of-the-art alternatives, drawing attention to the potential of these approaches. ",

We use Zubov's equation to train a maximal Lyapunov function defined on the domain of attraction. Additionally, we propose conditions that can be readily verified by satisfiability modulo theories (SMT) solvers for both local and global stability. We provide theoretical guarantees on the existence of maximal Lyapunov functions and demonstrate the effectiveness of our computational approach through numerical examples. ",

    "title": "Robustness of community structure under edge addition",
    "abstract": "Communities often represent key structural and functional clusters in networks. To preserve such communities, it is important to understand their robustness under network perturbations. Previous work in community robustness analysis has focused on studying changes in the community structure as a response of edge rewiring and node/edge removal. However, the impact of increasing connectivity on the robustness of communities in networked systems is relatively unexplored. Studying the limits of community robustness under edge addition is crucial to better understanding the cases in which density expands or false edges erroneously appear. In this paper, we analyze the effect of edge addition on community robustness in synthetic and empirical temporal networks. We study two scenarios of edge addition: random and targeted. We use four community detection algorithms, Infomap, Label Propagation, Leiden, and Louvain, and demonstrate the results in community similarity metrics. The experiments on synthetic networks show that communities are more robust when the initial partition is stronger or the edge addition is random, and the experiments on empirical data also indicate that robustness performance can be affected by the community similarity metric. Overall, our results suggest that the communities identified by the different types of community detection algorithms exhibit different levels of robustness, and so the robustness of communities depends strongly on the choice of detection method.
