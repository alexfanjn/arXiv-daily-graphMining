    "title": "Deep Transfer Learning Applications in Intrusion Detection Systems: A  Comprehensive Review",
    "abstract": "Globally, the external Internet is increasingly being connected to the contemporary industrial control system. As a result, there is an immediate need to protect the network from several threats. The key infrastructure of industrial activity may be protected from harm by using an intrusion detection system (IDS), a preventive measure mechanism, to recognize new kinds of dangerous threats and hostile activities. The most recent artificial intelligence (AI) techniques used to create IDS in many kinds of industrial control networks are examined in this study, with a particular emphasis on IDS-based deep transfer learning (DTL). This latter can be seen as a type of information fusion that merge, and/or adapt knowledge from multiple domains to enhance the performance of the target task, particularly when the labeled data in the target domain is scarce. Publications issued after 2015 were taken into account. These selected publications were divided into three categories: DTL-only and IDS-only are involved in the introduction and background, and DTL-based IDS papers are involved in the core papers of this review. Researchers will be able to have a better grasp of the current state of DTL approaches used in IDS in many different types of networks by reading this review paper. Other useful information, such as the datasets used, the sort of DTL employed, the pre-trained network, IDS techniques, the evaluation metrics including accuracy/F-score and false alarm rate (FAR), and the improvement gained, were also covered. The algorithms, and methods used in several studies, or illustrate deeply and clearly the principle in any DTL-based IDS subcategory are presented to the reader. ",

In most optimization problems, the loss function is convex, in which case we only have a global minima, or nonconvex, with a discrete number of global minima. In this paper, we prove that in the overparametrized regime, a shallow neural network can interpolate any data set, i.e. the loss function has a global minimum value equal to zero as long as the activation function is not a polynomial of small degree. Additionally, if such a global minimum exists, then the locus of global minima has infinitely many points. Furthermore, we give a characterization of the Hessian of the loss function evaluated at the global minima, and in the last section, we provide a practical probabilistic method of finding the interpolation point.

    "abstract": "Estimating heterogeneous treatment effects from observational data is a crucial task across many fields, helping policy and decision-makers take better actions. There has been recent progress on robust and efficient methods for estimating the conditional average treatment effect (CATE) function, but these methods often do not take into account the risk of hidden confounding, which could arbitrarily and unknowingly bias any causal estimate based on observational data. We propose a meta-learner called the B-Learner, which can efficiently learn sharp bounds on the CATE function under limits on the level of hidden confounding. We derive the B-Learner by adapting recent results for sharp and valid bounds of the average treatment effect (Dorn et al., 2021) into the framework given by Kallus & Oprescu (2022) for robust and model-agnostic learning of distributional treatment effects. The B-Learner can use any function estimator such as random forests and deep neural networks, and we prove its estimates are valid, sharp, efficient, and have a quasi-oracle property with respect to the constituent estimators under more general conditions than existing methods. Semi-synthetic experimental comparisons validate the theoretical findings, and we use real-world data demonstrate how the method might be used in practice. ",

    "abstract": "The increasing demand for privacy and security has driven the advancement of private inference (PI), a cryptographic method enabling inferences directly on encrypted data. However, the computational and storage burdens of non-linear operators (e.g., ReLUs) render it impractical. Despite these limitations, prior ReLU optimization methods consistently relied on classical networks, that are not optimized for PI. Moreover, the selection of baseline networks in these ReLU optimization methods remains enigmatic and fails to provide insights into network attributes contributing to PI efficiency. In this paper, we investigate the desirable network architecture for efficient PI, and {\\em key finding} is wider networks are superior at higher ReLU counts, while networks with a greater proportion of least-critical ReLUs excel at lower ReLU counts. Leveraging these findings, we develop a novel network redesign technique (DeepReShape) with a complexity of $\\mathcal{O}(1)$, and synthesize specialized architectures(HybReNet).

    "abstract": "Customer churn describes terminating a relationship with a business or reducing customer engagement over a specific period. Two main business marketing strategies play vital roles to increase market share dollar-value: gaining new and preserving existing customers. Customer acquisition cost can be five to six times that for customer retention, hence investing in customers with churn risk is smart. Causal analysis of the churn model can predict whether a customer will churn in the foreseeable future and assist enterprises to identify effects and possible causes for churn and subsequently use that knowledge to apply tailored incentives. This paper proposes a framework using a deep feedforward neural network for classification accompanied by a sequential pattern mining method on high-dimensional sparse data. We also propose a causal Bayesian network to predict cause probabilities that lead to customer churn. Evaluation metrics on test data confirm the XGBoost and our deep learning model outperformed previous techniques. Experimental analysis confirms that some independent causal variables representing the level of super guarantee contribution, account growth, and customer tenure were identified as confounding factors for customer churn with a high degree of belief. This paper provides a real-world customer churn analysis from current status inference to future directions in local superannuation funds. ",

    "abstract": "The deployment of AI models on low-power, real-time edge devices requires accelerators for which energy, latency, and area are all first-order concerns. There are many approaches to enabling deep neural networks (DNNs) in this domain, including pruning, quantization, compression, and binary neural networks (BNNs), but with the emergence of the \"extreme edge\", there is now a demand for even more efficient models. In order to meet the constraints of ultra-low-energy devices, we propose ULEEN, a model architecture based on weightless neural networks. Weightless neural networks (WNNs) are a class of neural model which use table lookups, not arithmetic, to perform computation. The elimination of energy-intensive arithmetic operations makes WNNs theoretically well suited for edge inference; however, they have historically suffered from poor accuracy and excessive memory usage. ULEEN incorporates algorithmic improvements and a novel training strategy inspired by BNNs to make significant strides in improving accuracy and reducing model size. We compare FPGA and ASIC implementations of an inference accelerator for ULEEN against edge-optimized DNN and BNN devices. On a Xilinx Zynq Z-7045 FPGA, we demonstrate classification on the MNIST dataset at 14.3 million inferences per second (13 million inferences/Joule) with 0.21 $\\mu$s latency and 96.2% accuracy, while Xilinx FINN achieves 12.3 million inferences per second (1.69 million inferences/Joule) with 0.31 $\\mu$s latency and 95.83% accuracy. In a 45nm ASIC, we achieve 5.1 million inferences/Joule and 38.5 million inferences/second at 98.46% accuracy, while a quantized Bit Fusion model achieves 9230 inferences/Joule and 19,100 inferences/second at 99.35% accuracy. In our search for ever more efficient edge devices, ULEEN shows that WNNs are deserving of consideration. ",

    "abstract": "Harmful content is pervasive on social media, poisoning online communities and negatively impacting participation. A common approach to address this issue is to develop detection models that rely on human annotations. However, the tasks required to build such models expose annotators to harmful and offensive content and may require significant time and cost to complete. Generative AI models have the potential to understand and detect harmful content. To investigate this potential, we used ChatGPT and compared its performance with MTurker annotations for three frequently discussed concepts related to harmful content: Hateful, Offensive, and Toxic (HOT). We designed five prompts to interact with ChatGPT and conducted four experiments eliciting HOT classifications. Our results show that ChatGPT can achieve an accuracy of approximately 80% when compared to MTurker annotations. Specifically, the model displays a more consistent classification for non-HOT comments than HOT comments compared to human annotations. Our findings also suggest that ChatGPT classifications align with provided HOT definitions, but ChatGPT classifies \"hateful\" and \"offensive\" as subsets of \"toxic.\" Moreover, the choice of prompts used to interact with ChatGPT impacts its performance. Based on these in-sights, our study provides several meaningful implications for employing ChatGPT to detect HOT content, particularly regarding the reliability and consistency of its performance, its understand-ing and reasoning of the HOT concept, and the impact of prompts on its performance. Overall, our study provides guidance about the potential of using generative AI models to moderate large volumes of user-generated content on social media. ",

The position-dependent density learning is of particular interest for photogrammetry, enabling 3D reconstruction by querying and filtering the NeRF coordinate system based on the object density. While traditional methods like Structure from Motion are commonly used for camera pose calculation in pre-processing for NeRFs, the HoloLens offers an interesting interface for extracting the required input data directly. We present a workflow for high-resolution 3D reconstructions almost directly from HoloLens data using NeRFs. Thereby, different investigations are considered: Internal camera poses from the HoloLens trajectory via a server application, and external camera poses from Structure from Motion, both with an enhanced variant applied through pose refinement. Results show that the internal camera poses lead to NeRF convergence with a PSNR of 25\\,dB with a simple rotation around the x-axis and enable a 3D reconstruction. Pose refinement enables comparable quality compared to external camera poses, resulting in improved training process with a PSNR of 27\\,dB and a better 3D reconstruction. Overall, NeRF reconstructions outperform the conventional photogrammetric dense reconstruction using Multi-View Stereo in terms of completeness and level of detail. ",

    "abstract": "Feature point (FP) detection is a fundamental step of many computer vision tasks. However, FP detectors are usually designed for low dynamic range (LDR) images. In scenes with extreme light conditions, LDR images present saturated pixels, which degrade FP detection. On the other hand, high dynamic range (HDR) images usually present no saturated pixels but FP detection algorithms do not take advantage of all the information present in such images. FP detection frequently relies on differential methods, which work well in LDR images. However, in HDR images, the differential operation response in bright areas overshadows the response in dark areas. As an alternative to standard FP detection methods, this study proposes an FP detector based on a coefficient of variation (CV) designed for HDR images. The CV operation adapts its response based on the standard deviation of pixels inside a window, working well in both dark and bright areas of HDR images. The proposed and standard detectors are evaluated by measuring their repeatability rate (RR) and uniformity. Our proposed detector shows better performance when compared to other standard state-of-the-art detectors. In uniformity metric, our proposed detector surpasses all the other algorithms. In other hand, when using the repeatability rate metric, the proposed detector is worse than Harris for HDR and SURF detectors. ",

Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) that use Language Models (LMs) to encode textual information of graphs achieve state-of-the-art performance in many node classification tasks. Yet, combining GNNs with LMs has not been widely explored for practical deployments due to its scalability issues. In this work, we tackle this challenge by developing a Graph-Aware Distillation framework (GRAD) to encode graph structures into an LM for graph-free, fast inference. Different from conventional knowledge distillation, GRAD jointly optimizes a GNN teacher and a graph-free student over the graph's nodes via a shared LM. This encourages the graph-free student to exploit graph information encoded by the GNN teacher while at the same time, enables the GNN teacher to better leverage textual information from unlabeled nodes. As a result, the teacher and the student models learn from each other to improve their overall performance. Experiments in eight node classification benchmarks in both transductive and inductive settings showcase GRAD's superiority over existing distillation approaches for textual graphs. ",

However, it is challenging for existing methods to handle the scenarios where the instances are systems whose characteristics are not readily observed as data. Appropriate interactions are needed to interact with the systems and identify those with abnormal responses. Detecting system-wise anomalies is a challenging task due to several reasons including: how to formally define the system-wise anomaly detection problem; how to find the effective activation signal for interacting with systems to progressively collect the data and learn the detector; how to guarantee stable training in such a non-stationary scenario with real-time interactions? To address the challenges, we propose InterSAD (Interactive System-wise Anomaly Detection). Specifically, first, we adopt Markov decision process to model the interactive systems, and define anomalous systems as anomalous transition and anomalous reward systems. Then, we develop an end-to-end approach which includes an encoder-decoder module that learns system embeddings, and a policy network to generate effective activation for separating embeddings of normal and anomaly systems. Finally, we design a training method to stabilize the learning process, which includes a replay buffer to store historical interaction data and allow them to be re-sampled. Experiments on two benchmark environments, including identifying the anomalous robotic systems and detecting user data poisoning in recommendation models, demonstrate the superiority of InterSAD compared with state-of-the-art baselines methods.

    "abstract": "Multi-instance multi-label (MIML) learning is widely applicated in numerous domains, such as the image classification where one image contains multiple instances correlated with multiple logic labels simultaneously. The related labels in existing MIML are all assumed as logical labels with equal significance. However, in practical applications in MIML, significance of each label for multiple instances per bag (such as an image) is significant different. Ignoring labeling significance will greatly lose the semantic information of the object, so that MIML is not applicable in complex scenes with a poor learning performance. To this end, this paper proposed a novel MIML framework based on graph label enhancement, namely GLEMIML, to improve the classification performance of MIML by leveraging label significance. GLEMIML first recognizes the correlations among instances by establishing the graph and then migrates the implicit information mined from the feature space to the label space via nonlinear mapping, thus recovering the label significance. Finally, GLEMIML is trained on the enhanced data through matching and interaction mechanisms. GLEMIML (AvgRank: 1.44) can effectively improve the performance of MIML by mining the label distribution mechanism and show better results than the SOTA method (AvgRank: 2.92) on multiple benchmark datasets.

    "abstract": "The present study explores the intricacies of causal relationship extraction, a vital component in the pursuit of causality knowledge. Causality is frequently intertwined with temporal elements, as the progression from cause to effect is not instantaneous but rather ensconced in a temporal dimension. Thus, the extraction of temporal causality holds paramount significance in the field. In light of this, we propose a method for extracting causality from the text that integrates both temporal and causal relations, with a particular focus on the time aspect. To this end, we first compile a dataset that encompasses temporal relationships. Subsequently, we present a novel model, TC-GAT, which employs a graph attention mechanism to assign weights to the temporal relationships and leverages a causal knowledge graph to determine the adjacency matrix. Additionally, we implement an equilibrium mechanism to regulate the interplay between temporal and causal relations. Our experiments demonstrate that our proposed method significantly surpasses baseline models in the task of causality extraction. ",

    "abstract": "Learning effective high-order feature interactions is very crucial in the CTR prediction task. However, it is very time-consuming to calculate high-order feature interactions with massive features in online e-commerce platforms. Most existing methods manually design a maximal order and further filter out the useless interactions from them. Although they reduce the high computational costs caused by the exponential growth of high-order feature combinations, they still suffer from the degradation of model capability due to the suboptimal learning of the restricted feature orders. The solution to maintain the model capability and meanwhile keep it efficient is a technical challenge, which has not been adequately addressed. To address this issue, we propose an adaptive feature interaction learning model, named as EulerNet, in which the feature interactions are learned in a complex vector space by conducting space mapping according to Euler's formula. EulerNet converts the exponential powers of feature interactions into simple linear combinations of the modulus and phase of the complex features, making it possible to adaptively learn the high-order feature interactions in an efficient way. Furthermore, EulerNet incorporates the implicit and explicit feature interactions into a unified architecture, which achieves the mutual enhancement and largely boosts the model capabilities. Such a network can be fully learned from data, with no need of pre-designed form or order for feature interactions. Extensive experiments conducted on three public datasets have demonstrated the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach. Our code is available at: https://github.com/RUCAIBox/EulerNet. ",

This study proposes a comprehensive self-supervised framework for accurate scale-aware depth prediction on autonomous driving scenes utilizing inter-frame poses obtained from inertial measurements. In particular, we introduce a Full-Scale depth prediction network named FSNet. FSNet contains four important improvements over existing self-supervised models: (1) a multichannel output representation for stable training of depth prediction in driving scenarios, (2) an optical-flow-based mask designed for dynamic object removal, (3) a self-distillation training strategy to augment the training process, and (4) an optimization-based post-processing algorithm in test time, fusing the results from visual odometry. With this framework, robots and vehicles with only one well-calibrated camera can collect sequences of training image frames and camera poses, and infer accurate 3D depths of the environment without extra labeling work or 3D data. Extensive experiments on the KITTI dataset, KITTI-360 dataset and the nuScenes dataset demonstrate the potential of FSNet.

To address the above issues, this paper leverages the advanced neural network (NN) to learn the frequency dynamics and incorporates NN to facilitate system reliable operation. This paper proposes the conservative sparse neural network (CSNN) embedded frequency-constrained unit commitment (FCUC) with converter-based DERs, including the learning and optimization stages. In the learning stage, it samples the inertia parameters, calculates the corresponding frequency, and characterizes the stability region of the sampled parameters using the convex hulls to ensure stability and avoid extrapolation. For conservativeness, the positive prediction error penalty is added to the loss function to prevent possible frequency requirement violation. For the sparsity, the NN topology pruning is employed to eliminate unnecessary connections for solving acceleration. In the optimization stage, the trained CSNN is transformed into mixed-integer linear constraints using the big-M method and then incorporated to establish the data-enhanced model. The case study verifies 1) the effectiveness of the proposed model in terms of high accuracy, fewer parameters, and significant solving acceleration; 2) the stable system operation against frequency violation under contingency.

In this paper, we propose a novel evaluation benchmark to stress-test the robustness of ITM models. To this end, we add various fooling images and captions to a retrieval pool. Specifically, we change images by inserting unrelated images, and change captions by substituting a noun, which can change the meaning of a sentence. We discover that just adding these newly created images and captions to the test set can degrade performances (i.e., Recall@1) of a wide range of SOTA models (e.g., 81.9% $\\rightarrow$ 64.5% in BLIP, 66.1% $\\rightarrow$ 37.5% in VSE$\\infty$).

    "abstract": "Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have received considerable attention not only for their superiority in energy efficient with discrete signal processing, but also for their natural suitability to integrate multi-scale biological plasticity. However, most SNNs directly adopt the structure of the well-established DNN, rarely automatically design Neural Architecture Search (NAS) for SNNs. The neural motifs topology, modular regional structure and global cross-brain region connection of the human brain are the product of natural evolution and can serve as a perfect reference for designing brain-inspired SNN architecture. In this paper, we propose a Multi-Scale Evolutionary Neural Architecture Search (MSE-NAS) for SNN, simultaneously considering micro-, meso- and macro-scale brain topologies as the evolutionary search space. MSE-NAS evolves individual neuron operation, self-organized integration of multiple circuit motifs, and global connectivity across motifs through a brain-inspired indirect evaluation function, Representational Dissimilarity Matrices (RDMs). This training-free fitness function could greatly reduce computational consumption and NAS's time, and its task-independent property enables the searched SNNs to exhibit excellent transferbility and scalability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with shorter simulation steps on static datasets (CIFAR10, CIFAR100) and neuromorphic datasets (CIFAR10-DVS and DVS128-Gesture). The thorough analysis also illustrates the significant performance improvement and consistent bio-interpretability deriving from the topological evolution at different scales and the RDMs fitness function.

However, most of these CNNs-based detectors are trained independently, making it difficult to associate detected parts with body. In this paper, we focus on the joint detection of human body and its corresponding parts. Specifically, we propose a novel extended object representation integrating center-offsets of body parts, and construct a dense one-stage generic Body-Part Joint Detector (BPJDet). In this way, body-part associations are neatly embedded in a unified object representation containing both semantic and geometric contents. Therefore, we can perform multi-loss optimizations to tackle multi-tasks synergistically. BPJDet does not suffer from error-prone post matching, and keeps a better trade-off between speed and accuracy. Furthermore, BPJDet can be generalized to detect any one or more body parts. To verify the superiority of BPJDet, we conduct experiments on three body-part datasets (CityPersons, CrowdHuman and BodyHands) and one body-parts dataset COCOHumanParts. While keeping high detection accuracy, BPJDet achieves state-of-the-art association performance on all datasets comparing with its counterparts. Besides, we show benefits of advanced body-part association capability by improving performance of two representative downstream applications: accurate crowd head detection and hand contact estimation.

Recent studies showed the effectiveness of encouraging exploration with intrinsic rewards estimated from novelty in observations. However, there is a gap between the novelty of an observation and an exploration in general, because the stochasticity in the environment as well as the behavior of an agent may affect the observation. To estimate exploratory behaviors accurately, we propose DEIR, a novel method where we theoretically derive an intrinsic reward from a conditional mutual information term that principally scales with the novelty contributed by agent explorations, and materialize the reward with a discriminative forward model. We conduct extensive experiments in both standard and hardened exploration games in MiniGrid to show that DEIR quickly learns a better policy than baselines. Our evaluations in ProcGen demonstrate both generalization capabilities and the general applicability of our intrinsic reward. ",

In this paper, we provide a novel perspective and make two contributions towards this fundamental problem: 1) We revisit the normalized eight-point algorithm and make a theoretical contribution by showing the existence of different and better normalization algorithms; 2) We present a deep convolutional neural network with a self-supervised learning strategy to the normalization. Given eight pairs of correspondences, our network directly predicts the normalization matrices, thus learning to normalize each input sample.

Focusing on these two problems, we propose a brain-inspired plug-and-play method to learn a semantic-agnostic and spatial-aware representation for generalizable visual-audio navigation. We meticulously design two auxiliary tasks for respectively accelerating learning representations with the above-desired characteristics. With these two auxiliary tasks, the agent learns a spatially-correlated representation of visual and audio inputs that can be applied to work on environments with novel sounds and maps.

Unlike recent model poisoning attacks that optimize the amplitude of malicious perturbations along certain prescribed directions to cause DoS, we propose a Flexible Model Poisoning Attack (FMPA) that can achieve versatile attack goals. We consider a practical threat scenario where no extra knowledge about the FL system (e.g., aggregation rules or updates on benign devices) is available to adversaries. FMPA exploits the global historical information to construct an estimator that predicts the next round of the global model as a benign reference. It then fine-tunes the reference model to obtain the desired poisoned model with low accuracy and small perturbations. Besides the goal of causing DoS, FMPA can be naturally extended to launch a fine-grained controllable attack, making it possible to precisely reduce the global accuracy. Armed with precise control, malicious FL service providers can gain advantages over their competitors without getting noticed, hence opening a new attack surface in FL other than DoS. Even for the purpose of DoS, experiments show that FMPA significantly decreases the global accuracy, outperforming six state-of-the-art attacks. ",

Recently, multimodal pre-trained models such as CLIP show significant performance improvement in diverse experiments. However, when the labeled dataset is limited, the generalization of a new dataset or domain is still challenging. To improve the generalization performance on few-shot learning, there have been diverse efforts, such as prompt learning and adapter. However, the current few-shot adaptation methods are not interpretable, and they require a high computation cost for adaptation. In this study, we propose a new method, robust prompt learning with knowledge graph (RPLKG). Based on the knowledge graph, we automatically design diverse interpretable and meaningful prompt sets. Our model obtains cached embeddings of prompt sets after one forwarding from a large pre-trained model. After that, model optimizes the prompt selection processes with GumbelSoftmax. In this way, our model is trained using relatively little memory and learning time. Also, RPLKG selects the optimal interpretable prompt automatically, depending on the dataset. In summary, RPLKG is i) interpretable, ii) requires small computation resources, and iii) easy to incorporate prior human knowledge. To validate the RPLKG, we provide comprehensive experimental results on few-shot learning, domain generalization and new class generalization setting. RPLKG shows a significant performance improvement compared to zero-shot learning and competitive performance against several prompt learning methods using much lower resources. ",

    "abstract": "We study Individual Fairness (IF) for Bayesian neural networks (BNNs). Specifically, we consider the $\\epsilon$-$\\delta$-individual fairness notion, which requires that, for any pair of input points that are $\\epsilon$-similar according to a given similarity metrics, the output of the BNN is within a given tolerance $\\delta>0.$ We leverage bounds on statistical sampling over the input space and the relationship between adversarial robustness and individual fairness to derive a framework for the systematic estimation of $\\epsilon$-$\\delta$-IF, designing Fair-FGSM and Fair-PGD as global,fairness-aware extensions to gradient-based attacks for BNNs. We empirically study IF of a variety of approximately inferred BNNs with different architectures on fairness benchmarks, and compare against deterministic models learnt using frequentist techniques. Interestingly, we find that BNNs trained by means of approximate Bayesian inference consistently tend to be markedly more individually fair than their deterministic counterparts. ",

This work looks at the prospect of creating a new set of three algorithms that can obtain maximum privacy, data utility, and time savings while doing so. This paper proposes a unique double encryption and Transaction Splitter approach to alter the database to optimize the data utility and confidentiality tradeoff in the preparation phase. This paper presents a customized apriori approach for the mining process, which does not examine the entire database to estimate the support for each attribute. Existing distributed data solutions have a high encryption complexity and an insufficient specification of many participants' properties. Proposed solutions provide increased privacy protection against a variety of attack models. Furthermore, in terms of communication cycles and processing complexity, it is much simpler and quicker.

    "abstract": "Wireless networks that are decentralized and communicate without using existing infrastructure are known as mobile ad-hoc networks. The most common sorts of threats and attacks can affect MANETs. Therefore, it is advised to utilize intrusion detection, which controls the system to detect additional security issues. Monitoring is essential to avoid attacks and provide extra protection against unauthorized access. Although the current solutions have been designed to defeat the attack nodes, they still require additional hardware, have considerable delivery delays, do not offer high throughput or packet delivery ratios, or do not do so without using more energy. The capability of a mobile node to forward packets, which is dependent on the platform's life quality, may be impacted by the absence of the network node power source. We developed the Safe Routing Approach (SRA), which uses behaviour analysis to track and monitor attackers who discard packets during the route discovery process. The attacking node recognition system is made for irregular routing node detection to protect the controller network's usual properties from becoming recognized as an attack node. The suggested method examines the nearby attack nodes and conceals the trusted node in the routing pathway. The path is instantly assigned after the initial discovery of trust nodes based on each node's strength value. It extends the network's life span and reduces packet loss. In terms of Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR), energy consumption, network performance, and detection of attack nodes, the suggested approach is contrasted with AIS, ZIDS, and Improved AODV. The findings demonstrate that the recommended strategy performs superior in terms of PDR, residual energy, and network throughput. ",

Synthetic data, on the other hand, are cost-effective to create and offer greater flexibility for adapting to various applications. Hence, they are widely utilized in both research and industry. In this paper, we propose the dataset HabitatDyn, which contains both synthetic RGB videos, semantic labels, and depth information, as well as kinetics information. HabitatDyn was created from the perspective of a mobile robot with a moving camera, and contains 30 scenes featuring six different types of moving objects with varying velocities. To demonstrate the usability of our dataset, two existing algorithms are used for evaluation and an approach to estimate the distance between the object and camera is implemented based on these segmentation methods and evaluated through the dataset. With the availability of this dataset, we aspire to foster further advancements in the field of mobile robotics, leading to more capable and intelligent robots that can navigate and interact with their environments more effectively.

The side-channel is a key part of transient execution attacks to leak data. In this work, we discover a vulnerability that the change of the EFLAGS register in transient execution may have a side effect on the Jcc (jump on condition code) instruction after it in Intel CPUs. Based on our discovery, we propose a new side-channel attack that leverages the timing of both transient execution and Jcc instructions to deliver data. This attack encodes secret data to the change of register which makes the execution time of context slightly slower, which can be measured by the attacker to decode data. This attack doesn't rely on the cache system and doesn't need to reset the EFLAGS register manually to its initial state before the attack, which may make it more difficult to detect or mitigate. We implemented this side-channel on machines with Intel Core i7-6700, i7-7700, and i9-10980XE CPUs. In the first two processors, we combined it as the side-channel of the Meltdown attack, which could achieve 100\\% success leaking rate. We evaluate and discuss potential defenses against the attack. Our contributions include discovering security vulnerabilities in the implementation of Jcc instructions and EFLAGS register and proposing a new side-channel attack that does not rely on the cache system.

Yet, achievement of consistent GNN performance on heterophilous graphs remains an open research problem. Recent works have proposed extensions to standard GNN architectures to improve performance on heterophilous graphs, trading off model simplicity for prediction accuracy. However, these models fail to capture basic graph properties, such as neighborhood label distribution, which are fundamental for learning. In this work, we propose GCN for Heterophily (GCNH), a simple yet effective GNN architecture applicable to both heterophilous and homophilous scenarios. GCNH learns and combines separate representations for a node and its neighbors, using one learned importance coefficient per layer to balance the contributions of center nodes and neighborhoods. We conduct extensive experiments on eight real-world graphs and a set of synthetic graphs with varying degrees of heterophily to demonstrate how the design choices for GCNH lead to a sizable improvement over a vanilla GCN. Moreover, GCNH outperforms state-of-the-art models of much higher complexity on four out of eight benchmarks, while producing comparable results on the remaining datasets. Finally, we discuss and analyze the lower complexity of GCNH, which results in fewer trainable parameters and faster training times than other methods, and show how GCNH mitigates the oversmoothing problem.

The equivalent circuit of the leaky memcapacitor involves a memcapacitive and memristive system connected in parallel. In the leaky memcapacitor, the resistance and capacitance depend on the same internal state variable, which is the displacement of the movable plate. We have performed a comprehensive analysis showing that several spiking types observed in biological neurons can be implemented with the leaky memcapacitor. Significant attention is paid to the dynamic properties of the model. As in leaky memcapacitors the capacitive and leaking resistive functionalities are implemented naturally within the same device structure, their use will simplify the creation of spiking neural networks.

Recent approaches use self-supervision of fully-observable unlabelled snapshots of the states to decode state pairs into actions. However, the iterative learning scheme employed by these techniques is prone to get trapped into bad local minima. Previous work uses goal-aware strategies to solve this issue. However, this requires manual intervention to verify whether an agent has reached its goal. We address this limitation by incorporating a discriminator into the original framework, offering two key advantages and directly solving a learning problem previous work had. First, it disposes of the manual intervention requirement. Second, it helps in learning by guiding function approximation based on the state transition of the expert's trajectories. Third, the discriminator solves a learning issue commonly present in the policy model, which is to sometimes perform a `no action' within the environment until the agent finally halts. ",

Subsequently, we achieve better convergence properties and performance enhancement than the conventional gradient-flow method. To illustrate its application in time-varying networks, we address the dynamic matching problem of two distinct groups of agents with different sensing ranges. This problem is a novel coordination task that involves pairing agents from two distinct groups to achieve a convergence of the paired agents' states to the same value. Accordingly, we apply the proposed method to this problem and provide sufficient conditions for successful matching.

The problem is significantly more challenging in the presence of multiple moving and/or deforming objects. Traditional methods have approached the setup with a mix of simplifications, scene priors, pretrained templates, or known deformation models. The advent of neural representations, especially neural implicit representations and radiance fields, opens the possibility of end-to-end optimization to collectively capture geometry, appearance, and object motion. However, current approaches produce global scene encoding, assume multiview capture with limited or no motion in the scenes, and do not facilitate easy manipulation beyond novel view synthesis. In this work, we introduce a factored neural scene representation that can directly be learned from a monocular RGB-D video to produce object-level neural presentations with an explicit encoding of object movement (e.g., rigid trajectory) and/or deformations (e.g., nonrigid movement). We evaluate ours against a set of neural approaches on both synthetic and real data to demonstrate that the representation is efficient, interpretable, and editable (e.g., change object trajectory).

However, most of the existing studies are focused on the networks with a single structure, e.g., community or bipartite, while ignoring multiple structures, e.g., the coexistence of community and bipartite structures. Furthermore, existing studies were faced with challenge regarding large-scale signed networks due to their high time complexity, especially when determining the number of clusters in the observed network without any prior knowledge. In view of this, we propose a mathematically principled method for signed network multiple structure discovery named the Signed Stochastic Block Model (SSBM). The SSBM can capture the multiple structures contained in signed networks, e.g., community, bipartite, and coexistence of them, by adopting a probabilistic model. Moreover, by integrating the minimum message length (MML) criterion and component-wise EM (CEM) algorithm, a scalable learning algorithm that has the ability of model selection is proposed to handle large-scale signed networks. By comparing state-of-the-art methods on synthetic and real-world signed networks, extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of SSBM in discovering large-scale exploratory signed networks with multiple structures.

It adopts two-fold ideas: a) adopting tucker decomposition to build a LFT model for achieving a better recovery accuracy. b) taking the adjusted instance error based on the PID control theory into the SGD solver to effectively improve convergence rate. Our experimental studies on two major city traffic road speed datasets show that the proposed model achieves significant efficiency gain and highly competitive prediction accuracy. ",

In this work, we utilize the World Of Code dataset, which contains commit activity data for millions of OSS projects, to build collaboration networks for ten popular programming language ecosystems, containing in total over 290M commits across over 18M projects. We build a collaboration graph representation for each language ecosystem, having authors and projects as nodes, which enables various forms of social network analysis on the scale of language ecosystems. Moreover, we capture the information on the ecosystems' evolution by slicing each network into 30 historical snapshots. Additionally, we calculate multiple collaboration metrics that characterize the ecosystems' states. We make the resulting dataset publicly available, including the constructed graphs and the pipeline enabling the analysis of more ecosystems. ",

    "abstract": "As deep neural networks continue to be used in critical domains, concerns over their security have emerged. Deep learning models are vulnerable to backdoor attacks due to the lack of transparency. A poisoned backdoor model may perform normally in routine environments, but exhibit malicious behavior when the input contains a trigger. Current research on backdoor attacks focuses on improving the stealthiness of triggers, and most approaches require strong attacker capabilities, such as knowledge of the model structure or control over the training process. These attacks are impractical since in most cases the attacker's capabilities are limited. Additionally, the issue of model robustness has not received adequate attention. For instance, model distillation is commonly used to streamline model size as the number of parameters grows exponentially, and most of previous backdoor attacks failed after model distillation; the image augmentation operations can destroy the trigger and thus disable the backdoor. This study explores the implementation of black-box backdoor attacks within capability constraints. An attacker can carry out such attacks by acting as either an image annotator or an image provider, without involvement in the training process or knowledge of the target model's structure. Through the design of a backdoor trigger, our attack remains effective after model distillation and image augmentation, making it more threatening and practical. Our experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves a high attack success rate in black-box scenarios and evades state-of-the-art backdoor defenses. ",

Also, new facts or evidence may become available, leading to new understandings of complex phenomena. This is particularly true in the biomedical field, where scientists and physicians are constantly striving to find new methods of diagnosis, treatment and eventually cure. Knowledge Graphs (KGs) offer a real way of organizing and retrieving the massive and growing amount of biomedical knowledge. Objective : We propose an end-to-end approach for knowledge extraction and analysis from biomedical clinical notes using the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) model and Conditional Random Field (CRF) layer. Methods : The approach is based on knowledge graphs, which can effectively process abstract biomedical concepts such as relationships and interactions between medical entities. Besides offering an intuitive way to visualize these concepts, KGs can solve more complex knowledge retrieval problems by simplifying them into simpler representations or by transforming the problems into representations from different perspectives. We created a biomedical Knowledge Graph using using Natural Language Processing models for named entity recognition and relation extraction. The generated biomedical knowledge graphs (KGs) are then used for question answering. Results : The proposed framework can successfully extract relevant structured information with high accuracy (90.7% for Named-entity recognition (NER), 88% for relation extraction (RE)), according to experimental findings based on real-world 505 patient biomedical unstructured clinical notes. Conclusions : In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end system for the construction of a biomedical knowledge graph from clinical textual using a variation of BERT models. ",

We propose an optimization framework to refine these anomaly scores by leveraging side information in the form of a causality graph between the various features of the data points. The refinement block builds on causality theory and a proposed notion of confidence scores. After motivating our framework, smoothness properties are proved for the ensuing mathematical expressions. Next, equipped with these results, a gradient descent algorithm is proposed, and a proof of its convergence to a stationary point is provided. Our results hold (i) for any causal anomaly detection algorithm and (ii) for any side information in the form of a directed acyclic graph. Numerical results are provided to illustrate the advantage of our proposed framework in dealing with False Positives (FPs) and False Negatives (FNs). Additionally, the effect of the graph's structure on the expected performance advantage and the various trade-offs that take place are analyzed. ",

The primary objective of this research is to recognize different emotions of human beings such as anger, sadness, fear, neutrality, disgust, pleasant surprise, and happiness by using several MATLAB functions namely, spectral descriptors, periodicity, and harmonicity. To accomplish the work, we analyze the CREMA-D (Crowd-sourced Emotional Multimodal Actors Data) & TESS (Toronto Emotional Speech Set) datasets of human speech. The audio file contains data that have various characteristics (e.g., noisy, speedy, slow) thereby the efficiency of the ML (Machine Learning) models increases significantly. The EMD (Empirical Mode Decomposition) is utilized for the process of signal decomposition. Then, the features are extracted through the use of several techniques such as the MFCC, GTCC, spectral centroid, roll-off point, entropy, spread, flux, harmonic ratio, energy, skewness, flatness, and audio delta. The data is trained using some renowned ML models namely, Support Vector Machine, Neural Network, Ensemble, and KNN. The algorithms show an accuracy of 67.7%, 63.3%, 61.6%, and 59.0% respectively for the test data and 77.7%, 76.1%, 99.1%, and 61.2% for the training data.

This success is largely indebted to the massive size of deep learning models that is expected to increase unceasingly. This growth of the deep learning models is accompanied by issues related to their considerable energy consumption, both during the training and inference phases, as well as their scalability. Although a number of work based on unconventional physical systems have been proposed which addresses the issue of energy efficiency in the inference phase, efficient training of deep learning models has remained unaddressed. So far, training of digital deep learning models mainly relies on backpropagation, which is not suitable for physical implementation as it requires perfect knowledge of the computation performed in the so-called forward pass of the neural network. Here, we tackle this issue by proposing a simple deep neural network architecture augmented by a biologically plausible learning algorithm, referred to as \"model-free forward-forward training\". The proposed architecture enables training deep physical neural networks consisting of layers of physical nonlinear systems, without requiring detailed knowledge of the nonlinear physical layers' properties. We show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art hardware-aware training methods by improving training speed, decreasing digital computations, and reducing power consumption in physical systems. We demonstrate the adaptability of the proposed method, even in systems exposed to dynamic or unpredictable external perturbations. To showcase the universality of our approach, we train diverse wave-based physical neural networks that vary in the underlying wave phenomenon and the type of non-linearity they use, to perform vowel and image classification tasks experimentally.

These characteristics have become essential for conversational intelligent virtual assistants. However, most of the state-of-the-art intelligent virtual assistants (IVAs) are failed to interpret the affective semantics of human voices. This research proposes an anthropomorphic intelligent system that can hold a proper human-like conversation with emotion and personality. A voice style transfer method is also proposed to map the attributes of a specific emotion. Initially, the frequency domain data (Mel-Spectrogram) is created by converting the temporal audio wave data, which comprises discrete patterns for audio features such as notes, pitch, rhythm, and melody. A collateral CNN-Transformer-Encoder is used to predict seven different affective states from voice. The voice is also fed parallelly to the deep-speech, an RNN model that generates the text transcription from the spectrogram. Then the transcripted text is transferred to the multi-domain conversation agent using blended skill talk, transformer-based retrieve-and-generate generation strategy, and beam-search decoding, and an appropriate textual response is generated. The system learns an invertible mapping of data to a latent space that can be manipulated and generates a Mel-spectrogram frame based on previous Mel-spectrogram frames to voice synthesize and style transfer. Finally, the waveform is generated using WaveGlow from the spectrogram. The outcomes of the studies we conducted on individual models were auspicious. Furthermore, users who interacted with the system provided positive feedback, demonstrating the system's effectiveness. ",

In this paper, we identify a security vulnerability wherein an adversary can reconstruct the user's private input data from a power side-channel attack, under proper data acquisition and pre-processing, even without knowledge of the DNN model. We further demonstrate a machine learning-based attack approach using a generative adversarial network (GAN) to enhance the reconstruction. Our results show that the attack methodology is effective in reconstructing user inputs from analog CIM accelerator power leakage, even when at large noise levels and countermeasures are applied. Specifically, we demonstrate the efficacy of our approach on the U-Net for brain tumor detection in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) medical images, with a noise-level of 20% standard deviation of the maximum power signal value. Our study highlights a significant security vulnerability in analog CIM accelerators and proposes an effective attack methodology using a GAN to breach user privacy. ",

    "abstract": "Over the years, open-source software systems have become prey to threat actors. Even as open-source communities act quickly to patch the breach, code vulnerability screening should be an integral part of agile software development from the beginning. Unfortunately, current vulnerability screening techniques are ineffective at identifying novel vulnerabilities or providing developers with code vulnerability and classification. Furthermore, the datasets used for vulnerability learning often exhibit distribution shifts from the real-world testing distribution due to novel attack strategies deployed by adversaries and as a result, the machine learning model's performance may be hindered or biased. To address these issues, we propose a joint interpolated multitasked unbiased vulnerability classifier comprising a transformer \"RoBERTa\" and graph convolution neural network (GCN). We present a training process utilizing a semantic vulnerability graph (SVG) representation from source code, created by integrating edges from a sequential flow, control flow, and data flow, as well as a novel flow dubbed Poacher Flow (PF). Poacher flow edges reduce the gap between dynamic and static program analysis and handle complex long-range dependencies. Moreover, our approach reduces biases of classifiers regarding unbalanced datasets by integrating Focal Loss objective function along with SVG. Remarkably, experimental results show that our classifier outperforms state-of-the-art results on vulnerability detection with fewer false negatives and false positives. After testing our model across multiple datasets, it shows an improvement of at least 2.41% and 18.75% in the best-case scenario. Evaluations using N-day program samples demonstrate that our proposed approach achieves a 93% accuracy and was able to detect 4, zero-day vulnerabilities from popular GitHub repositories. ",

The defender policies were trained in an environment intended to simulate a cyber attack. In the simulation, an attacking agent attempts to capture targets in the environment, while the defender attempts to protect them by enabling defenses. The environment was modeled using attack graphs based on the Meta Attack Language language. We assumed that defensive measures have downtime costs, meaning that the defender agent was penalized for using them. We also assumed that the environment was equipped with an imperfect intrusion detection system that occasionally produces erroneous alerts based on the environment state. To evaluate the setup, we trained the defensive agent with different volumes of intrusion detection system noise. We also trained agents with different attacker strategies and graph sizes. In experiments, the defensive agent using policies trained with reinforcement learning outperformed agents using heuristic policies. Experiments also demonstrated that the policies could generalize across different attacker strategies.

However, existing methods do not model faces with fine-scale facial features, or local control of facial parts that extrapolate asymmetric expressions from monocular videos. Further, most condition only on 3DMM parameters with poor(er) locality, and resolve local features with a global neural field. We build on part-based implicit shape models that decompose a global deformation field into local ones. Our novel formulation models multiple implicit deformation fields with local semantic rig-like control via 3DMM-based parameters, and representative facial landmarks. Further, we propose a local control loss and attention mask mechanism that promote sparsity of each learned deformation field.

    "abstract": "We propose an evolution strategies-based algorithm for estimating gradients in unrolled computation graphs, called ES-Single. Similarly to the recently-proposed Persistent Evolution Strategies (PES), ES-Single is unbiased, and overcomes chaos arising from recursive function applications by smoothing the meta-loss landscape. ES-Single samples a single perturbation per particle, that is kept fixed over the course of an inner problem (e.g., perturbations are not re-sampled for each partial unroll). Compared to PES, ES-Single is simpler to implement and has lower variance: the variance of ES-Single is constant with respect to the number of truncated unrolls, removing a key barrier in applying ES to long inner problems using short truncations. We show that ES-Single is unbiased for quadratic inner problems, and demonstrate empirically that its variance can be substantially lower than that of PES. ES-Single consistently outperforms PES on a variety of tasks, including a synthetic benchmark task, hyperparameter optimization, training recurrent neural networks, and training learned optimizers.

We present a multivariate, multi-step, and SLA-driven approach that incorporates 20 different radio access network (RAN) features, a custom feature set based on peak traffic hours, and handover-based clustering to leverage the spatiotemporal effects.

We also perform multi-step prediction up to 24 steps ahead and evaluate performance under both single-step and multi-step prediction conditions.

    "abstract": "This paper presents the application of triangle configuration B-splines (TCB-splines) for representing and analyzing the Kirchhoff-Love shell in the context of isogeometric analysis (IGA). The Kirchhoff-Love shell formulation requires global $C^1$-continuous basis functions. The nonuniform rational B-spline (NURBS)-based IGA has been extensively used for developing Kirchhoff-Love shell elements. However, shells with complex geometries inevitably need multiple patches and trimming techniques, where stitching patches with high continuity is a challenge. On the other hand, due to their unstructured nature, TCB-splines can accommodate general polygonal domains, have local refinement, and are flexible to model complex geometries with $C^1$ continuity, which naturally fit into the Kirchhoff-Love shell formulation with complex geometries. Therefore, we propose to use TCB-splines as basis functions for geometric representation and solution approximation. We apply our method to both linear and nonlinear benchmark shell problems, where the accuracy and robustness are validated. The applicability of the proposed approach to shell analysis is further exemplified by performing geometrically nonlinear Kirchhoff-Love shell simulations of a pipe junction and a front bumper represented by a single patch of TCB-splines.

    "abstract": "The computational power of contemporary quantum processors is limited by hardware errors that cause computations to fail. In principle, each quantum processor's computational capabilities can be described with a capability function that quantifies how well a processor can run each possible quantum circuit (i.e., program), as a map from circuits to the processor's success rates on those circuits. However, capability functions are typically unknown and challenging to model, as the particular errors afflicting a specific quantum processor are a priori unknown and difficult to completely characterize. In this work, we investigate using artificial neural networks to learn an approximation to a processor's capability function. We explore how to define the capability function, and we explain how data for training neural networks can be efficiently obtained for a capability function defined using process fidelity. We then investigate using convolutional neural networks to model a quantum computer's capability. Using simulations, we show that convolutional neural networks can accurately model a processor's capability when that processor experiences gate-dependent, time-dependent, and context-dependent stochastic errors. We then discuss some challenges to creating useful neural network capability models for experimental processors, such as generalizing beyond training distributions and modelling the effects of coherent errors. Lastly, we apply our neural networks to model the capabilities of cloud-access quantum computing systems, obtaining moderate prediction accuracy (average absolute error around 2-5%). ",

In this method, The output parameters and corresponding losses are separated, so the weights between output parameters are not considered. Not all partial derivatives participate in gradient backpropagation, and the remaining terms will be reused.Therefore, compared with traditional PINN, this method is a rapid version. Here, labeled data, physical constraints and network outputs are regarded as priori information, and the residuals of the N-S equations are regarded as posteriori information. So this method can deal with both data-driven and data-free problems. As a result, it can solve the special form of compressible N-S equations -- -Shallow-Water equations, and incompressible N-S equations. As boundary conditions are known, this method only needs the flow field information at a certain time to restore the past and future flow field information. We solve the progress of a solitary wave onto a shelving beach and the dispersion of the hot water in the flow, which show this method's potential in the marine engineering. We also use incompressible equations with exact solutions to prove this method's correctness and universality. We find that PINN needs more strict boundary conditions to solve the N-S equation, because it has no computational boundary compared with the finite element method. ",

We applied THINGS EEG2 dataset to train and test 72 independent EEG2EEG models corresponding to 72 pairs across 9 subjects. Our results demonstrate that EEG2EEG is able to effectively learn the mapping of neural representations in EEG signals from one subject to another and achieve high conversion performance. Additionally, the generated EEG signals contain clearer representations of visual information than that can be obtained from real data. This method establishes a novel and state-of-the-art framework for neural conversion of EEG signals, which can realize a flexible and high-performance mapping from individual to individual and provide insight for both neural engineering and cognitive neuroscience.

However, the focus of the literature thus far has been mostly on structured data, and fewer studies have addressed unstructured or multi-modal datasets. In this paper, we present an analysis of the most effective architectures for the fusion of deep learning models for the prediction of company credit rating classes, by using structured and unstructured datasets of different types. In these models, we tested different combinations of fusion strategies with different deep learning models, including CNN, LSTM, GRU, and BERT. We studied data fusion strategies in terms of level (including early and intermediate fusion) and techniques (including concatenation and cross-attention). Our results show that a CNN-based multi-modal model with two fusion strategies outperformed other multi-modal techniques. In addition, by comparing simple architectures with more complex ones, we found that more sophisticated deep learning models do not necessarily produce the highest performance; however, if attention-based models are producing the best results, cross-attention is necessary as a fusion strategy. Finally, our comparison of rating agencies on short-, medium-, and long-term performance shows that Moody's credit ratings outperform those of other agencies like Standard & Poor's and Fitch Ratings.

    "abstract": "The close coupling of artificial intelligence (AI) and electroencephalography (EEG) has substantially advanced human-computer interaction (HCI) technologies in the AI era. Different from traditional EEG systems, the interpretability and robustness of AI-based EEG systems are becoming particularly crucial. The interpretability clarifies the inner working mechanisms of AI models and thus can gain the trust of users. The robustness reflects the AI's reliability against attacks and perturbations, which is essential for sensitive and fragile EEG signals. Thus the interpretability and robustness of AI in EEG systems have attracted increasing attention, and their research has achieved great progress recently. However, there is still no survey covering recent advances in this field. In this paper, we present the first comprehensive survey and summarize the interpretable and robust AI techniques for EEG systems. Specifically, we first propose a taxonomy of interpretability by characterizing it into three types: backpropagation, perturbation, and inherently interpretable methods. Then we classify the robustness mechanisms into four classes: noise and artifacts, human variability, data acquisition instability, and adversarial attacks. Finally, we identify several critical and unresolved challenges for interpretable and robust AI in EEG systems and further discuss their future directions. ",

    "abstract": "In the stock market, a successful investment requires a good balance between profits and risks. Recently, stock recommendation has been widely studied in quantitative investment to select stocks with higher return ratios for investors. Despite the success in making profits, most existing recommendation approaches are still weak in risk control, which may lead to intolerable paper losses in practical stock investing. To effectively reduce risks, we draw inspiration from adversarial perturbations and propose a novel Split Variational Adversarial Training (SVAT) framework for risk-aware stock recommendation. Essentially, SVAT encourages the model to be sensitive to adversarial perturbations of risky stock examples and enhances the model's risk awareness by learning from perturbations. To generate representative adversarial examples as risk indicators, we devise a variational perturbation generator to model diverse risk factors. Particularly, the variational architecture enables our method to provide a rough risk quantification for investors, showing an additional advantage of interpretability. Experiments on three real-world stock market datasets show that SVAT effectively reduces the volatility of the stock recommendation model and outperforms state-of-the-art baseline methods by more than 30% in terms of risk-adjusted profits.

    "abstract": "Non-Line-of-Sight (NLoS) propagation condition is a crucial factor affecting the precision of the localization in the Ultra-Wideband (UWB) Indoor Positioning System (IPS). Numerous supervised Machine Learning (ML) approaches have been applied for NLoS identification to improve the accuracy of the IPS. However, it is difficult for existing ML approaches to maintain a high classification accuracy when the database contains a small number of NLoS signals and a large number of Line-of-Sight (LoS) signals. The inaccurate localization of the target node caused by this small number of NLoS signals can still be problematic. To solve this issue, we propose feature-based Gaussian Distribution (GD) and Generalized Gaussian Distribution (GGD) NLoS detection algorithms. By employing our detection algorithm for the imbalanced dataset, a classification accuracy of $96.7\\%$ and $98.0\\%$ can be achieved. We also compared the proposed algorithm with the existing cutting-edge such as Support-Vector-Machine (SVM), Decision Tree (DT), Naive Bayes (NB), and Neural Network (NN), which can achieve an accuracy of $92.6\\%$, $92.8\\%$, $93.2\\%$, and $95.5\\%$, respectively. The results demonstrate that the GGD algorithm can achieve high classification accuracy with the imbalanced dataset. Finally, the proposed algorithm can also achieve a higher classification accuracy for different ratios of LoS and NLoS signals which proves the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed method. ",

    "abstract": "This paper introduces a stochastic plug-and-play (PnP) sampling algorithm that leverages variable splitting to efficiently sample from a posterior distribution. The algorithm based on split Gibbs sampling (SGS) draws inspiration from the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). It divides the challenging task of posterior sampling into two simpler sampling problems. The first problem depends on the likelihood function, while the second is interpreted as a Bayesian denoising problem that can be readily carried out by a deep generative model. Specifically, for an illustrative purpose, the proposed method is implemented in this paper using state-of-the-art diffusion-based generative models. Akin to its deterministic PnP-based counterparts, the proposed method exhibits the great advantage of not requiring an explicit choice of the prior distribution, which is rather encoded into a pre-trained generative model. However, unlike optimization methods (e.g., PnP-ADMM) which generally provide only point estimates, the proposed approach allows conventional Bayesian estimators to be accompanied by confidence intervals at a reasonable additional computational cost. Experiments on commonly studied image processing problems illustrate the efficiency of the proposed sampling strategy. Its performance is compared to recent state-of-the-art optimization and sampling methods. ",

Under mild assumptions, we give non asymptotic bounds with high probability to quantify this convergence. Our main result is based on the McDiarmid inequality.
