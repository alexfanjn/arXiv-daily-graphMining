    "abstract": "Federated learning has been rapidly evolving and gaining popularity in recent years due to its privacy-preserving features, among other advantages. Nevertheless, the exchange of model updates and gradients in this architecture provides new attack surfaces for malicious users of the network which may jeopardize the model performance and user and data privacy. For this reason, one of the main motivations for decentralized federated learning is to eliminate server-related threats by removing the server from the network and compensating for it through technologies such as blockchain. However, this advantage comes at the cost of challenging the system with new privacy threats. Thus, performing a thorough security analysis in this new paradigm is necessary. This survey studies possible variations of threats and adversaries in decentralized federated learning and overviews the potential defense mechanisms. Trustability and verifiability of decentralized federated learning are also considered in this study. ",

    "abstract": "This study presents a new approach for estimating confidence in machine learning model predictions, specifically in regression tasks utilizing Earth Observation (EO) data, with a particular focus on mosquito abundance (MA) estimation. We take advantage of a Variational AutoEncoder architecture, to derive a confidence metric by the latent space representations of EO datasets. This methodology is pivotal in establishing a correlation between the Euclidean distance in latent representations and the Absolute Error (AE) in individual MA predictions. Our research focuses on EO datasets from the Veneto region in Italy and the Upper Rhine Valley in Germany, targeting areas significantly affected by mosquito populations. A key finding is a notable correlation of 0.46 between the AE of MA predictions and the proposed confidence metric. This correlation signifies a robust, new metric for quantifying the reliability and enhancing the trustworthiness of the AI model's predictions in the context of both EO data analysis and mosquito abundance studies.

    "abstract": "Reliable offroad autonomy requires low-latency, high-accuracy state estimates of pose as well as velocity, which remain viable throughout environments with sub-optimal operating conditions for the utilized perception modalities. As state estimation remains a single point of failure system in the majority of aspiring autonomous systems, failing to address the environmental degradation the perception sensors could potentially experience given the operating conditions, can be a mission-critical shortcoming. In this work, a method for integration of radar velocity information in a LiDAR-inertial odometry solution is proposed, enabling consistent estimation performance even with degraded LiDAR-inertial odometry. The proposed method utilizes the direct velocity-measuring capabilities of an Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave (FMCW) radar sensor to enhance the LiDAR-inertial smoother solution onboard the vehicle through integration of the forward velocity measurement into the graph-based smoother. This leads to increased robustness in the overall estimation solution, even in the absence of LiDAR data. This method was validated by hardware experiments conducted onboard an all-terrain vehicle traveling at high speed, ~12 m/s, in demanding offroad environments. ",

To improve the robustness/defense of MARL systems against adversarial attacks, the study of various adversarial attacks on reinforcement learning systems is very important. Previous works on adversarial attacks considered some possible features to attack in MDP, such as the action poisoning attacks, the reward poisoning attacks, and the state perception attacks. In this paper, we propose a brand-new form of attack called the camouflage attack in the MARL systems. In the camouflage attack, the attackers change the appearances of some objects without changing the actual objects themselves; and the camouflaged appearances may look the same to all the targeted recipient (victim) agents. The camouflaged appearances can mislead the recipient agents to misguided actions. We design algorithms that give the optimal camouflage attacks minimizing the rewards of recipient agents. Our numerical and theoretical results show that camouflage attacks can rival the more conventional, but likely more difficult state perception attacks. We also investigate cost-constrained camouflage attacks and showed numerically how cost budgets affect the attack performance. ",

This leaves us with a major inspiration: can LLMs be used to fully simulate the economic environment and generate data for efficient human choice prediction, substituting for the elaborated economic lab studies? We pioneer the study of this subject, demonstrating its feasibility.

However, the precision of GPS signals can be influenced by a range of factors, including wireless transmission and obstructions like buildings. Given the pivotal role of GPS signals in perception fusion and the potential for various interference, it becomes imperative to investigate whether specific GPS signals can easily mislead the multi-agent perception system. To address this concern, we frame the task as an adversarial attack challenge and introduce \\textsc{AdvGPS}, a method capable of generating adversarial GPS signals which are also stealthy for individual agents within the system, significantly reducing object detection accuracy. To enhance the success rates of these attacks in a black-box scenario, we introduce three types of statistically sensitive natural discrepancies: appearance-based discrepancy, distribution-based discrepancy, and task-aware discrepancy. Our extensive experiments on the OPV2V dataset demonstrate that these attacks substantially undermine the performance of state-of-the-art methods, showcasing remarkable transferability across different point cloud based 3D detection systems. This alarming revelation underscores the pressing need to address security implications within multi-agent perception systems, thereby underscoring a critical area of research. ",

    "abstract": "Machine unlearning requires removing the information of forgetting data while keeping the necessary information of remaining data. Despite recent advancements in this area, existing methodologies mainly focus on the effect of removing forgetting data without considering the negative impact this can have on the information of the remaining data, resulting in significant performance degradation after data removal. Although some methods try to repair the performance of remaining data after removal, the forgotten information can also return after repair. Such an issue is due to the intricate intertwining of the forgetting and remaining data. Without adequately differentiating the influence of these two kinds of data on the model, existing algorithms take the risk of either inadequate removal of the forgetting data or unnecessary loss of valuable information from the remaining data. To address this shortcoming, the present study undertakes a causal analysis of the unlearning and introduces a novel framework termed Causal Machine Unlearning (CaMU). This framework adds intervention on the information of remaining data to disentangle the causal effects between forgetting data and remaining data. Then CaMU eliminates the causal impact associated with forgetting data while concurrently preserving the causal relevance of the remaining data. Comprehensive empirical results on various datasets and models suggest that CaMU enhances performance on the remaining data and effectively minimizes the influences of forgetting data. Notably, this work is the first to interpret deep model unlearning tasks from a new perspective of causality and provide a solution based on causal analysis, which opens up new possibilities for future research in deep model unlearning.

However, most studies ignore the environmental impacts of producing mining equipment, which is problematic given the short lifespan of such highly specific hardware. In this study, we perform a cradle-to-gate life cycle assessment (LCA) of dedicated Bitcoin mining equipment, considering their specific architecture. Our results show that the application-specific integrated circuit designed for Bitcoin mining is the main contributor to production-related impacts. This observation applies to most impact categories, including the global warming potential. In addition, this finding stresses out the necessity to carefully consider the specificity of the hardware. By comparing these results with several usage scenarios, we also demonstrate that the impacts of producing this type of equipment can be significant (up to 80% of the total life cycle impacts), depending on the sources of electricity supply for the use phase. Therefore, we highlight the need to consider the production phase when assessing the environmental impacts of Bitcoin mining hardware. To test the validity of our results, we use the Sphera LCA and ecoinvent databases for the background modeling of our system. Surprisingly, it leads to results with variations of up to 4 orders of magnitude for toxicity-related indicators, despite using the same foreground modeling. This database mismatch phenomenon, already identified in previous studies, calls for better understanding, consideration and discussion of environmental impacts in the field of electronics, going well beyond climate change indicators.

The geometric, inertial, and frictional parameters of the slider are not known to the controller, nor are measurements of the slider's pose. We assume that the robot can be localized so that the global position of the contact point is always known and that the approximate initial position of the slider is provided. Simulations and real-world experiments show that our controller yields stable pushes that are robust to a wide range of slider parameters and state perturbations along both straight and curved paths. Furthermore, we use an admittance controller to adjust the pushing velocity based on the measured force when the slider contacts obstacles like walls. ",

This six degrees of freedom (DOF) model accounts for the behavior of deflection in the moving body frame, encompassing the bending, traction and torsion dynamics. The model is also designed to be compliant with the Two-Input-Two-Output Port (TITOP) approach, which offers the possibility to model complex multibody mechanical systems, while keeping the uncertain nature of the plant and condensing all the possible mechanical configurations in a single LFR. To evaluate the effectiveness of the model, various scenarios are considered and their results are tabulated. These scenarios include uniform beams with fixed root boundary conditions for different values of tip mass, root offset and angular velocity. The results from the analysis of the uniform cantilever beam are compared with solutions found in the literature and obtained from a commercial finite element software. Ultimately, this paper presents a multibody model for a spinning spacecraft mission scenario. A comprehensive analysis of the system dynamics is conducted, providing insights into the behavior of the spacecraft under spinning conditions. ",

Specifically, we aim to maximize the sum secrecy rate from all vehicular pairs subject to bandwidth and power resource constraints. For the considered problem, we first propose a solution based on the successive convex approximation (SCA) method, which has not been applied in this context before. To further reduce the complexity of the SCA-based method, we also propose a low-complexity solution based on a fast iterative shrinkage-thresholding algorithm (FISTA). Our simulation results for SCA and FISTA show a trade-off between convergence and runtime. While the SCA method achieves better convergence, the FISTA-based approach is at least 300 times faster than the SCA method. ",

Although the pipeline largely alleviates the issue of extracting essential information from giant KGs, efficiency is still an open challenge when scaling up hops in grounding the subgraphs. In this paper, we target at finding semantically related entity nodes in the subgraph to improve the efficiency of graph reasoning with KG. We propose a grounding-pruning-reasoning pipeline to prune noisy nodes, remarkably reducing the computation cost and memory usage while also obtaining decent subgraph representation. In detail, the pruning module first scores concept nodes based on the dependency distance between matched spans and then prunes the nodes according to score ranks. To facilitate the evaluation of pruned subgraphs, we also propose a graph attention network (GAT) based module to reason with the subgraph data.

In-phase and quadrature (IQ) impairments of the coherent transceiver (e.g. IQ skew and power imbalance) cause severe performance degradation. In the DSCM-based coherent PtMP optical networks, it is hard to realize far-end IQ-impairments estimation for the hub transmitter because the leaf on one subcarrier cannot acquire the signal on the symmetrical subcarrier. In this paper, we propose a far-end IQ-impairments estimation based on the specially designed time-and-frequency interleaving tones (TFITs), which can simultaneously estimate IQ skews and power imbalances of the hub transmitter and leaf receiver at an individual leaf. The feasibility of the TFITs-based IQ-impairments estimation has been experimentally verified by setting up $8$Gbaud/SC$\\times$$4$SCs DSCM-based coherent PtMP optical network. The experimental results depict that the absolute errors in the estimated IQ skew and power imbalance are within $\\pm 0.5$ps and $\\pm 0.2$dB, respectively. In conclusion, TFITs-based IQ-impairments estimation has great potential for DSCM-based coherent PtMP optical networks. ",

Upon measuring the difference in loss functions, we provide an upper bound of the performance deterioration due to imperfect wireless channels. Moreover, we characterize the transmission rate under task performance guarantees and propose the channel capacity gain resulting from the inherent robustness in wireless distributed learning. An efficient algorithm for approximating the derived upper bound is established for practical use. The effectiveness of our results is illustrated by the numerical simulations. ",

    "title": "Graph Contrastive Learning with Cohesive Subgraph Awareness",
    "abstract": "Graph contrastive learning (GCL) has emerged as a state-of-the-art strategy for learning representations of diverse graphs including social and biomedical networks. GCL widely uses stochastic graph topology augmentation, such as uniform node dropping, to generate augmented graphs. However, such stochastic augmentations may severely damage the intrinsic properties of a graph and deteriorate the following representation learning process. We argue that incorporating an awareness of cohesive subgraphs during the graph augmentation and learning processes has the potential to enhance GCL performance. To this end, we propose a novel unified framework called CTAug, to seamlessly integrate cohesion awareness into various existing GCL mechanisms. In particular, CTAug comprises two specialized modules: topology augmentation enhancement and graph learning enhancement. The former module generates augmented graphs that carefully preserve cohesion properties, while the latter module bolsters the graph encoder's ability to discern subgraph patterns. Theoretical analysis shows that CTAug can strictly improve existing GCL mechanisms. Empirical experiments verify that CTAug can achieve state-of-the-art performance for graph representation learning, especially for graphs with high degrees.

    "title": "Assertion Detection Large Language Model In-context Learning LoRA  Fine-tuning",
    "abstract": "In this study, we aim to address the task of assertion detection when extracting medical concepts from clinical notes, a key process in clinical natural language processing (NLP). Assertion detection in clinical NLP usually involves identifying assertion types for medical concepts in the clinical text, namely certainty (whether the medical concept is positive, negated, possible, or hypothetical), temporality (whether the medical concept is for present or the past history), and experiencer (whether the medical concept is described for the patient or a family member). These assertion types are essential for healthcare professionals to quickly and clearly understand the context of medical conditions from unstructured clinical texts, directly influencing the quality and outcomes of patient care. Although widely used, traditional methods, particularly rule-based NLP systems and machine learning or deep learning models, demand intensive manual efforts to create patterns and tend to overlook less common assertion types, leading to an incomplete understanding of the context. To address this challenge, our research introduces a novel methodology that utilizes Large Language Models (LLMs) pre-trained on a vast array of medical data for assertion detection. We enhanced the current method with advanced reasoning techniques, including Tree of Thought (ToT), Chain of Thought (CoT), and Self-Consistency (SC), and refine it further with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) fine-tuning. We first evaluated the model on the i2b2 2010 assertion dataset. Our method achieved a micro-averaged F-1 of 0.89, with 0.11 improvements over the previous works. To further assess the generalizability of our approach, we extended our evaluation to a local dataset that focused on sleep concept extraction. Our approach achieved an F-1 of 0.74, which is 0.31 higher than the previous method. ",

    "title": "Estimating Diffusion Degree on Graph Streams",
    "abstract": "The challenges of graph stream algorithms are twofold. First, each edge needs to be processed only once, and second, it needs to work on highly constrained memory. Diffusion degree is a measure of node centrality that can be calculated (for all nodes) trivially for static graphs using a single Breadth-First Search (BFS). However, keeping track of the Diffusion Degree in a graph stream is nontrivial. The memory requirement for exact calculation is equivalent to keeping the whole graph in memory. The present paper proposes an estimator (or sketch) of diffusion degree for graph streams. We prove the correctness of the proposed sketch and the upper bound of the estimated error. Given $\\epsilon, \\delta \\in (0,1)$, we achieve error below $\\epsilon(b_u-a_u)d_u\\lambda$ in node $u$ with probability $1-\\delta$ by utilizing $O(n\\frac1{\\epsilon^2}\\log{\\frac1{\\delta}})$ space, where $b_u$ and $a_u$ are the maximum and minimum degrees of neighbors of $u$, $\\lambda$ is diffusion probability, and $d_u$ is the degree of node $u$. With the help of this sketch, we propose an algorithm to extract the top-$k$ influencing nodes in the graph stream. Comparative experiments show that the spread of top-$k$ nodes by the proposed graph stream algorithm is equivalent to or better than the spread of top-$k$ nodes extracted by the exact algorithm. ",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in Graph Neural Networks (GNN) have led to a considerable growth in graph data modeling for multi-modal data which contains various types of nodes and edges. Although some integrative prediction solutions have been developed recently for network-structured data, these methods have some restrictions. For a node classification task involving multi-modal data, certain data modalities may perform better when predicting one class, while others might excel in predicting a different class. Thus, to obtain a better learning representation, advanced computational methodologies are required for the integrative analysis of multi-modal data. Moreover, existing integrative tools lack a comprehensive and cohesive understanding of the rationale behind their specific predictions, making them unsuitable for enhancing model interpretability. Addressing these restrictions, we introduce a novel integrative neural network approach for multi-modal data networks, named Integrative Graph Convolutional Networks (IGCN). IGCN learns node embeddings from multiple topologies and fuses the multiple node embeddings into a weighted form by assigning attention coefficients to the node embeddings. Our proposed attention mechanism helps identify which types of data receive more emphasis for each sample to predict a certain class. Therefore, IGCN has the potential to unravel previously unknown characteristics within different node classification tasks. We benchmarked IGCN on several datasets from different domains, including a multi-omics dataset to predict cancer subtypes and a multi-modal clinical dataset to predict the progression of Alzheimer's disease. Experimental results show that IGCN outperforms or is on par with the state-of-the-art and baseline methods. ",

Contrastive learning, a prominent self-supervised approach for molecular representation learning, relies on establishing positive and negative pairs. However, this binary similarity categorization oversimplifies the nature of complex molecular relationships and overlooks the degree of relative similarities among molecules, posing challenges to the effectiveness and generality of representation learning. In response to this challenge, we propose the Graph Multi-Similarity Learning for Molecular Property Prediction (GraphMSL) framework. GraphMSL incorporates a generalized multi-similarity metric in a continuous scale, capturing self-similarity and relative similarities. The unimodal multi-similarity metrics are derived from various chemical modalities, and the fusion of these metrics into a multimodal form significantly enhances the effectiveness of GraphMSL. In addition, the flexibility of fusion function can reshape the focus of the model to convey different chemical semantics. GraphMSL proves effective in drug discovery evaluations through various downstream tasks and post-hoc analysis of learnt representations. Its notable performance suggests significant potential for the exploration of new drug candidates. ",

    "abstract": "The widespread deployment of control-flow integrity has propelled non-control data attacks into the mainstream. In the domain of OS kernel exploits, by corrupting critical non-control data, local attackers can directly gain root access or privilege escalation without hijacking the control flow. As a result, OS kernels have been restricting the availability of such non-control data. This forces attackers to continue to search for more exploitable non-control data in OS kernels. However, discovering unknown non-control data can be daunting because they are often tied heavily to semantics and lack universal patterns. We make two contributions in this paper: (1) discover critical non-control objects in the file subsystem and (2) analyze their exploitability. This work represents the first study, with minimal domain knowledge, to semi-automatically discover and evaluate exploitable non-control data within the file subsystem of the Linux kernel. Our solution utilizes a custom analysis and testing framework that statically and dynamically identifies promising candidate objects. Furthermore, we categorize these discovered objects into types that are suitable for various exploit strategies, including a novel strategy necessary to overcome the defense that isolates many of these objects. These objects have the advantage of being exploitable without requiring KASLR, thus making the exploits simpler and more reliable. We use 18 real-world CVEs to evaluate the exploitability of the file system objects using various exploit strategies. We develop 10 end-to-end exploits using a subset of CVEs against the kernel with all state-of-the-art mitigations enabled. ",

    "abstract": "Current implementations of differentially-private (DP) systems either lack support to track the global privacy budget consumed on a dataset, or fail to faithfully maintain the state continuity of this budget. We show that failure to maintain a privacy budget enables an adversary to mount replay, rollback and fork attacks - obtaining answers to many more queries than what a secure system would allow. As a result the attacker can reconstruct secret data that DP aims to protect - even if DP code runs in a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE). We propose ElephantDP, a system that aims to provide the same guarantees as a trusted curator in the global DP model would, albeit set in an untrusted environment. Our system relies on a state continuity module to provide protection for the privacy budget and a TEE to faithfully execute DP code and update the budget. To provide security, our protocol makes several design choices including the content of the persistent state and the order between budget updates and query answers. We prove that ElephantDP provides liveness (i.e., the protocol can restart from a correct state and respond to queries as long as the budget is not exceeded) and DP confidentiality (i.e., an attacker learns about a dataset as much as it would from interacting with a trusted curator). Our implementation and evaluation of the protocol use Intel SGX as a TEE to run the DP code and a network of TEEs to maintain state continuity. Compared to an insecure baseline, we observe only 1.1-2$\\times$ overheads and lower relative overheads for larger datasets and complex DP queries. ",

    "abstract": "Self-supervised learning (SSL) has attracted increased attention for learning meaningful speech representations. Speech SSL models, such as WavLM, employ masked prediction training to encode general-purpose representations. In contrast, speaker SSL models, exemplified by DINO-based models, adopt utterance-level training objectives primarily for speaker representation. Understanding how these models represent information is essential for refining model efficiency and effectiveness. Unlike the various analyses of speech SSL, there has been limited investigation into what information speaker SSL captures and how its representation differs from speech SSL or other fully-supervised speaker models. This paper addresses these fundamental questions. We explore the capacity to capture various speech properties by applying SUPERB evaluation probing tasks to speech and speaker SSL models. We also examine which layers are predominantly utilized for each task to identify differences in how speech is represented. Furthermore, we conduct direct comparisons to measure the similarities between layers within and across models. Our analysis unveils that 1) the capacity to represent content information is somewhat unrelated to enhanced speaker representation, 2) specific layers of speech SSL models would be partly specialized in capturing linguistic information, and 3) speaker SSL models tend to disregard linguistic information but exhibit more sophisticated speaker representation.

We designed several case studies in a simulated environment and examined 3 different emotions; positive (happy), neutral and negative (angry). A survey study was conducted with 70 participants to explore their impressions about the navigation of the robot and compare the human safety and comfort measurements results. Both survey and simulation results showed that integrating emotions into proxemic zones has a significant effect on the physical safety of a human. The results revealed that when a person is angry, the robot is expected to navigate further than the standard distance to support his/her physiological comfort and safety. The results also showed that reducing the navigation distance is not preferred when a person is happy. ",

However, previous related work rarely considers both situations at the same time. This implies the deployment of multiple models and thus more computational burden. The main reasons for this lack of an integrated model are caused by two factors: (1) The lack of a dataset including both physical and digital attacks with ID consistency which means the same ID covers the real face and all attack types; (2) Given the large intra-class variance between these two attacks, it is difficult to learn a compact feature space to detect both attacks simultaneously. To address these issues, we collect a Unified physical-digital Attack dataset, called UniAttackData. The dataset consists of $1,800$ participations of 2 and 12 physical and digital attacks, respectively, resulting in a total of 29,706 videos. Then, we propose a Unified Attack Detection framework based on Vision-Language Models (VLMs), namely UniAttackDetection, which includes three main modules: the Teacher-Student Prompts (TSP) module, focused on acquiring unified and specific knowledge respectively; the Unified Knowledge Mining (UKM) module, designed to capture a comprehensive feature space; and the Sample-Level Prompt Interaction (SLPI) module, aimed at grasping sample-level semantics. These three modules seamlessly form a robust unified attack detection framework. Extensive experiments on UniAttackData and three other datasets demonstrate the superiority of our approach for unified face attack detection. ",

On the other hand, in bipartite graphs the forcing number corresponds to the famous feedback vertex set problem in digraphs. Determining the complexity of finding the smallest forcing number of a given planar graph is still a widely open and important question in this area, originally proposed by Afshani, Hatami, and Mahmoodian in 2004. We take a first step towards the resolution of this question by providing an algorithm that determines the set of all possible forcing numbers of an outerplanar graph in polynomial time. This is the first polynomial-time algorithm concerning this problem for a class of graphs of comparable or greater generality. ",

However, the subjective nature of aesthetic preferences presents a significant challenge in defining and quantifying what makes an interior design visually appealing. The current paper addresses this gap by introducing a novel methodology for quantifying and predicting aesthetic preferences in interior design. Our study combines fuzzy logic with image processing techniques. We collected a dataset of interior design images from social media platforms, focusing on essential visual attributes such as color harmony, lightness, and complexity. We integrate these features using weighted average to compute a general aesthetic score. Our approach considers individual color preferences in calculating the overall aesthetic preference. We initially gather user ratings for primary colors like red, brown, and others to understand their preferences. Then, we use the pixel count of the top five dominant colors in the image to get the color scheme preference. The color scheme preference and the aesthetic score are then passed as inputs to the fuzzy inference system to calculate an overall preference score. This score represents a comprehensive measure of the user's preference for a particular interior design, considering their color choices and general aesthetic appeal. We used the 2AFC (Two-Alternative Forced Choice) method to validate our methodology, achieving a notable hit rate of 0.7. This study can help designers and professionals better understand and meet people's interior design preferences, especially in a world that relies heavily on digital media. ",

Longitudinal brain stimulation-based interventions like transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) induce short-term changes in the resting membrane potential and influence cognitive processes. However, very little research has been conducted on predicting these changes in cognitive performance post-intervention. In this research, we intend to address this gap in the literature by employing different EEG-based functional connectivity analyses and machine learning algorithms to predict changes in cognitive performance in a complex multitasking task. Forty subjects were divided into experimental and active-control conditions. On Day 1, all subjects executed a multitasking task with simultaneous 32-channel EEG being acquired. From Day 2 to Day 7, subjects in the experimental condition undertook 15 minutes of 2mA anodal tDCS stimulation during task training. Subjects in the active-control condition undertook 15 minutes of sham stimulation during task training. On Day 10, all subjects again executed the multitasking task with EEG acquisition. Source-level functional connectivity metrics, namely phase lag index and directed transfer function, were extracted from the EEG data on Day 1 and Day 10. Various machine learning models were employed to predict changes in cognitive performance. Results revealed that the multi-layer perceptron and directed transfer function recorded a cross-validation training RMSE of 5.11% and a test RMSE of 4.97%.

However, the inherent openness of sequential recommender systems renders them vulnerable to poisoning attacks, where fraudulent users are injected into the training data to manipulate learned patterns. Traditional defense strategies predominantly depend on predefined assumptions or rules extracted from specific known attacks, limiting their generalizability to unknown attack types. To solve the above problems, considering the rich open-world knowledge encapsulated in Large Language Models (LLMs), our research initially focuses on the capabilities of LLMs in the detection of unknown fraudulent activities within recommender systems, a strategy we denote as LLM4Dec. Empirical evaluations demonstrate the substantial capability of LLMs in identifying unknown fraudsters, leveraging their expansive, open-world knowledge. Building upon this, we propose the integration of LLMs into defense strategies to extend their effectiveness beyond the confines of known attacks. We propose LoRec, an advanced framework that employs LLM-Enhanced Calibration to strengthen the robustness of sequential recommender systems against poisoning attacks. LoRec integrates an LLM-enhanced CalibraTor (LCT) that refines the training process of sequential recommender systems with knowledge derived from LLMs, applying a user-wise reweighting to diminish the impact of fraudsters injected by attacks. By incorporating LLMs' open-world knowledge, the LCT effectively converts the limited, specific priors or rules into a more general pattern of fraudsters, offering improved defenses against poisoning attacks. Our comprehensive experiments validate that LoRec, as a general framework, significantly strengthens the robustness of sequential recommender systems. ",

    "abstract": "It is very important to locate survivors from collapsed buildings so that rescue operations can be arranged. Many lives are lost due to lack of competent systems to detect people in these collapsed buildings at the right time. So here we have designed a hand gesture controlled robot which is capable of detecting humans under these collapsed building parts. The proposed work can be used to access specific locations that are not humanly possible, and detect those humans trapped under the rubble of collapsed buildings. This information is then used to notify the rescue team to take adequate measures and initiate rescue operations accordingly. ",

    "abstract": "Distillation-based federated learning has emerged as a promising collaborative learning approach, where clients share the output logit vectors of a public dataset rather than their private model parameters. This practice reduces the risk of privacy invasion attacks and facilitates heterogeneous learning. The landscape of poisoning attacks within distillation-based federated learning is complex, with existing research employing traditional data poisoning strategies targeting the models' parameters. However, these attack schemes primarily have shortcomings rooted in their original designs, which target the model parameters rather than the logit vectors. Furthermore, they do not adequately consider the role of logit vectors in carrying information during the knowledge transfer process. This misalignment results in less efficiency in the context of distillation-based federated learning. Due to the limitations of existing methodologies, our research delves into the intrinsic properties of the logit vector, striving for a more nuanced understanding. We introduce a two-stage scheme for logit poisoning attacks, addressing previous shortcomings. Initially, we collect the local logits, generate the representative vectors, categorize the logit elements within the vector, and design a shuffling table to maximize information entropy. Then, we intentionally scale the shuffled logit vectors to enhance the magnitude of the target vectors. Concurrently, we propose an efficient defense algorithm to counter this new poisoning scheme by calculating the distance between estimated benign vectors and vectors uploaded by users. Through extensive experiments, our study illustrates the significant threat posed by the proposed logit poisoning attack and highlights the effectiveness of our defense algorithm. ",

    "abstract": "Message passing Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are known to be limited in expressive power by the 1-WL color-refinement test for graph isomorphism. Other more expressive models either are computationally expensive or need preprocessing to extract structural features from the graph. In this work, we propose to make GNNs universal by guiding the learning process with exact isomorphism solver techniques which operate on the paradigm of Individualization and Refinement (IR), a method to artificially introduce asymmetry and further refine the coloring when 1-WL stops. Isomorphism solvers generate a search tree of colorings whose leaves uniquely identify the graph. However, the tree grows exponentially large and needs hand-crafted pruning techniques which are not desirable from a learning perspective. We take a probabilistic view and approximate the search tree of colorings (i.e. embeddings) by sampling multiple paths from root to leaves of the search tree. To learn more discriminative representations, we guide the sampling process with particle filter updates, a principled approach for sequential state estimation. Our algorithm is end-to-end differentiable, can be applied with any GNN as backbone and learns richer graph representations with only linear increase in runtime. Experimental evaluation shows that our approach consistently outperforms leading GNN models on both synthetic benchmarks for isomorphism detection as well as real-world datasets. ",

By employing one shared BERT-type network to refine textual and cross-modal features simultaneously, SNP is lightweight and could support various downstream applications. Second, based on the intuition that people always pay attention to several \"significant words\" when understanding a sentence, we propose the Significant Semantic Strengthening (S3) strategy, which includes a novel masking and matching proxy task to promote the pre-training performance. Experiments conducted on three downstream video-text tasks and six datasets demonstrate that, we establish a new state-of-the-art in pixel-level video-text pre-training; we also achieve a satisfactory balance between the pre-training efficiency and the fine-tuning performance.

Neural compression models learn to encode an image into a quantized latent representation that can be efficiently sent to the decoder, which decodes the quantized latent into a reconstructed image. While these models have proven successful in practice, they lead to sub-optimal results due to imperfect optimization and limitations in the encoder and decoder capacity. Recent work shows how to use stochastic Gumbel annealing (SGA) to refine the latents of pre-trained neural image compression models. We extend this idea by introducing SGA+, which contains three different methods that build upon SGA. Further, we give a detailed analysis of our proposed methods, show how they improve performance, and show that they are less sensitive to hyperparameter choices. Besides, we show how each method can be extended to three- instead of two-class rounding. Finally, we show how refinement of the latents with our best-performing method improves the compression performance on the Tecnick dataset and how it can be deployed to partly move along the rate-distortion curve.

Infusing graph inductive-biases in the innately structure-agnostic transformer architecture in the form of structural or positional encodings (PEs) is key to achieving these impressive results. However, designing such encodings is tricky and disparate attempts have been made to engineer such encodings including Laplacian eigenvectors, relative random-walk probabilities (RRWP), spatial encodings, centrality encodings, edge encodings etc. In this work, we argue that such encodings may not be required at all, provided the attention mechanism itself incorporates information about the graph structure. We introduce Eigenformer, which uses a novel spectrum-aware attention mechanism cognizant of the Laplacian spectrum of the graph, and empirically show that it achieves performance comparable to SOTA MP-GNN architectures and Graph Transformers on a number of standard GNN benchmark datasets, even surpassing the SOTA on some datasets. We also find that our architecture is much faster to train in terms of number of epochs, presumably due to the innate graph inductive biases. ",

To address this issue, we propose DE-TSMCL, an innovative distillation enhanced framework for long sequence time series forecasting.

Meanwhile, we design a supervised task to learn more robust representations and facilitate the contrastive learning process. Finally, we jointly optimize the above two tasks.

To address these issues, we propose an expandable Subject Word Embedding Altering (SWEA) framework, which modifies the representation of subjects and achieve the goal of editing knowledge during the inference stage. SWEA uses precise key matching outside the model and performs reliable subject word embedding altering, thus protecting the original weights of the model without increasing inference overhead. We then propose optimizing then suppressing fusion method, which first optimizes the embedding vector for the editing target and then suppresses the Knowledge Embedding Dimension (KED) to obtain the final fused embedding. We thus propose SWEAOS method for editing factual knowledge in LLMs. We demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of SWEAOS on the COUNTERFACT and zsRE datasets. To further validate the reasoning ability of SWEAOS in editing knowledge, we evaluate it on the more complex RIPPLEEDITS benchmark. The results on two subdatasets demonstrate that our SWEAOS possesses state-of-the-art reasoning ability. ",

Our preliminary findings from multiple platforms robustly indicate that rumors tend to spread more deeply, while non-rumors distribute more broadly. Interestingly, we discover that the spread of rumors is slower, persists longer, and, in most cases, involves fewer participants than that of non-rumors. And an undiscovered highlight is that reputable active users, termed `onlookers', inadvertently or unwittingly spread rumors due to their extensive online interactions and the allure of sensational fake news. Conversely, celebrities exhibit caution, mindful of releasing unverified information. Additionally, we identify cascade features aligning with exponential patterns, highlight the Credibility Erosion Effect (CEE) phenomenon in the propagation process, and discover the different contents and policies between the two platforms.

However, semantic inconsistency, mainly due to missing modal attributes, poses a significant challenge. Traditional approaches rely on attribute interpolation, but this often introduces modality noise, distorting the original semantics. Moreover, the lack of a universal theoretical framework limits advancements in achieving semantic consistency. This study introduces a novel approach, DESAlign, which addresses these issues by applying a theoretical framework based on Dirichlet energy to ensure semantic consistency. We discover that semantic inconsistency leads to model overfitting to modality noise, causing performance fluctuations, particularly when modalities are missing. DESAlign innovatively combats over-smoothing and interpolates absent semantics using existing modalities. Our approach includes a multi-modal knowledge graph learning strategy and a propagation technique that employs existing semantic features to compensate for missing ones, providing explicit Euler solutions. Comprehensive evaluations across 18 benchmarks, including monolingual and bilingual scenarios, demonstrate that DESAlign surpasses existing methods, setting a new standard in performance. Further testing on 42 benchmarks with high rates of missing modalities confirms its robustness, offering an effective solution to semantic inconsistency in real-world MMKGs. ",

A key enabler for generating high-resolution images with low computational cost has been the development of latent diffusion models (LDMs). In contrast to conventional diffusion models, LDMs perform the denoising process in the low-dimensional latent space of a pre-trained autoencoder (AE) instead of the high-dimensional image space. Despite their relevance, the forensic analysis of LDMs is still in its infancy. In this work we propose AEROBLADE, a novel detection method which exploits an inherent component of LDMs: the AE used to transform images between image and latent space. We find that generated images can be more accurately reconstructed by the AE than real images, allowing for a simple detection approach based on the reconstruction error. Most importantly, our method is easy to implement and does not require any training, yet nearly matches the performance of detectors that rely on extensive training. We empirically demonstrate that AEROBLADE is effective against state-of-the-art LDMs including Stable Diffusion and Midjourney. Beyond detection, our approach allows for the qualitative analysis of images, which can be leveraged for identifying inpainted regions. ",

The cooperation and competition between UAV BSs in the communication network leads to a Markov game problem. Multi-agent reinforcement learning is a significant solution for the above decision-making. However, there are still many common issues, such as the instability of the system and low utilization of historical data, that limit its application. In this paper, a novel graph-attention multi-agent trust region (GA-MATR) reinforcement learning framework is proposed to solve the multi-UAV assisted communication problem. Graph recurrent network is introduced to process and analyze complex topology of the communication network, so as to extract useful information and patterns from observational information. The attention mechanism provides additional weighting for conveyed information, so that the critic network can accurately evaluate the value of behavior for UAV BSs. This provides more reliable feedback signals and helps the actor network update the strategy more effectively. Ablation simulations indicate that the proposed approach attains improved convergence over the baselines. UAV BSs learn the optimal communication strategies to achieve their maximum cumulative rewards. Additionally, multi-agent trust region method with monotonic convergence provides an estimated Nash equilibrium for the multi-UAV assisted communication Markov game. ",

In PVLR, we first introduce a dual-prompting strategy comprising Knowledge-Aware Prompting (KAP) and Context-Aware Prompting (CAP). KAP utilizes fixed prompts to capture the intrinsic semantic knowledge and relationships across all labels, while CAP employs learnable prompts to capture context-aware label semantics and relationships. Later, we propose an Interaction and Fusion Module (IFM) to interact and fuse the representations obtained from KAP and CAP. In contrast to the unidirectional fusion in previous works, we introduce a Dual-Modal Attention (DMA) that enables bidirectional interaction between textual and visual features, yielding context-aware label representations and semantic-related visual representations, which are subsequently used to calculate similarities and generate final predictions for all labels. Extensive experiments on three popular datasets including MS-COCO, Pascal VOC 2007, and NUS-WIDE demonstrate the superiority of PVLR. ",

Of particular interest is the problem of, given a specific bipartite network, to identify possible respective groups or clusters characterized by similar interconnecting patterns. The present work approaches this issue by extending and complementing a previously described coincidence similarity methodology (Bioarxiv, doi.org/10.1101/2022.07.16.500294) in several manners, including the consideration of direct and non-directed bipartite networks, the characterization of groups in those networks, as well as considering synthetic bipartite networks presenting groups as a resource for studying the performance of the described methodology. Several interesting results are described and discussed, including the corroboration of the potential of the coincidence similarity methodology for achieving enhanced separation between the groups in bipartite networks.

In this scenario, understanding the factors that capture audience attention and drive viral content is crucial. Employing Gibrat's Law, which posits that an entity's growth rate is unrelated to its size, we examine the engagement growth dynamics of news outlets on social media. Our analysis encloses the Facebook historical data of over a thousand news outlets, encompassing approximately 57 million posts in four European languages from 2008 to the end of 2022. We discover universal growth dynamics according to which news virality is independent of the traditional size or engagement with the outlet. Moreover, our analysis reveals a significant long-term impact of news source reliability on engagement growth, with engagement induced by unreliable sources decreasing over time.

One major field, underexplored in the neuromorphic setting, is Natural Language Processing (NLP), where most state-of-the-art solutions still heavily rely on resource-consuming and power-hungry traditional deep learning architectures. Therefore, it is compelling to design NLP models for neuromorphic architectures due to their low energy requirements, with the additional benefit of a more human-brain-like operating model for processing information. However, one of the biggest issues with bringing NLP to the neuromorphic setting is in properly encoding text into a spike train so that it can be seamlessly handled by both current and future SNN architectures. In this paper, we compare various methods of encoding text as spikes and assess each method's performance in an associated SNN on a downstream NLP task, namely, sentiment analysis. Furthermore, we go on to propose a new method of encoding text as spikes that outperforms a widely-used rate-coding technique, Poisson rate-coding, by around 13\\% on our benchmark NLP tasks. Subsequently, we demonstrate the energy efficiency of SNNs implemented in hardware for the sentiment analysis task compared to traditional deep neural networks, observing an energy efficiency increase of more than 32x during inference and 60x during training while incurring the expected energy-performance tradeoff.

Combining perception, planning and prediction allows us to model the interactions between robots and pedestrians, resulting in impressive outcomes especially with recent approaches based on deep reinforcement learning (RL). However, these works do not consider multi-robot scenarios. In this paper, we present MultiSoc, a new method for learning multi-agent socially aware navigation strategies using RL. Inspired by recent works on multi-agent deep RL, our method leverages graph-based representation of agent interactions, combining the positions and fields of view of entities (pedestrians and agents). Each agent uses a model based on two Graph Neural Network combined with attention mechanisms. First an edge-selector produces a sparse graph, then a crowd coordinator applies node attention to produce a graph representing the influence of each entity on the others. This is incorporated into a model-free RL framework to learn multi-agent policies. We evaluate our approach on simulation and provide a series of experiments in a set of various conditions (number of agents / pedestrians). Empirical results show that our method learns faster than social navigation deep RL mono-agent techniques, and enables efficient multi-agent implicit coordination in challenging crowd navigation with multiple heterogeneous humans. Furthermore, by incorporating customizable meta-parameters, we can adjust the neighborhood density to take into account in our navigation strategy. ",

    "abstract": "Recent studies have used unsupervised domain adaptive object detection (UDAOD) methods to bridge the domain gap in remote sensing (RS) images. However, UDAOD methods typically assume that the source domain data can be accessed during the domain adaptation process. This setting is often impractical in the real world due to RS data privacy and transmission difficulty. To address this challenge, we propose a practical source-free object detection (SFOD) setting for RS images, which aims to perform target domain adaptation using only the source pre-trained model. We propose a new SFOD method for RS images consisting of two parts: perturbed domain generation and alignment. The proposed multilevel perturbation constructs the perturbed domain in a simple yet efficient form by perturbing the domain-variant features at the image level and feature level according to the color and style bias. The proposed multilevel alignment calculates feature and label consistency between the perturbed domain and the target domain across the teacher-student network, and introduces the distillation of feature prototype to mitigate the noise of pseudo-labels. By requiring the detector to be consistent in the perturbed domain and the target domain, the detector is forced to focus on domaininvariant features. Extensive results of three synthetic-to-real experiments and three cross-sensor experiments have validated the effectiveness of our method which does not require access to source domain RS images. Furthermore, experiments on computer vision datasets show that our method can be extended to other fields as well. Our code will be available at: https://weixliu.github.io/ . ",

Related literature has explored their detection using various approaches leveraging Machine and Deep Learning. While these approaches are effective in detecting malware, they do not answer how to use this intelligence to protect against threats, raising concerns about their applicability in a hostile environment. Solutions that focus on mitigation rarely explore how to prevent and not just alert or halt its execution, especially when considering Linux-based samples. This paper presents GuardFS, a file system-based approach to investigate the integration of detection and mitigation of ransomware. Using a bespoke overlay file system, data is extracted before files are accessed. Models trained on this data are used by three novel defense configurations that obfuscate, delay, or track access to the file system. The experiments on GuardFS test the configurations in a reactive setting. The results demonstrate that although data loss cannot be completely prevented, it can be significantly reduced. Usability and performance analysis demonstrate that the defense effectiveness of the configurations relates to their impact on resource consumption and usability. ",

In this paper, we investigate the possibility of discarding residual learning by employing large implicit kernels to achieve full context interaction at each layer of the network. To accomplish it, we introduce coordinate-based implicit MLPs as a slow network to generate hyper-kernels for another fast convolutional network. To get context-varying weights for fast dynamic encoding, we propose a $\\mathrm{Hyper}\\mathcal{Z{\\cdot}Z{\\cdot}W}$ operator that connects hyper-kernels ($\\mathcal{W}$) and hidden activations ($\\mathcal{Z}$) through simple elementwise multiplication, followed by convolution of $\\mathcal{Z}$ using the context-dependent $\\mathcal{W}$. Based on this design, we present a novel Terminator architecture that integrates hyper-kernels of different sizes to produce multi-branch hidden representations for enhancing the feature extraction capability of each layer. Additionally, a bottleneck layer is employed to compress the concatenated channels, allowing only valuable information to propagate to the subsequent layers. Notably, our model incorporates several innovative components and exhibits excellent properties, such as introducing local feedback error for updating the slow network, stable zero-mean features, faster training convergence, and fewer model parameters. Extensive experimental results on pixel-level 1D and 2D image classification benchmarks demonstrate the superior performance of our architecture. ",

Another finding underscores the viability of creating a new model tailored to a specific scenario and training it on a specific dataset.

In this paper, we apply tools developed in neuroscience and information theory to propose both a novel practical approach to network interpretability and theoretical insights into polysemanticity and the density of codes. We infer levels of redundancy in the network's code by inspecting the eigenspectrum of the activation's covariance matrix. Furthermore, we show how random projections can reveal whether a network exhibits a smooth or non-differentiable code and hence how interpretable the code is. This same framework explains the advantages of polysemantic neurons to learning performance and explains trends found in recent results by Elhage et al.~(2022). Our approach advances the pursuit of interpretability in neural networks, providing insights into their underlying structure and suggesting new avenues for circuit-level interpretability. ",

In such a context, robotic vision plays a central role in enabling service robots to perceive high-level environmental features from visual observations. Despite the data-driven approaches based on deep learning push the boundaries of vision systems, applying these techniques to real-world robotic scenarios presents unique methodological challenges. Traditional models fail to represent the challenging perception constraints typical of service robots and must be adapted for the specific environment where robots finally operate. We propose a method leveraging photorealistic simulations that balances data quality and acquisition costs for synthesizing visual datasets from the robot perspective used to train deep architectures. Then, we show the benefits in qualifying a general detector for the target domain in which the robot is deployed, showing also the trade-off between the effort for obtaining new examples from such a setting and the performance gain. In our extensive experimental campaign, we focus on the door detection task (namely recognizing the presence and the traversability of doorways) that, in dynamic settings, is useful to infer the topology of the map.

However, the working mechanisms of safety prompts have not yet been fully understood, which hinders the potential for automatically optimizing them for improved LLM safety. Motivated by this problem, we investigate the impact of safety prompts from the perspective of model representations. We find that in models' representation space, harmful and harmless queries can be largely distinguished, but this is not noticeably enhanced by safety prompts. Instead, the queries' representations are moved by different safety prompts in similar directions, where models become more prone to refusal (i.e., refusing to provide assistance) even when the queries are harmless. Inspired by these findings, we propose a method called DRO (Directed Representation Optimization) for automatic safety prompt optimization. DRO treats safety prompts as continuous, trainable embeddings and learns to move the representations of harmful/harmless queries along/opposite the direction in which the model's refusal probability increases. We demonstrate that DRO remarkably improves the safeguarding performance of human-crafted safety prompts and outperforms strong baselines, as evaluated on out-of-domain benchmarks, without compromising the general model capability.

Even though there is a high inter-individual consistency for the main cortical folds, this is not the case when we examine the exact shapes and details of the folding patterns. Because of this complexity, characterizing the cortical folding variability and relating them to subjects' behavioral characteristics or pathologies is still an open scientific problem. Classical approaches include labeling a few specific patterns, either manually or semi-automatically, based on geometric distances, but the recent availability of MRI image datasets of tens of thousands of subjects makes modern deep-learning techniques particularly attractive. Here, we build a self-supervised deep-learning model to detect folding patterns in the cingulate region. We train a contrastive self-supervised model (SimCLR) on both Human Connectome Project (1101 subjects) and UKBioBank (21070 subjects) datasets with topological-based augmentations on the cortical skeletons, which are topological objects that capture the shape of the folds. We explore several backbone architectures (convolutional network, DenseNet, and PointNet) for the SimCLR. For evaluation and testing, we perform a linear classification task on a database manually labeled for the presence of the \"double-parallel\" folding pattern in the cingulate region, which is related to schizophrenia characteristics. The best model, giving a test AUC of 0.76, is a convolutional network with 6 layers, a 10-dimensional latent space, a linear projection head, and using the branch-clipping augmentation. This is the first time that a self-supervised deep learning model has been applied to cortical skeletons on such a large dataset and quantitatively evaluated. We can now envisage the next step: applying it to other brain regions to detect other biomarkers. ",

    "abstract": "Continual learning (CL) is the research field that aims to build machine learning models that can accumulate knowledge continuously over different tasks without retraining from scratch. Previous studies have shown that pre-training graph neural networks (GNN) may lead to negative transfer (Hu et al., 2020) after fine-tuning, a setting which is closely related to CL. Thus, we focus on studying GNN in the continual graph learning (CGL) setting. We propose the first continual graph learning benchmark for spatio-temporal graphs and use it to benchmark well-known CGL methods in this novel setting. The benchmark is based on the N-UCLA and NTU-RGB+D datasets for skeleton-based action recognition. Beyond benchmarking for standard performance metrics, we study the class and task-order sensitivity of CGL methods, i.e., the impact of learning order on each class/task's performance, and the architectural sensitivity of CGL methods with backbone GNN at various widths and depths. We reveal that task-order robust methods can still be class-order sensitive and observe results that contradict previous empirical observations on architectural sensitivity in CL. ",

    "abstract": "Locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) is a fundamental algorithmic technique widely employed in large-scale data processing applications, such as nearest-neighbor search, entity resolution, and clustering. However, its applicability in some real-world scenarios is limited due to the need for careful design of hashing functions that align with specific metrics. Existing LSH-based Entity Blocking solutions primarily rely on generic similarity metrics such as Jaccard similarity, whereas practical use cases often demand complex and customized similarity rules surpassing the capabilities of generic similarity metrics. Consequently, designing LSH functions for these customized similarity rules presents considerable challenges. In this research, we propose a neuralization approach to enhance locality-sensitive hashing by training deep neural networks to serve as hashing functions for complex metrics. We assess the effectiveness of this approach within the context of the entity resolution problem, which frequently involves the use of task-specific metrics in real-world applications. Specifically, we introduce NLSHBlock (Neural-LSH Block), a novel blocking methodology that leverages pre-trained language models, fine-tuned with a novel LSH-based loss function. Through extensive evaluations conducted on a diverse range of real-world datasets, we demonstrate the superiority of NLSHBlock over existing methods, exhibiting significant performance improvements. Furthermore, we showcase the efficacy of NLSHBlock in enhancing the performance of the entity matching phase, particularly within the semi-supervised setting. ",

    "abstract": "Camera localization methods based on retrieval, local feature matching, and 3D structure-based pose estimation are accurate but require high storage, are slow, and are not privacy-preserving. A method based on scene landmark detection (SLD) was recently proposed to address these limitations. It involves training a convolutional neural network (CNN) to detect a few predetermined, salient, scene-specific 3D points or landmarks and computing camera pose from the associated 2D-3D correspondences. Although SLD outperformed existing learning-based approaches, it was notably less accurate than 3D structure-based methods. In this paper, we show that the accuracy gap was due to insufficient model capacity and noisy labels during training. To mitigate the capacity issue, we propose to split the landmarks into subgroups and train a separate network for each subgroup. To generate better training labels, we propose using dense reconstructions to estimate visibility of scene landmarks. Finally, we present a compact architecture to improve memory efficiency. Accuracy wise, our approach is on par with state of the art structure based methods on the INDOOR-6 dataset but runs significantly faster and uses less storage.

The Auditory Evoked Potential (AEP) is generated using acoustic stimuli. Interpreting these waves requires competence to avoid misdiagnosing hearing problems. Automating ABR test labeling with computer vision may reduce human error. Method: The ABR test results of 26 children aged 1 to 20 months with normal hearing in both ears were used. A new approach is suggested for automatically calculating the peaks of waves of different intensities (in decibels). The procedure entails acquiring wave images from an Audera device using the Color Thresholder method, segmenting each wave as a single wave image using the Image Region Analyzer application, converting all wave images into waves using Image Processing (IP) techniques, and finally calculating the latency of the peaks for each wave to be used by an audiologist for diagnosing the disease. Findings: Image processing techniques were able to detect 1, 3, and 5 waves in the diagnosis field with accuracy (0.82), (0.98), and (0.98), respectively, and its precision for waves 1, 3, and 5, were respectively (0.32), (0.97) and (0.87). This evaluation also worked well in the thresholding part and 82.7 % correctly detected the ABR waves. Conclusion: Our findings indicate that the audiology test battery suite can be made more accurate, quick, and error-free by using technology to automatically detect and label ABR waves. ",

This distribution assumes a singular or non-singular form depending on whether the number of observations $p\\lessgtr$ the system dimensionality $m$. Therefore, we statistically characterize the leading eigenvalue of the singular and non-singular $F$-matrices by deriving their cumulative distribution functions (c.d.f.). Subsequently, they have been utilized in deriving the corresponding receiver operating characteristic (ROC) profiles. We also extend our analysis into the high dimensional domain. It turns out that, when the signal is sufficiently strong, the maximum eigenvalue can reliably detect it in this regime. Nevertheless, weak signals cannot be detected in the high dimensional regime with the leading eigenvalue. ",

In particular, it combines a novel local neural network scheme with an effective PNPic finite element solver. Since the input data of the neural network scheme only involves a small local patch of coarse grid solutions, which the finite element solver can quickly produce, the PNPic deep learning solver can be trained much faster than any corresponding conventional global neural network solvers. After properly trained, it can output a predicted PNPic solution in a much higher degree of accuracy than the low cost coarse grid solutions and can reflect different perturbation cases on the parameters, ion channel subregions, and interface and boundary values, etc. Consequently, the PNPic deep learning solver can generate a numerical solution with high accuracy for a family of PNPic models. As an initial study, two types of numerical tests were done by perturbing one and two parameters of the PNPic model, respectively, as well as the tests done by using a few perturbed interface positions of the model as training samples. These tests demonstrate that the PNPic deep learning solver can generate highly accurate PNPic numerical solutions. ",

    "abstract": "The introduction of more renewable energy sources into the energy system increases the variability and weather dependence of electricity generation. Power system simulations are used to assess the adequacy and reliability of the electricity grid over decades, but often become computational intractable for such long simulation periods with high technical detail. To alleviate this computational burden, we investigate the use of outlier detection algorithms to find periods of extreme renewable energy generation which enables detailed modelling of the performance of power systems under these circumstances. Specifically, we apply the Maximum Divergent Intervals (MDI) algorithm to power generation time series that have been derived from ERA5 historical climate reanalysis covering the period from 1950 through 2019. By applying the MDI algorithm on these time series, we identified intervals of extreme low and high energy production. To determine the outlierness of an interval different divergence measures can be used. Where the cross-entropy measure results in shorter and strongly peaking outliers, the unbiased Kullback-Leibler divergence tends to detect longer and more persistent intervals. These intervals are regarded as potential risks for the electricity grid by domain experts, showcasing the capability of the MDI algorithm to detect critical events in these time series. For the historical period analysed, we found no trend in outlier intensity, or shift and lengthening of the outliers that could be attributed to climate change. By applying MDI on climate model output, power system modellers can investigate the adequacy and possible changes of risk for the current and future electricity grid under a wider range of scenarios.

One class of causal discovery techniques are founded based on the argument that there are inherent structural asymmetries between the causal and anti-causal direction which could be leveraged in determining the direction of causation. To go about capturing these discrepancies between cause and effect remains to be a challenge and many current state-of-the-art algorithms propose to compare the norms of the kernel mean embeddings of the conditional distributions. In this work, we argue that such approaches based on RKHS embeddings are insufficient in capturing principal markers of cause-effect asymmetry involving higher-order structural variabilities of the conditional distributions. We propose Kernel Intrinsic Invariance Measure with Heterogeneous Transform (KIIM-HT) which introduces a novel score measure based on heterogeneous transformation of RKHS embeddings to extract relevant higher-order moments of the conditional densities for causal discovery. Inference is made via comparing the score of each hypothetical cause-effect direction. Tests and comparisons on a synthetic dataset, a two-dimensional synthetic dataset and the real-world benchmark dataset T\\\"ubingen Cause-Effect Pairs verify our approach. In addition, we conduct a sensitivity analysis to the regularization parameter to faithfully compare previous work to our method and an experiment with trials on varied hyperparameter values to showcase the robustness of our algorithm.

Previously, cooperative behavior has been studied by considering game magnetization and individual player's average payoff as indicators. This paper shows that game susceptibility, correlation, and payoff capacity can aid in understanding cooperative behavior in social dilemmas in the thermodynamic limit. In this paper, we compare three analytical methods, i.e., Nash equilibrium mapping (NEM), Darwinian selection (DS), and Aggregate selection (AS), with a numerical-based method (ABM) via the game susceptibility, correlation, and payoff capacity as indicators of cooperative behavior. AS and DS fail compared to NEM and ABM by giving incorrect results for the indicators in question. The results obtained via NEM and ABM are in good agreement for all three indicators in question, for both Hawk-Dove and the Public goods games. After comparing the results obtained for all five indicators, we see that individual players' average payoff and payoff capacity are the best indicators to study cooperative behavior among players in the thermodynamic limit. This paper finds that NEM and ABM, along with the selected indicators, offer valuable insights into cooperative behavior in infinite-player games, contributing to understanding social dilemmas in the thermodynamic limit.
