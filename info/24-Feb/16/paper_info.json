    "abstract": "In the evolving landscape of machine learning, a pivotal challenge lies in deciphering the internal representations harnessed by neural networks and Transformers. Building on recent progress toward comprehending how networks execute distinct target functions, our study embarks on an exploration of the underlying reasons behind networks adopting specific computational strategies. We direct our focus to the complex algebraic learning task of modular addition involving $k$ inputs. Our research presents a thorough analytical characterization of the features learned by stylized one-hidden layer neural networks and one-layer Transformers in addressing this task. A cornerstone of our theoretical framework is the elucidation of how the principle of margin maximization shapes the features adopted by one-hidden layer neural networks. Let $p$ denote the modulus, $D_p$ denote the dataset of modular arithmetic with $k$ inputs and $m$ denote the network width. We demonstrate that a neuron count of $ m \\geq 2^{2k-2} \\cdot (p-1) $, these networks attain a maximum $ L_{2,k+1} $-margin on the dataset $ D_p $. Furthermore, we establish that each hidden-layer neuron aligns with a specific Fourier spectrum, integral to solving modular addition problems. By correlating our findings with the empirical observations of similar studies, we contribute to a deeper comprehension of the intrinsic computational mechanisms of neural networks. Furthermore, we observe similar computational mechanisms in the attention matrix of the Transformer. This research stands as a significant stride in unraveling their operation complexities, particularly in the realm of complex algebraic tasks. ",

    "abstract": "Reconstruction attacks and defenses are essential in understanding the data leakage problem in machine learning. However, prior work has centered around empirical observations of gradient inversion attacks, lacks theoretical groundings, and was unable to disentangle the usefulness of defending methods versus the computational limitation of attacking methods. In this work, we propose a strong reconstruction attack in the setting of federated learning. The attack reconstructs intermediate features and nicely integrates with and outperforms most of the previous methods. On this stronger attack, we thoroughly investigate both theoretically and empirically the effect of the most common defense methods. Our findings suggest that among various defense mechanisms, such as gradient clipping, dropout, additive noise, local aggregation, etc., gradient pruning emerges as the most effective strategy to defend against state-of-the-art attacks.

    "abstract": "Multiobjective optimization (MOO) is prevalent in numerous applications, in which a Pareto front (PF) is constructed to display optima under various preferences. Previous methods commonly utilize the set of Pareto objectives (particles on the PF) to represent the entire PF. However, the empirical distribution of the Pareto objectives on the PF is rarely studied, which implicitly impedes the generation of diverse and representative Pareto objectives in previous methods. To bridge the gap, we suggest in this paper constructing \\emph{uniformly distributed} Pareto objectives on the PF, so as to alleviate the limited diversity found in previous MOO approaches. We are the first to formally define the concept of ``uniformity\" for an MOO problem. We optimize the maximal minimal distances on the Pareto front using a neural network, resulting in both asymptotically and non-asymptotically uniform Pareto objectives. Our proposed method is validated through experiments on real-world and synthetic problems, which demonstrates the efficacy in generating high-quality uniform Pareto objectives and the encouraging performance exceeding existing state-of-the-art methods. The detailed model implementation and the code are scheduled to be open-sourced upon publication. ",

    "abstract": "Modern language models (LMs) have gained widespread acceptance in everyday and professional contexts, particularly in programming. An essential procedure enabling this adoption is instruction tuning, which substantially enhances LMs' practical utility by training them to follow user instructions and human preferences. However, existing instruction tuning schemes overlook a crucial aspect: the security of generated code. As a result, even the state-of-the-art instruction-tuned LMs frequently produce unsafe code, posing significant security risks. In this work, we introduce SafeCoder to address this gap. SafeCoder performs security-centric fine-tuning using a diverse and high-quality dataset that we collected using an automated pipeline. We integrate the security fine-tuning with standard instruction tuning, to facilitate a joint optimization of both security and utility. Despite its simplicity, we show that SafeCoder is effective across a variety of popular LMs and datasets. It is able to drastically improve security (by about 30%), while preserving utility. ",

Previous studies identified potential related variables, but lacked analysis on certain intrinsic and extrinsic patient variables during pregnancy. Objective: The study aims to evaluate the most influential variables in PUI using machine learning, focusing on intrinsic, extrinsic, and combined variable groups. Methods: Data from 93 pregnant women were analyzed using machine learning and oversampling techniques. Four key variables were predicted: occurrence, frequency, intensity of urinary incontinence, and stress urinary incontinence. Results: Models using extrinsic variables were most accurate, with 70% accuracy for urinary incontinence, 77% for frequency, 71% for intensity, and 93% for stress urinary incontinence. Conclusions: The study highlights extrinsic variables as significant predictors of PUI issues. This suggests that PUI prevention might be achievable through healthy habits during pregnancy, although further research is needed for confirmation. ",

    "abstract": "Background: Modern Code Review (MCR) is a key component for delivering high-quality software and sharing knowledge among developers. Effective reviews require an in-depth understanding of the code and demand from the reviewers to contextualize the change from different perspectives. Aim: While there is a plethora of research on solutions that support developers to understand changed code, we have observed that many provide only narrow, specialized insights and very few aggregate information in a meaningful manner. Therefore, we aim to provide a vision of improving code understanding in MCR. Method: We classified 53 research papers suggesting proposals to improve MCR code understanding. We use this classification, the needs expressed by code reviewers from previous research, and the information we have not found in the literature for extrapolation. Results: We identified four major types of support systems and suggest an environment for contextualized code reviews. Furthermore, we illustrate with a set of scenarios how such an environment would improve the effectiveness of code reviews. Conclusions: Current research focuses mostly on providing narrow support for developers. We outline a vision for how MCR can be improved by using context and reducing the cognitive load on developers. We hope our vision can foster future advancements in development environments. ",

    "abstract": "Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image processing tend to focus on localized texture patterns, commonly referred to as texture bias. While most of the previous works in the literature focus on the task of image classification, we go beyond this and study the texture bias of CNNs in semantic segmentation. In this work, we propose to train CNNs on pre-processed images with less texture to reduce the texture bias. Therein, the challenge is to suppress image texture while preserving shape information. To this end, we utilize edge enhancing diffusion (EED), an anisotropic image diffusion method initially introduced for image compression, to create texture reduced duplicates of existing datasets. Extensive numerical studies are performed with both CNNs and vision transformer models trained on original data and EED-processed data from the Cityscapes dataset and the CARLA driving simulator. We observe strong texture-dependence of CNNs and moderate texture-dependence of transformers. Training CNNs on EED-processed images enables the models to become completely ignorant with respect to texture, demonstrating resilience with respect to texture re-introduction to any degree. Additionally we analyze the performance reduction in depth on a level of connected components in the semantic segmentation and study the influence of EED pre-processing on domain generalization as well as adversarial robustness.

    "title": "Why Does Differential Privacy with Large Epsilon Defend Against  Practical Membership Inference Attacks?",
    "abstract": "For small privacy parameter $\\epsilon$, $\\epsilon$-differential privacy (DP) provides a strong worst-case guarantee that no membership inference attack (MIA) can succeed at determining whether a person's data was used to train a machine learning model. The guarantee of DP is worst-case because: a) it holds even if the attacker already knows the records of all but one person in the data set; and b) it holds uniformly over all data sets. In practical applications, such a worst-case guarantee may be overkill: practical attackers may lack exact knowledge of (nearly all of) the private data, and our data set might be easier to defend, in some sense, than the worst-case data set. Such considerations have motivated the industrial deployment of DP models with large privacy parameter (e.g. $\\epsilon \\geq 7$), and it has been observed empirically that DP with large $\\epsilon$ can successfully defend against state-of-the-art MIAs. Existing DP theory cannot explain these empirical findings: e.g., the theoretical privacy guarantees of $\\epsilon \\geq 7$ are essentially vacuous. In this paper, we aim to close this gap between theory and practice and understand why a large DP parameter can prevent practical MIAs. To tackle this problem, we propose a new privacy notion called practical membership privacy (PMP). PMP models a practical attacker's uncertainty about the contents of the private data. The PMP parameter has a natural interpretation in terms of the success rate of a practical MIA on a given data set. We quantitatively analyze the PMP parameter of two fundamental DP mechanisms: the exponential mechanism and Gaussian mechanism. Our analysis reveals that a large DP parameter often translates into a much smaller PMP parameter, which guarantees strong privacy against practical MIAs. Using our findings, we offer principled guidance for practitioners in choosing the DP parameter. ",

Traditional approaches, however, treat programming source code as natural language text, which may neglect significant structural or semantic details. Additionally, most current methods of representing source code focus solely on the code, without considering beneficial additional context. This paper explores the integration of static analysis and additional context such as bug reports and design patterns into source code representations for deep learning models. We use the Abstract Syntax Tree-based Neural Network (ASTNN) method and augment it with additional context information obtained from bug reports and design patterns, creating an enriched source code representation that significantly enhances the performance of common software engineering tasks such as code classification and code clone detection. Utilizing existing open-source code data, our approach improves the representation and processing of source code, thereby improving task performance. ",

This pre-training task preserves original distribution and data shapes of the time-series. Additionally, the full-rank forward and backward attention matrices exhibit more expressive representation capabilities. Using biosignal data, BiTimelyGPT demonstrates superior performance in predicting neurological functionality, disease diagnosis, and physiological signs. By visualizing the attention heatmap, we observe that the pre-trained BiTimelyGPT can identify discriminative segments from time-series sequences, even more so after fine-tuning on the task. ",

    "abstract": "Due to the ubiquity of graph data on the web, web graph mining has become a hot research spot. Nonetheless, the prevalence of large-scale web graphs in real applications poses significant challenges to storage, computational capacity and graph model design. Despite numerous studies to enhance the scalability of graph models, a noticeable gap remains between academic research and practical web graph mining applications. One major cause is that in most industrial scenarios, only a small part of nodes in a web graph are actually required to be analyzed, where we term these nodes as target nodes, while others as background nodes. In this paper, we argue that properly fetching and condensing the background nodes from massive web graph data might be a more economical shortcut to tackle the obstacles fundamentally. To this end, we make the first attempt to study the problem of massive background nodes compression for target nodes classification. Through extensive experiments, we reveal two critical roles played by the background nodes in target node classification: enhancing structural connectivity between target nodes, and feature correlation with target nodes. Followingthis, we propose a novel Graph-Skeleton1 model, which properly fetches the background nodes, and further condenses the semantic and topological information of background nodes within similar target-background local structures. Extensive experiments on various web graph datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method. In particular, for MAG240M dataset with 0.24 billion nodes, our generated skeleton graph achieves highly comparable performance while only containing 1.8% nodes of the original graph. ",

These moves form a basis for defining an irreducible Markov chain necessary for testing statistical model fit to block-partitioned network data. Our methods further generalize well-known algebraic results from the 1990s: namely, that the corresponding moves can be used to construct a regular triangulation for a generalization of the second hypersimplex. On the other hand, in contrast to the monochromatic case, we show that for simple graphs, the 1-norm of the moves necessary to connect the space increases with the number of colors. ",

The purpose of this multicenter study is to validate an automated cardiac plaque detection model using a 3D multiclass nnU-Net for gated and non-gated non-contrast chest CT volumes. CT scans were performed at three tertiary care hospitals and collected as three datasets, respectively. Heart, aorta, and lung segmentations were determined using TotalSegmentator, while plaques in the coronary arteries and heart valves were manually labeled for 801 volumes. In this work we demonstrate how the nnU-Net semantic segmentation pipeline may be adapted to detect plaques in the coronary arteries and valves. With a linear correction, nnU-Net deep learning methods may also accurately estimate Agatston scores on chest non-contrast CT scans. Compared to manual Agatson scoring, automated Agatston scoring indicated a slope of the linear regression of 0.841 with an intercept of +16 HU (R2 = 0.97). These results are an improvement over previous work assessing automated Agatston score computation in non-gated CT scans. ",

The State-of-the-Art SSL methods have shown to suffer from dimensional collapse and fall behind maintaining full rank. Recent approaches to prevent this problem have proposed using contrastive losses, regularization techniques, or architectural tricks. We propose WERank, a new regularizer on the weight parameters of the network to prevent rank degeneration at different layers of the network. We provide empirical evidence and mathematical justification to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed regularization method in preventing dimensional collapse. We verify the impact of WERank on graph SSL where dimensional collapse is more pronounced due to the lack of proper data augmentation. We empirically demonstrate that WERank is effective in helping BYOL to achieve higher rank during SSL pre-training and consequently downstream accuracy during evaluation probing.

Effective strategies for early detection are therefore of paramount importance. In recent years, machine learning (ML) has demonstrated considerable potential in healthcare by facilitating the detection of various diseases. In this retrospective development and validation study, we developed an ML model based on dynamic ensemble selection (DES) for LC detection. The model leverages standard blood sample analysis and smoking history data from a large population at risk in Denmark. The study includes all patients examined on suspicion of LC in the Region of Southern Denmark from 2009 to 2018. We validated and compared the predictions by the DES model with diagnoses provided by five pulmonologists. Among the 38,944 patients, 9,940 had complete data of which 2,505 (25\\%) had LC. The DES model achieved an area under the roc curve of 0.77$\\pm$0.01, sensitivity of 76.2\\%$\\pm$2.4\\%, specificity of 63.8\\%$\\pm$2.3\\%, positive predictive value of 41.6\\%$\\pm$1.2\\%, and F\\textsubscript{1}-score of 53.8\\%$\\pm$1.1\\%. The DES model outperformed all five pulmonologists, achieving a sensitivity 9\\% higher than their average. The model identified smoking status, age, total calcium levels, neutrophil count, and lactate dehydrogenase as the most important factors for the detection of LC. The results highlight the successful application of the ML approach in detecting LC, surpassing pulmonologists' performance.

    "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been widely used to learn node representations and with outstanding performance on various tasks such as node classification. However, noise, which inevitably exists in real-world graph data, would considerably degrade the performance of GNNs revealed by recent studies. In this work, we propose a novel and robust GNN encoder, Low-Rank Graph Contrastive Learning (LR-GCL). Our method performs transductive node classification in two steps. First, a low-rank GCL encoder named LR-GCL is trained by prototypical contrastive learning with low-rank regularization. Next, using the features produced by LR-GCL, a linear transductive classification algorithm is used to classify the unlabeled nodes in the graph. Our LR-GCL is inspired by the low frequency property of the graph data and its labels, and it is also theoretically motivated by our sharp generalization bound for transductive learning. To the best of our knowledge, our theoretical result is among the first to theoretically demonstrate the advantage of low-rank learning in graph contrastive learning supported by strong empirical performance. Extensive experiments on public benchmarks demonstrate the superior performance of LR-GCL and the robustness of the learned node representations. The code of LR-GCL is available at \\url{https://anonymous.4open.science/r/Low-Rank_Graph_Contrastive_Learning-64A6/}. ",

To mitigate the scalability of non-contrastive graph SSL, we propose a novel approach to reduce the cost of computing the covariance matrix for the pre-training loss function with volume-maximization terms. Our work focuses on reducing the cost associated with the loss computation via graph node or dimension sampling. We provide theoretical insight into why dimension sampling would result in accurate loss computations and support it with mathematical derivation of the novel approach. We develop our experimental setup on the node-level graph prediction tasks, where SSL pre-training has shown to be difficult due to the large size of real world graphs. Our experiments demonstrate that the cost associated with the loss computation can be reduced via node or dimension sampling without lowering the downstream performance. Our results demonstrate that sampling mostly results in improved downstream performance. Ablation studies and experimental analysis are provided to untangle the role of the different factors in the experimental setup. ",

In many cases of interest, the integrated intensity function admits a closed form and can be computed in quadratic time in the number of hidden neurons. We enumerate a far more extensive number of such cases than has previously been discussed. Our approach is more memory and time efficient than naive implementations of squared or exponentiated kernel methods or Gaussian processes. Maximum likelihood and maximum a posteriori estimates in a reparameterisation of the final layer of the intensity function can be obtained by solving a (strongly) convex optimisation problem using projected gradient descent.

We then propose a novel intervention methodology for generating expressive counterfactuals in the representation space, aiming to make representations of a source class (e.g., ``toxic'') resemble those of a target class (e.g., ``non-toxic''). This approach, generalizing previous linear intervention techniques, utilizes a closed-form solution for the Earth Mover's problem under Gaussian assumptions and provides theoretical guarantees on the representation space's geometric organization. We further build on this technique and derive a nonlinear intervention that enables controlled generation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approaches in mitigating bias in multiclass classification and in reducing the generation of toxic language, outperforming strong baselines. ",

A key reason for this reluctance could be the competitive advantage that comes with lax regulation. A popular platform that starts enforcing content moderation rules may fear that it could lose users to less-regulated alternative platforms. Moreover, if users continue harmful activities on other platforms, regulation ends up being futile. This article examines the competitive aspect of content moderation by considering the motivations of all involved players (platformer, news source, and social media users), identifying the regulation policies sustained in equilibrium, and evaluating the information quality available on each platform. Applied to simple yet relevant social networks such as stochastic block models, our model reveals the conditions for a popular platform to enforce strict regulation without losing users. Effectiveness of regulation depends on the diffusive property of news posts, friend interaction qualities in social media, the sizes and cohesiveness of communities, and how much sympathizers appreciate surprising news from influencers.

Despite its tremendous potential to deploy user-oriented embeddings, none of previous approaches provides a concrete solution for it. This paper offers a new viewpoint, which treats the instruction as a question about the input text and encodes the expected answers to obtain the representation accordingly. Intuitively, texts with the same (implicit) semantics would share similar answers following the instruction, thus leading to more similar embeddings. Specifically, we propose InBedder that instantiates this embed-via-answering idea by only fine-tuning language models on abstractive question answering tasks. InBedder demonstrates significantly improved instruction-following capabilities according to our proposed instruction awareness tests and instruction robustness tests, when applied to both large language models (LLMs) (e.g., llama-2-7b) and smaller encoder-based LMs (e.g., roberta-large). Additionally, our qualitative analysis of clustering outcomes, achieved by applying different instructions to the same corpus, demonstrates a high degree of interpretability. ",

In our research, we introduce an innovative deep learning approach for anticipating soccer fouls. This method integrates video data, bounding box positions, image details, and pose information by curating a novel soccer foul dataset. Our model utilizes a combination of convolutional and recurrent neural networks (CNNs and RNNs) to effectively merge information from these four modalities. The experimental results show that our full model outperformed the ablated models, and all of the RNN modules, bounding box position and image, and estimated pose were useful for the foul prediction. Our findings have important implications for a deeper understanding of foul play in soccer and provide a valuable reference for future research and practice in this area. ",

We first examine both digital and analog transmission methods, together with a unified and fair comparison scheme under practical constraints. A universal convergence analysis under various imperfections is established for FL performance evaluation in wireless networks. These analytical results reveal that the fundamental difference between the two paradigms lies in whether communication and computation are jointly designed or not. The digital schemes decouple the communication design from specific FL tasks, making it difficult to support simultaneous uplink transmission of massive devices with limited bandwidth. In contrast, the analog communication allows over-the-air computation (AirComp), thus achieving efficient spectrum utilization. However, computation-oriented analog transmission reduces power efficiency, and its performance is sensitive to computational errors. Finally, numerical simulations are conducted to verify these theoretical observations. ",

As an alternative, we introduce CodeMind, a framework designed to gauge the code reasoning abilities of LLMs. CodeMind currently supports three code reasoning tasks: Independent Execution Reasoning (IER), Dependent Execution Reasoning (DER), and Specification Reasoning (SR). The first two evaluate models to predict the execution output of an arbitrary code or code the model could correctly synthesize. The third one evaluates the extent to which LLMs implement the specified expected behavior. Our extensive evaluation of nine LLMs across five benchmarks in two different programming languages using CodeMind shows that LLMs fairly understand control flow constructs and, in general, are capable of reasoning how inputs evolve to output, specifically for simple programs and the ones they can correctly synthesize. However, their performance drops for code with higher complexity, non-trivial logical and arithmetic operators, non-primitive types, and API calls. Furthermore, we observe that, while correlated, specification reasoning (essential for code synthesis) does not imply execution reasoning (essential for broader programming tasks such as testing and debugging): ranking LLMs based on test passing can be different compared to code reasoning.

    "abstract": "Commonsense knowledge graph completion is a new challenge for commonsense knowledge graph construction and application. In contrast to factual knowledge graphs such as Freebase and YAGO, commonsense knowledge graphs (CSKGs; e.g., ConceptNet) utilize free-form text to represent named entities, short phrases, and events as their nodes. Such a loose structure results in large and sparse CSKGs, which makes the semantic understanding of these nodes more critical for learning rich commonsense knowledge graph embedding. While current methods leverage semantic similarities to increase the graph density, the semantic plausibility of the nodes and their relations are under-explored. Previous works adopt conceptual abstraction to improve the consistency of modeling (event) plausibility, but they are not scalable enough and still suffer from data sparsity. In this paper, we propose to adopt textual entailment to find implicit entailment relations between CSKG nodes, to effectively densify the subgraph connecting nodes within the same conceptual class, which indicates a similar level of plausibility. Each node in CSKG finds its top entailed nodes using a finetuned transformer over natural language inference (NLI) tasks, which sufficiently capture textual entailment signals. The entailment relation between these nodes are further utilized to: 1) build new connections between source triplets and entailed nodes to densify the sparse CSKGs; 2) enrich the generalization ability of node representations by comparing the node embeddings with a contrastive loss. Experiments on two standard CSKGs demonstrate that our proposed framework EntailE can improve the performance of CSKG completion tasks under both transductive and inductive settings. ",

Unfortunately, the integration of COTS components introduces serious security concerns. None of the entities in the COTS IC supply chain are trusted from a consumer's perspective, leading to a ''zero trust'' threat model. Any of these entities could introduce hidden malicious circuits or hardware Trojans within the component, allowing an attacker in the field to extract secret information (e.g., cryptographic keys) or cause a functional failure. Existing solutions to counter hardware Trojans are inapplicable in such a zero-trust scenario as they assume either the design house or the foundry to be trusted and consider the design to be available for either analysis or modification. In this work, we have proposed a software-oriented countermeasure to ensure the confidentiality of secret assets against hardware Trojans that can be seamlessly integrated in existing COTS microprocessors. The proposed solution does not require any supply chain entity to be trusted and does not require analysis or modification of the IC design. To protect secret assets in an untrusted microprocessor, the proposed method leverages the concept of residue number coding (RNC) to transform the software functions operating on the asset to be fully homomorphic. We have implemented the proposed solution to protect the secret key within the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) program and presented a detailed security analysis. We also have developed a plugin for the LLVM compiler toolchain that automatically integrates the solution in AES. Finally, we compare the execution time overhead of the operations in the RNC-based technique with comparable homomorphic solutions and demonstrate significant improvement. ",

For several of these applications, the sensitive wireless data (such as spectrograms) are stored in a shared database or multistakeholder cloud environment and are therefore prone to privacy leaks. This paper aims to address such privacy concerns by examining the representative case study of shared database scenarios in 5G Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) networks where we have a shared database within the near-real-time (near-RT) RAN intelligent controller. We focus on securing the data that can be used by machine learning (ML) models for spectrum sharing and interference mitigation applications without compromising the model and network performances. The underlying idea is to leverage a (i) Shuffling-based learnable encryption technique to encrypt the data, following which, (ii) employ a custom Vision transformer (ViT) as the trained ML model that is capable of performing accurate inferences on such encrypted data. The paper offers a thorough analysis and comparisons with analogous convolutional neural networks (CNN) as well as deeper architectures (such as ResNet-50) as baselines. Our experiments showcase that the proposed approach significantly outperforms the baseline CNN with an improvement of 24.5% and 23.9% for the percent accuracy and F1-Score respectively when operated on encrypted data.

Nonetheless, recent studies show that GNNs struggle to produce good results on low-degree nodes despite their overall strong performance. In practical applications of LP, like recommendation systems, improving performance on low-degree nodes is critical, as it amounts to tackling the cold-start problem of improving the experiences of users with few observed interactions. In this paper, we investigate improving GNNs' LP performance on low-degree nodes while preserving their performance on high-degree nodes and propose a simple yet surprisingly effective augmentation technique called NodeDup. Specifically, NodeDup duplicates low-degree nodes and creates links between nodes and their own duplicates before following the standard supervised LP training scheme. By leveraging a ''multi-view'' perspective for low-degree nodes, NodeDup shows significant LP performance improvements on low-degree nodes without compromising any performance on high-degree nodes. Additionally, as a plug-and-play augmentation module, NodeDup can be easily applied to existing GNNs with very light computational cost. Extensive experiments show that NodeDup achieves 38.49%, 13.34%, and 6.76% improvements on isolated, low-degree, and warm nodes, respectively, on average across all datasets compared to GNNs and state-of-the-art cold-start methods.

    "abstract": "Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a prevalent distributed machine learning scheme that enables collaborative model training without aggregating raw data. Cloud service providers further embrace Federated Learning as a Service (FLaaS), allowing data analysts to execute their FL training pipelines over differentially-protected data. Due to the intrinsic properties of differential privacy, the enforced privacy level on data blocks can be viewed as a privacy budget that requires careful scheduling to cater to diverse training pipelines. Existing privacy budget scheduling studies prioritize either efficiency or fairness individually. In this paper, we propose DPBalance, a novel privacy budget scheduling mechanism that jointly optimizes both efficiency and fairness. We first develop a comprehensive utility function incorporating data analyst-level dominant shares and FL-specific performance metrics. A sequential allocation mechanism is then designed using the Lagrange multiplier method and effective greedy heuristics. We theoretically prove that DPBalance satisfies Pareto Efficiency, Sharing Incentive, Envy-Freeness, and Weak Strategy Proofness. We also theoretically prove the existence of a fairness-efficiency tradeoff in privacy budgeting. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DPBalance outperforms state-of-the-art solutions, achieving an average efficiency improvement of $1.44\\times \\sim 3.49 \\times$, and an average fairness improvement of $1.37\\times \\sim 24.32 \\times$.

In contrast to classical methods that are based on explicit representations such as point clouds, neural fields provide a continuous scene representation able to represent 3D geometry and appearance in a way which is compact and ideal for robotics applications. However, limited prior methods have investigated registering multiple neural fields by directly utilising these continuous implicit representations. In this paper, we present Reg-NF, a neural fields-based registration that optimises for the relative 6-DoF transformation between two arbitrary neural fields, even if those two fields have different scale factors. Key components of Reg-NF include a bidirectional registration loss, multi-view surface sampling, and utilisation of volumetric signed distance functions (SDFs). We showcase our approach on a new neural field dataset for evaluating registration problems.

FedWeb remarkably reduces the number of required participating data owners to support privacy-preserving Web 3.0 data analytics based on a novel distributed differential privacy technique. The correctness of mining results is guaranteed by a theoretically rigid candidate filtering scheme based on Hoeffding's inequality and Chebychev's inequality. Two response budget saving solutions are proposed to further reduce participating data owners. Experiments on three representative Web 3.0 scenarios show that FedWeb can improve data utility by ~25.3% and reduce the participating data owners by ~98.4%. ",

    "abstract": "Multimodal hateful content detection is a challenging task that requires complex reasoning across visual and textual modalities. Therefore, creating a meaningful multimodal representation that effectively captures the interplay between visual and textual features through intermediate fusion is critical. Conventional fusion techniques are unable to attend to the modality-specific features effectively. Moreover, most studies exclusively concentrated on English and overlooked other low-resource languages. This paper proposes a context-aware attention framework for multimodal hateful content detection and assesses it for both English and non-English languages. The proposed approach incorporates an attention layer to meaningfully align the visual and textual features. This alignment enables selective focus on modality-specific features before fusing them. We evaluate the proposed approach on two benchmark hateful meme datasets, viz. MUTE (Bengali code-mixed) and MultiOFF (English). Evaluation results demonstrate our proposed approach's effectiveness with F1-scores of $69.7$% and $70.3$% for the MUTE and MultiOFF datasets. The scores show approximately $2.5$% and $3.2$% performance improvement over the state-of-the-art systems on these datasets.

    "abstract": "This paper addresses the problem of detecting false data injection (FDI) attacks in a distributed network without a fusion center, represented by a connected graph among multiple agent nodes. Each agent node is equipped with a sensor, and uses a Kalman consensus information filter (KCIF) to track a discrete time global process with linear dynamics and additive Gaussian noise. The state estimate of the global process at any sensor is computed from the local observation history and the information received by that agent node from its neighbors. At an unknown time, an attacker starts altering the local observation of one agent node. In the Bayesian setting where there is a known prior distribution of the attack beginning instant, we formulate a Bayesian quickest change detection (QCD) problem for FDI detection in order to minimize the mean detection delay subject to a false alarm probability constraint. While it is well-known that the optimal Bayesian QCD rule involves checking the Shriyaev's statistic against a threshold, we demonstrate how to compute the Shriyaev's statistic at each node in a recursive fashion given our non-i.i.d. observations. Next, we consider non-Bayesian QCD where the attack begins at an arbitrary and unknown time, and the detector seeks to minimize the worst case detection delay subject to a constraint on the mean time to false alarm and probability of misidentification. We use the multiple hypothesis sequential probability ratio test for attack detection and identification at each sensor. For unknown attack strategy, we use the window-limited generalized likelihood ratio (WL-GLR) algorithm to solve the QCD problem. Numerical results demonstrate the performances and trade-offs of the proposed algorithms. ",

Despite advancements in Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), the need for customized optimization tasks for individual users complicates developing and applying numerous DRL models, leading to substantial computation resource and energy consumption and can lead to inconsistent outcomes. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach utilizing a Mixture of Experts (MoE) framework, augmented with Large Language Models (LLMs), to analyze user objectives and constraints effectively, select specialized DRL experts, and weigh each decision from the participating experts. Specifically, we develop a gate network to oversee the expert models, allowing a collective of experts to tackle a wide array of new tasks. Furthermore, we innovatively substitute the traditional gate network with an LLM, leveraging its advanced reasoning capabilities to manage expert model selection for joint decisions. Our proposed method reduces the need to train new DRL models for each unique optimization problem, decreasing energy consumption and AI model implementation costs. The LLM-enabled MoE approach is validated through a general maze navigation task and a specific network service provider utility maximization task, demonstrating its effectiveness and practical applicability in optimizing complex networking systems.

    "abstract": "Learning of deep neural networks (DNN) using Resistive Processing Unit (RPU) architecture is energy-efficient as it utilizes dedicated neuromorphic hardware and stochastic computation of weight updates for in-memory computing. Charge Trap Flash (CTF) devices can implement RPU-based weight updates in DNNs. However, prior work has shown that the weight updates (V_T) in CTF-based RPU are impacted by the non-ideal program time of CTF. The non-ideal program time is affected by two factors of CTF. Firstly, the effects of the number of input pulses (N) or pulse width (pw), and secondly, the gap between successive update pulses (t_gap) used for the stochastic computation of weight updates. Therefore, the impact of this non-ideal program time must be studied for neural network training simulations. In this study, Firstly, we propose a pulse-train design compensation technique to reduce the total error caused by non-ideal program time of CTF and stochastic variance of a network. Secondly, we simulate RPU-based DNN with non-ideal program time of CTF on MNIST and Fashion-MNIST datasets. We find that for larger N (~1000), learning performance approaches the ideal (software-level) training level and, therefore, is not much impacted by the choice of t_gap used to implement RPU-based weight updates. However, for lower N (<500), learning performance depends on T_gap of the pulses. Finally, we also performed an ablation study to isolate the causal factor of the improved learning performance. We conclude that the lower noise level in the weight updates is the most likely significant factor to improve the learning performance of DNN. Thus, our study attempts to compensate for the error caused by non-ideal program time and standardize the pulse length (N) and pulse gap (t_gap) specifications for CTF-based RPUs for accurate system-level on-chip training.

We train our models on this synthetic data and demonstrate that our approach outperforms single-channel VAD models and energy-based multi-channel VAD algorithm in various acoustic environments. In addition to VAD results, we also present multiparty ASR evaluation results to highlight the impact of using our VAD model for filtering audio in downstream tasks by significantly reducing the insertion error.

    "abstract": "Several recent deep learning (DL) based techniques perform considerably well on image-based multilingual text detection. However, their performance relies heavily on the availability and quality of training data. There are numerous types of page-level document images consisting of information in several modalities, languages, fonts, and layouts. This makes text detection a challenging problem in the field of computer vision (CV), especially for low-resource or handwritten languages. Furthermore, there is a scarcity of word-level labeled data for text detection, especially for multilingual settings and Indian scripts that incorporate both printed and handwritten text. Conventionally, Indian script text detection requires training a DL model on plenty of labeled data, but to the best of our knowledge, no relevant datasets are available. Manual annotation of such data requires a lot of time, effort, and expertise. In order to solve this problem, we propose TEXTRON, a Data Programming-based approach, where users can plug various text detection methods into a weak supervision-based learning framework. One can view this approach to multilingual text detection as an ensemble of different CV-based techniques and DL approaches. TEXTRON can leverage the predictions of DL models pre-trained on a significant amount of language data in conjunction with CV-based methods to improve text detection in other languages. We demonstrate that TEXTRON can improve the detection performance for documents written in Indian languages, despite the absence of corresponding labeled data. Further, through extensive experimentation, we show improvement brought about by our approach over the current State-of-the-art (SOTA) models, especially for handwritten Devanagari text.

However, network technology is a double-edged sword, bringing convenience to people but also posing many security challenges. Maintaining network security and protecting the legitimate interests of users is at the heart of network construction. Threat detection is an important part of a complete and effective defense system. In the field of network information security, the technical update of network attack and network protection is spiraling. How to effectively detect unknown threats is one of the concerns of network protection. Currently, network threat detection is usually based on rules and traditional machine learning methods, which create artificial rules or extract common spatiotemporal features, which cannot be applied to large-scale data applications, and the emergence of unknown threats causes the detection accuracy of the original model to decline. With this in mind, this paper uses deep learning for advanced threat detection to improve cybersecurity resilienc e in the financial industry. Many network security researchers have shifted their focus to exceptio n-based intrusion detection techniques. The detection technology mainly uses statistical machine learning methods - collecting normal program and network behavior data, extracting multidimensional features, and training decision machine learning models on this basis (commonly used include naive Bayes, decision trees, support vector machines, random forests, etc.). In the detection phase, program code or network behavior that deviates from the normal value beyond the tolerance is considered malicious code or network attack behavior. ",

One of the most notable advancements of LLMs is that a single model is trained on vast and diverse datasets spanning multiple domains -- a paradigm we term `All in One'. This methodology empowers LLMs with super generalization capabilities, facilitating an encompassing comprehension of varied data distributions. Leveraging these capabilities, a single LLM demonstrates remarkable versatility across a variety of domains -- a paradigm we term `One for All'. However, applying this idea to the graph field remains a formidable challenge, with cross-domain pretraining often resulting in negative transfer. This issue is particularly important in few-shot learning scenarios, where the paucity of training data necessitates the incorporation of external knowledge sources. In response to this challenge, we propose a novel approach called Graph COordinators for PrEtraining (GCOPE), that harnesses the underlying commonalities across diverse graph datasets to enhance few-shot learning. Our novel methodology involves a unification framework that amalgamates disparate graph datasets during the pretraining phase to distill and transfer meaningful knowledge to target tasks. Extensive experiments across multiple graph datasets demonstrate the superior efficacy of our approach. By successfully leveraging the synergistic potential of multiple graph datasets for pretraining, our work stands as a pioneering contribution to the realm of graph foundational model. ",

The problem takes an edge-weighted graph and pairs of vertices as input, and the aim is to find a minimum cost subgraph in which each given vertex pair lies in the same connected component. It is known that this problem is APX-hard in general, and NP-hard on graphs of treewidth 3, treedepth 4, and feedback vertex set size 2. However, Bateni, Hajiaghayi and Marx [JACM, 2011] gave an approximation scheme with a runtime of $n^{O(\\frac{k^2}{\\varepsilon})}$ on graphs of treewidth $k$. Our main result is a much faster efficient parameterized approximation scheme (EPAS) with a runtime of $2^{O(\\frac{k^2}{\\varepsilon} \\log \\frac{k^2}{\\varepsilon})} \\cdot n^{O(1)}$. If $k$ instead is the vertex cover number of the input graph, we show how to compute the optimum solution in $2^{O(k \\log k)} \\cdot n^{O(1)}$ time, and we also prove that this runtime dependence on $k$ is asymptotically best possible, under ETH. Furthermore, if $k$ is the size of a feedback edge set, then we obtain a faster $2^{O(k)} \\cdot n^{O(1)}$ time algorithm, which again cannot be improved under ETH. ",

    "title": "Social Reward: Evaluating and Enhancing Generative AI through  Million-User Feedback from an Online Creative Community",
    "abstract": "Social reward as a form of community recognition provides a strong source of motivation for users of online platforms to engage and contribute with content. The recent progress of text-conditioned image synthesis has ushered in a collaborative era where AI empowers users to craft original visual artworks seeking community validation. Nevertheless, assessing these models in the context of collective community preference introduces distinct challenges. Existing evaluation methods predominantly center on limited size user studies guided by image quality and prompt alignment. This work pioneers a paradigm shift, unveiling Social Reward - an innovative reward modeling framework that leverages implicit feedback from social network users engaged in creative editing of generated images. We embark on an extensive journey of dataset curation and refinement, drawing from Picsart: an online visual creation and editing platform, yielding a first million-user-scale dataset of implicit human preferences for user-generated visual art named Picsart Image-Social. Our analysis exposes the shortcomings of current metrics in modeling community creative preference of text-to-image models' outputs, compelling us to introduce a novel predictive model explicitly tailored to address these limitations. Rigorous quantitative experiments and user study show that our Social Reward model aligns better with social popularity than existing metrics. Furthermore, we utilize Social Reward to fine-tune text-to-image models, yielding images that are more favored by not only Social Reward, but also other established metrics. These findings highlight the relevance and effectiveness of Social Reward in assessing community appreciation for AI-generated artworks, establishing a closer alignment with users' creative goals: creating popular visual art.

    "abstract": "Adversarial attacks represent a substantial challenge in Natural Language Processing (NLP). This study undertakes a systematic exploration of this challenge in two distinct phases: vulnerability evaluation and resilience enhancement of Transformer-based models under adversarial attacks. In the evaluation phase, we assess the susceptibility of three Transformer configurations, encoder-decoder, encoder-only, and decoder-only setups, to adversarial attacks of escalating complexity across datasets containing offensive language and misinformation. Encoder-only models manifest a 14% and 21% performance drop in offensive language detection and misinformation detection tasks, respectively. Decoder-only models register a 16% decrease in both tasks, while encoder-decoder models exhibit a maximum performance drop of 14% and 26% in the respective tasks. The resilience-enhancement phase employs adversarial training, integrating pre-camouflaged and dynamically altered data. This approach effectively reduces the performance drop in encoder-only models to an average of 5% in offensive language detection and 2% in misinformation detection tasks. Decoder-only models, occasionally exceeding original performance, limit the performance drop to 7% and 2% in the respective tasks. Although not surpassing the original performance, Encoder-decoder models can reduce the drop to an average of 6% and 2% respectively. Results suggest a trade-off between performance and robustness, with some models maintaining similar performance while gaining robustness. Our study and adversarial training techniques have been incorporated into an open-source tool for generating camouflaged datasets. However, methodology effectiveness depends on the specific camouflage technique and data encountered, emphasizing the need for continued exploration. ",

We rely on a few training samples labeled with position ground truth and many training samples in which only the LED state is known, whose collection is cheap. We show that using LED state prediction as a pretext task significantly helps to learn the visual localization end task. The resulting model does not require knowledge of LED states during inference. We instantiate the approach to visual relative localization of nano-quadrotors: experimental results show that using our pretext task significantly improves localization accuracy (from 68.3% to 76.2%) and outperforms alternative strategies, such as a supervised baseline, model pre-training, and an autoencoding pretext task. We deploy our model aboard a 27-g Crazyflie nano-drone, running at 21 fps, in a position-tracking task of a peer nano-drone. Our approach, relying on position labels for only 300 images, yields a mean tracking error of 4.2 cm versus 11.9 cm of a supervised baseline model trained without our pretext task.

Each dataset comes with multiple domains, allowing us to test how well a model trained in one domain performs in another. For each prediction task, we select features that have a causal influence on the target of prediction. Our goal is to test the hypothesis that models trained on causal features generalize better across domains. Without exception, we find that predictors using all available features, regardless of causality, have better in-domain and out-of-domain accuracy than predictors using causal features. Moreover, even the absolute drop in accuracy from one domain to the other is no better for causal predictors than for models that use all features. If the goal is to generalize to new domains, practitioners might as well train the best possible model on all available features. ",

Although some existing methods employ model self-enhancement techniques, they fall short of effectively addressing unknown factual hallucinations. Using Knowledge Graph (KG) enhancement approaches fails to address the generalization across different KG sources and the enhancement of open-ended answer questions simultaneously. To tackle these limitations, there is a framework that combines Pseudo-Graph Generation and Atomic Knowledge Verification proposed. The enhancement of LLM using KG in an open-ended question-answering setting is implemented by leveraging the Pseudo-Graph Generation. Atomic Knowledge Verification utilizes atomic-level knowledge querying and verification to achieve generalizability under different KG sources. Compared to the baseline, this approach yields a minimum improvement of 11.5 in the ROUGE-L score for open-ended questions. For precise questions, we observe a minimum accuracy improvement of 7.5. Moreover, there is also demonstration that this framework exhibits generalizability across different KG sources. In summary, our results pave the way for enhancing LLMs by incorporating Pseudo- and Multisource-KGs, particularly in the context of open-ended questions. ",

With this work, we aim to bridge this gap by formally deriving a novel risk-sensitive deep reinforcement learning algorithm while providing numerical evidence for its efficacy. Specifically, we introduce discrete Soft Actor-Critic for the entropic risk measure by deriving a version of the Bellman equation for the respective Q-values. We establish a corresponding policy improvement result and infer a practical algorithm. We introduce an environment that represents typical contextual multi-stage stochastic combinatorial optimization problems and perform numerical experiments to empirically validate our algorithm's robustness against realistic distribution shifts, without compromising performance on the training distribution. We show that our algorithm is superior to risk-neutral Soft Actor-Critic as well as to two benchmark approaches for robust deep reinforcement learning. Thereby, we provide the first structured analysis on the robustness of reinforcement learning under distribution shifts in the realm of contextual multi-stage stochastic combinatorial optimization problems.

Our approach is based on a reconstruction attack against the gossip averaging protocol, which we then extend to handle the additional challenges raised by D-GD. We validate the effectiveness of our attack on real graphs and datasets, showing that the number of users compromised by a single or a handful of attackers is often surprisingly large.

But in terms of a single 2D view rendered from different angles, only limited partial information can be provided.The richness and value of Multi-view 2D information can provide superior self-supervised signals for 3D objects. In this paper, we propose a novel self-supervised point cloud representation learning method, MM-Point, which is driven by intra-modal and inter-modal similarity objectives. The core of MM-Point lies in the Multi-modal interaction and transmission between 3D objects and multiple 2D views at the same time. In order to more effectively simultaneously perform the consistent cross-modal objective of 2D multi-view information based on contrastive learning, we further propose Multi-MLP and Multi-level Augmentation strategies. Through carefully designed transformation strategies, we further learn Multi-level invariance in 2D Multi-views. MM-Point demonstrates state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in various downstream tasks. For instance, it achieves a peak accuracy of 92.4% on the synthetic dataset ModelNet40, and a top accuracy of 87.8% on the real-world dataset ScanObjectNN, comparable to fully supervised methods.

To prevent widespread consequences, platforms are eager to predict these videos' impact on viewers' mental health. Subsequently, they can take intervention measures, such as revising recommendation algorithms and displaying viewer discretion. Nevertheless, applicable predictive methods lack relevance to well-established medical knowledge, which outlines clinically proven external and environmental factors of depression. To account for such medical knowledge, we resort to an emergent methodological discipline, seeded Neural Topic Models (NTMs). However, existing seeded NTMs suffer from the limitations of single-origin topics, unknown topic sources, unclear seed supervision, and suboptimal convergence. To address those challenges, we develop a novel Knowledge-guided Multimodal NTM to predict a short-form video's depressive impact on viewers. Extensive empirical analyses using TikTok and Douyin datasets prove that our method outperforms state-of-the-art benchmarks. Our method also discovers medically relevant topics from videos that are linked to depressive impact. We contribute to IS with a novel video analytics method that is generalizable to other video classification problems. Practically, our method can help platforms understand videos' mental impacts, thus adjusting recommendations and video topic disclosure. ",

    "abstract": "Byzantine consensus allows n processes to decide on a common value, in spite of arbitrary failures. The seminal Dolev-Reischuk bound states that any deterministic solution to Byzantine consensus exchanges Omega(n^2) bits. In recent years, great advances have been made in deterministic Byzantine agreement for partially synchronous networks, with state-of-the-art cryptographic solutions achieving O(n^2 \\kappa) bits (where $\\kappa$ is the security parameter) and nearly matching the lower bound. In contrast, for synchronous networks, optimal solutions with O(n^2) bits, with no cryptography and the same failure tolerance, have been known for more than three decades. Can this gap in network models be closed? In this paper, we present Repeater, the first generic transformation of Byzantine agreement algorithms from synchrony to partial synchrony. Repeater is modular, relying on existing and novel algorithms for its sub-modules. With the right choice of modules, Repeater requires no additional cryptography, is optimally resilient (n = 3t+1, where t is the maximum number of failures) and, for constant-size inputs, preserves the worst-case per-process bit complexity of the transformed synchronous algorithm. Leveraging Repeater, we present the first partially synchronous algorithm that (1) achieves optimal bit complexity (O(n^2) bits), (2) resists a computationally unbounded adversary (no cryptography), and (3) is optimally-resilient (n = 3t+1), thus showing that the Dolev-Reischuk bound is tight in partial synchrony. Moreover, we adapt Repeater for long inputs, introducing several new algorithms with improved complexity and weaker (or completely absent) cryptographic assumptions. ",

    "abstract": "For a machine learning model deployed in real world scenarios, the ability of detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) samples is indispensable and challenging. Most existing OOD detection methods focused on exploring advanced training skills or training-free tricks to prevent the model from yielding overconfident confidence score for unknown samples. The training-based methods require expensive training cost and rely on OOD samples which are not always available, while most training-free methods can not efficiently utilize the prior information from the training data. In this work, we propose an \\textbf{O}ptimal \\textbf{P}arameter and \\textbf{N}euron \\textbf{P}runing (\\textbf{OPNP}) approach, which aims to identify and remove those parameters and neurons that lead to over-fitting. The main method is divided into two steps. In the first step, we evaluate the sensitivity of the model parameters and neurons by averaging gradients over all training samples. In the second step, the parameters and neurons with exceptionally large or close to zero sensitivities are removed for prediction. Our proposal is training-free, compatible with other post-hoc methods, and exploring the information from all training data. Extensive experiments are performed on multiple OOD detection tasks and model architectures, showing that our proposed OPNP consistently outperforms the existing methods by a large margin. ",

    "abstract": "Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) is a practical and challenging problem for achieving general artificial intelligence. Recently, Pre-Trained Models (PTMs) have led to breakthroughs in both visual and natural language processing tasks. Despite recent studies showing PTMs' potential ability to learn sequentially, a plethora of work indicates the necessity of alleviating the catastrophic forgetting of PTMs. Through a pilot study and a causal analysis of CIL, we reveal that the crux lies in the imbalanced causal effects between new and old data. Specifically, the new data encourage models to adapt to new classes while hindering the adaptation of old classes. Similarly, the old data encourages models to adapt to old classes while hindering the adaptation of new classes. In other words, the adaptation process between new and old classes conflicts from the causal perspective. To alleviate this problem, we propose Balancing the Causal Effects (BaCE) in CIL. Concretely, BaCE proposes two objectives for building causal paths from both new and old data to the prediction of new and classes, respectively. In this way, the model is encouraged to adapt to all classes with causal effects from both new and old data and thus alleviates the causal imbalance problem. We conduct extensive experiments on continual image classification, continual text classification, and continual named entity recognition. Empirical results show that BaCE outperforms a series of CIL methods on different tasks and settings. ",

The proposed neuro-inspired NYCTALE offers a novel pathway in the domain of Personalized Medicine (PM) for lung cancer diagnosis. In nature, Nyctales are small owls known for their nocturnal behavior, hunting primarily during the darkness of night. The NYCTALE operates in a similarly vigilant manner, i.e., processing data in an evidence-based fashion and making predictions dynamically/adaptively. Distinct from conventional Computed Tomography (CT)-based Deep Learning (DL) models, the NYCTALE performs predictions only when sufficient amount of evidence is accumulated. In other words, instead of processing all or a pre-defined subset of CT slices, for each person, slices are provided one at a time. The NYCTALE framework then computes an evidence vector associated with contribution of each new CT image. A decision is made once the total accumulated evidence surpasses a specific threshold. Preliminary experimental analyses conducted using a challenging in-house dataset comprising 114 subjects. The results are noteworthy, suggesting that NYCTALE outperforms the benchmark accuracy even with approximately 60% less training data on this demanding and small dataset. ",

The complexity escalates further when implementing RL in recurrent spiking networks, where inherent noise introduced by spikes adds a layer of difficulty. Life-long learning machines must inherently resolve the plasticity-stability paradox. Striking a balance between acquiring new knowledge and maintaining stability is crucial for artificial agents. In this context, we take inspiration from machine learning technology and introduce a biologically plausible implementation of proximal policy optimization, arguing that it significantly alleviates this challenge. Our approach yields two notable advancements: first, the ability to assimilate new information without necessitating alterations to the current policy, and second, the capability to replay experiences without succumbing to policy divergence. Furthermore, when contrasted with other experience replay (ER) techniques, our method demonstrates the added advantage of being computationally efficient in an online setting.

Active learning for GNNs aims to query the valuable samples from the unlabeled data for annotation to maximize the GNNs' performance at a low cost. However, most existing methods for reinforced active learning in GNNs may lead to a highly imbalanced class distribution, especially in highly skewed class scenarios. This further adversely affects the classification performance. To tackle this issue, in this paper, we propose a novel reinforced class-balanced active learning framework for GNNs, namely, GraphCBAL. It learns an optimal policy to acquire class-balanced and informative nodes for annotation, maximizing the performance of GNNs trained with selected labeled nodes. GraphCBAL designs class-balance-aware states, as well as a reward function that achieves trade-off between model performance and class balance. We further upgrade GraphCBAL to GraphCBAL++ by introducing a punishment mechanism to obtain a more class-balanced labeled set. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approaches, achieving superior performance over state-of-the-art baselines.

Our study introduces a novel robust aggregation mechanism utilizing the Fourier Transform (FT), which is able to effectively handling sophisticated attacks without prior knowledge of the number of attackers. Employing this data technique, weights generated by FL clients are projected into the frequency domain to ascertain their density function, selecting the one exhibiting the highest frequency.

To mitigate these issues, numerous well-established methods were proposed for neural network quantization. To further enhance their portability of independent deployment as well as improve their stability evaluated by language perplexity, we propose a novel approach called the Quantized Embedding Controllable Diffusion Language Model (QE-CDLM). QE-CDLM builds upon the recent successful controllable DLMs by remodeling the task-specific embedding space via quantization. This leads to a gradient-based controller for the generation tasks, and more stable intermediate latent variables are obtained, which naturally brings in an accelerated convergence as well as better controllability. Additionally, the adaption fine-tuning method is employed to reduce tunable weights.

Several AI indices have emerged to assess countries' progress in AI development, aiding decision-making on investments and policy choices. Typically, these indices combine multiple indicators using linear additive methods such as weighted sums, although they are limited in their ability to account for interactions among indicators. Another limitation concerns the use of deterministic weights, which can be perceived as subjective and vulnerable to debate and scrutiny, especially by nations that feel disadvantaged. Aiming at mitigating these problems, we conduct a methodological analysis to derive AI indices based on multiple criteria decision analysis. Initially, we assess correlations between different AI dimensions and employ the Choquet integral to model them. Thus, we apply the Stochastic Multicriteria Acceptability Analysis (SMAA) to conduct a sensitivity analysis using both weighted sum and Choquet integral in order to evaluate the stability of the indices with regard the weights. Finally, we introduce a novel ranking methodology based on SMAA, which considers several sets of weights to derive the ranking of countries. As a result, instead of using predefined weights, in the proposed approach, the ranking is achieved based on the probabilities of countries in occupying a specific position. In the computational analysis, we utilize the data employed in The Global AI Index proposed by Tortoise. Results reveal correlations in the data, and our approach effectively mitigates bias. In the sensitivity analysis, we scrutinize changes in the ranking resulting from weight adjustments. We demonstrate that our proposal rankings closely align with those derived from weight variations, proving to be more robust. ",

In this study, we leverage the concept of traveling wave dynamics within a neural lattice to formulate a theoretical model of neural working memory, study its properties, and its real world implications in AI. The proposed model diverges from traditional approaches, which assume information storage in static, register-like locations updated by interference. Instead, the model stores data as waves that is updated by the wave's boundary conditions. We rigorously examine the model's capabilities in representing and learning state histories, which are vital for learning history-dependent dynamical systems. The findings reveal that the model reliably stores external information and enhances the learning process by addressing the diminishing gradient problem. To understand the model's real-world applicability, we explore two cases: linear boundary condition and non-linear, self-attention-driven boundary condition. The experiments reveal that the linear scenario is effectively learned by Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) through backpropagation when modeling history-dependent dynamical systems. Conversely, the non-linear scenario parallels the autoregressive loop of an attention-only transformer.

Building on this framework, we then systematically investigate the performance impact of information structure in the reward modeling stage of RLHF. To further understand reward generalization in the reward modeling stage, we introduce a new method based on random graph theory that models generalization in the semantic space. A key insight of our analysis is the superiority of the tree-based information structure in reward modeling, compared to chain-based baselines adopted by conventional RLHF methods. We derive that under highly complex contexts with limited data, the tree-based reward model (RM) induces up to $\\Theta(\\log n/\\log\\log n)$ times less variance than chain-based RM where $n$ is the dataset size. To validate our theoretical contribution, we demonstrate that on three different NLP tasks, the tree-based RM achieves 65% win rate on average against chain-based baselines. Looking forward, we hope our framework can serve as a step towards understanding goal misgeneralization. ",

    "abstract": "Language agents powered by large language models (LLMs) have seen exploding development. Their capability of using language as a vehicle for thought and communication lends an incredible level of flexibility and versatility. People have quickly capitalized on this capability to connect LLMs to a wide range of external components and environments: databases, tools, the Internet, robotic embodiment, etc. Many believe an unprecedentedly powerful automation technology is emerging. However, new automation technologies come with new safety risks, especially for intricate systems like language agents. There is a surprisingly large gap between the speed and scale of their development and deployment and our understanding of their safety risks. Are we building a house of cards? In this position paper, we present the first systematic effort in mapping adversarial attacks against language agents. We first present a unified conceptual framework for agents with three major components: Perception, Brain, and Action. Under this framework, we present a comprehensive discussion and propose 12 potential attack scenarios against different components of an agent, covering different attack strategies (e.g., input manipulation, adversarial demonstrations, jailbreaking, backdoors). We also draw connections to successful attack strategies previously applied to LLMs. We emphasize the urgency to gain a thorough understanding of language agent risks before their widespread deployment.

Typically, the reduction approaches either remove edges (sparsification) or merge nodes (coarsening) in an unsupervised way with no specific downstream task in mind. In this paper, we present an approach for subsampling graph structures using an Ising model defined on either the nodes or edges and learning the external magnetic field of the Ising model using a graph neural network. Our approach is task-specific as it can learn how to reduce a graph for a specific downstream task in an end-to-end fashion. The utilized loss function of the task does not even have to be differentiable.

However, the use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) introduces a challenge, as UAVs can detect RF signals from the ground by hovering over specific areas of interest. With the growing utilization of UAVs in modern surveillance, there is a crucial need for a thorough understanding of their unknown nonlinear dynamic trajectories to effectively implement LPD communication. Unfortunately, this critical information is often not readily available, posing a significant hurdle in LPD communication. To address this issue, we consider a case-study for enabling terrestrial LPD communication in the presence of multiple UAVs that are engaged in surveillance. We introduce a novel framework that combines graph neural networks (GNN) with Koopman theory to predict the trajectories of multiple fixed-wing UAVs over an extended prediction horizon. Using the predicted UAV locations, we enable LPD communication in a terrestrial ad-hoc network by controlling nodes' transmit powers to keep the received power at UAVs' predicted locations minimized. Our extensive simulations validate the efficacy of the proposed framework in accurately predicting the trajectories of multiple UAVs, thereby effectively establishing LPD communication. ",

    "abstract": "The popularity and diffusion of wearable devices provides new opportunities for sensor-based human activity recognition that leverages deep learning-based algorithms. Although impressive advances have been made, two major challenges remain. First, sensor data is often incomplete or noisy due to sensor placement and other issues as well as data transmission failure, calling for imputation of missing values, which also introduces noise. Second, human activity has multi-scale characteristics. Thus, different groups of people and even the same person may behave differently under different circumstances. To address these challenges, we propose a multilevel heterogeneous neural network, called MHNN, for sensor data analysis. We utilize multilevel discrete wavelet decomposition to extract multi-resolution features from sensor data. This enables distinguishing signals with different frequencies, thereby suppressing noise. As the components resulting from the decomposition are heterogeneous, we equip the proposed model with heterogeneous feature extractors that enable the learning of multi-scale features. Due to the complementarity of these features, we also include a cross aggregation module for enhancing their interactions. An experimental study using seven publicly available datasets offers evidence that MHNN can outperform other cutting-edge models and offers evidence of robustness to missing values and noise. An ablation study confirms the importance of each module. ",

In contrast to previous studies, a critical part of our study was permutation feature importance analysis, which highlighted key features for grasp classification. It revealed that the most crucial brain activities during grasping occur in the motor cortex, within the alpha and beta frequency bands.

Achieving general representation through self-supervised learning (SSL) is a well-known approach to overcome the scarcity of labeled data; however, a naive application of SSL to ECG data, without considering the spatial-temporal relationships inherent in ECG signals, may yield suboptimal results. In this paper, we introduce ST-MEM (Spatio-Temporal Masked Electrocardiogram Modeling), designed to learn spatio-temporal features by reconstructing masked 12-lead ECG data. ST-MEM outperforms other SSL baseline methods in various experimental settings for arrhythmia classification tasks. Moreover, we demonstrate that ST-MEM is adaptable to various lead combinations.

The quality of generated signals measured using Frechet Inception Distance (FID) yielded scores of 1.345 and 11.565 for eyes-open and closed respectively. Even without a spectral or spatial loss term, our WGAN model was able to emulate the spectral and spatial properties of the EEG training data. The WGAN-generated data mirrored the dominant alpha activity during closed-eye resting and high delta waves in the training data in its topographic map and power spectral density (PSD) plot.

At the same time, there is a growing number of scientific papers using not commercial, but custom do-it-yourself IMU-based systems in medical and sports applications. Even though these solutions can help to popularize the use of this technology, they have more limited features and the description on how to design and build them from scratch is yet too scarce in the literature. The aim of this work is two-fold: (1) Proving the feasibility of building an affordable custom solution aimed at simultaneous multiple body parts orientation tracking; while providing a detailed bottom-up description of the required hardware, tools, and mathematical operations to estimate and represent 3D movement in real-time. (2) Showing how the introduction of a custom 2.4 GHz communication protocol including a channel hopping strategy can address some of the current communication limitations of entry-level commercial solutions. The proposed system can be used for wireless real-time human body parts orientation tracking with up to 10 custom sensors, at least at 50 Hz. In addition, it provides a more reliable motion data acquisition in Bluetooth and Wi-Fi crowded environments, where the use of entry-level commercial solutions might be unfeasible.

There have been prior studies applying AI approaches based on deep learning for heart disease detection. However, these models are yet to be widely accepted as a reliable aid for clinical diagnostics, in part due to the current black-box perception surrounding many AI algorithms. In particular, there is a need to identify the key features of the ECG signal that contribute toward making an accurate diagnosis, thereby enhancing the interpretability of the model. In the present study, we develop a vision transformer approach to identify atrial fibrillation based on single-lead ECG data. A residual network (ResNet) approach is also developed for comparison with the vision transformer approach. These models are applied to the Chapman-Shaoxing dataset to classify atrial fibrillation, as well as another common arrhythmia, sinus bradycardia, and normal sinus rhythm heartbeats. The models enable the identification of the key regions of the heartbeat that determine the resulting classification, and highlight the importance of P-waves and T-waves, as well as heartbeat duration and signal amplitude, in distinguishing normal sinus rhythm from atrial fibrillation and sinus bradycardia.

To address this issue, we propose a novel method called Temporally and Anatomically Informed Generative Adversarial Network (TAI-GAN) that utilizes an all-to-one mapping to convert early frames into those with tracer distribution similar to the last reference frame.

Our proposed method was evaluated on a clinical 82-Rb PET dataset, and the results show that our TAI-GAN can produce converted early frames with high image quality, comparable to the real reference frames. After TAI-GAN conversion, the motion estimation accuracy and subsequent myocardial blood flow (MBF) quantification with both conventional and deep learning-based motion correction methods were improved compared to using the original frames.

Prompted by the need for dependable uncertainty estimates in motion planning applications where the behavior of diverse objects may be more or less unpredictable, we blend different techniques from online conformal prediction of single and multiple time series, as well as ideas for addressing heteroscedasticity in regression. This solution is both principled, providing precise finite-sample guarantees, and effective, often leading to more informative predictions than prior methods. ",

    "abstract": "The singular value decomposition (SVD) is a crucial tool in machine learning and statistical data analysis. However, it is highly susceptible to outliers in the data matrix. Existing robust SVD algorithms often sacrifice speed for robustness or fail in the presence of only a few outliers. This study introduces an efficient algorithm, called Spherically Normalized SVD, for robust SVD approximation that is highly insensitive to outliers, computationally scalable, and provides accurate approximations of singular vectors. The proposed algorithm achieves remarkable speed by utilizing only two applications of a standard reduced-rank SVD algorithm to appropriately scaled data, significantly outperforming competing algorithms in computation times. To assess the robustness of the approximated singular vectors and their subspaces against data contamination, we introduce new notions of breakdown points for matrix-valued input, including row-wise, column-wise, and block-wise breakdown points. Theoretical and empirical analyses demonstrate that our algorithm exhibits higher breakdown points compared to standard SVD and its modifications. We empirically validate the effectiveness of our approach in applications such as robust low-rank approximation and robust principal component analysis of high-dimensional microarray datasets. Overall, our study presents a highly efficient and robust solution for SVD approximation that overcomes the limitations of existing algorithms in the presence of outliers. ",

    "abstract": "While actors in a population can interact with anyone else freely, social relations significantly influence our inclination towards particular individuals. The consequence of such interactions, however, may also form the intensity of our relations established earlier. These dynamical processes are captured via a coevolutionary model staged in multiplex networks with two distinct layers. In a so-called relationship layer the weights of edges among players may change in time as a consequence of games played in the alternative interaction layer. As an reasonable assumption, bilateral cooperation confirms while mutual defection weakens these weight factors. Importantly, the fitness of a player, which basically determines the success of a strategy imitation, depends not only on the payoff collected from interactions, but also on the individual relationship index calculated from the mentioned weight factors of related edges. Within the framework of weak prisoner's dilemma situation we explore the potential outcomes of the mentioned coevolutionary process where we assume different topologies for relationship layer. We find that higher average degree of the relationship graph is more beneficial to maintain cooperation in regular graphs, but the randomness of links could be a decisive factor in harsh situations. Surprisingly, a stronger coupling between relationship index and fitness discourage the evolution of cooperation by weakening the direct consequence of a strategy change. To complete our study we also monitor how the distribution of relationship index vary and detect a strong relation between its polarization and the general cooperation level. ",

Many prior works learn mappings between channel state information (CSI) and position fully-supervised. However, that approach relies on position labels which are very expensive to acquire. In this work, this requirement is relaxed by using pseudo-labels during deployment, which are calculated from an inertial measurement unit (IMU). We propose practical algorithms for IMU double integration and training of the localization system. We show decimeter-level accuracy on simulated and challenging real data of 5G measurements. Our IMU-supervised method performs similarly to fully-supervised, but requires much less effort to deploy. ",

It has nonlinear relation between the materials and the spectral information provided by the HSI image. Deep learning methods have shown superiority in learning this nonlinearity in comparison to traditional machine learning methods. Use of 3-D CNN along with 2-D CNN have shown great success for learning spatial and spectral features. However, it uses comparatively large number of parameters. Moreover, it is not effective to learn inter layer information. Hence, this paper proposes a neural network combining 3-D CNN, 2-D CNN and Bi-LSTM. The performance of this model has been tested on Indian Pines(IP) University of Pavia(PU) and Salinas Scene(SA) data sets. The results are compared with the state of-the-art deep learning-based models. This model performed better in all three datasets. It could achieve 99.83, 99.98 and 100 percent accuracy using only 30 percent trainable parameters of the state-of-art model in IP, PU and SA datasets respectively. ",

    "abstract": "The morphology and hierarchy of the vascular systems are essential for perfusion in supporting metabolism. In human retina, one of the most energy-demanding organs, retinal circulation nourishes the entire inner retina by an intricate vasculature emerging and remerging at the optic nerve head (ONH). Thus, tracing the vascular branching from ONH through the vascular tree can illustrate vascular hierarchy and allow detailed morphological quantification, and yet remains a challenging task. Here, we presented a novel approach for a robust semi-automatic vessel tracing algorithm on human fundus images by an instance segmentation neural network (InSegNN). Distinct from semantic segmentation, InSegNN separates and labels different vascular trees individually and therefore enable tracing each tree throughout its branching. We have built-in three strategies to improve robustness and accuracy with temporal learning, spatial multi-sampling, and dynamic probability map. We achieved 83% specificity, and 50% improvement in Symmetric Best Dice (SBD) compared to literature, and outperformed baseline U-net. We have demonstrated tracing individual vessel trees from fundus images, and simultaneously retain the vessel hierarchy information. InSegNN paves a way for any subsequent morphological analysis of vascular morphology in relation to retinal diseases. ",

Although graph neural network (GNN)-based data detectors can achieve decent detection accuracy at reasonable computation cost, they fail to best harness prior information of transmitted data. To further minimize the data detection error of OTFS systems, this letter develops an AMP-GNN-based detector, leveraging the approximate message passing (AMP) algorithm to iteratively improve the symbol estimates of a GNN. Given the inter-Doppler interference (IDI) symbols incur substantial computational overhead to the constructed GNN, learning-based IDI approximation is implemented to sustain low detection complexity. Simulation results demonstrate a remarkable bit error rate (BER) performance achieved by the proposed AMP-GNN-based detector compared to existing baselines. Meanwhile, the proposed IDI approximation scheme avoids a large amount of computations with negligible BER degradation. ",

However, existing results only establish weak convergence of the empirical eigenvalue distribution, and fall short of providing precise quantitative characterizations of the ''spike'' eigenvalues and eigenvectors that often capture the low-dimensional signal structure of the learning problem. In this work, we characterize these signal eigenvalues and eigenvectors for a nonlinear version of the spiked covariance model, including the CK as a special case. Using this general result, we give a quantitative description of how spiked eigenstructure in the input data propagates through the hidden layers of a neural network with random weights. As a second application, we study a simple regime of representation learning where the weight matrix develops a rank-one signal component over training and characterize the alignment of the target function with the spike eigenvector of the CK on test data.
