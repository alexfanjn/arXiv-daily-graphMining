    "abstract": "Traditional models focus on horizontal table detection but struggle in rotating contexts, limiting progress in table recognition. This paper introduces a new task: detecting table regions and localizing head-tail parts in rotation scenarios. We propose corresponding datasets, evaluation metrics, and methods. Our novel method, 'Adaptively Bounded Rotation,' addresses dataset scarcity in detecting rotated tables and their head-tail parts. We produced 'TRR360D,' a dataset incorporating semantic information of table head and tail, based on 'ICDAR2019MTD.' A new metric, 'R360 AP,' measures precision in detecting rotated regions and localizing head-tail parts. Our baseline, the high-speed and accurate 'RTMDet-S,' is chosen after extensive review and testing. We introduce 'RTHDet,' enhancing the baseline with a 'r360' rotated rectangle angle representation and an 'Angle Loss' branch, improving head-tail localization. By applying transfer learning and adaptive boundary rotation augmentation, RTHDet's AP50 (T<90) improved from 23.7% to 88.7% compared to the baseline. This demonstrates RTHDet's effectiveness in detecting rotating table regions and accurately localizing head and tail parts.RTHDet is integrated into the widely-used open-source MMRotate toolkit: https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmrotate/tree/dev-1.x/projects/RR360.

    "abstract": "Vision Transformers (ViTs) have gained prominence as a preferred choice for a wide range of computer vision tasks due to their exceptional performance. However, their widespread adoption has raised concerns about security in the face of malicious attacks. Most existing methods rely on empirical adjustments during the training process, lacking a clear theoretical foundation. In this study, we address this gap by introducing SpecFormer, specifically designed to enhance ViTs' resilience against adversarial attacks, with support from carefully derived theoretical guarantees. We establish local Lipschitz bounds for the self-attention layer and introduce a novel approach, Maximum Singular Value Penalization (MSVP), to attain precise control over these bounds. We seamlessly integrate MSVP into ViTs' attention layers, using the power iteration method for enhanced computational efficiency. The modified model, SpecFormer, effectively reduces the spectral norms of attention weight matrices, thereby enhancing network local Lipschitzness. This, in turn, leads to improved training efficiency and robustness. Extensive experiments on CIFAR and ImageNet datasets confirm SpecFormer's superior performance in defending against adversarial attacks. ",

    "title": "Connect Later: Improving Fine-tuning for Robustness with Targeted  Augmentations",
    "abstract": "Models trained on a labeled source domain (e.g., labeled images from wildlife camera traps) often generalize poorly when deployed on an out-of-distribution (OOD) target domain (e.g., images from new camera trap locations). In the domain adaptation setting where unlabeled target data is available, self-supervised pretraining (e.g., masked autoencoding or contrastive learning) is a promising method to mitigate this performance drop. Pretraining improves OOD error when the generic data augmentations used (e.g., masking or cropping) connect the source and target domains, which may be far apart in the input space. In this paper, we show on real-world tasks that standard fine-tuning after pretraining does not consistently improve OOD error over simply training from scratch on labeled source data. To better leverage pretraining for distribution shifts, we propose Connect Later: after pretraining with generic augmentations, fine-tune with targeted augmentations designed with knowledge of the distribution shift. Pretraining learns good representations within the source and target domains, while targeted augmentations connect the domains better during fine-tuning. Connect Later improves average OOD error over standard fine-tuning and supervised learning with targeted augmentations on 4 real-world datasets: Connect Later achieves the state-of-the-art on astronomical time-series classification (AstroClassification) by 2.5%, wildlife species identification (iWildCam-WILDS) with ResNet-50 by 0.9%, and tumor identification (Camelyon17-WILDS) with DenseNet121 by 1.1%; as well as best performance on a new dataset for astronomical time-series redshift prediction (Redshifts) by 0.03 RMSE (11% relative).

This offers greater adaptability compared to the DAG structure of current ANNs. We further develop the Graph Over Multi-layer Perceptron, which is the first detailed model based on this new design paradigm. Experimental validation of the Cyclic NN's advantages on widely tested datasets in most generalized cases, demonstrating its superiority over current BP training methods through the use of a forward-forward (FF) training algorithm.

    "abstract": "In upcoming 6G networks, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are expected to play a fundamental role by acting as mobile base stations, particularly for demanding vehicle-to-everything (V2X) applications. In this scenario, one of the most challenging problems is the design of trajectories for multiple UAVs, cooperatively serving the same area. Such joint trajectory design can be performed using multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) algorithms, but ensuring collision-free paths among UAVs becomes a critical challenge. Traditional methods involve imposing high penalties during training to discourage unsafe conditions, but these can be proven to be ineffective, whereas binary masks can be used to restrict unsafe actions, but naively applying them to all agents can lead to suboptimal solutions and inefficiencies. To address these issues, we propose a rank-based binary masking approach. Higher-ranked UAVs move optimally, while lower-ranked UAVs use this information to define improved binary masks, reducing the number of unsafe actions. This approach allows to obtain a good trade-off between exploration and exploitation, resulting in enhanced training performance, while maintaining safety constraints. ",

    "abstract": "This study aims to minimize the influence of fake news on social networks by deploying debunkers to propagate true news. This is framed as a reinforcement learning problem, where, at each stage, one user is selected to propagate true news. A challenging issue is episodic reward where the \"net\" effect of selecting individual debunkers cannot be discerned from the interleaving information propagation on social networks, and only the collective effect from mitigation efforts can be observed. Existing Self-Imitation Learning (SIL) methods have shown promise in learning from episodic rewards, but are ill-suited to the real-world application of fake news mitigation because of their poor sample efficiency. To learn a more effective debunker selection policy for fake news mitigation, this study proposes NAGASIL - Negative sampling and state Augmented Generative Adversarial Self-Imitation Learning, which consists of two improvements geared towards fake news mitigation: learning from negative samples, and an augmented state representation to capture the \"real\" environment state by integrating the current observed state with the previous state-action pairs from the same campaign. Experiments on two social networks show that NAGASIL yields superior performance to standard GASIL and state-of-the-art fake news mitigation models. ",

    "abstract": "In recent years, graph neural networks (GNNs) have become a popular tool to improve the accuracy and performance of recommender systems. Modern recommender systems are not only designed to serve the end users, but also to benefit other participants, such as items and items providers. These participants may have different or conflicting goals and interests, which raise the need for fairness and popularity bias considerations. GNN-based recommendation methods also face the challenges of unfairness and popularity bias and their normalization and aggregation processes suffer from these challenges. In this paper, we propose a fair GNN-based recommender system, called HetroFair, to improve items' side fairness. HetroFair uses two separate components to generate fairness-aware embeddings: i) fairness-aware attention which incorporates dot product in the normalization process of GNNs, to decrease the effect of nodes' degrees, and ii) heterophily feature weighting to assign distinct weights to different features during the aggregation process. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of HetroFair, we conduct extensive experiments over six real-world datasets. Our experimental results reveal that HetroFair not only alleviates the unfairness and popularity bias on the items' side, but also achieves superior accuracy on the users' side.

This study introduces a novel approach using transfer learning techniques. Various pre-trained networks, including EfficientNet, ResNet, VGG16, and Inception, were tested through exhaustive optimization to identify the most suitable architecture. Transfer learning was applied to fine-tune these models on a glioblastoma image dataset, aiming to achieve two objectives: survival and tumor grade prediction.The experimental results show 65% accuracy in survival prediction, classifying patients into short, medium, or long survival categories. Additionally, the prediction of tumor grade achieved an accuracy of 97%, accurately differentiating low-grade gliomas (LGG) and high-grade gliomas (HGG). The success of the approach is attributed to the effectiveness of transfer learning, surpassing the current state-of-the-art methods. In conclusion, this study presents a promising method for predicting the survival and grade of glioblastoma. Transfer learning demonstrates its potential in enhancing prediction models, particularly in scenarios with limited large datasets. These findings hold promise for improving diagnostic and treatment approaches for glioblastoma patients. ",

Methods: 235 students from 5 different educational centres participate in this study between March and December 2015. Data analysis carried out is divided into two blocks: social network analysis and unsupervised machine learning techniques. As for the social network analysis, the Girvan-Newman technique was applied to find the best number of cohesive groups within each of the friendship networks of the different classes analysed. Results: After applying Girvan-Newman in the three classes, the best division into clusters was respectively 2 for classroom A, 7 for classroom B and 6 for classroom C. There are significant differences between the groups and the gender and diet variables. After applying K-means using population diet as an input variable, a K-means clustering of 2 clusters for class A, 3 clusters for class B and 3 clusters for class C is obtained. Conclusion: Adolescents form subgroups within their classrooms. Subgroup cohesion is defined by the fact that nodes share similarities in aspects that influence obesity, they share attributes related to food quality and gender. The concept of homophily, related to SNA, justifies our results. Artificial intelligence techniques together with the application of the Girvan-Newman provide robustness to the structural analysis of similarities and cohesion between subgroups. ",

Recent work has shown that molecular graph generation using recurrent neural networks (RNNs) is advantageous compared to traditional generative approaches which require converting continuous latent representations into graphs. One issue which arises when treating graph generation as sequential generation is the arbitrary order of the sequence which results from a particular choice of graph flattening method. In this work we propose using RNNs, taking into account the non-sequential nature of graphs by adding an Orderless Regularization (OLR) term that encourages the hidden state of the recurrent model to be invariant to different valid orderings present under the training distribution. We demonstrate that sequential graph generation models benefit from our proposed regularization scheme, especially when data is scarce. Our findings contribute to the growing body of research on graph generation and provide a valuable tool for various applications requiring the synthesis of realistic and diverse graph structures. ",

    "abstract": "Criminal and suspicious activity detection has become a popular research topic in recent years. The rapid growth of computer vision technologies has had a crucial impact on solving this issue. However, physical stalking detection is still a less explored area despite the evolution of modern technology. Nowadays, stalking in public places has become a common occurrence with women being the most affected. Stalking is a visible action that usually occurs before any criminal activity begins as the stalker begins to follow, loiter, and stare at the victim before committing any criminal activity such as assault, kidnapping, rape, and so on. Therefore, it has become a necessity to detect stalking as all of these criminal activities can be stopped in the first place through stalking detection. In this research, we propose a novel deep learning-based hybrid fusion model to detect potential stalkers from a single video with a minimal number of frames. We extract multiple relevant features, such as facial landmarks, head pose estimation, and relative distance, as numerical values from video frames. This data is fed into a multilayer perceptron (MLP) to perform a classification task between a stalking and a non-stalking scenario. Simultaneously, the video frames are fed into a combination of convolutional and LSTM models to extract the spatio-temporal features. We use a fusion of these numerical and spatio-temporal features to build a classifier to detect stalking incidents. Additionally, we introduce a dataset consisting of stalking and non-stalking videos gathered from various feature films and television series, which is also used to train the model. The experimental results show the efficiency and dynamism of our proposed stalker detection system, achieving 89.58% testing accuracy with a significant improvement as compared to the state-of-the-art approaches.

Most existing research has addressed this problem by only studying individual static snapshots of networks that typically change over time. To address this gap, we study the evolution of recommendation fairness over time and its relation to dynamic network properties. We examine three real-world dynamic networks by evaluating the fairness of six recommendation algorithms and analyzing the association between fairness and network properties over time. We further study how interventions on network properties influence fairness by examining counterfactual scenarios with alternative evolution outcomes and differing network properties. Our results on empirical datasets suggest that recommendation fairness improves over time, regardless of the recommendation method. We also find that two network properties, minority ratio, and homophily ratio, exhibit stable correlations with fairness over time. Our counterfactual study further suggests that an extreme homophily ratio potentially contributes to unfair recommendations even with a balanced minority ratio. Our work provides insights into the evolution of fairness within dynamic networks in social science. We believe that our findings will help system operators and policymakers to better comprehend the implications of temporal changes and interventions targeting fairness in social networks. ",

Nevertheless, the inherent complexity of anatomical patterns and the random nature of lesion distribution in medical image segmentation pose significant challenges to the disentanglement of representations and the understanding of salient features. Methods guided by the maximization of mutual information, particularly within the framework of contrastive learning, have demonstrated remarkable success and superiority in decoupling densely intertwined representations. However, the effectiveness of contrastive learning highly depends on the quality of the positive and negative sample pairs, i.e. the unselected average mutual information among multi-views would obstruct the learning strategy so the selection of the views is vital. In this work, we introduce a novel approach predicated on representation distance-based mutual information (MI) maximization for measuring the significance of different views, aiming at conducting more efficient contrastive learning and representation disentanglement. Additionally, we introduce an MI re-ranking strategy for representation selection, benefiting both the continuous MI estimating and representation significance distance measuring. Specifically, we harness multi-view representations extracted from the frequency domain, re-evaluating their significance based on mutual information across varying frequencies, thereby facilitating a multifaceted contrastive learning approach to bolster semantic comprehension. The statistical results under the five metrics demonstrate that our proposed framework proficiently constrains the MI maximization-driven representation selection and steers the multi-view contrastive learning process.

A precise understanding of deformation can elevate robotic simulations and have broad implications across different industries. We introduce a method using Physics-Encoded Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for such predictions. Similar to robotic grasping and manipulation scenarios, we focus on modeling the dynamics between a rigid mesh contacting a deformable mesh under external forces. Our approach represents both the soft body and the rigid body within graph structures, where nodes hold the physical states of the meshes. We also incorporate cross-attention mechanisms to capture the interplay between the objects. By jointly learning geometry and physics, our model reconstructs consistent and detailed deformations. We've made our code and dataset public to advance research in robotic simulation and grasping. ",

    "abstract": "Text classification systems have been proven vulnerable to adversarial text examples, modified versions of the original text examples that are often unnoticed by human eyes, yet can force text classification models to alter their classification. Often, research works quantifying the impact of adversarial text attacks have been applied only to models trained in English. In this paper, we introduce the first word-level study of adversarial attacks in Arabic. Specifically, we use a synonym (word-level) attack using a Masked Language Modeling (MLM) task with a BERT model in a black-box setting to assess the robustness of the state-of-the-art text classification models to adversarial attacks in Arabic. To evaluate the grammatical and semantic similarities of the newly produced adversarial examples using our synonym BERT-based attack, we invite four human evaluators to assess and compare the produced adversarial examples with their original examples. We also study the transferability of these newly produced Arabic adversarial examples to various models and investigate the effectiveness of defense mechanisms against these adversarial examples on the BERT models. We find that fine-tuned BERT models were more susceptible to our synonym attacks than the other Deep Neural Networks (DNN) models like WordCNN and WordLSTM we trained. We also find that fine-tuned BERT models were more susceptible to transferred attacks. We, lastly, find that fine-tuned BERT models successfully regain at least 2% in accuracy after applying adversarial training as an initial defense mechanism. ",

A supervised learning approach was adopted, wherein an XGBoost model was trained utilizing 80\\% of the train dataset, encompassing 107 features (including the original and derived features). Subsequently, the model was evaluated on the remaining 20\\% of the test data. The model was validated on prospective data that was entirely unseen during the training phase. To assess the model's performance at the individual patient level and timeliness of the prediction, a normalized utility score was employed, a widely recognized scoring methodology for sepsis detection, as outlined in the PhysioNet Sepsis Challenge paper. Metrics such as F1 Score, Sensitivity, Specificity, and Flag Rate were also devised. The model achieved a normalized utility score of 0.494 on test data and 0.378 on prospective data at threshold 0.3. The F1 scores were 80.8\\% and 67.1\\% respectively for the test data and the prospective data for the same threshold, highlighting its potential to be integrated into clinical decision-making processes effectively. These results bear testament to the model's robust predictive capabilities and its potential to substantially impact clinical decision-making processes. ",

    "abstract": "For half a century, artificial intelligence research has attempted to reproduce the human qualities of abstraction and reasoning - creating computer systems that can learn new concepts from a minimal set of examples, in settings where humans find this easy. While specific neural networks are able to solve an impressive range of problems, broad generalisation to situations outside their training data has proved elusive.In this work, we look at several novel approaches for solving the Abstraction & Reasoning Corpus (ARC), a dataset of abstract visual reasoning tasks introduced to test algorithms on broad generalization. Despite three international competitions with $100,000 in prizes, the best algorithms still fail to solve a majority of ARC tasks and rely on complex hand-crafted rules, without using machine learning at all. We revisit whether recent advances in neural networks allow progress on this task. First, we adapt the DreamCoder neurosymbolic reasoning solver to ARC. DreamCoder automatically writes programs in a bespoke domain-specific language to perform reasoning, using a neural network to mimic human intuition. We present the Perceptual Abstraction and Reasoning Language (PeARL) language, which allows DreamCoder to solve ARC tasks, and propose a new recognition model that allows us to significantly improve on the previous best implementation.We also propose a new encoding and augmentation scheme that allows large language models (LLMs) to solve ARC tasks, and find that the largest models can solve some ARC tasks. LLMs are able to solve a different group of problems to state-of-the-art solvers, and provide an interesting way to complement other approaches. We perform an ensemble analysis, combining models to achieve better results than any system alone. Finally, we publish the arckit Python library to make future research on ARC easier. ",

We consider merit-based exposure as the desired fair outcome, which provides exposure to each action in proportion to the reward associated. We model the algorithm's effectiveness using fairness regret, which captures the difference between fair optimal policy and the policy output by the algorithm. Applying fair CMAB algorithm to each agent individually leads to fairness regret linear in the number of agents. We propose that collaborative -- federated learning can be more effective and provide the algorithm Fed-FairX-LinUCB that also ensures differential privacy. The primary challenge in extending the existing privacy framework is designing the communication protocol for communicating required information across agents. A naive protocol can either lead to weaker privacy guarantees or higher regret. We design a novel communication protocol that allows for (i) Sub-linear theoretical bounds on fairness regret for Fed-FairX-LinUCB and comparable bounds for the private counterpart, Priv-FairX-LinUCB (relative to single-agent learning), (ii) Effective use of privacy budget in Priv-FairX-LinUCB. We demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed algorithm with extensive simulations-based experiments. We show that both Fed-FairX-LinUCB and Priv-FairX-LinUCB achieve near-optimal fairness regret. ",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we present our framework for neural face/head reenactment whose goal is to transfer the 3D head orientation and expression of a target face to a source face. Previous methods focus on learning embedding networks for identity and head pose/expression disentanglement which proves to be a rather hard task, degrading the quality of the generated images. We take a different approach, bypassing the training of such networks, by using (fine-tuned) pre-trained GANs which have been shown capable of producing high-quality facial images. Because GANs are characterized by weak controllability, the core of our approach is a method to discover which directions in latent GAN space are responsible for controlling head pose and expression variations. We present a simple pipeline to learn such directions with the aid of a 3D shape model which, by construction, inherently captures disentangled directions for head pose, identity, and expression. Moreover, we show that by embedding real images in the GAN latent space, our method can be successfully used for the reenactment of real-world faces. Our method features several favorable properties including using a single source image (one-shot) and enabling cross-person reenactment. Extensive qualitative and quantitative results show that our approach typically produces reenacted faces of notably higher quality than those produced by state-of-the-art methods for the standard benchmarks of VoxCeleb1 & 2.

The main contribution of this paper is to prove a novel generalization bound for the binary classification setting with $\\ell_0$-bounded adversarial perturbation that is distribution-independent. Deriving a generalization bound in this setting has two main challenges: (i) the truncated inner product which is highly non-linear; and (ii) maximization over the $\\ell_0$ ball due to adversarial training is non-convex and highly non-smooth. To tackle these challenges, we develop new coding techniques for bounding the combinatorial dimension of the truncated hypothesis class. ",

Fort & Scherlis (2019) discovered that a high positive curvature and local convexity of the loss Hessian are associated with highly trainable initial points located in a region coined the \"Goldilocks zone\". Only a handful of subsequent studies touched upon this relationship, so it remains largely unexplained. In this paper, we present a rigorous and comprehensive analysis of the Goldilocks zone for homogeneous neural networks. In particular, we derive the fundamental condition resulting in non-zero positive curvature of the loss Hessian and argue that it is only incidentally related to the initialization norm, contrary to prior beliefs. Further, we relate high positive curvature to model confidence, low initial loss, and a previously unknown type of vanishing cross-entropy loss gradient. To understand the importance of positive curvature for trainability of deep networks, we optimize both fully-connected and convolutional architectures outside the Goldilocks zone and analyze the emergent behaviors. We find that strong model performance is not necessarily aligned with the Goldilocks zone, which questions the practical significance of this concept. ",

To tackle this problem, we propose a double-head discriminator algorithm, by introducing an addition source-only domain discriminator that are trained solely on source learning phase. We prove that with the introduction of a pre-trained source-only domain discriminator, the empirical estimation error of $\\gH$-divergence related adversarial loss is reduced from the source domain side. Further experiments on existing domain adaptation benchmark show that our proposed algorithm achieves more than 2$\\%$ improvement on all categories of target domain adaptation task while significantly mitigating the forgetting on source domain.

    "abstract": "Cancer subtyping is one of the most challenging tasks in digital pathology, where Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) by processing gigapixel whole slide images (WSIs) has been in the spotlight of recent research. However, MIL approaches do not take advantage of inter- and intra-magnification information contained in WSIs. In this work, we present GRASP, a novel graph-structured multi-magnification framework for processing WSIs in digital pathology. Our approach is designed to dynamically emulate the pathologist's behavior in handling WSIs and benefits from the hierarchical structure of WSIs. GRASP, which introduces a convergence-based node aggregation instead of traditional pooling mechanisms, outperforms state-of-the-art methods over two distinct cancer datasets by a margin of up to 10% balanced accuracy, while being 7 times smaller than the closest-performing state-of-the-art model in terms of the number of parameters. Our results show that GRASP is dynamic in finding and consulting with different magnifications for subtyping cancers and is reliable and stable across different hyperparameters. The model's behavior has been evaluated by two expert pathologists confirming the interpretability of the model's dynamic. We also provide a theoretical foundation, along with empirical evidence, for our work, explaining how GRASP interacts with different magnifications and nodes in the graph to make predictions. We believe that the strong characteristics yet simple structure of GRASP will encourage the development of interpretable, structure-based designs for WSI representation in digital pathology. Furthermore, we publish two large graph datasets of rare Ovarian and Bladder cancers to contribute to the field. ",

    "abstract": "Common click-through rate (CTR) prediction recommender models tend to exhibit feature-level bias, which leads to unfair recommendations among item groups and inaccurate recommendations for users. While existing methods address this issue by adjusting the learning of CTR models, such as through additional optimization objectives, they fail to consider how the bias is caused within these models. To address this research gap, our study performs a top-down analysis on representative CTR models. Through blocking different components of a trained CTR model one by one, we identify the key contribution of the linear component to feature-level bias. We conduct a theoretical analysis of the learning process for the weights in the linear component, revealing how group-wise properties of training data influence them. Our experimental and statistical analyses demonstrate a strong correlation between imbalanced positive sample ratios across item groups and feature-level bias. Based on this understanding, we propose a minimally invasive yet effective strategy to counteract feature-level bias in CTR models by removing the biased linear weights from trained models. Additionally, we present a linear weight adjusting strategy that requires fewer random exposure records than relevant debiasing methods. The superiority of our proposed strategies are validated through extensive experiments on three real-world datasets. ",

Instead, we propose a new Bayesian VAR model with a hierarchical graph prior over binary Granger causal graphs, separately from the VAR coefficients.

They are preferred in practice over other probabilistic representations such as Bayesian and Markov networks because PCs can solve marginal inference (MAR) tasks in time that scales linearly in the size of the network. Unfortunately, the maximum-a-posteriori (MAP) and marginal MAP (MMAP) tasks remain NP-hard in these models. Inspired by the recent work on using neural networks for generating near-optimal solutions to optimization problems such as integer linear programming, we propose an approach that uses neural networks to approximate (M)MAP inference in PCs. The key idea in our approach is to approximate the cost of an assignment to the query variables using a continuous multilinear function, and then use the latter as a loss function. The two main benefits of our new method are that it is self-supervised and after the neural network is learned, it requires only linear time to output a solution. We evaluate our new approach on several benchmark datasets and show that it outperforms three competing linear time approximations, max-product inference, max-marginal inference and sequential estimation, which are used in practice to solve MMAP tasks in PCs.

However, SAM often struggles when handling various unconventional images, such as aerial, medical, and non-RGB images. This paper presents CAT-SAM, a ConditionAl Tuning network that adapts SAM toward various unconventional target tasks with just few-shot target samples. CAT-SAM freezes the entire SAM and adapts its mask decoder and image encoder simultaneously with a small number of learnable parameters. The core design is a prompt bridge structure that enables decoder-conditioned joint tuning of the heavyweight image encoder and the lightweight mask decoder. The bridging maps the prompt token of the mask decoder to the image encoder, fostering synergic adaptation of the encoder and the decoder with mutual benefits. We develop two representative tuning strategies for the image encoder which leads to two CAT-SAM variants: one injecting learnable prompt tokens in the input space and the other inserting lightweight adapter networks. Extensive experiments over 11 unconventional tasks show that both CAT-SAM variants achieve superior target segmentation performance consistently even under the very challenging one-shot adaptation setup.

Analyzing and understanding network traffic is vital for improving network security and management. However, the analysis of network traffic poses great challenges due to the unique characteristics of data packets, such as heterogeneous headers and encrypted payload lacking semantics. To capture the latent semantics of traffic, a few studies have adopted pre-training techniques based on the Transformer encoder or decoder to learn the representations from large-scale traffic data. However, these methods typically excel only in traffic understanding (classification) or traffic generation tasks. To address this issue, we develop Lens, a foundational network traffic model that leverages the T5 architecture to learn the pre-trained representations from large-scale unlabeled data. Harnessing the strength of the encoder-decoder framework, which captures the global information while preserving the generative ability, our model can better learn the representations from large-scale network traffic. To further enhance pre-training performance, we design a novel loss that integrates three distinct tasks, namely Masked Span Prediction (MSP), Packet Order Prediction (POP), and Homologous Traffic Prediction (HTP). Evaluation results on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed Lens outperforms the baselines in most downstream tasks related to both traffic understanding and traffic generation. Notably, it also requires considerably less labeled data for fine-tuning compared to current methods. ",

    "abstract": "Triangle counting in a graph is a fundamental problem and has a wide range of applications in various domains. It is crucial in understanding the structural properties of a graph and is often used as a building block for more complex graph analytics. In this paper, we solve the triangle counting problem in an anonymous graph in a distributed setting using mobile agents and subsequently use this as a subroutine to tackle the truss decomposition and triangle centrality problem. The paper employs mobile agents, placed on the nodes of the graph to coordinate among themselves to solve the triangle enumeration problem for the graph. Following the literature, we consider the synchronous systems where each robot executes its tasks concurrently with all others and hence time complexity can be measured as the number of rounds needed to complete the task. The graph is anonymous, i.e., without any node labels or IDs, but the agents are autonomous with distinct IDs and have limited memory. Agents can only communicate with other agents locally i.e., if and only if they are at the same node. The goal is to devise algorithms that minimise both the time required for triangle counting and the memory usage at each agent. We further demonstrate how the triangle count obtained through the mobile agent approach can be leveraged to address the truss decomposition, triangle centrality and local clustering coefficient problems, which involves finding maximal sub-graphs with strong interconnections. Truss decomposition helps in identifying maximal, highly interconnected sub-graphs, or trusses, within a network, thus, revealing the structural cohesion and tight-knit communities in complex graphs, facilitating the analysis of relationships and information flow in various fields, such as social networks, biology, and recommendation systems.

Our research focuses on developing a reward inference method based on the contextual properties of information propagation on graphs that capitalizes on a constrained number of human reward annotations to infer rewards for unlabelled data. We leverage both the available data and limited reward annotations to construct a reward propagation graph, wherein the edge weights incorporate various influential factors pertaining to the rewards. Subsequently, we employ the constructed graph for transductive reward inference, thereby estimating rewards for unlabelled data. Furthermore, we establish the existence of a fixed point during several iterations of the transductive inference process and demonstrate its at least convergence to a local optimum. Empirical evaluations on locomotion and robotic manipulation tasks validate the effectiveness of our approach.

We demonstrate that symbol correctness is a necessary property for NS-DNN explainability and transfer learning (despite being in general impossible to train for). Moreover, we show that the framework of symbol correctness provides a precise way to reason and communicate about model behavior at neural-symbolic boundaries, and gives insight into the fundamental tradeoffs faced by NS-DNN training algorithms.

However, these libraries show poor scalability on multi-core processors, which under-utilizes the available platform resources and limits the performance. This is because GNN training is a resource-intensive workload with high volume of irregular data accessing, and existing libraries fail to utilize the memory bandwidth efficiently. To address this challenge, we propose ARGO, a novel runtime system for GNN training that offers scalable performance. ARGO exploits multi-processing and core-binding techniques to improve platform resource utilization. We further develop an auto-tuner that searches for the optimal configuration for multi-processing and core-binding. The auto-tuner works automatically, making it completely transparent from the user. Furthermore, the auto-tuner allows ARGO to adapt to various platforms, GNN models, datasets, etc. We evaluate ARGO on two representative GNN models and four widely-used datasets on two platforms. With the proposed autotuner, ARGO is able to select a near-optimal configuration by exploring only 5% of the design space. ARGO speeds up state-of-the-art GNN libraries by up to 5.06x and 4.54x on a four-socket Ice Lake machine with 112 cores and a two-socket Sapphire Rapids machine with 64 cores, respectively. Finally, ARGO can seamlessly integrate into widely-used GNN libraries (e.g., DGL, PyG) with few lines of code and speed up GNN training. ",

    "abstract": "Graph generation has been dominated by autoregressive models due to their simplicity and effectiveness, despite their sensitivity to ordering. Yet diffusion models have garnered increasing attention, as they offer comparable performance while being permutation-invariant. Current graph diffusion models generate graphs in a one-shot fashion, but they require extra features and thousands of denoising steps to achieve optimal performance. We introduce PARD, a Permutation-invariant Auto Regressive Diffusion model that integrates diffusion models with autoregressive methods. PARD harnesses the effectiveness and efficiency of the autoregressive model while maintaining permutation invariance without ordering sensitivity. Specifically, we show that contrary to sets, elements in a graph are not entirely unordered and there is a unique partial order for nodes and edges. With this partial order, PARD generates a graph in a block-by-block, autoregressive fashion, where each block's probability is conditionally modeled by a shared diffusion model with an equivariant network. To ensure efficiency while being expressive, we further propose a higher-order graph transformer, which integrates transformer with PPGN. Like GPT, we extend the higher-order graph transformer to support parallel training of all blocks. Without any extra features, PARD achieves state-of-the-art performance on molecular and non-molecular datasets, and scales to large datasets like MOSES containing 1.9M molecules. ",

However, over high-bandwidth networks, flows can easily arrive faster than model inference rates. The temporal nature of network flows limits simple scale-out approaches leveraged in other high-traffic machine learning applications. Accordingly, this paper presents ServeFlow, a solution for machine-learning model serving aimed at network traffic analysis tasks, which carefully selects the number of packets to collect and the models to apply for individual flows to achieve a balance between minimal latency, high service rate, and high accuracy. We identify that on the same task, inference time across models can differ by 2.7x-136.3x, while the median inter-packet waiting time is often 6-8 orders of magnitude higher than the inference time! ServeFlow is able to make inferences on 76.3% flows in under 16ms, which is a speed-up of 40.5x on the median end-to-end serving latency while increasing the service rate and maintaining similar accuracy. Even with thousands of features per flow, it achieves a service rate of over 48.5k new flows per second on a 16-core CPU commodity server, which matches the order of magnitude of flow rates observed on city-level network backbones.

Manual assessment of sperm abnormalities through head morphology analysis encounters issues of observer variability and diagnostic discrepancies among experts. Its alternative, Computer-Assisted Semen Analysis (CASA), suffers from low-quality sperm images, small datasets, and noisy class labels. We propose a new approach for sperm head morphology classification, called SHMC-Net, which uses segmentation masks of sperm heads to guide the morphology classification of sperm images. SHMC-Net generates reliable segmentation masks using image priors, refines object boundaries with an efficient graph-based method, and trains an image network with sperm head crops and a mask network with the corresponding masks. In the intermediate stages of the networks, image and mask features are fused with a fusion scheme to better learn morphological features. To handle noisy class labels and regularize training on small datasets, SHMC-Net applies Soft Mixup to combine mixup augmentation and a loss function. We achieve state-of-the-art results on SCIAN and HuSHeM datasets, outperforming methods that use additional pre-training or costly ensembling techniques. ",

While the vehicles commonly use the Global Positioning System (GPS) for navigation, they may refrain from sharing their precise GPS coordinates with the RSUs due to privacy concerns. Therefore, to jointly address the high localization requirements by the RSUs as well as the vehicles' privacy, we present a novel spatial-provenance framework wherein each vehicle uses Bloom filters to embed their partial location information when forwarding the packets. In this framework, the RSUs and the vehicles agree upon fragmenting the coverage area into several smaller regions so that the vehicles can embed the identity of their regions through Bloom filters. Given the probabilistic nature of Bloom filters, we derive an analytical expression on the error-rates in provenance recovery and then pose an optimization problem to choose the underlying parameters. With the help of extensive simulation results, we show that our method offers near-optimal Bloom filter parameters in learning spatial provenance. Some interesting trade-offs between the communication-overhead, spatial privacy of the vehicles and the error rates in provenance recovery are also discussed. ",

By leveraging multiple large language models with distinct areas of expertise, we can efficiently generate strategies and perform task decomposition. Introducing the cosine similarity approach,aligning task decomposition instructions with robot task sequences at the vector level, we can identify subtasks with incomplete task decomposition and iterate on them multiple times to ultimately generate executable machine task sequences.The robot is guided through these task sequences to complete tasks of higher complexity. With this architecture, we implement the process of natural language control of robots to perform complex tasks, and successfully address the challenge of multi agent execution of open tasks in open scenarios and the problem of task decomposition.

To prevent such misconceptions, we must necessarily provide additional information beyond the training data. Existing methods incorporate forms of additional instance-level supervision, such as labels for spurious features or additional labeled data from a balanced distribution. Such strategies can become prohibitively costly for large-scale datasets since they require additional annotation at a scale close to the original training data. We hypothesize that targeted natural language feedback about a model's misconceptions is a more efficient form of additional supervision. We introduce Clarify, a novel interface and method for interactively correcting model misconceptions. Through Clarify, users need only provide a short text description to describe a model's consistent failure patterns. Then, in an entirely automated way, we use such descriptions to improve the training process by reweighting the training data or gathering additional targeted data. Our user studies show that non-expert users can successfully describe model misconceptions via Clarify, improving worst-group accuracy by an average of 17.1% in two datasets. Additionally, we use Clarify to find and rectify 31 novel hard subpopulations in the ImageNet dataset, improving minority-split accuracy from 21.1% to 28.7%. ",

Using SimCSE and advanced neighbor selection techniques, SNS effectively improves the quality of selected neighbors, thereby improving graph representation and alleviating issues like over-squashing and heterophily. Besides, as an inductive and training-free approach, SNS demonstrates superior generalization and scalability over traditional GNN methods. Our comprehensive experiments, adhering to standard dataset partitioning practices, demonstrate that SNS, through simple prompt interactions with LLMs, consistently outperforms vanilla GNNs and achieves state-of-the-art results on datasets like PubMed in node classification, showcasing LLMs' potential in graph structure understanding. Our research further underscores the significance of graph structure integration in LLM applications and identifies key factors for their success in node classification.

    "abstract": "Deep-learning and large scale language-image training have produced image object detectors that generalise well to diverse environments and semantic classes. However, single-image object detectors trained on internet data are not optimally tailored for the embodied conditions inherent in robotics. Instead, robots must detect objects from complex multi-modal data streams involving depth, localisation and temporal correlation, a task termed embodied object detection. Paradigms such as Video Object Detection (VOD) and Semantic Mapping have been proposed to leverage such embodied data streams, but existing work fails to enhance performance using language-image training. In response, we investigate how an image object detector pre-trained using language-image data can be extended to perform embodied object detection. We propose a novel implicit object memory that uses projective geometry to aggregate the features of detected objects across long temporal horizons. The spatial and temporal information accumulated in memory is then used to enhance the image features of the base detector. When tested on embodied data streams sampled from diverse indoor scenes, our approach improves the base object detector by 3.09 mAP, outperforming alternative external memories designed for VOD and Semantic Mapping. Our method also shows a significant improvement of 16.90 mAP relative to baselines that perform embodied object detection without first training on language-image data, and is robust to sensor noise and domain shift experienced in real-world deployment.

Instance-level causality identifies causal relationships among individual events, providing more fine-grained information for decision-making. Existing work in the literature either requires strong assumptions, such as linearity in the intensity function, or heuristically defined model parameters that do not necessarily meet the requirements of Granger causality. We propose Instance-wise Self-Attentive Hawkes Processes (ISAHP), a novel deep learning framework that can directly infer the Granger causality at the event instance level. ISAHP is the first neural point process model that meets the requirements of Granger causality. It leverages the self-attention mechanism of the transformer to align with the principles of Granger causality. We empirically demonstrate that ISAHP is capable of discovering complex instance-level causal structures that cannot be handled by classical models. We also show that ISAHP achieves state-of-the-art performance in proxy tasks involving type-level causal discovery and instance-level event type prediction. ",

While several methods have been proposed for detecting social bots, significant research gaps remain. First, current models exhibit limitations in detecting sophisticated bots that aim to mimic genuine OSN users. Second, these methods often rely on simplistic profile features, which are susceptible to manipulation. In addition to their vulnerability to adversarial manipulations, these models lack generalizability, resulting in subpar performance when trained on one dataset and tested on another. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework for social Bot detection with Self-Supervised Contrastive Learning (BotSSCL). Our framework leverages contrastive learning to distinguish between social bots and humans in the embedding space to improve linear separability. The high-level representations derived by BotSSCL enhance its resilience to variations in data distribution and ensure generalizability. We evaluate BotSSCL's robustness against adversarial attempts to manipulate bot accounts to evade detection. Experiments on two datasets featuring sophisticated bots demonstrate that BotSSCL outperforms other supervised, unsupervised, and self-supervised baseline methods. We achieve approx. 6% and approx. 8% higher (F1) performance than SOTA on both datasets. In addition, BotSSCL also achieves 67% F1 when trained on one dataset and tested with another, demonstrating its generalizability. Lastly, BotSSCL increases adversarial complexity and only allows 4% success to the adversary in evading detection. ",

However, potential security threats during the MARL deployment need more attention and thorough investigation. Recent researches reveal that an attacker can rapidly exploit the victim's vulnerabilities and generate adversarial policies, leading to the victim's failure in specific tasks. For example, reducing the winning rate of a superhuman-level Go AI to around 20%. They predominantly focus on two-player competitive environments, assuming attackers possess complete global state observation. In this study, we unveil, for the first time, the capability of attackers to generate adversarial policies even when restricted to partial observations of the victims in multi-agent competitive environments. Specifically, we propose a novel black-box attack (SUB-PLAY), which incorporates the concept of constructing multiple subgames to mitigate the impact of partial observability and suggests the sharing of transitions among subpolicies to improve the exploitative ability of attackers. Extensive evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of SUB-PLAY under three typical partial observability limitations. Visualization results indicate that adversarial policies induce significantly different activations of the victims' policy networks. Furthermore, we evaluate three potential defenses aimed at exploring ways to mitigate security threats posed by adversarial policies, providing constructive recommendations for deploying MARL in competitive environments.

Extensive experiments and ablation studies are performed on several popular LLMs and question-answering (QA) benchmarks, showing the effectiveness of our proposal. ",

    "abstract": "The discovery of partial differential equations (PDEs) from datasets has attracted increased attention. However, the discovery of governing equations from sparse data with high noise is still very challenging due to the difficulty of derivatives computation and the disturbance of noise. Moreover, the selection principles for the candidate library to meet physical laws need to be further studied. The invariance is one of the fundamental laws for governing equations. In this study, we propose an invariance constrained deep learning network (ICNet) for the discovery of PDEs. Considering that temporal and spatial translation invariance (Galilean invariance) is a fundamental property of physical laws, we filter the candidates that cannot meet the requirement of the Galilean transformations. Subsequently, we embedded the fixed and possible terms into the loss function of neural network, significantly countering the effect of sparse data with high noise. Then, by filtering out redundant terms without fixing learnable parameters during the training process, the governing equations discovered by the ICNet method can effectively approximate the real governing equations. We select the 2D Burgers equation, the equation of 2D channel flow over an obstacle, and the equation of 3D intracranial aneurysm as examples to verify the superiority of the ICNet for fluid mechanics. Furthermore, we extend similar invariance methods to the discovery of wave equation (Lorentz Invariance) and verify it through Single and Coupled Klein-Gordon equation. The results show that the ICNet method with physical constraints exhibits excellent performance in governing equations discovery from sparse and noisy data. ",

    "abstract": "Chordal graphs is a well-studied large graph class that is also a strict super-class of path graphs. Munro and Wu (ISAAC 2018) have given an $(n^2/4+o(n^2))-$bit succinct representation for $n-$vertex unlabeled chordal graphs. A chordal graph $G=(V,E)$ is the intersection graph of sub-trees of a tree $T$. Based on this characterization, the two parameters of chordal graphs which we consider in this work are \\textit{leafage}, introduced by Lin, McKee and West (Discussiones Mathematicae Graph Theory 1998) and \\textit{vertex leafage}, introduced by Chaplick and Stacho (Discret. Appl. Math. 2014). Leafage is the minimum number of leaves in any possible tree $T$ characterizing $G$. Let $L(u)$ denote the number of leaves of the sub-tree in $T$ corresponding to $u \\in V$ and $k=\\max\\limits_{u \\in V} L(u)$. The smallest $k$ for which there exists a tree $T$ for $G$ is called its vertex leafage. In this work, we improve the worst-case information theoretic lower bound of Munro and Wu (ISAAC 2018) for chordal graphs when vertex leafage is bounded and leafage is unbounded. The class of unlabeled $k-$vertex leafage chordal graphs that consists of all chordal graphs with vertex leafage at most $k$ and unbounded leafage, denoted $\\mathcal{G}_k$, is introduced for the first time. For $k>1$ in $o(n/\\log n)$, we obtain a lower bound of $((k-1)n \\log n - kn \\log k - O(\\log n))-$bits on the size of any data structure that encodes a graph in $\\mathcal{G}_k$. Further, for every $k-$vertex leafage chordal graph $G$ such that $k>1$ in $o(n/\\log n)$, we present a $((k-1)n \\log n + o(kn \\log n))-$bit data structure, constructed using the succinct data structure for path graphs with $kn/2$ vertices. Our data structure supports adjacency query in $O(k \\log n)$ time and using additional $2n \\log n$ bits, an $O(k^2 d_v \\log n + \\log^2 n)$ time neighbourhood query where $d_v$ is degree of $v \\in V$.

Digital Twin (DT) technology paves the way for cost-effective and performance-optimised management by digitally creating a virtual representation of the network to simulate its behaviour. In order to capture the complex spatio-temporal features in traffic scenario, we construct alignment diagrams to assist in completing the spatio-temporal correlation representation and design dilated alignment convolution network (DACN) to learn the fine-grained correlations, i.e., spatio-temporal interactions.

Traditional methods of data generation, such as random sampling or exhaustive exploration, are either intractable or may not capture rare, but highly informative configurations. In this study, we propose a method that leverages uncertainty as the collective variable (CV) to guide the acquisition of chemically-relevant data points, focusing on regions of the configuration space where ML model predictions are most uncertain. This approach employs a Gaussian Mixture Model-based uncertainty metric from a single model as the CV for biased molecular dynamics simulations. The effectiveness of our approach in overcoming energy barriers and exploring unseen energy minima, thereby enhancing the data set in an active learning framework, is demonstrated on the alanine dipeptide benchmark system.

    "abstract": "Automatic radiology report generation is booming due to its huge application potential for the healthcare industry. However, existing computer vision and natural language processing approaches to tackle this problem are limited in two aspects. First, when extracting image features, most of them neglect multi-view reasoning in vision and model single-view structure of medical images, such as space-view or channel-view. However, clinicians rely on multi-view imaging information for comprehensive judgment in daily clinical diagnosis. Second, when generating reports, they overlook context reasoning with multi-modal information and focus on pure textual optimization utilizing retrieval-based methods. We aim to address these two issues by proposing a model that better simulates clinicians' perspectives and generates more accurate reports. Given the above limitation in feature extraction, we propose a Globally-intensive Attention (GIA) module in the medical image encoder to simulate and integrate multi-view vision perception. GIA aims to learn three types of vision perception: depth view, space view, and pixel view. On the other hand, to address the above problem in report generation, we explore how to involve multi-modal signals to generate precisely matched reports, i.e., how to integrate previously predicted words with region-aware visual content in next word prediction. Specifically, we design a Visual Knowledge-guided Decoder (VKGD), which can adaptively consider how much the model needs to rely on visual information and previously predicted text to assist next word prediction. Hence, our final Intensive Vision-guided Network (IVGN) framework includes a GIA-guided Visual Encoder and the VKGD. Experiments on two commonly-used datasets IU X-Ray and MIMIC-CXR demonstrate the superior ability of our method compared with other state-of-the-art approaches. ",

This compromises the privacy of the anonymized communication system. Therefore, we propose a defense scheme against flow watermarking. The scheme is based on deep neural networks and utilizes generative adversarial networks to convert the original Inter-Packet Delays (IPD) into new IPDs generated by the model. We also adopt the concept of adversarial attacks to ensure that the detector will produce an incorrect classification when detecting these new IPDs. This approach ensures that these IPDs are considered \"clean\", effectively covering the potential watermarks. This scheme is effective against time-based flow watermarking techniques. ",

    "abstract": "With the exponential growth of AI tools that generate source code, understanding software has become crucial. When developers comprehend a program, they may refer to additional contexts to look for information, e.g. program documentation or historical code versions. Therefore, we argue that encoding this additional contextual information could also benefit code representation for deep learning. Recent papers incorporate contextual data (e.g. call hierarchy) into vector representation to address program comprehension problems. This motivates further studies to explore additional contexts, such as version history, to enhance models' understanding of programs. That is, insights from version history enable recognition of patterns in code evolution over time, recurring issues, and the effectiveness of past solutions. Our paper presents preliminary evidence of the potential benefit of encoding contextual information from the version history to predict code clones and perform code classification. We experiment with two representative deep learning models, ASTNN and CodeBERT, to investigate whether combining additional contexts with different aggregations may benefit downstream activities. The experimental result affirms the positive impact of combining version history into source code representation in all scenarios; however, to ensure the technique performs consistently, we need to conduct a holistic investigation on a larger code base using different combinations of contexts, aggregation, and models. Therefore, we propose a research agenda aimed at exploring various aspects of encoding additional context to improve code representation and its optimal utilisation in specific situations. ",

This process can help newcomers learn from the feedback of experienced reviewers; however, it often brings a large workload and stress to reviewers. To alleviate this burden, the field of automated code reviews aims to automate the process, teaching large language models to provide reviews on submitted code, just as a human would. A recent approach pre-trained and fine-tuned the code intelligent language model on a large-scale code review corpus. However, such techniques did not fully utilise quality reviews amongst the training data. Indeed, reviewers with a higher level of experience or familiarity with the code will likely provide deeper insights than the others. In this study, we set out to investigate whether higher-quality reviews can be generated from automated code review models that are trained based on an experience-aware oversampling technique. Through our quantitative and qualitative evaluation, we find that experience-aware oversampling can increase the correctness, level of information, and meaningfulness of reviews generated by the current state-of-the-art model without introducing new data. The results suggest that a vast amount of high-quality reviews are underutilised with current training strategies. This work sheds light on resource-efficient ways to boost automated code review models. ",

Although traditional data-driven models have shown promise in this domain, their long-term prediction accuracy can be limited, especially in scenarios with sparse or incomplete data and they often rely on black-box deep learning structures that lack solid physical foundation leading to reduced transparency and interpretability in predictions. To address these limitations, this paper presents a novel approach named Physics guided Neural Network for Air Quality Prediction (AirPhyNet). Specifically, we leverage two well-established physics principles of air particle movement (diffusion and advection) by representing them as differential equation networks. Then, we utilize a graph structure to integrate physics knowledge into a neural network architecture and exploit latent representations to capture spatio-temporal relationships within the air quality data. Experiments on two real-world benchmark datasets demonstrate that AirPhyNet outperforms state-of-the-art models for different testing scenarios including different lead time (24h, 48h, 72h), sparse data and sudden change prediction, achieving reduction in prediction errors up to 10%. Moreover, a case study further validates that our model captures underlying physical processes of particle movement and generates accurate predictions with real physical meaning. ",

Nevertheless, it is still challenging for models, trained on an inadequate amount of labeled data, to generalize to unseen anomalies. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework Knowledge-Data Alignment (KDAlign) to integrate rule knowledge, typically summarized by human experts, to supplement the limited labeled data. Specifically, we transpose these rules into the knowledge space and subsequently recast the incorporation of knowledge as the alignment of knowledge and data. To facilitate this alignment, we employ the Optimal Transport (OT) technique. We then incorporate the OT distance as an additional loss term to the original objective function of WSAD methodologies. Comprehensive experimental results on five real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposed KDAlign framework markedly surpasses its state-of-the-art counterparts, achieving superior performance across various anomaly types.

These limitations include blocking message flows, vulnerability to over-smoothness, and suboptimal neighborhood discriminability. Inspired by these understandings, we explore non-discrete edge masks, which are sampled from a continuous and dispersive probability distribution instead of the discrete Bernoulli distribution. These masks restrict the amount of output messages for each edge, referred to as \"bandwidths\".

We demonstrate its powerful graph topological learning ability both theoretically and empirically.

Experiments demonstrate a significant improvement over baseline models. On the proposed dataset, the highest accuracy achieved by the detection model reached 0.975, and the maximum F-measure achieved by the segmentation model reached 0.948. ",

    "abstract": "Outlier generation is a popular technique used for solving important outlier detection tasks. Generating outliers with realistic behavior is challenging. Popular existing methods tend to disregard the 'multiple views' property of outliers in high-dimensional spaces. The only existing method accounting for this property falls short in efficiency and effectiveness. We propose BISECT, a new outlier generation method that creates realistic outliers mimicking said property. To do so, BISECT employs a novel proposition introduced in this article stating how to efficiently generate said realistic outliers. Our method has better guarantees and complexity than the current methodology for recreating 'multiple views'. We use the synthetic outliers generated by BISECT to effectively enhance outlier detection in diverse datasets, for multiple use cases. For instance, oversampling with BISECT reduced the error by up to 3 times when compared with the baselines. ",

    "abstract": "We study how to report few-shot imitation (FSI) policies' behavior errors in novel environments, a novel task named adaptable error detection (AED). The potential to cause serious damage to surrounding areas limits the application of FSI policies in real-world scenarios. Thus, a robust system is necessary to notify operators when FSI policies are inconsistent with the intent of demonstrations. We develop a cross-domain benchmark for the challenging AED task, consisting of 329 base and 158 novel environments. This task introduces three challenges, including (1) detecting behavior errors in novel environments, (2) behavior errors occurring without revealing notable changes, and (3) lacking complete temporal information of the rollout due to the necessity of online detection. To address these challenges, we propose Pattern Observer (PrObe) to parse discernible patterns in the policy feature representations of normal or error states, whose effectiveness is verified in the proposed benchmark. Through our comprehensive evaluation, PrObe consistently surpasses strong baselines and demonstrates a robust capability to identify errors arising from a wide range of FSI policies. Moreover, we conduct comprehensive ablations and experiments (error correction, demonstration quality, etc.) to validate the practicality of our proposed task and methodology. ",

    "abstract": "This work proposes a geographically-based split of the community microgrids into clusters of members that tend to have similar consumption and generation profiles. Assuming a community microgrid divided into clusters, a two-layer architecture is developed to facilitate the greater penetration of distributed energy resources in an efficient way. The first layer, referred as the market layer, is responsible for creating local energy markets with the aim of maximising the economic benefits for community microgrid members. The second layer is responsible for the network reconfiguration, which is based on the energy balance within each cluster. This layer complies with the IEC 61850 communication standard, in order to control commercial sectionalizing and tie switches. This allows the community microgrid network to be reconfigured to minimise energy exchanges with the main grid. To implement this two-layer energy management strategy, an aperiodic market approach based on Blockchain technology, and the additional functionality offered by Smart Contracts is adopted. This embraces the concept of energy communities since it decentralizes the control and eliminates intermediaries. The use of aperiodic control techniques helps to overcome the challenges of using Blockchain technology in terms of storage, computational requirements and member privacy. The scalability and modularity of the Smart Contract-based system allow each cluster of members to be designed by tailoring the system to their specific needs. The implementation of this strategy is based on low-cost off-the-shelf devices, such as Raspberry Pi 4 Model B boards, which operate as Blockchain nodes of community microgrid members. Finally, the strategy has been validated by emulating two use cases based on the IEEE 123-node system network model highlighting the benefits of the proposal. ",

    "abstract": "In Ethereum, the ledger exchanges messages along an underlying Peer-to-Peer (P2P) network to reach consistency. Understanding the underlying network topology of Ethereum is crucial for network optimization, security and scalability. However, the accurate discovery of Ethereum network topology is non-trivial due to its deliberately designed security mechanism. Consequently, existing measuring schemes cannot accurately infer the Ethereum network topology with a low cost. To address this challenge, we propose the Distributed Ethereum Network Analyzer (DEthna) tool, which can accurately and efficiently measure the Ethereum network topology. In DEthna, a novel parallel measurement model is proposed that can generate marked transactions to infer link connections based on the transaction replacement and propagation mechanism in Ethereum. Moreover, a workload offloading scheme is designed so that DEthna can be deployed on multiple distributed probing nodes so as to measure a large-scale Ethereum network at a low cost. We run DEthna on Goerli (the most popular Ethereum test network) to evaluate its capability in discovering network topology. The experimental results demonstrate that DEthna significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines. Based on DEthna, we further analyze characteristics of the Ethereum network revealing that there exist more than 50% low-degree Ethereum nodes that weaken the network robustness. ",

    "abstract": "Millimeter wave (mmWave) multiple-input-multi-output (MIMO) is now a reality with great potential for further improvement. We study full-duplex transmissions as an effective way to improve mmWave MIMO systems. Compared to half-duplex systems, full-duplex transmissions may offer higher data rates and lower latency. However, full-duplex transmission is hindered by self-interference (SI) at the receive antennas, and SI channel estimation becomes a crucial step to make the full-duplex systems feasible. In this paper, we address the problem of channel estimation in full-duplex mmWave MIMO systems using neural networks (NNs). Our approach involves sharing pilot resources between user equipments (UEs) and transmit antennas at the base station (BS), aiming to reduce the pilot overhead in full-duplex systems and to achieve a comparable level to that of a half-duplex system. Additionally, in the case of separate antenna configurations in a full-duplex BS, providing channel estimates of transmit antenna (TX) arrays to the downlink UEs poses another challenge, as the TX arrays are not capable of receiving pilot signals. To address this, we employ an NN to map the channel from the downlink UEs to the receive antenna (RX) arrays to the channel from the TX arrays to the downlink UEs. We further elaborate on how NNs perform the estimation with different architectures, (e.g., different numbers of hidden layers), the introduction of non-linear distortion (e.g., with a 1-bit analog-to-digital converter (ADC)), and different channel conditions (e.g., low-correlated and high-correlated channels). Our work provides novel insights into NN-based channel estimators. ",

It is a recurring argument in this debate that language develops \"naturally\" and that \"severe interventions\" - such as gender-inclusive language is often claimed to be - in the allegedly \"organic\" language system are inappropriate and even \"dangerous\". Such interventions are, however, not unprecedented. Socially motivated processes of language change are neither unusual nor new. We focus in our contribution on one important political-social space in Germany, the German Bundestag. Taking other struggles about language and gender in the plenaries of the Bundestag as a starting point, our article illustrates that language and gender has been a recurring issue in the German Bundestag since the 1980s. We demonstrate how this is reflected in linguistic practices of the Bundestag, by the use of a) designations for gays and lesbians; b) pair forms such as B\\\"urgerinnen und B\\\"urger (female and male citizens); and c) female forms of addresses and personal nouns ('Pr\\\"asidentin' in addition to 'Pr\\\"asident'). Lastly, we will discuss implications of these earlier language battles for the currently very heated debate about gender-inclusive language, especially regarding new forms with gender symbols like the asterisk or the colon (Lehrer*innen, Lehrer:innen; male*female teachers) which are intended to encompass all gender identities.

    "abstract": "Predicting the movement of other road users is beneficial for improving automated vehicle (AV) performance. However, the relationship between the time horizon associated with these predictions and AV performance remains unclear. Despite the existence of numerous trajectory prediction algorithms, no studies have been conducted on how varying prediction lengths affect AV safety and other vehicle performance metrics, resulting in undefined horizon requirements for prediction methods. Our study addresses this gap by examining the effects of different prediction horizons on AV performance, focusing on safety, comfort, and efficiency. Through multiple experiments using a state-of-the-art, risk-based predictive trajectory planner, we simulated predictions with horizons up to 20 seconds. Based on our simulations, we propose a framework for specifying the minimum required and optimal prediction horizons based on specific AV performance criteria and application needs. Our results indicate that a horizon of 1.6 seconds is required to prevent collisions with crossing pedestrians, horizons of 7-8 seconds yield the best efficiency, and horizons up to 15 seconds improve passenger comfort. We conclude that prediction horizon requirements are application-dependent, and recommend aiming for a prediction horizon of 11.8 seconds as a general guideline for applications involving crossing pedestrians.

While these devices and setups provide users with interactive, engaging, and immersive experiences with different sensing modalities, such as eye and hand trackers, many non-player characters are utilized in a pre-scripted way or by conventional AI techniques. In this paper, we argue for using large language models (LLMs) in XR by embedding them in virtual avatars or as narratives to facilitate more inclusive experiences through prompt engineering according to user profiles and fine-tuning the LLMs for particular purposes. We argue that such inclusion will facilitate diversity for XR use. In addition, we believe that with the versatile conversational capabilities of LLMs, users will engage more with XR environments, which might help XR be more used in everyday life. Lastly, we speculate that combining the information provided to LLM-powered environments by the users and the biometric data obtained through the sensors might lead to novel privacy invasions. While studying such possible privacy invasions, user privacy concerns and preferences should also be investigated. In summary, despite some challenges, embedding LLMs into XR is a promising and novel research area with several opportunities. ",

To address this problem, many transferability enhancement approaches (e.g., input transformation and model augmentation) have been proposed. However, they show poor performances in attacking systems having different model genera from the surrogate model. In this paper, we propose a novel and generic attacking strategy, called Deformation-Constrained Warping Attack (DeCoWA), that can be effectively applied to cross model genus attack. Specifically, DeCoWA firstly augments input examples via an elastic deformation, namely Deformation-Constrained Warping (DeCoW), to obtain rich local details of the augmented input. To avoid severe distortion of global semantics led by random deformation, DeCoW further constrains the strength and direction of the warping transformation by a novel adaptive control strategy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the transferable examples crafted by our DeCoWA on CNN surrogates can significantly hinder the performance of Transformers (and vice versa) on various tasks, including image classification, video action recognition, and audio recognition.

    "abstract": "Computation of document similarity is a critical task in various NLP domains that has applications in deduplication, matching, and recommendation. Traditional approaches for document similarity computation include learning representations of documents and employing a similarity or a distance function over the embeddings. However, pairwise similarities and differences are not efficiently captured by individual representations. Graph representations such as Joint Concept Interaction Graph (JCIG) represent a pair of documents as a joint undirected weighted graph. JCIGs facilitate an interpretable representation of document pairs as a graph. However, JCIGs are undirected, and don't consider the sequential flow of sentences in documents. We propose two approaches to model document similarity by representing document pairs as a directed and sparse JCIG that incorporates sequential information. We propose two algorithms inspired by Supergenome Sorting and Hamiltonian Path that replace the undirected edges with directed edges. Our approach also sparsifies the graph to $O(n)$ edges from JCIG's worst case of $O(n^2)$. We show that our sparse directed graph model architecture consisting of a Siamese encoder and GCN achieves comparable results to the baseline on datasets not containing sequential information and beats the baseline by ten points on an instructional documents dataset containing sequential information.

    "abstract": "Deep learning is closing the gap with humans on several object recognition benchmarks. Here we investigate this gap in the context of challenging images where objects are seen from unusual viewpoints. We find that humans excel at recognizing objects in unusual poses, in contrast with state-of-the-art pretrained networks (EfficientNet, SWAG, ViT, SWIN, BEiT, ConvNext) which are systematically brittle in this condition. Remarkably, as we limit image exposure time, human performance degrades to the level of deep networks, suggesting that additional mental processes (requiring additional time) take place when humans identify objects in unusual poses. Finally, our analysis of error patterns of humans vs. networks reveals that even time-limited humans are dissimilar to feed-forward deep networks. We conclude that more work is needed to bring computer vision systems to the level of robustness of the human visual system. Understanding the nature of the mental processes taking place during extra viewing time may be key to attain such robustness. ",

This paper studies label smoothing from the perspective of Neural Collapse (NC), a powerful empirical and theoretical framework which characterizes model behavior during the terminal phase of training. We first show empirically that models trained with label smoothing converge faster to neural collapse solutions and attain a stronger level of neural collapse. Additionally, we show that at the same level of NC1, models under label smoothing loss exhibit intensified NC2. These findings provide valuable insights into the performance benefits and enhanced model calibration under label smoothing loss. We then leverage the unconstrained feature model to derive closed-form solutions for the global minimizers for both loss functions and further demonstrate that models under label smoothing have a lower conditioning number and, therefore, theoretically converge faster. Our study, combining empirical evidence and theoretical results, not only provides nuanced insights into the differences between label smoothing and cross-entropy losses, but also serves as an example of how the powerful neural collapse framework can be used to improve our understanding of DNNs.

However, the majority of the theoretical investigations around low-rank bias in neural networks deal with oversimplified deep linear networks. In this work, we consider general networks with nonlinear activations and the weight decay parameter, and we show the presence of an intriguing neural rank collapse phenomenon, connecting the low-rank bias of trained networks with networks' neural collapse properties: as the weight decay parameter grows, the rank of each layer in the network decreases proportionally to the within-class variability of the hidden-space embeddings of the previous layers. Our theoretical findings are supported by a range of experimental evaluations illustrating the phenomenon. ",

Through evaluation, we have found that most of the existing methods are unable to achieve both supervised and contrastive unlearnability, which poses risks to data protection. Different from recent methods based on contrastive error minimization, we employ contrastive-like data augmentations in supervised error minimization or maximization frameworks to obtain attacks effective for both SL and CL.

One approach to address this issue is neural network quantization. The construction of such networks remains an open problem, acknowledged for its inherent instability.In this paper, we explore the quantization of the recurrent and input weight matrices in ORNNs, leading to Quantized approximately Orthogonal RNNs (QORNNs). We investigate one post-training quantization (PTQ) strategy and three quantization-aware training (QAT) algorithms that incorporate orthogonal constraints and quantized weights.

    "abstract": "Safety issues associated with transporting crude oil by rail have been a concern since the boom of US domestic shale oil production in 2012. During the last decade, over 300 crude oil by rail incidents have occurred in the US. Some of them have caused adverse consequences including fire and hazardous materials leakage. However, only limited information on the routes of crude-on-rail and their associated risks is available to the public. To this end, this study proposes an unconventional way to reconstruct the crude-on-rail routes using geotagged photos harvested from the Flickr website. The proposed method links the geotagged photos of crude oil trains posted online with national railway networks to identify potential railway segments those crude oil trains were traveling on. A shortest path-based method was then applied to infer the complete crude-on-rail routes, by utilizing the confirmed railway segments as well as their movement direction information. Validation of the inferred routes was performed using a public map and official crude oil incident data. Results suggested that the inferred routes based on geotagged photos have high coverage, with approximately 96% of the documented crude oil incidents aligned with the reconstructed crude-on-rail network. The inferred crude oil train routes were found to pass through many metropolitan areas with dense populations, who are exposed to potential risk. This finding could improve situation awareness for policymakers and transportation planners. In addition, with the inferred routes, this study establishes a good foundation for future crude oil train risk analysis along the rail route. ",

Previous approaches have relied on DIMM-based near-memory processing techniques or introduced 3D-stacked DRAM to address memory-bound issues and expand memory bandwidth. However, these solutions fall short when dealing with the expanding size of personalized recommendation systems. Recommendation models have grown to sizes exceeding tens of terabytes, making them challenging to run efficiently on traditional single-node inference servers. Although various algorithmic methods have been proposed to reduce embedding table capacity, they often result in increased memory access or inefficient utilization of memory resources. This paper introduces HEAM, a heterogeneous memory architecture that integrates 3D-stacked DRAM with DIMM to accelerate recommendation systems in which compositional embedding is utilized-a technique aimed at reducing the size of embedding tables. The architecture is organized into a three-tier memory hierarchy consisting of conventional DIMM, 3D-stacked DRAM with a base die-level Processing-In-Memory (PIM), and a bank group-level PIM incorporating a Look-Up-Table. This setup is specifically designed to accommodate the unique aspects of compositional embedding, such as temporal locality and embedding table capacity. This design effectively reduces bank access, improves access efficiency, and enhances overall throughput, resulting in a 6.3 times speedup and 58.9% energy savings compared to the baseline. ",

Our research primarily addresses the theoretical underpinnings of cosine-similarity-based edge reconstruction attacks (COSERA), providing theoretical and empirical evidence that such attacks can perfectly reconstruct sparse Erdos Renyi graphs with independent random features as graph size increases. Conversely, we establish that sparsity is a critical factor for COSERA's effectiveness, as demonstrated through analysis and experiments on stochastic block models. Finally, we explore the resilience of (provably) private graph representations produced via noisy aggregation (NAG) mechanism against COSERA. We empirically delineate instances wherein COSERA demonstrates both efficacy and deficiency in its capacity to function as an instrument for elucidating the trade-off between privacy and utility. ",

Moreover, while trivial adaptations are available, empirical investigations reveal their limited efficacy as they do not properly model the interplay among graph components. To address this, we propose a joint score-based model of nodes and edges for graph generation that considers all graph components. Our approach offers two key novelties: (i) node and edge attributes are combined in an attention module that generates samples based on the two ingredients; and (ii) node, edge and adjacency information are mutually dependent during the graph diffusion process. We evaluate our method on challenging benchmarks involving real-world and synthetic datasets in which edge features are crucial. Additionally, we introduce a new synthetic dataset that incorporates edge values. Furthermore, we propose a novel application that greatly benefits from the method due to its nature: the generation of traffic scenes represented as graphs. Our method outperforms other graph generation methods, demonstrating a significant advantage in edge-related measures. ",

The presence of relational hyperedges makes link prediction a task between $k$ nodes for varying choices of $k$, which is substantially harder than link prediction with knowledge graphs, where every relation is binary ($k=2$). In this paper, we propose two frameworks for link prediction with relational hypergraphs and conduct a thorough analysis of the expressive power of the resulting model architectures via corresponding relational Weisfeiler-Leman algorithms, and also via some natural logical formalisms. Through extensive empirical analysis, we validate the power of the proposed model architectures on various relational hypergraph benchmarks. The resulting model architectures substantially outperform every baseline for inductive link prediction, and lead to state-of-the-art results for transductive link prediction.

We empirically analyze the reasons for this overfitting and find that a key reason is the lack of diversity in DWS datasets.

To address this, we explore strategies for data augmentation in weight spaces and propose a MixUp method adapted for weight spaces. We demonstrate the effectiveness of these methods in two setups.

The proposed mechanism can be efficiently applied to take advantage of the processing elements existing on low-cost and low-energy multi-core embedded devices executing object detection algorithms based on cascading classifiers. Although these classifiers yield the best results for detection algorithms in the field of computer vision, their high computational requirements prevent them from being used on these devices under real-time requirements.

Then we use all these scores returned by CNNs to compute a final detection score, using models that enable us to improve our analysis of the importance of each section in the final score. ",

    "abstract": "CodeCompose is an AI-assisted code authoring tool powered by large language models (LLMs) that provides inline suggestions to 10's of thousands of developers at Meta. In this paper, we present how we scaled the product from displaying single-line suggestions to multi-line suggestions. This evolution required us to overcome several unique challenges in improving the usability of these suggestions for developers. First, we discuss how multi-line suggestions can have a 'jarring' effect, as the LLM's suggestions constantly move around the developer's existing code, which would otherwise result in decreased productivity and satisfaction. Second, multi-line suggestions take significantly longer to generate; hence we present several innovative investments we made to reduce the perceived latency for users. These model-hosting optimizations sped up multi-line suggestion latency by 2.5x. Finally, we conduct experiments on 10's of thousands of engineers to understand how multi-line suggestions impact the user experience and contrast this with single-line suggestions. Our experiments reveal that (i) multi-line suggestions account for 42% of total characters accepted (despite only accounting for 16% for displayed suggestions) (ii) multi-line suggestions almost doubled the percentage of keystrokes saved for users from 9% to 17%. Multi-line CodeCompose has been rolled out to all engineers at Meta, and less than 1% of engineers have opted out of multi-line suggestions. ",

We start with a generalization of Riemann integration that also encapsulates functions that are not strictly additive but are, more generally, $t$-additive, as in nonextensive statistical mechanics. Notably, this recovers Volterra's product integral as a special case. We then generalize the Fundamental Theorem of calculus using an extension of the (Euclidean) derivative. This, along with a series of more specific Theorems, serves as a basis for results showing how one can specifically design, alter, or change fundamental properties of distortion measures in a simple way, with a special emphasis on geometric- and ML-related properties that are the metricity, hyperbolicity, and encoding. We show how to apply it to a problem that has recently gained traction in ML: hyperbolic embeddings with a \"cheap\" and accurate encoding along the hyperbolic vs Euclidean scale. We unveil a new application for which the Poincar\\'e disk model has very appealing features, and our theory comes in handy: \\textit{model} embeddings for boosted combinations of decision trees, trained using the log-loss (trees) and logistic loss (combinations).

However, with the increased usage, cybercrime aimed at mobile devices is rocketing. Smishing attacks, in particular, have observed a significant upsurge in recent years. This problem is further exacerbated by the perpetrator creating new deceptive websites daily, with an average life cycle of under 15 hours. This renders the standard practice of keeping a database of malicious URLs ineffective. To this end, we propose a novel on-device pipeline: COPS that intelligently identifies features of fraudulent messages and URLs to alert the user in real-time. COPS is a lightweight pipeline with a detection module based on the Disentangled Variational Autoencoder of size 3.46MB for smishing and URL phishing detection, and we benchmark it on open datasets. We achieve an accuracy of 98.15% and 99.5%, respectively, for both tasks, with a false negative and false positive rate of a mere 0.037 and 0.015, outperforming previous works with the added advantage of ensuring real-time alerts on resource-constrained devices.

    "abstract": "Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable problem-solving capabilities in various vision fields (e.g., generic object recognition and grounding) based on strong visual semantic representation and language reasoning ability. However, whether MLLMs are sensitive to subtle visual spoof/forged clues and how they perform in the domain of face attack detection (e.g., face spoofing and forgery detection) is still unexplored. In this paper, we introduce a new benchmark, namely SHIELD, to evaluate the ability of MLLMs on face spoofing and forgery detection. Specifically, we design true/false and multiple-choice questions to evaluate multimodal face data in these two face security tasks. For the face anti-spoofing task, we evaluate three different modalities (i.e., RGB, infrared, depth) under four types of presentation attacks (i.e., print attack, replay attack, rigid mask, paper mask). For the face forgery detection task, we evaluate GAN-based and diffusion-based data with both visual and acoustic modalities. Each question is subjected to both zero-shot and few-shot tests under standard and chain of thought (COT) settings. The results indicate that MLLMs hold substantial potential in the face security domain, offering advantages over traditional specific models in terms of interpretability, multimodal flexible reasoning, and joint face spoof and forgery detection. Additionally, we develop a novel Multi-Attribute Chain of Thought (MA-COT) paradigm for describing and judging various task-specific and task-irrelevant attributes of face images, which provides rich task-related knowledge for subtle spoof/forged clue mining. Extensive experiments in separate face anti-spoofing, separate face forgery detection, and joint detection tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed MA-COT.

    "abstract": "Humans possess a remarkable capacity to recognize and manipulate abstract structure, which is especially apparent in the domain of geometry. Recent research in cognitive science suggests neural networks do not share this capacity, concluding that human geometric abilities come from discrete symbolic structure in human mental representations. However, progress in artificial intelligence (AI) suggests that neural networks begin to demonstrate more human-like reasoning after scaling up standard architectures in both model size and amount of training data. In this study, we revisit empirical results in cognitive science on geometric visual processing and identify three key biases in geometric visual processing: a sensitivity towards complexity, regularity, and the perception of parts and relations. We test tasks from the literature that probe these biases in humans and find that large pre-trained neural network models used in AI demonstrate more human-like abstract geometric processing. ",

    "abstract": "Background: Acute kidney injury (AKI), the decline of kidney excretory function, occurs in up to 18% of hospitalized admissions. Progression of AKI may lead to irreversible kidney damage. Methods: This retrospective cohort study includes adult patients admitted to a non-intensive care unit at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC) (n = 46,815) and University of Florida Health (UFH) (n = 127,202). We developed and compared deep learning and conventional machine learning models to predict progression to Stage 2 or higher AKI within the next 48 hours. We trained local models for each site (UFH Model trained on UFH, UPMC Model trained on UPMC) and a separate model with a development cohort of patients from both sites (UFH-UPMC Model). We internally and externally validated the models on each site and performed subgroup analyses across sex and race. Results: Stage 2 or higher AKI occurred in 3% (n=3,257) and 8% (n=2,296) of UFH and UPMC patients, respectively. Area under the receiver operating curve values (AUROC) for the UFH test cohort ranged between 0.77 (UPMC Model) and 0.81 (UFH Model), while AUROC values ranged between 0.79 (UFH Model) and 0.83 (UPMC Model) for the UPMC test cohort. UFH-UPMC Model achieved an AUROC of 0.81 (95% confidence interval [CI] [0.80, 0.83]) for UFH and 0.82 (95% CI [0.81,0.84]) for UPMC test cohorts; an area under the precision recall curve values (AUPRC) of 0.6 (95% CI, [0.05, 0.06]) for UFH and 0.13 (95% CI, [0.11,0.15]) for UPMC test cohorts. Kinetic estimated glomerular filtration rate, nephrotoxic drug burden and blood urea nitrogen remained the top three features with the highest influence across the models and health centers. Conclusion: Locally developed models displayed marginally reduced discrimination when tested on another institution, while the top set of influencing features remained the same across the models and sites.

Typically, content service providers (CSPs) own the content, and the users request their preferred content from the CSPs using their (wireless) internet service providers (ISPs). As these parties do not reveal their private information and business secrets, traditional techniques may not be readily used to predict the dynamic changes in users' future demands. Motivated by this, we propose a novel resource-aware hierarchical federated learning (RawHFL) solution for predicting user's future content requests. A practical data acquisition technique is used that allows the user to update its local training dataset based on its requested content. Besides, since networking and other computational resources are limited, considering that only a subset of the users participate in the model training, we derive the convergence bound of the proposed algorithm. Based on this bound, we minimize a weighted utility function for jointly configuring the controllable parameters to train the RawHFL energy efficiently under practical resource constraints. Our extensive simulation results validate the proposed algorithm's superiority, in terms of test accuracy and energy cost, over existing baselines. ",

    "abstract": "In a zero-trust fabless paradigm, designers are increasingly concerned about hardware-based attacks on the semiconductor supply chain. Logic locking is a design-for-trust method that adds extra key-controlled gates in the circuits to prevent hardware intellectual property theft and overproduction. While attackers have traditionally relied on an oracle to attack logic-locked circuits, machine learning attacks have shown the ability to retrieve the secret key even without access to an oracle. In this paper, we first examine the limitations of state-of-the-art machine learning attacks and argue that the use of key hamming distance as the sole model-guiding structural metric is not always useful. Then, we develop, train, and test a corruptibility-aware graph neural network-based oracle-less attack on logic locking that takes into consideration both the structure and the behavior of the circuits. Our model is explainable in the sense that we analyze what the machine learning model has interpreted in the training process and how it can perform a successful attack.

Deep learning (DL)-based methods, which build neural networks to reconstruct MR images from undersampled raw data, can reliably address this problem. Among these methods, model-driven DL methods incorporate different prior knowledge into deep networks, thereby narrowing the solution space and achieving better results. However, the complementarity among different prior knowledge has not been thoroughly explored. Most of the existing model-driven networks simply stack unrolled cascades to mimic iterative solution steps, which are inefficient and their performances are suboptimal. To optimize the conventional network structure, we propose a collaborative model-driven network. In the network, each unrolled cascade comprised three parts: model-driven subnetworks, attention modules, and correction modules. The attention modules can learn to enhance the areas of expertise for each subnetwork, and the correction modules can compensate for new errors caused by the attention modules. The optimized intermediate results are fed into the next cascade for better convergence. Experimental results on multiple sequences showed significant improvements in the final results without additional computational complexity. Moreover, the proposed model-driven network design strategy can be easily applied to other model-driven methods to improve their performances. ",

The reason, we believe, is that the three-channel RGB space is insufficient for supervising the restoration models. To this end, we augment the representation to hold structural information of local neighborhoods at each pixel while keeping the color information and pixel-grainedness unharmed. The result is a new representation space, dubbed augmented RGB ($a$RGB) space. Substituting the underlying representation space for the per-pixel losses facilitates the training of image restoration models, thereby improving the performance without affecting the evaluation phase. Notably, when combined with auxiliary objectives such as adversarial or perceptual losses, our $a$RGB space consistently improves overall metrics by reconstructing both color and local structures, overcoming the conventional perception-distortion trade-off.

Nevertheless, they suffer from multiple stability issues at inference time, such as hallucinations, content skipping or speech repetitions. In this work, we introduce a new self-supervised Voice Conversion (VC) architecture which can be used to learn to encode transitory features, such as content, separately from stationary ones, such as speaker ID or recording conditions, creating speaker-disentangled representations. Using speaker-disentangled codes to train LLMs for text-to-speech (TTS) allows the LLM to generate the content and the style of the speech only from the text, similarly to humans, while the speaker identity is provided by the decoder of the VC model. Results show that LLMs trained over speaker-disentangled self-supervised representations provide an improvement of 4.7pp in speaker similarity over SOTA entangled representations, and a word error rate (WER) 5.4pp lower. Furthermore, they achieve higher naturalness than human recordings of the LibriTTS test-other dataset. Finally, we show that using explicit reference embedding negatively impacts intelligibility (stability), with WER increasing by 14pp compared to the model that only uses text to infer the style. ",

Our modular distributed deep learning paradigm, termed \\textit{neural pathways}, can achieve arbitrary accuracy while only loading a small number of parameters into GPU VRAM. Formally, we prove that for every error level $\\varepsilon>0$ and every Lipschitz function $f:[0,1]^n\\to \\mathbb{R}$, one can construct a neural pathways model which uniformly approximates $f$ to $\\varepsilon$ accuracy over $[0,1]^n$ while only requiring networks of $\\mathcal{O}(\\varepsilon^{-1})$ parameters to be loaded in memory and $\\mathcal{O}(\\varepsilon^{-1}\\log(\\varepsilon^{-1}))$ to be loaded during the forward pass. This improves the optimal bounds for traditional non-distributed deep learning models, namely ReLU MLPs, which need $\\mathcal{O}(\\varepsilon^{-n/2})$ parameters to achieve the same accuracy. The only other available deep learning model that breaks the curse of dimensionality is MLPs with super-expressive activation functions. However, we demonstrate that these models have an infinite VC dimension, even with bounded depth and width restrictions, unlike the neural pathways model. This implies that only the latter generalizes. Our analysis is validated experimentally in both regression and classification tasks, demonstrating that our model exhibits superior performance compared to larger centralized benchmarks. ",

    "abstract": "Pediatric Low-Grade Neuroepithelial Tumors (PLGNT) are the most common pediatric cancer type, accounting for 40% of brain tumors in children, and identifying PLGNT molecular subtype is crucial for treatment planning. However, the gold standard to determine the PLGNT subtype is biopsy, which can be impractical or dangerous for patients. This research improves the performance of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in classifying PLGNT subtypes through MRI scans by introducing a loss function that specifically improves the model's Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Curve (AUROC), offering a non-invasive diagnostic alternative. In this study, a retrospective dataset of 339 children with PLGNT (143 BRAF fusion, 71 with BRAF V600E mutation, and 125 non-BRAF) was curated. We employed a CNN model with Monte Carlo random data splitting. The baseline model was trained using binary cross entropy (BCE), and achieved an AUROC of 86.11% for differentiating BRAF fusion and BRAF V600E mutations, which was improved to 87.71% using our proposed AUROC loss function (p-value 0.045). With multiclass classification, the AUROC improved from 74.42% to 76. 59% (p-value 0.0016). ",

    "abstract": "Studying the morphological development of cartilaginous and osseous structures is critical to the early detection of life-threatening skeletal dysmorphology. Embryonic cartilage undergoes rapid structural changes within hours, introducing biological variations and morphological shifts that limit the generalization of deep learning-based segmentation models that infer across multiple embryonic age groups. Obtaining individual models for each age group is expensive and less effective, while direct transfer (predicting an age unseen during training) suffers a potential performance drop due to morphological shifts. We propose a novel Transformer-based segmentation model with improved biological priors that better distills morphologically diverse information through conditional mechanisms. This enables a single model to accurately predict cartilage across multiple age groups. Experiments on the mice cartilage dataset show the superiority of our new model compared to other competitive segmentation models. Additional studies on a separate mice cartilage dataset with a distinct mutation show that our model generalizes well and effectively captures age-based cartilage morphology patterns. ",

    "abstract": "Supervised learning has recently garnered significant attention in the field of computational physics due to its ability to effectively extract complex patterns for tasks like solving partial differential equations, or predicting material properties. Traditionally, such datasets consist of inputs given as meshes with a large number of nodes representing the problem geometry (seen as graphs), and corresponding outputs obtained with a numerical solver. This means the supervised learning model must be able to handle large and sparse graphs with continuous node attributes. In this work, we focus on Gaussian process regression, for which we introduce the Sliced Wasserstein Weisfeiler-Lehman (SWWL) graph kernel. In contrast to existing graph kernels, the proposed SWWL kernel enjoys positive definiteness and a drastic complexity reduction, which makes it possible to process datasets that were previously impossible to handle. The new kernel is first validated on graph classification for molecular datasets, where the input graphs have a few tens of nodes. The efficiency of the SWWL kernel is then illustrated on graph regression in computational fluid dynamics and solid mechanics, where the input graphs are made up of tens of thousands of nodes. ",

    "abstract": "Geometric quantum machine learning (GQML) aims to embed problem symmetries for learning efficient solving protocols. However, the question remains if (G)QML can be routinely used for constructing protocols with an exponential separation from classical analogs. In this Letter we consider Simon's problem for learning properties of Boolean functions, and show that this can be related to an unsupervised circuit classification problem. Using the workflow of geometric QML, we learn from first principles Simon's algorithm, thus discovering an example of BQP$^A\\neq$BPP protocol with respect to some dataset (oracle $A$). Our key findings include the development of an equivariant feature map for embedding Boolean functions, based on twirling with respect to identified bitflip and permutational symmetries, and measurement based on invariant observables with a sampling advantage. The proposed workflow points to the importance of data embeddings and classical post-processing, while keeping the variational circuit as a trivial identity operator. Next, developing the intuition for the function learning, we visualize instances as directed computational hypergraphs, and observe that the GQML protocol can access their global topological features for distinguishing bijective and surjective functions. Finally, we discuss the prospects for learning other BQP$^A$-type protocols, and conjecture that this depends on the ability of simplifying embeddings-based oracles $A$ applied as a linear combination of unitaries.

    "abstract": "Graph neural networks (GNNs) have gained popularity for various graph-related tasks. However, similar to deep neural networks, GNNs are also vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Empirical studies have shown that adversarially robust generalization has a pivotal role in establishing effective defense algorithms against adversarial attacks. In this paper, we contribute by providing adversarially robust generalization bounds for two kinds of popular GNNs, graph convolutional network (GCN) and message passing graph neural network, using the PAC-Bayesian framework. Our result reveals that spectral norm of the diffusion matrix on the graph and spectral norm of the weights as well as the perturbation factor govern the robust generalization bounds of both models. Our bounds are nontrivial generalizations of the results developed in (Liao et al., 2020) from the standard setting to adversarial setting while avoiding exponential dependence of the maximum node degree. As corollaries, we derive better PAC-Bayesian robust generalization bounds for GCN in the standard setting, which improve the bounds in (Liao et al., 2020) by avoiding exponential dependence on the maximum node degree.
