    "abstract": "In harsh environments such as those found in nuclear facilities, the use of robotic systems is crucial for performing tasks that would otherwise require human intervention. This is done to minimize the risk of human exposure to dangerous levels of radiation, which can have severe consequences for health and even be fatal. However, the telemanipulation systems employed in these environments are becoming increasingly intricate, relying heavily on sophisticated control methods and local master devices. Consequently, the cognitive burden on operators during labor-intensive tasks is growing. To tackle this challenge, operator intention detection based on task learning can greatly enhance the performance of robotic tasks while reducing the reliance on human effort in teleoperation, particularly in a glovebox environment. By accurately predicting the operator's intentions, the robot can carry out tasks more efficiently and effectively, with minimal input from the operator. In this regard, we propose the utilization of Convolutional Neural Networks, a machine learning approach, to learn and forecast the operator's intentions using raw force feedback spatiotemporal data. Through our experimental study on glovebox tasks for nuclear applications, such as radiation survey and object grasping, we have achieved promising outcomes. Our approach holds the potential to enhance the safety and efficiency of robotic systems in harsh environments, thus diminishing the risk of human exposure to radiation while simultaneously improving the precision and speed of robotic operations.

    "abstract": "To solve complex tasks under resource constraints, reinforcement learning (RL) agents need to be simple, efficient, and scalable with (1) large state space and (2) increasingly accumulated data of interactions. We propose the HyperAgent, a RL framework with hypermodel, index sampling schemes and incremental update mechanism, enabling computation-efficient sequential posterior approximation and data-efficient action selection under general value function approximation beyond conjugacy. The implementation of \\HyperAgent is simple as it only adds one module and one line of code additional to DDQN. Practically, HyperAgent demonstrates its robust performance in large-scale deep RL benchmarks with significant efficiency gain in terms of both data and computation. Theoretically, among the practically scalable algorithms, HyperAgent is the first method to achieve provably scalable per-step computational complexity as well as sublinear regret under tabular RL. The core of our theoretical analysis is the sequential posterior approximation argument, made possible by the first analytical tool for sequential random projection, a non-trivial martingale extension of the Johnson-Lindenstrauss lemma. This work bridges the theoretical and practical realms of RL, establishing a new benchmark for RL algorithm design. ",

However, challenges persist due to the absence of a standardized definition and universally accepted datasets. Many researchers now view cyberbullying as a facet of cyberaggression, encompassing factors like repetition, peer relationships, and harmful intent in addition to online aggression. Acquiring comprehensive data reflective of all cyberbullying components from social media networks proves to be a complex task. This paper provides a description of an extensive semi-synthetic cyberbullying dataset that incorporates all of the essential aspects of cyberbullying, including aggression, repetition, peer relationships, and intent to harm. The method of creating the dataset is succinctly outlined, and a detailed overview of the publicly accessible dataset is additionally presented.

However, deep learning-based models face a critical security threat - their vulnerability to backdoor attacks. In this paper, we explore compromising deep sequential anomaly detection models by proposing a novel backdoor attack strategy. The attack approach comprises two primary steps, trigger generation and backdoor injection. Trigger generation is to derive imperceptible triggers by crafting perturbed samples from the benign normal data, of which the perturbed samples are still normal. The backdoor injection is to properly inject the backdoor triggers to comprise the model only for the samples with triggers. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed attack strategy by injecting backdoors on two well-established one-class anomaly detection models. ",

    "abstract": "Detecting abrupt changes in real-time data streams from scientific simulations presents a challenging task, demanding the deployment of accurate and efficient algorithms. Identifying change points in live data stream involves continuous scrutiny of incoming observations for deviations in their statistical characteristics, particularly in high-volume data scenarios. Maintaining a balance between sudden change detection and minimizing false alarms is vital. Many existing algorithms for this purpose rely on known probability distributions, limiting their feasibility. In this study, we introduce the Kernel-based Cumulative Sum (KCUSUM) algorithm, a non-parametric extension of the traditional Cumulative Sum (CUSUM) method, which has gained prominence for its efficacy in online change point detection under less restrictive conditions. KCUSUM splits itself by comparing incoming samples directly with reference samples and computes a statistic grounded in the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) non-parametric framework. This approach extends KCUSUM's pertinence to scenarios where only reference samples are available, such as atomic trajectories of proteins in vacuum, facilitating the detection of deviations from the reference sample without prior knowledge of the data's underlying distribution. Furthermore, by harnessing MMD's inherent random-walk structure, we can theoretically analyze KCUSUM's performance across various use cases, including metrics like expected delay and mean runtime to false alarms. Finally, we discuss real-world use cases from scientific simulations such as NWChem CODAR and protein folding data, demonstrating KCUSUM's practical effectiveness in online change point detection. ",

LAVE automatically generates language descriptions for the user's footage, serving as the foundation for enabling the LLM to process videos and assist in editing tasks. When the user provides editing objectives, the agent plans and executes relevant actions to fulfill them. Moreover, LAVE allows users to edit videos through either the agent or direct UI manipulation, providing flexibility and enabling manual refinement of agent actions. Our user study, which included eight participants ranging from novices to proficient editors, demonstrated LAVE's effectiveness. The results also shed light on user perceptions of the proposed LLM-assisted editing paradigm and its impact on users' creativity and sense of co-creation.

    "abstract": "We propose Multi-Antenna (MA) Towards Inband Shift Keying (TISK): a new multi-carrier radio concept to cope with critical link budgets. In contrast to common proposals that rely on analog beamforming at both transmitter and receiver, MA-TISK does not require beam alignment. The transmitted signals have all constant envelope in continuous time, which allows for efficient, low-cost power amplification and up-conversion. The concept is compatible with any linear PSK-modulation as well as pulse position modulation. Each sub-carrier is sent over a separate antenna that is equipped with a voltage-controlled oscillator. The phases of these oscillators are controlled by digital baseband. Temporal signal combining makes up for the lack of beamforming gain at the transmitter. A common message may be broadcast to many receivers, simultaneously. Demodulation can be efficiently implemented by means of fast Fourier transform. MA-TISK does not suffer from spectral re-growth issues plaguing other constant envelope modulations like GMSK. Almost rectangular signal spectra similar to those for linear modulation with root-raised-cosine pulse shaping are possible. For the 100 MHz-wide spectral mask of 5G downlink, QPSK-modulation allows for 160 MBit/s with 5.74 MHz subcarrier spacing when using 16 transmit antennas. The wide carrier spacing makes the signals insensitive to Doppler effects. There is no loss in link budget gain compared to spatial beamforming at the transmitter. ",

    "abstract": "This paper presents an approach for applying camera perception techniques to spinning LiDAR data. To improve the robustness of long-term change detection from a 3D LiDAR, range and intensity information are rendered into virtual perspectives using a pinhole camera model. Hue-saturation-value image encoding is used to colourize the images by range and near-IR intensity. The LiDAR's active scene illumination makes it invariant to ambient brightness, which enables night-to-day change detection without additional processing. Using the colourized, perspective range image allows existing foundation models to detect semantic regions. Specifically, the Segment Anything Model detects semantically similar regions in both a previously acquired map and live view from a path-repeating robot. By comparing the masks in both views, changes in the live scan are detected. Results indicate that the Segment Anything Model is capable of accurately capturing the shape of arbitrary changes introduced into scenes. The system achieves an object recall of 82.6% and a precision of 47.0%. Changes can be detected through day-to-night illumination variations reliably. After pixel-level masks are generated, the one-to-one correspondence with 3D points means that the 2D masks can be directly used to recover the 3D location of the changes. Eventually, the detected 3D changes can be avoided by treating them as obstacles in a local motion planner. ",

    "abstract": "Oftentimes, machine learning applications using neural networks involve solving discrete optimization problems, such as in pruning, parameter-isolation-based continual learning and training of binary networks. Still, these discrete problems are combinatorial in nature and are also not amenable to gradient-based optimization. Additionally, classical approaches used in discrete settings do not scale well to large neural networks, forcing scientists and empiricists to rely on alternative methods. Among these, two main distinct sources of top-down information can be used to lead the model to good solutions: (1) extrapolating gradient information from points outside of the solution set (2) comparing evaluations between members of a subset of the valid solutions. We take continuation path (CP) methods to represent using purely the former and Monte Carlo (MC) methods to represent the latter, while also noting that some hybrid methods combine the two. The main goal of this work is to compare both approaches. For that purpose, we first overview the two classes while also discussing some of their drawbacks analytically. Then, on the experimental section, we compare their performance, starting with smaller microworld experiments, which allow more fine-grained control of problem variables, and gradually moving towards larger problems, including neural network regression and neural network pruning for image classification, where we additionally compare against magnitude-based pruning.

    "abstract": "With the rising popularity of virtual worlds, the importance of data-driven parametric models of 3D meshes has grown rapidly. Numerous applications, such as computer vision, procedural generation, and mesh editing, vastly rely on these models. However, current approaches do not allow for independent editing of deformations at different frequency levels. They also do not benefit from representing deformations at different frequencies with dedicated representations, which would better expose their properties and improve the generated meshes' geometric and perceptual quality. In this work, spectral meshes are introduced as a method to decompose mesh deformations into low-frequency and high-frequency deformations. These features of low- and high-frequency deformations are used for representation learning with graph convolutional networks. A parametric model for 3D facial mesh synthesis is built upon the proposed framework, exposing user parameters that control disentangled high- and low-frequency deformations. Independent control of deformations at different frequencies and generation of plausible synthetic examples are mutually exclusive objectives. A Conditioning Factor is introduced to leverage these objectives. Our model takes further advantage of spectral partitioning by representing different frequency levels with disparate, more suitable representations. Low frequencies are represented with standardised Euclidean coordinates, and high frequencies with a normalised deformation representation (DR). This paper investigates applications of our proposed approach in mesh reconstruction, mesh interpolation, and multi-frequency editing. It is demonstrated that our method improves the overall quality of generated meshes on most datasets when considering both the $L_1$ norm and perceptual Dihedral Angle Mesh Error (DAME) metrics. ",

This work focuses on single-arm manipulation of stiff DLOs (StDLOs) connected to form a DLO network (DLON), for which the measurements (output) are the endpoint poses of the DLON, which are subject to unknown dynamics during manipulation. To demonstrate feasibility of output-based control without state estimation, direct input-output dynamics are shown to exist by training neural network models on simulated trajectories. Output dynamics are then approximated with polynomials and found to contain well-known rigid body dynamics terms. A composite model consisting of a rigid body model and an online data-driven residual is developed, which predicts output dynamics more accurately than either model alone, and without prior experience with the system. An adaptive model predictive controller is developed with the composite model for DLON manipulation, which completes DLON installation tasks, both in simulation and with a physical automotive wire harness.

The goal of log-based anomaly detection is to automatically detect system anomalies by analyzing the large number of logs generated in a short period of time, which is a critical challenge in the real world. Previous studies have used a log parser to extract templates from unstructured log data and detect anomalies on the basis of patterns of the template occurrences. These methods have limitations for logs with unknown templates. Furthermore, since most log anomalies are known to be point anomalies rather than contextual anomalies, detection methods based on occurrence patterns can cause unnecessary delays in detection. In this paper, we propose LogELECTRA, a new log anomaly detection model that analyzes a single line of log messages more deeply on the basis of self-supervised anomaly detection. LogELECTRA specializes in detecting log anomalies as point anomalies by applying ELECTRA, a natural language processing model, to analyze the semantics of a single line of log messages.

State-of-the-art approaches leverage heuristics, machine learning, and deep learning to detect code smells. However, existing approaches have not fully explored the potential of large language models (LLMs). In this paper, we propose \\textit{PromptSmell}, a novel approach based on prompt learning for detecting multi-label code smell. Firstly, code snippets are acquired by traversing abstract syntax trees. Combined code snippets with natural language prompts and mask tokens, \\textit{PromptSmell} constructs the input of LLMs. Secondly, to detect multi-label code smell, we leverage a label combination approach by converting a multi-label problem into a multi-classification problem. A customized answer space is added to the word list of pre-trained language models, and the probability distribution of intermediate answers is obtained by predicting the words at the mask positions. Finally, the intermediate answers are mapped to the target class labels by a verbalizer as the final classification result. We evaluate the effectiveness of \\textit{PromptSmell} by answering six research questions. The experimental results demonstrate that \\textit{PromptSmell} obtains an improvement of 11.17\\% in $precision_{w}$ and 7.4\\% in $F1_{w}$ compared to existing approaches. ",

Meanwhile, developments in neural surface representation learning incorporate non-linear positional encoding, addressing issues like spectral bias; however, this poses challenges in applying mesh extraction techniques based on CPWA functions. Focusing on trilinear interpolating methods as positional encoding, we present theoretical insights and an analytical mesh extraction, showing the transformation of hypersurfaces to flat planes within the trilinear region under the eikonal constraint. Moreover, we introduce a method for approximating intersecting points among three hypersurfaces contributing to broader applications.

To help researchers synthesize the new research many have written survey papers, but even those have become numerous. In this paper, we develop a method to automatically assign survey papers to a taxonomy. We collect the metadata of 144 LLM survey papers and explore three paradigms to classify papers within the taxonomy. Our work indicates that leveraging graph structure information on co-category graphs can significantly outperform the language models in two paradigms; pre-trained language models' fine-tuning and zero-shot/few-shot classifications using LLMs. We find that our model surpasses an average human recognition level and that fine-tuning LLMs using weak labels generated by a smaller model, such as the GCN in this study, can be more effective than using ground-truth labels, revealing the potential of weak-to-strong generalization in the taxonomy classification task.

    "abstract": "Modern techniques like contrastive learning have been effectively used in many areas, including computer vision, natural language processing, and graph-structured data. Creating positive examples that assist the model in learning robust and discriminative representations is a crucial stage in contrastive learning approaches. Usually, preset human intuition directs the selection of relevant data augmentations. Due to patterns that are easily recognized by humans, this rule of thumb works well in the vision and language domains. However, it is impractical to visually inspect the temporal structures in time series. The diversity of time series augmentations at both the dataset and instance levels makes it difficult to choose meaningful augmentations on the fly. In this study, we address this gap by analyzing time series data augmentation using information theory and summarizing the most commonly adopted augmentations in a unified format. We then propose a contrastive learning framework with parametric augmentation, AutoTCL, which can be adaptively employed to support time series representation learning. The proposed approach is encoder-agnostic, allowing it to be seamlessly integrated with different backbone encoders. Experiments on univariate forecasting tasks demonstrate the highly competitive results of our method, with an average 6.5\\% reduction in MSE and 4.7\\% in MAE over the leading baselines. In classification tasks, AutoTCL achieves a $1.2\\%$ increase in average accuracy. ",

A crucial aspect of effective GCL is the caliber of generated positive and negative samples, which is intrinsically dictated by their resemblance to the original data. Nevertheless, precise control over similarity during sample generation presents a formidable challenge, often impeding the effective discovery of representative graph patterns. To address this challenge, we propose an innovative framework: Adversarial Curriculum Graph Contrastive Learning (ACGCL), which capitalizes on the merits of pair-wise augmentation to engender graph-level positive and negative samples with controllable similarity, alongside subgraph contrastive learning to discern effective graph patterns therein. Within the ACGCL framework, we have devised a novel adversarial curriculum training methodology that facilitates progressive learning by sequentially increasing the difficulty of distinguishing the generated samples. Notably, this approach transcends the prevalent sparsity issue inherent in conventional curriculum learning strategies by adaptively concentrating on more challenging training data. Finally, a comprehensive assessment of ACGCL is conducted through extensive experiments on six well-known benchmark datasets, wherein ACGCL conspicuously surpasses a set of state-of-the-art baselines.

However, a theoretical understanding of how perturbations include class features and contribute to generalization is limited. In this study, we provide a theoretical framework for understanding learning from perturbations using a one-hidden-layer network trained on mutually orthogonal samples.

    "abstract": "As machine learning (ML) becomes more prevalent in human-centric applications, there is a growing emphasis on algorithmic fairness and privacy protection. While previous research has explored these areas as separate objectives, there is a growing recognition of the complex relationship between privacy and fairness. However, previous works have primarily focused on examining the interplay between privacy and fairness through empirical investigations, with limited attention given to theoretical exploration. This study aims to bridge this gap by introducing a theoretical framework that enables a comprehensive examination of their interrelation. We shall develop and analyze an information bottleneck (IB) based information obfuscation method with local differential privacy (LDP) for fair representation learning. In contrast to many empirical studies on fairness in ML, we show that the incorporation of LDP randomizers during the encoding process can enhance the fairness of the learned representation. Our analysis will demonstrate that the disclosure of sensitive information is constrained by the privacy budget of the LDP randomizer, thereby enabling the optimization process within the IB framework to effectively suppress sensitive information while preserving the desired utility through obfuscation. Based on the proposed method, we further develop a variational representation encoding approach that simultaneously achieves fairness and LDP. Our variational encoding approach offers practical advantages. It is trained using a non-adversarial method and does not require the introduction of any variational prior. Extensive experiments will be presented to validate our theoretical results and demonstrate the ability of our proposed approach to achieve both LDP and fairness while preserving adequate utility. ",

    "abstract": "Event cameras have been successfully applied to visual place recognition (VPR) tasks by using deep artificial neural networks (ANNs) in recent years. However, previously proposed deep ANN architectures are often unable to harness the abundant temporal information presented in event streams. In contrast, deep spiking networks exhibit more intricate spatiotemporal dynamics and are inherently well-suited to process sparse asynchronous event streams. Unfortunately, directly inputting temporal-dense event volumes into the spiking network introduces excessive time steps, resulting in prohibitively high training costs for large-scale VPR tasks. To address the aforementioned issues, we propose a novel deep spiking network architecture called Spike-EVPR for event-based VPR tasks. First, we introduce two novel event representations tailored for SNN to fully exploit the spatio-temporal information from the event streams, and reduce the video memory occupation during training as much as possible. Then, to exploit the full potential of these two representations, we construct a Bifurcated Spike Residual Encoder (BSR-Encoder) with powerful representational capabilities to better extract the high-level features from the two event representations. Next, we introduce a Shared & Specific Descriptor Extractor (SSD-Extractor). This module is designed to extract features shared between the two representations and features specific to each. Finally, we propose a Cross-Descriptor Aggregation Module (CDA-Module) that fuses the above three features to generate a refined, robust global descriptor of the scene. Our experimental results indicate the superior performance of our Spike-EVPR compared to several existing EVPR pipelines on Brisbane-Event-VPR and DDD20 datasets, with the average Recall@1 increased by 7.61% on Brisbane and 13.20% on DDD20.

While recent studies have predominantly focused on classifier-based methods, research on deep generative model (DGM)-based methods have lagged relatively.

This paper focuses on explaining the underlying mechanism of this phenomenon. We propose a hypothesis that less complex images concentrate in high-density regions in the latent space, resulting in a higher likelihood assignment in the Normalizing Flow (NF). We experimentally demonstrate its validity for five NF architectures, concluding that their likelihood is untrustworthy. Additionally, we show that this problem can be alleviated by treating image complexity as an independent variable. Finally, we provide evidence of the potential applicability of our hypothesis in another DGM, PixelCNN++. ",

    "abstract": "Malaria is a major health issue worldwide, and its diagnosis requires scalable solutions that can work effectively with low-cost microscopes (LCM). Deep learning-based methods have shown success in computer-aided diagnosis from microscopic images. However, these methods need annotated images that show cells affected by malaria parasites and their life stages. Annotating images from LCM significantly increases the burden on medical experts compared to annotating images from high-cost microscopes (HCM). For this reason, a practical solution would be trained on HCM images which should generalize well on LCM images during testing. While earlier methods adopted a multi-stage learning process, they did not offer an end-to-end approach. In this work, we present an end-to-end learning framework, named CodaMal (Contrastive Domain Adpation for Malaria). In order to bridge the gap between HCM (training) and LCM (testing), we propose a domain adaptive contrastive loss. It reduces the domain shift by promoting similarity between the representations of HCM and its corresponding LCM image, without imposing an additional annotation burden. In addition, the training objective includes object detection objectives with carefully designed augmentations, ensuring the accurate detection of malaria parasites. On the publicly available large-scale M5-dataset, our proposed method shows a significant improvement of 16% over the state-of-the-art methods in terms of the mean average precision metric (mAP), provides 21x speed up during inference, and requires only half learnable parameters than the prior methods.

Furthermore, miscellaneous resilient coordination problems are discussed in this survey. Specifically, some preliminaries and the fundamental problem settings are given at the beginning. Subsequently, based on a multi-layered framework of CPSs, promising results of resilient consensus are classified and reviewed from three perspectives: physical structure, communication mechanism, and network topology. Next, two typical application scenarios, i.e., multi-robot systems and smart grids are exemplified to extend resilient consensus to other coordination tasks. Particularly, we examine resilient containment and resilient distributed optimization problems, both of which demonstrate the applicability of resilient coordination approaches.

    "abstract": "This paper introduces a novel neural audio codec targeting high waveform sampling rates and low bitrates named APCodec, which seamlessly integrates the strengths of parametric codecs and waveform codecs. The APCodec revolutionizes the process of audio encoding and decoding by concurrently handling the amplitude and phase spectra as audio parametric characteristics like parametric codecs. It is composed of an encoder and a decoder with the modified ConvNeXt v2 network as the backbone, connected by a quantizer based on the residual vector quantization (RVQ) mechanism. The encoder compresses the audio amplitude and phase spectra in parallel, amalgamating them into a continuous latent code at a reduced temporal resolution. This code is subsequently quantized by the quantizer. Ultimately, the decoder reconstructs the audio amplitude and phase spectra in parallel, and the decoded waveform is obtained by inverse short-time Fourier transform. To ensure the fidelity of decoded audio like waveform codecs, spectral-level loss, quantization loss, and generative adversarial network (GAN) based loss are collectively employed for training the APCodec. To support low-latency streamable inference, we employ feed-forward layers and causal convolutional layers in APCodec, incorporating a knowledge distillation training strategy to enhance the quality of decoded audio. Experimental results confirm that our proposed APCodec can encode 48 kHz audio at bitrate of just 6 kbps, with no significant degradation in the quality of the decoded audio. At the same bitrate, our proposed APCodec also demonstrates superior decoded audio quality and faster generation speed compared to well-known codecs, such as SoundStream, Encodec, HiFi-Codec and AudioDec.

Conversational systems can exploit automatic paraphrasing to make the conversation more natural, e.g., talking about a certain topic using different paraphrases in different time instants. Recently, the task of automatically generating paraphrases has been approached in the context of Natural Language Generation (NLG). While many existing systems simply consist in rule-based models, the recent success of the Deep Neural Networks in several NLG tasks naturally suggests the possibility of exploiting such networks for generating paraphrases. However, the main obstacle toward neural-network-based paraphrasing is the lack of large datasets with aligned pairs of sentences and paraphrases, that are needed to efficiently train the neural models. In this paper we present a method for the automatic generation of large aligned corpora, that is based on the assumption that news and blog websites talk about the same events using different narrative styles. We propose a similarity search procedure with linguistic constraints that, given a reference sentence, is able to locate the most similar candidate paraphrases out from millions of indexed sentences. The data generation process is evaluated in the case of the Italian language, performing experiments using pointer-based deep neural architectures. ",

    "abstract": "Whole-slide image (WSI) classification is a challenging task because 1) patches from WSI lack annotation, and 2) WSI possesses unnecessary variability, e.g., stain protocol. Recently, Multiple-Instance Learning (MIL) has made significant progress, allowing for classification based on slide-level, rather than patch-level, annotations. However, existing MIL methods ignore that all patches from normal slides are normal. Using this free annotation, we introduce a semi-supervision signal to de-bias the inter-slide variability and to capture the common factors of variation within normal patches. Because our method is orthogonal to the MIL algorithm, we evaluate our method on top of the recently proposed MIL algorithms and also compare the performance with other semi-supervised approaches. We evaluate our method on two public WSI datasets including Camelyon-16 and TCGA lung cancer and demonstrate that our approach significantly improves the predictive performance of existing MIL algorithms and outperforms other semi-supervised algorithms.

    "abstract": "Hallucinations pose a significant challenge for the practical implementation of large language models (LLMs). The utilization of parametric knowledge in generating factual content is constrained by the limited knowledge of LLMs, potentially resulting in internal hallucinations. While incorporating external information can help fill knowledge gaps, it also introduces the risk of irrelevant information, thereby increasing the likelihood of external hallucinations. A careful and balanced integration of the parametric knowledge within LLMs with external information is crucial to alleviate hallucinations. In this study, we present Rowen, a novel approach that enhances LLMs with a selective retrieval augmentation process tailored to address hallucinated outputs. This process is governed by a multilingual semantic-aware detection module, which evaluates the consistency of the perturbed responses across various languages for the same queries. Upon detecting inconsistencies indicative of hallucinations, Rowen activates the retrieval of external information to rectify the model outputs. Rowen adeptly harmonizes the intrinsic parameters in LLMs with external knowledge sources, effectively mitigating hallucinations by ensuring a balanced integration of internal reasoning and external evidence. Through a comprehensive empirical analysis, we demonstrate that Rowen surpasses the current state-of-the-art in both detecting and mitigating hallucinated content within the outputs of LLMs. ",

    "abstract": "Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) has become a promising technology to realize the programmable wireless environment via steering the incident signal in fully customizable ways. However, a major challenge in RIS-aided communication systems is the simultaneous design of the precoding matrix at the base station (BS) and the phase shifting matrix of the RIS elements. This is mainly attributed to the highly non-convex optimization space of variables at both the BS and the RIS, and the diversity of communication environments. Generally, traditional optimization methods for this problem suffer from the high complexity, while existing deep learning based methods are lack of robustness in various scenarios. To address these issues, we introduce a gradient-based manifold meta learning method (GMML), which works without pre-training and has strong robustness for RIS-aided communications. Specifically, the proposed method fuses meta learning and manifold learning to improve the overall spectral efficiency, and reduce the overhead of the high-dimensional signal process. Unlike traditional deep learning based methods which directly take channel state information as input, GMML feeds the gradients of the precoding matrix and phase shifting matrix into neural networks. Coherently, we design a differential regulator to constrain the phase shifting matrix of the RIS. Numerical results show that the proposed GMML can improve the spectral efficiency by up to 7.31\\%, and speed up the convergence by 23 times faster compared to traditional approaches. Moreover, they also demonstrate remarkable robustness and adaptability in dynamic settings. ",

As large language models (LLMs) increasingly integrate into social and professional environments, understanding their behavior within the context of social networks and interactions becomes essential. Our study analyzes the behaviors of standard network structures and real-world networks to determine whether the dynamics of multiple LLMs align with human social dynamics. We explore various social network principles, including micro-level concepts such as preferential attachment, triadic closure, and homophily, as well as macro-level concepts like community structure and the small-world phenomenon. Our findings suggest that LLMs demonstrate all these principles when they are provided with network structures and asked about their preferences regarding network formation. Furthermore, we investigate LLMs' decision-making based on real-world networks to compare the strengths of these principles. Our results reveal that triadic closure and homophily have a stronger influence than preferential attachment and that LLMs substantially exceed random guessing in the task of network formation predictions. Overall, our study contributes to the development of socially aware LLMs by shedding light on LLMs' network formation behaviors and exploring their impacts on social dynamics and norms. ",

To address this challenge, a common strategy is to leverage models trained on data from different populations, such as publicly available datasets. This approach, however, leads to the distribution shift problem, presenting a reduced performance on the population of interest. In scenarios where model errors can have significant consequences, selective prediction methods offer a means to mitigate risks and reduce reliance on expert supervision. This paper investigates selective prediction for semantic segmentation in low-resource settings, thus focusing on post-hoc confidence estimators applied to pre-trained models operating under distribution shift. We propose a novel image-level confidence measure tailored for semantic segmentation and demonstrate its effectiveness through experiments on three medical imaging tasks. Our findings show that post-hoc confidence estimators offer a cost-effective approach to reducing the impacts of distribution shift. ",

To face these challenges, a holistic approach is essential that allows for the concurrent development of part design, material system and manufacturing process. Current approaches employ numerical simulations, which however quickly becomes computation-intensive, especially for iterative optimization. Data-driven machine learning methods can be used to replace time- and resource-intensive numerical simulations. In particular, MeshGraphNets (MGNs) have shown promising results. They enable fast and accurate predictions on unseen mesh geometries while being fully differentiable for optimization. However, these models rely on large amounts of expensive training data, such as numerical simulations. Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) offer an opportunity to train neural networks with partial differential equations instead of labeled data, but have not been extended yet to handle time-dependent simulations of arbitrary meshes. This work introduces PI-MGNs, a hybrid approach that combines PINNs and MGNs to quickly and accurately solve non-stationary and nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs) on arbitrary meshes. The method is exemplified for thermal process simulations of unseen parts with inhomogeneous material distribution. Further results show that the model scales well to large and complex meshes, although it is trained on small generic meshes only. ",

Our analysis demonstrates that twinning significantly reduces network delays, with virtual twins outperforming physical networks. Virtual twins maintain low delays even with increased vehicle density, such as 15.05 seconds for 300 vehicles. Moreover, they exhibit faster computational speeds, with cloud-based twins being 1.7 times faster than edge twins in certain scenarios. These findings provide insights for efficient vehicular communication and underscore the potential of virtual twins in enhancing vehicular networks in crowded areas while emphasizing the importance of considering real-world factors when making deployment decisions.

However, identifying the full-field heterogeneous elastic properties of soft materials using traditional computational and engineering approaches is fundamentally challenging due to difficulties in estimating local stress fields. Recently, there has been a growing interest in using data-driven models to learn full-field mechanical responses such as displacement and strain from experimental or synthetic data. However, research studies on inferring the full-field elastic properties of materials, a more challenging problem, are scarce, particularly for large deformation, hyperelastic materials. Here, we propose a novel approach to identify the elastic modulus distribution in nonlinear, large deformation hyperelastic materials utilizing physics-informed neural networks (PINNs). We evaluate the prediction accuracies and computational efficiency of PINNs, informed by mechanic features and principles, across three synthetic materials with structural complexity that closely resemble real tissue patterns, such as brain tissue and tricuspid valve tissue. Our improved PINN architecture accurately estimates the full-field elastic properties, with relative errors of less than 5% across all examples.

Existing methods primarily employ auxiliary information to predict tail entity given head entity and its relation, yet face challenges due to the occasional unavailability of such detailed information and the inherent simplicity of predicting tail entities based on semantic similarities. Even though Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising solution to predict unobserved relations between the head and tail entity in a zero-shot manner, their performance is still restricted due to the inability to leverage all the (exponentially many) paths' information between two entities, which are critical in collectively indicating their relation types. To address this, in this work, we introduce a Condensed Transition Graph Framework for Zero-Shot Link Prediction (CTLP), which encodes all the paths' information in linear time complexity to predict unseen relations between entities, attaining both efficiency and information preservation. Specifically, we design a condensed transition graph encoder with theoretical guarantees on its coverage, expressiveness, and efficiency. It is learned by a transition graph contrastive learning strategy. Subsequently, we design a soft instruction tuning to learn and map the all-path embedding to the input of LLMs. Experimental results show that our proposed CTLP method achieves state-of-the-art performance on three standard ZSLP datasets ",

Given a set $X$ and an element $x\\in X$, to isolate $x$ from $X$, at least one of the sets in the selector must intersect $X$ on exactly $x$. We study (k,N)-permutation selectors which have the property that they can isolate each element of each $k$-element subset of $\\{0,1,...,N-1\\}$ in each possible order. These selectors can be used in protocols for ad-hoc radio networks to more efficiently disseminate information along multiple hops. In 2004, Gasieniec, Radzik and Xin gave a construction of a (k,N)-permutation selector of size $O(k^2\\log^3 N)$. This paper improves this by providing a probabilistic construction of a (k,N)-permutation selector of size $O(k^2\\log N)$. Remarkably, this matches the asymptotic bound for standard strong (k,N)-selectors, that isolate each element of each set of size $k$, but with no restriction on the order. We then show that the use of our (k,N)-permutation selector improves the best running time for gossiping in ad-hoc radio networks by a poly-logarithmic factor. ",

Motivated by this, we propose a remarkably simple alternative for learning on graphs that relies exclusively on attention. Graphs are represented as node or edge sets and their connectivity is enforced by masking the attention weight matrix, effectively creating custom attention patterns for each graph. Despite its simplicity, masked attention for graphs (MAG) has state-of-the-art performance on long-range tasks and outperforms strong message passing baselines and much more involved attention-based methods on over 55 node and graph-level tasks.

    "title": "TimeSeriesBench: An Industrial-Grade Benchmark for Time Series Anomaly  Detection Models",
    "abstract": "Driven by the proliferation of real-world application scenarios and scales, time series anomaly detection (TSAD) has attracted considerable scholarly and industrial interest. However, existing algorithms exhibit a gap in terms of training paradigm, online detection paradigm, and evaluation criteria when compared to the actual needs of real-world industrial systems. Firstly, current algorithms typically train a specific model for each individual time series. In a large-scale online system with tens of thousands of curves, maintaining such a multitude of models is impractical. The performance of using merely one single unified model to detect anomalies remains unknown. Secondly, most TSAD models are trained on the historical part of a time series and are tested on its future segment. In distributed systems, however, there are frequent system deployments and upgrades, with new, previously unseen time series emerging daily. The performance of testing newly incoming unseen time series on current TSAD algorithms remains unknown. Lastly, although some papers have conducted detailed surveys, the absence of an online evaluation platform prevents answering questions like \"Who is the best at anomaly detection at the current stage?\" In this paper, we propose TimeSeriesBench, an industrial-grade benchmark that we continuously maintain as a leaderboard. On this leaderboard, we assess the performance of existing algorithms across more than 168 evaluation settings combining different training and testing paradigms, evaluation metrics and datasets. Through our comprehensive analysis of the results, we provide recommendations for the future design of anomaly detection algorithms. To address known issues with existing public datasets, we release an industrial dataset to the public together with TimeSeriesBench. All code, data, and the online leaderboard have been made publicly available. ",

    "title": "Streaming Algorithms for Connectivity Augmentation",
    "abstract": "We study the $k$-connectivity augmentation problem ($k$-CAP) in the single-pass streaming model. Given a $(k-1)$-edge connected graph $G=(V,E)$ that is stored in memory, and a stream of weighted edges $L$ with weights in $\\{0,1,\\dots,W\\}$, the goal is to choose a minimum weight subset $L'\\subseteq L$ such that $G'=(V,E\\cup L')$ is $k$-edge connected. We give a $(2+\\epsilon)$-approximation algorithm for this problem which requires to store $O(\\epsilon^{-1} n\\log n)$ words. Moreover, we show our result is tight: Any algorithm with better than $2$-approximation for the problem requires $\\Omega(n^2)$ bits of space even when $k=2$. This establishes a gap between the optimal approximation factor one can obtain in the streaming vs the offline setting for $k$-CAP. We further consider a natural generalization to the fully streaming model where both $E$ and $L$ arrive in the stream in an arbitrary order. We show that this problem has a space lower bound that matches the best possible size of a spanner of the same approximation ratio. Following this, we give improved results for spanners on weighted graphs: We show a streaming algorithm that finds a $(2t-1+\\epsilon)$-approximate weighted spanner of size at most $O(\\epsilon^{-1} n^{1+1/t}\\log n)$ for integer $t$, whereas the best prior streaming algorithm for spanner on weighted graphs had size depending on $\\log W$. Using our spanner result, we provide an optimal $O(t)$-approximation for $k$-CAP in the fully streaming model with $O(nk + n^{1+1/t})$ words of space. Finally we apply our results to network design problems such as Steiner tree augmentation problem (STAP), $k$-edge connected spanning subgraph ($k$-ECSS), and the general Survivable Network Design problem (SNDP). In particular, we show a single-pass $O(t\\log k)$-approximation for SNDP using $O(kn^{1+1/t})$ words of space, where $k$ is the maximum connectivity requirement. ",

    "abstract": "Distributed training of deep neural networks faces three critical challenges: privacy preservation, communication efficiency, and robustness to fault and adversarial behaviors. Although significant research efforts have been devoted to addressing these challenges independently, their synthesis remains less explored. In this paper, we propose TernaryVote, which combines a ternary compressor and the majority vote mechanism to realize differential privacy, gradient compression, and Byzantine resilience simultaneously. We theoretically quantify the privacy guarantee through the lens of the emerging f-differential privacy (DP) and the Byzantine resilience of the proposed algorithm. Particularly, in terms of privacy guarantees, compared to the existing sign-based approach StoSign, the proposed method improves the dimension dependence on the gradient size and enjoys privacy amplification by mini-batch sampling while ensuring a comparable convergence rate. We also prove that TernaryVote is robust when less than 50% of workers are blind attackers, which matches that of SIGNSGD with majority vote. Extensive experimental results validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. ",

    "abstract": "We consider hypergraph network design problems where the goal is to construct a hypergraph that satisfies certain connectivity requirements. For graph network design problems where the goal is to construct a graph that satisfies certain connectivity requirements, the number of edges in every feasible solution is at most quadratic in the number of vertices. In contrast, for hypergraph network design problems, we might have feasible solutions in which the number of hyperedges is exponential in the number of vertices. This presents an additional technical challenge in hypergraph network design problems compared to graph network design problems: in order to solve the problem in polynomial time, we first need to show that there exists a feasible solution in which the number of hyperedges is polynomial in the input size. The central theme of this work is to show that certain hypergraph network design problems admit solutions in which the number of hyperedges is polynomial in the number of vertices and moreover, can be solved in strongly polynomial time. Our work improves on the previous fastest pseudo-polynomial run-time for these problems. In addition, we develop strongly polynomial time algorithms that return near-uniform hypergraphs as solutions (i.e., every pair of hyperedges differ in size by at most one). As applications of our results, we derive the first strongly polynomial time algorithms for (i) degree-specified hypergraph connectivity augmentation using hyperedges, (ii) degree-specified hypergraph node-to-area connectivity augmentation using hyperedges, and (iii) degree-constrained mixed-hypergraph connectivity augmentation using hyperedges.

    "abstract": "Mental health conditions, prevalent across various demographics, necessitate efficient monitoring to mitigate their adverse impacts on life quality. The surge in data-driven methodologies for mental health monitoring has underscored the importance of privacy-preserving techniques in handling sensitive health data. Despite strides in federated learning for mental health monitoring, existing approaches struggle with vulnerabilities to certain cyber-attacks and data insufficiency in real-world applications. In this paper, we introduce a differential private federated transfer learning framework for mental health monitoring to enhance data privacy and enrich data sufficiency. To accomplish this, we integrate federated learning with two pivotal elements: (1) differential privacy, achieved by introducing noise into the updates, and (2) transfer learning, employing a pre-trained universal model to adeptly address issues of data imbalance and insufficiency. We evaluate the framework by a case study on stress detection, employing a dataset of physiological and contextual data from a longitudinal study. Our finding show that the proposed approach can attain a 10% boost in accuracy and a 21% enhancement in recall, while ensuring privacy protection. ",

However, the Gabor-like filters learned by classical sparse coding far overpredict well-tuned simple cell receptive field profiles observed empirically. While neurons fire sparsely, neuronal populations are also organized in physical space by their sensitivity to certain features. In V1, this organization is a smooth progression of orientations along the cortical sheet. A number of subsequent models have either discarded the sparse dictionary learning framework entirely or whose updates have yet to take advantage of the surge in unrolled, neural dictionary learning architectures. A key missing theme of these updates is a stronger notion of \\emph{structured sparsity}. We propose an autoencoder architecture (WLSC) whose latent representations are implicitly, locally organized for spectral clustering through a Laplacian quadratic form of a bipartite graph, which generates a diverse set of artificial receptive fields that match primate data in V1 as faithfully as recent contrastive frameworks like Local Low Dimensionality, or LLD \\citep{lld} that discard sparse dictionary learning. By unifying sparse and smooth coding in models of the early visual cortex through our autoencoder, we also show that our regularization can be interpreted as early-stage specialization of receptive fields to certain classes of stimuli; that is, we induce a weak clustering bias for later stages of cortex where functional and spatial segregation (i.e. topography) are known to occur. The results show an imperative for \\emph{spatial regularization} of both the receptive fields and firing rates to begin to describe feature disentanglement in V1 and beyond. ",

However, being agnostic of the underlying energy landscape, the accuracy of such generative model may still be limited. In this work, we explore the few-shot setting of such pre-trained generative sampler which incorporates MD simulations in a tractable manner. Specifically, given a target protein of interest, we first acquire some seeding conformations from the pre-trained sampler followed by a number of physical simulations in parallel starting from these seeding samples.

However, due to the mixed data types and multimodalities prevalent in tabular data, the delicate equilibrium between the generator and discriminator, as well as the inherent instability of Wasserstein distance in high dimensions, WGAN often fails to produce high-fidelity samples. To this end, we propose POTNet (Penalized Optimal Transport Network), a generative deep neural network based on a novel, robust, and interpretable marginally-penalized Wasserstein (MPW) loss. POTNet can effectively model tabular data containing both categorical and continuous features. Moreover, it offers the flexibility to condition on a subset of features. We provide theoretical justifications for the motivation behind the MPW loss. We also empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method on four different benchmarks across a variety of real-world and simulated datasets.

This correspondence-informing supervision entails cost in annotation that requires significant specialised effort. This paper describes a semi-weakly-supervised registration pipeline that improves the model performance, when only a small corresponding-ROI-labelled dataset is available, by exploiting unlabelled image pairs. We examine two types of augmentation methods by perturbation on network weights and image resampling, such that consistency-based unsupervised losses can be applied on unlabelled data. The novel WarpDDF and RegCut approaches are proposed to allow commutative perturbation between an image pair and the predicted spatial transformation (i.e. respective input and output of registration networks), distinct from existing perturbation methods for classification or segmentation. Experiments using 589 male pelvic MR images, labelled with eight anatomical ROIs, show the improvement in registration performance and the ablated contributions from the individual strategies. Furthermore, this study attempts to construct one of the first computational atlases for pelvic structures, enabled by registering inter-subject MRs, and quantifies the significant differences due to the proposed semi-weak supervision with a discussion on the potential clinical use of example atlas-derived statistics.

Many existing prediction approaches focus on single-point predictions, lacking the depth needed for effective decision-making and often overlooking market risk. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel model, RAGIC, which introduces sequence generation for stock interval prediction to quantify uncertainty more effectively. Our approach leverages a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to produce future price sequences infused with randomness inherent in financial markets. RAGIC's generator includes a risk module, capturing the risk perception of informed investors, and a temporal module, accounting for historical price trends and seasonality. This multi-faceted generator informs the creation of risk-sensitive intervals through statistical inference, incorporating horizon-wise insights. The interval's width is carefully adjusted to reflect market volatility. Importantly, our approach relies solely on publicly available data and incurs only low computational overhead. RAGIC's evaluation across globally recognized broad-based indices demonstrates its balanced performance, offering both accuracy and informativeness. Achieving a consistent 95% coverage, RAGIC maintains a narrow interval width. This promising outcome suggests that our approach effectively addresses the challenges of stock market prediction while incorporating vital risk considerations. ",

The work described in this paper was developed within the framework of the European project HELICoiD (HypErspectraL Imaging Cancer Detection), which had as a main goal the application of hyperspectral imaging to the delineation of brain tumors in real-time during neurosurgical operations. In this paper, the methodology followed to generate the first hyperspectral database of in-vivo human brain tissues is presented. Data was acquired employing a customized hyperspectral acquisition system capable of capturing information in the Visual and Near InfraRed (VNIR) range from 400 to 1000 nm. Repeatability was assessed for the cases where two images of the same scene were captured consecutively. The analysis reveals that the system works more efficiently in the spectral range between 450 and 900 nm. A total of 36 hyperspectral images from 22 different patients were obtained. From these data, more than 300 000 spectral signatures were labeled employing a semi-automatic methodology based on the spectral angle mapper algorithm. Four different classes were defined: normal tissue, tumor tissue, blood vessel, and background elements. All the hyperspectral data has been made available in a public repository. ",
