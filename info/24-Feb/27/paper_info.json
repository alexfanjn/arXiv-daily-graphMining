    "abstract": "Finding Minimal Unsatisfiable Subsets (MUSes) of binary constraints is a common problem in infeasibility analysis of over-constrained systems. However, because of the exponential search space of the problem, enumerating MUSes is extremely time-consuming in real applications. In this work, we propose to prune formulas using a learned model to speed up MUS enumeration. We represent formulas as graphs and then develop a graph-based learning model to predict which part of the formula should be pruned. Importantly, our algorithm does not require data labeling by only checking the satisfiability of pruned formulas. It does not even require training data from the target application because it extrapolates to data with different distributions. In our experiments we combine our algorithm with existing MUS enumerators and validate its effectiveness in multiple benchmarks including a set of real-world problems outside our training distribution. The experiment results show that our method significantly accelerates MUS enumeration on average on these benchmark problems. ",

    "abstract": "Email continues to be a pivotal and extensively utilized communication medium within professional and commercial domains. Nonetheless, the prevalence of spam emails poses a significant challenge for users, disrupting their daily routines and diminishing productivity. Consequently, accurately identifying and filtering spam based on content has become crucial for cybersecurity. Recent advancements in natural language processing, particularly with large language models like ChatGPT, have shown remarkable performance in tasks such as question answering and text generation. However, its potential in spam identification remains underexplored. To fill in the gap, this study attempts to evaluate ChatGPT's capabilities for spam identification in both English and Chinese email datasets. We employ ChatGPT for spam email detection using in-context learning, which requires a prompt instruction and a few demonstrations. We also investigate how the training example size affects the performance of ChatGPT. For comparison, we also implement five popular benchmark methods, including naive Bayes, support vector machines (SVM), logistic regression (LR), feedforward dense neural networks (DNN), and BERT classifiers. Though extensive experiments, the performance of ChatGPT is significantly worse than deep supervised learning methods in the large English dataset, while it presents superior performance on the low-resourced Chinese dataset, even outperforming BERT in this case.

    "abstract": "Grokking, or delayed generalization, is a phenomenon where generalization in a deep neural network (DNN) occurs long after achieving near zero training error. Previous studies have reported the occurrence of grokking in specific controlled settings, such as DNNs initialized with large-norm parameters or transformers trained on algorithmic datasets. We demonstrate that grokking is actually much more widespread and materializes in a wide range of practical settings, such as training of a convolutional neural network (CNN) on CIFAR10 or a Resnet on Imagenette. We introduce the new concept of delayed robustness, whereby a DNN groks adversarial examples and becomes robust, long after interpolation and/or generalization. We develop an analytical explanation for the emergence of both delayed generalization and delayed robustness based on a new measure of the local complexity of a DNN's input-output mapping. Our local complexity measures the density of the so-called 'linear regions' (aka, spline partition regions) that tile the DNN input space, and serves as a utile progress measure for training. We provide the first evidence that for classification problems, the linear regions undergo a phase transition during training whereafter they migrate away from the training samples (making the DNN mapping smoother there) and towards the decision boundary (making the DNN mapping less smooth there). Grokking occurs post phase transition as a robust partition of the input space emerges thanks to the linearization of the DNN mapping around the training points.

    "title": "Fast Adversarial Attacks on Language Models In One GPU Minute",
    "abstract": "In this paper, we introduce a novel class of fast, beam search-based adversarial attack (BEAST) for Language Models (LMs). BEAST employs interpretable parameters, enabling attackers to balance between attack speed, success rate, and the readability of adversarial prompts. The computational efficiency of BEAST facilitates us to investigate its applications on LMs for jailbreaking, eliciting hallucinations, and privacy attacks. Our gradient-free targeted attack can jailbreak aligned LMs with high attack success rates within one minute. For instance, BEAST can jailbreak Vicuna-7B-v1.5 under one minute with a success rate of 89% when compared to a gradient-based baseline that takes over an hour to achieve 70% success rate using a single Nvidia RTX A6000 48GB GPU. Additionally, we discover a unique outcome wherein our untargeted attack induces hallucinations in LM chatbots. Through human evaluations, we find that our untargeted attack causes Vicuna-7B-v1.5 to produce ~15% more incorrect outputs when compared to LM outputs in the absence of our attack. We also learn that 22% of the time, BEAST causes Vicuna to generate outputs that are not relevant to the original prompt. Further, we use BEAST to generate adversarial prompts in a few seconds that can boost the performance of existing membership inference attacks for LMs. We believe that our fast attack, BEAST, has the potential to accelerate research in LM security and privacy.

Observations from different angles enable the recovery of 3D object states from 2D image inputs if we can identify the same instance in different input frames. However, the dynamic nature of autonomous driving scenes leads to significant changes in the appearance and shape of each instance captured by the camera at different time steps. To this end, we propose a novel contrastive learning algorithm, Cohere3D, to learn coherent instance representations in a long-term input sequence robust to the change in distance and perspective. The learned representation aids in instance-level correspondence across multiple input frames in downstream tasks. In the pretraining stage, the raw point clouds from LiDAR sensors are utilized to construct the long-term temporal correspondence for each instance, which serves as guidance for the extraction of instance-level representation from the vision-based bird's eye-view (BEV) feature map. Cohere3D encourages a consistent representation for the same instance at different frames but distinguishes between representations of different instances. We evaluate our algorithm by finetuning the pretrained model on various downstream perception, prediction, and planning tasks.

    "abstract": "Achieving resiliency against adversarial attacks is necessary prior to deploying neural network classifiers in domains where misclassification incurs substantial costs, e.g., self-driving cars or medical imaging. Recent work has demonstrated that robustness can be transferred from an adversarially trained teacher to a student model using knowledge distillation. However, current methods perform distillation using a single adversarial and vanilla teacher and consider homogeneous architectures (i.e., residual networks) that are susceptible to misclassify examples from similar adversarial subspaces. In this work, we develop a defense framework against adversarial attacks by distilling adversarial robustness using heterogeneous teachers (DARHT). In DARHT, the student model explicitly represents teacher logits in a student-teacher feature map and leverages multiple teachers that exhibit low adversarial example transferability (i.e., exhibit high performance on dissimilar adversarial examples). Experiments on classification tasks in both white-box and black-box scenarios demonstrate that DARHT achieves state-of-the-art clean and robust accuracies when compared to competing adversarial training and distillation methods in the CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny ImageNet datasets. Comparisons with homogeneous and heterogeneous teacher sets suggest that leveraging teachers with low adversarial example transferability increases student model robustness. ",

By writing a configuration in IaC languages such as CloudFormation, users can declaratively specify their infrastructure and CloudFormation will handle the creation of the resources. However, understanding the complexity of IaC deployments has emerged as an unsolved issue. In particular, estimating the cost of an IaC deployment requires estimating the future usage and pricing models of every cloud resource in the deployment. Gaining transparency into predicted usage/costs is a leading challenge in cloud management. Existing work either relies on historical usage metrics to predict cost or on coarse-grain static analysis that ignores interactions between resources. Our key insight is that the topology of an IaC deployment imposes constraints on the usage of each resource, and we can formalize and automate the reasoning on constraints by using an SMT solver. This allows customers to have formal guarantees on the bounds of their cloud usage. We propose a tool for fine-grained static usage analysis that works by modeling the inter-resource interactions in an IaC deployment as a set of SMT constraints, and evaluate our tool on a benchmark of over 1000 real world IaC configurations.

    "abstract": "In-context learning has become a popular paradigm in natural language processing. However, its performance can be significantly influenced by the order of in-context demonstration examples. In this paper, we found that causal language models (CausalLMs) are more sensitive to this order compared to prefix language models (PrefixLMs). We attribute this phenomenon to the auto-regressive attention masks within CausalLMs, which restrict each token from accessing information from subsequent tokens. This results in different receptive fields for samples at different positions, thereby leading to representation disparities across positions. To tackle this challenge, we introduce an unsupervised fine-tuning method, termed the Information-Augmented and Consistency-Enhanced approach. This approach utilizes contrastive learning to align representations of in-context examples across different positions and introduces a consistency loss to ensure similar representations for inputs with different permutations. This enhances the model's predictive consistency across permutations. Experimental results on four benchmarks suggest that our proposed method can reduce the sensitivity to the order of in-context examples and exhibit robust generalizability, particularly when demonstrations are sourced from a pool different from that used in the training phase, or when the number of in-context examples differs from what is used during training.

    "abstract": "While convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have achieved success in computer vision tasks, it is vulnerable to backdoor attacks. Such attacks could mislead the victim model to make attacker-chosen prediction with a specific trigger pattern. Until now, the trigger injection of existing attacks is mainly limited to spatial domain. Recent works take advantage of perceptual properties of planting specific patterns in the frequency domain, which only reflect indistinguishable pixel-wise perturbations in pixel domain. However, in the black-box setup, the inaccessibility of training process often renders more complex trigger designs. Existing frequency attacks simply handcraft the magnitude of spectrum, introducing anomaly frequency disparities between clean and poisoned data and taking risks of being removed by image processing operations (such as lossy compression and filtering). In this paper, we propose a robust low-frequency black-box backdoor attack (LFBA), which minimally perturbs low-frequency components of frequency spectrum and maintains the perceptual similarity in spatial space simultaneously. The key insight of our attack restrict the search for the optimal trigger to low-frequency region that can achieve high attack effectiveness, robustness against image transformation defenses and stealthiness in dual space. We utilize simulated annealing (SA), a form of evolutionary algorithm, to optimize the properties of frequency trigger including the number of manipulated frequency bands and the perturbation of each frequency component, without relying on the knowledge from the victim classifier. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets verify the effectiveness and robustness of LFBA against image processing operations and the state-of-the-art backdoor defenses, as well as its inherent stealthiness in both spatial and frequency space, making it resilient against frequency inspection.

Despite their great success, current NO-based solutions face important challenges when dealing with spatio-temporal PDEs over long time scales. Specifically, the current theory of NOs does not present a systematic framework to perform data assimilation and efficiently correct the evolution of PDE solutions over time based on sparsely sampled noisy measurements. In this paper, we propose a learning-based state-space approach to compute the solution operators to infinite-dimensional semilinear PDEs. Exploiting the structure of semilinear PDEs and the theory of nonlinear observers in function spaces, we develop a flexible recursive method that allows for both prediction and data assimilation by combining prediction and correction operations. The proposed framework is capable of producing fast and accurate predictions over long time horizons, dealing with irregularly sampled noisy measurements to correct the solution, and benefits from the decoupling between the spatial and temporal dynamics of this class of PDEs. We show through experiments on the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky, Navier-Stokes and Korteweg-de Vries equations that the proposed model is robust to noise and can leverage arbitrary amounts of measurements to correct its prediction over a long time horizon with little computational overhead.

In this paper, we propose a code generation algorithm from HCSP to C with POSIX library for concurrency. The main difficulties include how to bridge the gap between the synchronized communication model in HCSP and the use of mutexes for synchronization in C, and how to discretize evolution along ODEs and support interrupt of ODE evolution by communication. To prove the correctness of code generation, we define a formal semantics for POSIX C, and build transition system models for both HCSP and C programs. We then define an approximate bisimulation relation between traces of transition systems, and show that under certain robustness conditions for HCSP, the generated C program is approximately bisimilar to the original model.

    "abstract": "Amidst growing uncertainty and frequent restructurings, the impacts of employee exits are becoming one of the central concerns for organizations. Using rich communication data from a large holding company, we examine the effects of employee departures on socialization networks among the remaining coworkers. Specifically, we investigate how network metrics change among people who historically interacted with departing employees. We find evidence of ``breakdown\" in communication among the remaining coworkers, who tend to become less connected with fewer interactions after their coworkers' departure. This effect appears to be moderated by both external factors, such as periods of high organizational stress, and internal factors, such as the characteristics of the departing employee. At the external level, periods of high stress correspond to greater communication breakdown; at the internal level, however, we find patterns suggesting individuals may end up better positioned in their networks after a network neighbor's departure. Overall, our study provides critical insights into managing workforce changes and preserving communication dynamics in the face of employee exits. ",

    "abstract": "Anchor-based methods are a pivotal approach in handling clustering of large-scale data. However, these methods typically entail two distinct stages: selecting anchor points and constructing an anchor graph. This bifurcation, along with the initialization of anchor points, significantly influences the overall performance of the algorithm. To mitigate these issues, we introduce a novel method termed Anchor-free Clustering based on Anchor Graph Factorization (AFCAGF). AFCAGF innovates in learning the anchor graph, requiring only the computation of pairwise distances between samples. This process, achievable through straightforward optimization, circumvents the necessity for explicit selection of anchor points. More concretely, our approach enhances the Fuzzy k-means clustering algorithm (FKM), introducing a new manifold learning technique that obviates the need for initializing cluster centers. Additionally, we evolve the concept of the membership matrix between cluster centers and samples in FKM into an anchor graph encompassing multiple anchor points and samples. Employing Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) on this anchor graph allows for the direct derivation of cluster labels, thereby eliminating the requirement for further post-processing steps. To solve the method proposed, we implement an alternating optimization algorithm that ensures convergence. Empirical evaluations on various real-world datasets underscore the superior efficacy of our algorithm compared to traditional approaches. ",

One of the most important directions for boosting the performance of automatic ICD coding is modeling ICD code relations. However, current methods insufficiently model the intricate relationships among ICD codes and often overlook the importance of context in clinical notes. In this paper, we propose a novel approach, a contextualized and flexible framework, to enhance the learning of ICD code representations. Our approach, unlike existing methods, employs a dependent learning paradigm that considers the context of clinical notes in modeling all possible code relations. We evaluate our approach on six public ICD coding datasets and the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach compared to state-of-the-art baselines. ",

    "abstract": "Clustering in dynamic environments is of increasing importance, with broad applications ranging from real-time data analysis and online unsupervised learning to dynamic facility location problems. While meta-heuristics have shown promising effectiveness in static clustering tasks, their application for tracking optimal clustering solutions or robust clustering over time in dynamic environments remains largely underexplored. This is partly due to a lack of dynamic datasets with diverse, controllable, and realistic dynamic characteristics, hindering systematic performance evaluations of clustering algorithms in various dynamic scenarios. This deficiency leads to a gap in our understanding and capability to effectively design algorithms for clustering in dynamic environments. To bridge this gap, this paper introduces the Dynamic Dataset Generator (DDG). DDG features multiple dynamic Gaussian components integrated with a range of heterogeneous, local, and global changes. These changes vary in spatial and temporal severity, patterns, and domain of influence, providing a comprehensive tool for simulating a wide range of dynamic scenarios. ",

    "abstract": "Conventional tracking paradigm takes in instantaneous measurements such as range and bearing, and produces object tracks across time. In applications such as autonomous driving, lidar measurements in the form of point clouds are usually passed through a \"virtual sensor\" realized by a deep learning model, to produce \"measurements\" such as bounding boxes, which are in turn ingested by a tracking module to produce object tracks. Very often multiple lidar sweeps are accumulated in a buffer to merge and become the input to the virtual sensor. We argue in this paper that such an input already contains temporal information, and therefore the virtual sensor output should also contain temporal information, not just instantaneous values for the time corresponding to the end of the buffer. In particular, we present the deep learning model called MULti-Sweep PAired Detector (MULSPAD) that produces, for each detected object, a pair of bounding boxes at both the end time and the beginning time of the input buffer. This is achieved with fairly straightforward changes in commonly used lidar detection models, and with only marginal extra processing, but the resulting symmetry is satisfying. Such paired detections make it possible not only to construct rudimentary trackers fairly easily, but also to construct more sophisticated trackers that can exploit the extra information conveyed by the pair and be robust to choices of motion models and object birth/death models. We have conducted preliminary training and experimentation using Waymo Open Dataset, which shows the efficacy of our proposed method. ",

However, enabling robots to reason similarly is non-trivial. Existing methods for physical reasoning are data-hungry and struggle with complexity and uncertainty inherent in the real world. This paper presents PhyPlan, a novel physics-informed planning framework that combines physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) with modified Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to enable embodied agents to perform dynamic physical tasks. PhyPlan leverages PINNs to simulate and predict outcomes of actions in a fast and accurate manner and uses MCTS for planning. It dynamically determines whether to consult a PINN-based simulator (coarse but fast) or engage directly with the actual environment (fine but slow) to determine optimal policy. Evaluation with robots in simulated 3D environments demonstrates the ability of our approach to solve 3D-physical reasoning tasks involving the composition of dynamic skills. Quantitatively, PhyPlan excels in several aspects: (i) it achieves lower regret when learning novel tasks compared to state-of-the-art, (ii) it expedites skill learning and enhances the speed of physical reasoning, (iii) it demonstrates higher data efficiency compared to a physics un-informed approach.

Specifically, it uses code transformation techniques to generate new code candidates first and then selects important ones as the training data by importance metrics. To evaluate the effectiveness of GenCode with a general importance metric -- loss value, we conduct experiments on four code understanding tasks (e.g., code clone detection) and three pre-trained code models (e.g., CodeT5).

Pinpointing performance bottlenecks and understanding the underlying causes of program performance issues are critical tasks to make the most of hardware resources. We provide an in-depth overview of performance bottlenecks in recent OoO microarchitectures and describe the difficulties of detecting them. Techniques that measure resources utilization can offer a good understanding of a program's execution, but, due to the constraints inherent to Performance Monitoring Units (PMU) of CPUs, do not provide the relevant metrics for each use case. Another approach is to rely on a performance model to simulate the CPU behavior. Such a model makes it possible to implement any new microarchitecture-related metric. Within this framework, we advocate for implementing modeled resources as parameters that can be varied at will to reveal performance bottlenecks. This allows a generalization of bottleneck analysis that we call sensitivity analysis. We present Gus, a novel performance analysis tool that combines the advantages of sensitivity analysis and dynamic binary instrumentation within a resource-centric CPU model. We evaluate the impact of sensitivity on bottleneck analysis over a set of high-performance computing kernels. ",

Accurately determining the Szone radius requires the precise location of the user equipment (UE) and data base stations (DBSs). Even a slight error in reported positions of DBSs or UE will lead to an incorrect determination of Szone radius and UE-DBS pairing, leading to degradation of the UE-DBS communication link. To compensate for the positioning error impact and improve the ASE and EE of the UCUDN, this work proposes a data-driven optimization and error compensation (DD-OEC) framework. The framework comprises an additional machine learning model that assesses the impact of residual errors and regulates the erroneous datadriven optimization to output Szone radius, transmit power, and DBS density values which improve network ASE and EE. The performance of the framework is compared to a baseline scheme, which does not employ the residual, and results demonstrate that the DD-OEC framework outperforms the baseline, achieving up to a 23% improvement in performance.

However, several studies have shown serious security flaws in that method, which makes the privacy and security concerns of SWDs particularly urgent. Gait identification is well suited for SWDs because its built-in sensors can provide data support for identification. However, existing gait identification methods have low accuracy and neglect to protect the privacy of gait features. In addition, the SWD can be used as an internet of things device for users to share data. But few studies have used gait feature-based encryption schemes to protect the privacy of message interactions between SWDs and other devices. In this paper, we propose a gait identification network, a bi-directional long short-term memory network with an attention mechanism (ABLSTM), to improve the identification accuracy and a stochastic orthogonal transformation (SOT) scheme to protect the extracted gait features from leakage. In the experiments, ABLSTM achieves an accuracy of 95.28%, reducing previous error rate by 19.3%. The SOT scheme is proved to be resistant to the chosen plaintext attack (CPA) and is 30% faster than previous methods. A biometric-based encryption scheme is proposed to enable secure message interactions using gait features as keys after the gait identification stage is passed, and offers better protection of the gait features compared to previous schemes.

We approach this defensive strategy with utmost caution, operating in an environment where the defender possesses significantly less information compared to the attacker. Specifically, the defender is unable to utilize any data samples for training a defense model or verifying the integrity of the channel. Instead, the defender relies exclusively on a set of pre-existing detectors readily available ``off the shelf''. To tackle this challenge, we derive an innovative information-theoretic defense approach that optimally aggregates the decisions made by these detectors, eliminating the need for any training data. We further explore a practical use-case scenario for empirical evaluation, where the attacker possesses a pre-trained classifier and launches well-known adversarial attacks against it. Our experiments highlight the effectiveness of our proposed solution, even in scenarios that deviate from the optimal setup. ",

Furthermore, there is a lack of substantive research on the robustness of LLMs to various perturbations in the input prompts. The contributions of this paper are three-fold. First, we show that fine-tuning sufficiently large LLMs can produce IC-SF performance comparable to discriminative models. Next, we systematically analyze the performance deterioration of those fine-tuned models due to three distinct yet relevant types of input perturbations - oronyms, synonyms, and paraphrasing. Finally, we propose an efficient mitigation approach, Prompt Perturbation Consistency Learning (PPCL), which works by regularizing the divergence between losses from clean and perturbed samples. Our experiments demonstrate that PPCL can recover on average 59% and 69% of the performance drop for IC and SF tasks, respectively. Furthermore, PPCL beats the data augmentation approach while using ten times fewer augmented data samples. ",

However, the current content search mechanism in NDN is complex and slow. This mechanism not only creates congestion but also hinders practical deployment due to its slowness and cumbersome nature. To address this issue, we propose a methodology, called BalanceDN, that distributes content through the network such that sought content can be found quickly. BalanceDN uses a distributed allocation of resolvers as those used by the domain name system but differs in how content is distributed. Our approach avoids flooding the network with pending interest requests and also eliminates the need for blind search when the location of content is unknown. We tested our approach on ndnSIM; a simulation platform for NDN. The results show that the proposed routing scheme utilizes far fewer network resources compared to the NDN network when retrieving content. The proposed scheme accomplishes this performance gain by leveraging a load-balanced hashing mechanism to distribute and locate the name of the content on the distributed nameserver lookup service nodes.

One promising approach involves using differentiable neural renderers to facilitate adversarial camouflage optimization through gradient back-propagation. However, existing methods often struggle to capture environmental characteristics during the rendering process or produce adversarial textures that can precisely map to the target vehicle, resulting in suboptimal attack performance. Moreover, these approaches neglect diverse weather conditions, reducing the efficacy of generated camouflage across varying weather scenarios. To tackle these challenges, we propose a robust and accurate camouflage generation method, namely RAUCA. The core of RAUCA is a novel neural rendering component, Neural Renderer Plus (NRP), which can accurately project vehicle textures and render images with environmental characteristics such as lighting and weather. In addition, we integrate a multi-weather dataset for camouflage generation, leveraging the NRP to enhance the attack robustness. Experimental results on six popular object detectors show that RAUCA consistently outperforms existing methods in both simulation and real-world settings. ",

The resulting neural network has only logarithmic depth (alleviating the degradation of data as it propagates through the network) and can process sequences in linear time (or in logarithmic time with a linear number of processors). The crucial property of FENs is that they learn by training a quasi-linear number of constant-depth neural networks in parallel. The fact that these networks are constant depth means that backpropagation works well. We note that currently the performance of FENs is only conjectured as we are yet to implement them. ",

    "abstract": "Coronary artery disease (CAD) stands as the leading cause of death worldwide, and invasive coronary angiography (ICA) remains the gold standard for assessing vascular anatomical information. However, deep learning-based methods encounter challenges in generating semantic labels for arterial segments, primarily due to the morphological similarity between arterial branches. To address this challenge, we model the vascular tree as a graph and propose a multi-graph graph matching (MGM) algorithm for coronary artery semantic labeling. The MGM algorithm assesses the similarity between arterials in multiple vascular tree graphs, taking into account the cycle consistency between each pair of graphs. This ensures that unannotated arterial segments are appropriately labeled by matching them with annotated segments. Through the incorporation of anatomical graph structure, radiomics features, and semantic mapping, the proposed MGM model achieves an impressive accuracy of 0.9471 for coronary artery semantic labeling. This approach presents a novel tool for coronary artery analysis using ICA videos, offering valuable insights into vascular health and pathology. ",

In this paper, we propose an efficient split federated learning algorithm (ESFL) to take full advantage of the powerful computing capabilities at a central server under a split federated learning framework with heterogeneous end devices (EDs). By splitting the model into different submodels between the server and EDs, our approach jointly optimizes user-side workload and server-side computing resource allocation by considering users' heterogeneity. We formulate the whole optimization problem as a mixed-integer non-linear program, which is an NP-hard problem, and develop an iterative approach to obtain an approximate solution efficiently.

Therefore, the optimization of these devices is essential in precision agriculture. Recently, with the advancements of deep learning, there have been several studies aiming to harness its capabilities for improving spray system performance. However, the effectiveness of these methods heavily depends on the size of the training dataset, which is expensive and time-consuming to collect. To address the challenge of insufficient training samples, this paper proposes an alternative solution by generating artificial images of droplets using generative adversarial networks (GAN). The GAN model is trained by using a small dataset captured by a high-speed camera and capable of generating images with progressively increasing resolution. The results demonstrate that the model can generate high-quality images with the size of $1024\\times1024$. Furthermore, this research leverages recent advancements in computer vision and deep learning to develop a light droplet detector using the synthetic dataset. As a result, the detection model achieves a 16.06\\% increase in mean average precision (mAP) when utilizing the synthetic dataset. To the best of our knowledge, this work stands as the first to employ a generative model for augmenting droplet detection. Its significance lies not only in optimizing nozzle design for constructing efficient spray systems but also in addressing the common challenge of insufficient data in various precision agriculture tasks. This work offers a critical contribution to conserving resources while striving for optimal and sustainable agricultural practices. ",

Unfortunately, recent work has shown that such models are susceptible to automated jailbreak attacks that induce them to generate harmful content. More recent LLMs often incorporate an additional layer of defense, a Guard Model, which is a second LLM that is designed to check and moderate the output response of the primary LLM. Our key contribution is to show a novel attack strategy, PRP, that is successful against several open-source (e.g., Llama 2) and closed-source (e.g., GPT 3.5) implementations of Guard Models. PRP leverages a two step prefix-based attack that operates by (a) constructing a universal adversarial prefix for the Guard Model, and (b) propagating this prefix to the response. We find that this procedure is effective across multiple threat models, including ones in which the adversary has no access to the Guard Model at all. Our work suggests that further advances are required on defenses and Guard Models before they can be considered effective. ",

Such integration not only broadens the captured scene but also augments holistic perception in computer vision applications. Given a pair of captured images, subtle perturbations and distortions which go unnoticed by the human visual system tend to attack the correspondence matching, impairing the performance of image stitching algorithms. In light of this challenge, this paper presents the first attempt to improve the robustness of image stitching against adversarial attacks. Specifically, we introduce a stitching-oriented attack~(SoA), tailored to amplify the alignment loss within overlapping regions, thereby targeting the feature matching procedure. To establish an attack resistant model, we delve into the robustness of stitching architecture and develop an adaptive adversarial training~(AAT) to balance attack resistance with stitching precision. In this way, we relieve the gap between the routine adversarial training and benign models, ensuring resilience without quality compromise. Comprehensive evaluation across real-world and synthetic datasets validate the deterioration of SoA on stitching performance. Furthermore, AAT emerges as a more robust solution against adversarial perturbations, delivering superior stitching results. Code is available at:https://github.com/Jzy2017/TRIS. ",

Recently, a novel multi-compartment spiking neuron model, namely the Two-Compartment LIF (TC-LIF) model, has been proposed and exhibited a remarkable capacity for sequential modelling. However, training the TC-LIF model presents challenges stemming from the large memory consumption and the issue of gradient vanishing associated with the Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT) algorithm. To address these challenges, online learning methodologies emerge as a promising solution. Yet, to date, the application of online learning methods in SNNs has been predominantly confined to simplified Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) neuron models. In this paper, we present a novel online learning method specifically tailored for networks of TC-LIF neurons. Additionally, we propose a refined TC-LIF neuron model called Adaptive TC-LIF, which is carefully designed to enhance temporal information integration in online learning scenarios. Extensive experiments, conducted on various sequential benchmarks, demonstrate that our approach successfully preserves the superior sequential modeling capabilities of the TC-LIF neuron while incorporating the training efficiency and hardware friendliness of online learning.

However, the overwhelming upload traffic may lead to unacceptable uploading time. To tackle this issue, for tasks taking environmental data as input, the data perceived by roadside units (RSU) equipped with several sensors can be directly exploited for computation, resulting in a novel task offloading paradigm with integrated communications, sensing and computing (I-CSC). With this paradigm, vehicles can select to upload their sensed data to RSUs or transmit computing instructions to RSUs during the offloading. By optimizing the computation mode and network resources, in this paper, we investigate an I-CSC-based task offloading problem to reduce the cost caused by resource consumption while guaranteeing the latency of each task. Although this non-convex problem can be handled by the alternating minimization (AM) algorithm that alternatively minimizes the divided four sub-problems, it leads to high computational complexity and local optimal solution. To tackle this challenge, we propose a creative structural knowledge-driven meta-learning (SKDML) method, involving both the model-based AM algorithm and neural networks. Specifically, borrowing the iterative structure of the AM algorithm, also referred to as structural knowledge, the proposed SKDML adopts long short-term memory (LSTM) network-based meta-learning to learn an adaptive optimizer for updating variables in each sub-problem, instead of the handcrafted counterpart in the AM algorithm.

However, the current literature does not comprehensively discuss this problem, nor does it provide realistic datasets that encompass actual graph structures, anomaly labels, and sensitive attributes for research in FairGAD.

Recent studies found that attaching suffixes to harmful instructions can hack the defense of LLMs and lead to dangerous outputs. This method, while effective, leaves a gap in understanding the underlying mechanics of such adversarial suffix due to the non-readability and it can be relatively easily seen through by common defense methods such as perplexity filters.To cope with this challenge, in this paper, we propose an Adversarial Suffixes Embedding Translation Framework(ASETF) that are able to translate the unreadable adversarial suffixes into coherent, readable text, which makes it easier to understand and analyze the reasons behind harmful content generation by large language models. We conducted experiments on LLMs such as LLaMa2, Vicuna and using the Advbench dataset's harmful instructions. The results indicate that our method achieves a much better attack success rate to existing techniques, while significantly enhancing the textual fluency of the prompts. In addition, our approach can be generalized into a broader method for generating transferable adversarial suffixes that can successfully attack multiple LLMs, even black-box LLMs, such as ChatGPT and Gemini. As a result, the prompts generated through our method exhibit enriched semantic diversity, which potentially provides more adversarial examples for LLM defense methods. ",

Our extensive evaluation including ablation study manifests the efficacy of using JSM for model debugging and interpretation, while significantly enhancing model accuracy as well. ",

    "abstract": "Some mechanical systems, that are modeled to have inelastic collisions, nonetheless possess energy-conserving intermittent-contact solutions, known as collisionless solutions. Such a solution, representing a persistent hopping or walking across a level ground, may be important for understanding animal locomotion or for designing efficient walking machines. So far, collisionless motion has been analytically studied in simple two degrees of freedom (DOF) systems, or in a system that decouples into 2-DOF subsystems in the harmonic approximation. In this paper we extend the consideration to a N-DOF system, recovering the known solutions as a special N = 2 case of the general formulation. We show that in the harmonic approximation the collisionless solution is determined by the spectrum of the system. We formulate a solution existence condition, which requires the presence of at least one oscillating normal mode in the most constrained phase of the motion. An application of the developed general framework is illustrated by finding a collisionless solution for a rocking motion of a biped with an armed standing torso. ",

    "abstract": "Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) has exhibited remarkable potential in improving graph-based clustering. To handle the general clustering scenario without a prior graph, these models estimate an initial graph beforehand to apply GCN. Throughout the literature, we have witnessed that 1) most models focus on the initial graph while neglecting the original features. Therefore, the discriminability of the learned representation may be corrupted by a low-quality initial graph; 2) the training procedure lacks effective clustering guidance, which may lead to the incorporation of clustering-irrelevant information into the learned graph. To tackle these problems, the Deep Contrastive Graph Learning (DCGL) model is proposed for general data clustering. Specifically, we establish a pseudo-siamese network, which incorporates auto-encoder with GCN to emphasize both the graph structure and the original features. On this basis, feature-level contrastive learning is introduced to enhance the discriminative capacity, and the relationship between samples and centroids is employed as the clustering-oriented guidance. Afterward, a two-branch graph learning mechanism is designed to extract the local and global structural relationships, which are further embedded into a unified graph under the cluster-level contrastive guidance. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of DCGL against state-of-the-art algorithms. ",

However, the current OWOD formulation heavily relies on the external human oracle for knowledge input during the incremental learning stages. Such reliance on run-time makes this formulation less realistic in a real-world deployment. To address this, we introduce a more realistic formulation, named semi-supervised open-world detection (SS-OWOD), that reduces the annotation cost by casting the incremental learning stages of OWOD in a semi-supervised manner. We demonstrate that the performance of the state-of-the-art OWOD detector dramatically deteriorates in the proposed SS-OWOD setting. Therefore, we introduce a novel SS-OWOD detector, named SS-OWFormer, that utilizes a feature-alignment scheme to better align the object query representations between the original and augmented images to leverage the large unlabeled and few labeled data. We further introduce a pseudo-labeling scheme for unknown detection that exploits the inherent capability of decoder object queries to capture object-specific information. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our SS-OWOD problem setting and approach for remote sensing object detection, proposing carefully curated splits and baseline performance evaluations.

Recent advancements in heterogeneous graph neural networks (HGNNs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance by considering relation heterogeneity and using specialized message functions and aggregation rules. However, existing frameworks for heterogeneous graph learning have limitations in generalizing across diverse heterogeneous graph datasets. Most of these frameworks follow the \"pre-train\" and \"fine-tune\" paradigm on the same dataset, which restricts their capacity to adapt to new and unseen data. This raises the question: \"Can we generalize heterogeneous graph models to be well-adapted to diverse downstream learning tasks with distribution shifts in both node token sets and relation type heterogeneity?'' To tackle those challenges, we propose HiGPT, a general large graph model with Heterogeneous graph instruction-tuning paradigm. Our framework enables learning from arbitrary heterogeneous graphs without the need for any fine-tuning process from downstream datasets. To handle distribution shifts in heterogeneity, we introduce an in-context heterogeneous graph tokenizer that captures semantic relationships in different heterogeneous graphs, facilitating model adaptation. We incorporate a large corpus of heterogeneity-aware graph instructions into our HiGPT, enabling the model to effectively comprehend complex relation heterogeneity and distinguish between various types of graph tokens. Furthermore, we introduce the Mixture-of-Thought (MoT) instruction augmentation paradigm to mitigate data scarcity by generating diverse and informative instructions.

    "abstract": "BGP is the de facto inter-domain routing protocol to ensure global connectivity of the Internet. However, various reasons, such as deliberate attacks or misconfigurations, could cause BGP routing anomalies. Traditional methods for BGP routing anomaly detection require significant manual investigation of routes by network operators. Although machine learning has been applied to automate the process, prior arts typically impose significant training overhead (such as large-scale data labeling and feature crafting), and only produce uninterpretable results. To address these limitations, this paper presents a routing anomaly detection system centering around a novel network representation learning model named BEAM. The core design of BEAM is to accurately learn the unique properties (defined as \\emph{routing role}) of each Autonomous System (AS) in the Internet by incorporating BGP semantics. As a result, routing anomaly detection, given BEAM, is reduced to a matter of discovering unexpected routing role churns upon observing new route announcements. We implement a prototype of our routing anomaly detection system and extensively evaluate its performance. The experimental results, based on 18 real-world RouteViews datasets containing over 11 billion route announcement records, demonstrate that our system can detect all previously-confirmed routing anomalies, while only introducing at most five false alarms every 180 million route announcements. We also deploy our system at a large ISP to perform real-world detection for one month. During the course of deployment, our system detects 497 true anomalies in the wild with an average of only 1.65 false alarms per day. ",

In FedFDP, we devise a fairness-aware clipping strategy to achieve differential privacy while adjusting fairness. Additionally, for the extra uploaded loss values, we present an adaptive clipping approach to maximize utility.

Major automobile manufacturers, including Volvo, Mercedes-Benz, and Tesla, have progressively introduced products ranging from assisted-driving vehicles to semi-autonomous vehicles. However, this period has also witnessed several traffic safety incidents involving self-driving vehicles. For instance, in March 2016, a Google self-driving car was involved in a minor collision with a bus. At the time of the accident, the autonomous vehicle was attempting to merge into the right lane but failed to dynamically respond to the real-time environmental information during the lane change. It incorrectly assumed that the approaching bus would slow down to avoid it, leading to a low-speed collision with the bus. This incident highlights the current technological shortcomings and safety concerns associated with autonomous lane-changing behavior, despite the rapid advancements in autonomous driving technology. Lane-changing is among the most common and hazardous behaviors in highway driving, significantly impacting traffic safety and flow. Therefore, lane-changing is crucial for traffic safety, and accurately predicting drivers' lane change intentions can markedly enhance driving safety. This paper introduces a deep learning-based prediction method for autonomous driving lane change behavior, aiming to facilitate safe lane changes and thereby improve road safety. ",

The system employs static taint analysis to address web security issues on mobile terminal platforms to ensure detection coverage. It integrates rules pertaining to page handler control logic within the taint detection process to improve its extensibility. We also implemented a post-processing step with the assistance of large language models to enhance accuracy and reduce the need for manual analysis.

While the incorporation of multimodal information could enhance the interpretability of these systems, current multimodal models represent users and items utilizing entangled numerical vectors, rendering them arduous to interpret. To address this, we propose a Disentangled Graph Variational Auto-Encoder (DGVAE) that aims to enhance both model and recommendation interpretability. DGVAE initially projects multimodal information into textual contents, such as converting images to text, by harnessing state-of-the-art multimodal pre-training technologies. It then constructs a frozen item-item graph and encodes the contents and interactions into two sets of disentangled representations utilizing a simplified residual graph convolutional network. DGVAE further regularizes these disentangled representations through mutual information maximization, aligning the representations derived from the interactions between users and items with those learned from textual content. This alignment facilitates the interpretation of user binary interactions via text. Our empirical analysis conducted on three real-world datasets demonstrates that DGVAE significantly surpasses the performance of state-of-the-art baselines by a margin of 10.02%.

The global robust output regulation problem for a class of general output feedback nonlinear systems with an uncertain exosystem and high relative degree can be tackled by constructing a linear generic internal model provided that a continuous nonlinear mapping exists. Leveraging the presented nonadaptive framework facilitates the conversion of the nonlinear robust output regulation problem into a robust nonadaptive stabilization endeavour for the augmented system endowed with Input-to-State Stable dynamics, removing the need for constructing a specific Lyapunov function with positive semidefinite derivatives. To ensure the feasibility of the nonlinear mapping, the approach is extended by incorporating the nonparametric learning framework. Moreover, the introduced nonparametric learning framework provides the ability to learn the dynamics of the steady-state/input behaviour from the signal generated from the internal model only using the output error feedback. As a result, the nonadaptive/nonparametric approach can be advantageous by guaranteeing convergence of the estimation and tracking error even when the underlying controlled system dynamics are complex or poorly understood. The effectiveness of the theoretical results is illustrated for a controlled duffing system and a continuously stirred tank reactor ",

    "abstract": "MoodCapture presents a novel approach that assesses depression based on images automatically captured from the front-facing camera of smartphones as people go about their daily lives. We collect over 125,000 photos in the wild from N=177 participants diagnosed with major depressive disorder for 90 days. Images are captured naturalistically while participants respond to the PHQ-8 depression survey question: \\textit{``I have felt down, depressed, or hopeless''}. Our analysis explores important image attributes, such as angle, dominant colors, location, objects, and lighting. We show that a random forest trained with face landmarks can classify samples as depressed or non-depressed and predict raw PHQ-8 scores effectively. Our post-hoc analysis provides several insights through an ablation study, feature importance analysis, and bias assessment. Importantly, we evaluate user concerns about using MoodCapture to detect depression based on sharing photos, providing critical insights into privacy concerns that inform the future design of in-the-wild image-based mental health assessment tools.

Here we use the large width Gaussian process limit to analyze the behaviour, at random initialization, of nonlinear activations that induce sparsity in the hidden outputs. A previously unreported form of training instability is proven for arguably two of the most natural candidates for hidden layer sparsification; those being a shifted ReLU ($\\phi(x)=\\max(0, x-\\tau)$ for $\\tau\\ge 0$) and soft thresholding ($\\phi(x)=0$ for $|x|\\le\\tau$ and $x-\\text{sign}(x)\\tau$ for $|x|>\\tau$). We show that this instability is overcome by clipping the nonlinear activation magnitude, at a level prescribed by the shape of the associated Gaussian process variance map. Numerical experiments verify the theory and show that the proposed magnitude clipped sparsifying activations can be trained with training and test fractional sparsity as high as 85\\% while retaining close to full accuracy.

Watermarking, a technique that aims to embed information in the output of a model to verify its source, is useful for mitigating misuse of such AI-generated content. However, existing watermarking schemes remain surprisingly susceptible to attack. In particular, we show that desirable properties shared by existing LLM watermarking systems such as quality preservation, robustness, and public detection APIs can in turn make these systems vulnerable to various attacks. We rigorously study potential attacks in terms of common watermark design choices, and propose best practices and defenses for mitigation -- establishing a set of practical guidelines for embedding and detection of LLM watermarks.

    "abstract": "Image enhancement algorithms are very useful for real world computer vision tasks where image resolution is often physically limited by the sensor size. While state-of-the-art deep neural networks show impressive results for image enhancement, they often struggle to enhance real-world images. In this work, we tackle a real-world setting: inpainting of images from Dunhuang caves. The Dunhuang dataset consists of murals, half of which suffer from corrosion and aging. These murals feature a range of rich content, such as Buddha statues, bodhisattvas, sponsors, architecture, dance, music, and decorative patterns designed by different artists spanning ten centuries, which makes manual restoration challenging. We modify two different existing methods (CAR, HINet) that are based upon state-of-the-art (SOTA) super resolution and deblurring networks. We show that those can successfully inpaint and enhance these deteriorated cave paintings. We further show that a novel combination of CAR and HINet, resulting in our proposed inpainting network (ARIN), is very robust to external noise, especially Gaussian noise. To this end, we present a quantitative and qualitative comparison of our proposed approach with existing SOTA networks and winners of the Dunhuang challenge. One of the proposed methods HINet) represents the new state of the art and outperforms the 1st place of the Dunhuang Challenge, while our combination ARIN, which is robust to noise, is comparable to the 1st place. We also present and discuss qualitative results showing the impact of our method for inpainting on Dunhuang cave images. ",

    "abstract": "Transformer-based language models for automatic code completion have shown great promise so far, yet the evaluation of these models rarely uses real data. This study provides both quantitative and qualitative assessments of three public code language models when completing real-world code. We first developed an open-source IDE extension, Code4Me, for the online evaluation of the models. We collected real auto-completion usage data for over a year from more than 1200 users, resulting in over 600K valid completions. These models were then evaluated using six standard metrics across twelve programming languages. Next, we conducted a qualitative study of 1690 real-world completion requests to identify the reasons behind the poor model performance. A comparative analysis of the models' performance in online and offline settings was also performed, using benchmark synthetic datasets and two masking strategies. Our findings suggest that while developers utilize code completion across various languages, the best results are achieved for mainstream languages such as Python and Java. InCoder outperformed the other models across all programming languages, highlighting the significance of training data and objectives. Our study also revealed that offline evaluations do not accurately reflect real-world scenarios. Upon qualitative analysis of the model's predictions, we found that 66.3% of failures were due to the models' limitations, 24.4% occurred due to inappropriate model usage in a development context, and 9.3% were valid requests that developers overwrote. Given these findings, we propose several strategies to overcome the current limitations. These include refining training objectives, improving resilience to typographical errors, adopting hybrid approaches, and enhancing implementations and usability. ",

In 1973, Weiner introduced the suffix tree of a string [FOCS 1973] and showed that the seemingly more difficult problem of computing matching statistics can also be solved in liner time. Pattern matching queries on graphs are inherently more difficult: under the Orthogonal Vector hypothesis, the graph pattern matching problem cannot be solved in subquadratic time [TALG 2023]. The complexity of graph pattern matching can be parameterized by the topological complexity of the considered graph, which is captured by a parameter $ p $ [JACM 2023]. In this paper, we show that, as in the string setting, computing matching statistics on graph is as difficult as solving standard pattern matching queries. To this end, we introduce a notion of longest common prefix (LCP) array for arbitrary graphs. ",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a novel distributed robust optimization scheme for steering distributions of multi-agent systems under stochastic and deterministic uncertainty. Robust optimization is a subfield of optimization which aims in discovering an optimal solution that remains robustly feasible for all possible realizations of the problem parameters within a given uncertainty set. Such approaches would naturally constitute an ideal candidate for multi-robot control, where in addition to stochastic noise, there might be exogenous deterministic disturbances. Nevertheless, as these methods are usually associated with significantly high computational demands, their application to multi-agent robotics has remained limited. The scope of this work is to propose a scalable robust optimization framework that effectively addresses both types of uncertainties, while retaining computational efficiency and scalability. In this direction, we provide tractable approximations for robust constraints that are relevant in multi-robot settings. Subsequently, we demonstrate how computations can be distributed through an Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) approach towards achieving scalability and communication efficiency. Simulation results highlight the performance of the proposed algorithm in effectively handling both stochastic and deterministic uncertainty in multi-robot systems. The scalability of the method is also emphasized by showcasing tasks with up to 100 agents. The results of this work indicate the promise of blending robust optimization, distribution steering and distributed optimization towards achieving scalable, safe and robust multi-robot control. ",

    "abstract": "Accurate prediction of future blood glucose (BG) levels can effectively improve BG management for people living with diabetes, thereby reducing complications and improving quality of life. The state of the art of BG prediction has been achieved by leveraging advanced deep learning methods to model multi-modal data, i.e., sensor data and self-reported event data, organised as multi-variate time series (MTS). However, these methods are mostly regarded as ``black boxes'' and not entirely trusted by clinicians and patients. In this paper, we propose interpretable graph attentive recurrent neural networks (GARNNs) to model MTS, explaining variable contributions via summarizing variable importance and generating feature maps by graph attention mechanisms instead of post-hoc analysis. We evaluate GARNNs on four datasets, representing diverse clinical scenarios. Upon comparison with twelve well-established baseline methods, GARNNs not only achieve the best prediction accuracy but also provide high-quality temporal interpretability, in particular for postprandial glucose levels as a result of corresponding meal intake and insulin injection. These findings underline the potential of GARNN as a robust tool for improving diabetes care, bridging the gap between deep learning technology and real-world healthcare solutions. ",

Although recent studies on graph neural networks (GNNs) and pretrained language models (PLMs) have exhibited their power in encoding network and text signals, respectively, less attention has been paid to delicately coupling these two types of models on TAGs. Specifically, existing GNNs rarely model text in each node in a contextualized way; existing PLMs can hardly be applied to characterize graph structures due to their sequence architecture. To address these challenges, we propose HASH-CODE, a High-frequency Aware Spectral Hierarchical Contrastive Selective Coding method that integrates GNNs and PLMs into a unified model. Different from previous \"cascaded architectures\" that directly add GNN layers upon a PLM, our HASH-CODE relies on five self-supervised optimization objectives to facilitate thorough mutual enhancement between network and text signals in diverse granularities. Moreover, we show that existing contrastive objective learns the low-frequency component of the augmentation graph and propose a high-frequency component (HFC)-aware contrastive learning objective that makes the learned embeddings more distinctive. Extensive experiments on six real-world benchmarks substantiate the efficacy of our proposed approach. In addition, theoretical analysis and item embedding visualization provide insights into our model interoperability. ",

    "abstract": "In the later training stages, further improvement of the models ability to determine changes relies on how well the change detection (CD) model learns hard cases; however, there are two additional challenges to learning hard case samples: (1) change labels are limited and tend to pointer only to foreground targets, yet hard case samples are prevalent in the background, which leads to optimizing the loss function focusing on the foreground targets and ignoring the background hard cases, which we call imbalance. (2) Complex situations, such as light shadows, target occlusion, and seasonal changes, induce hard case samples, and in the absence of both supervisory and scene information, it is difficult for the model to learn hard case samples directly to accurately obtain the feature representations of the change information, which we call missingness. We propose a Siamese foreground association-driven hard case sample optimization network (HSONet). To deal with this imbalance, we propose an equilibrium optimization loss function to regulate the optimization focus of the foreground and background, determine the hard case samples through the distribution of the loss values, and introduce dynamic weights in the loss term to gradually shift the optimization focus of the loss from the foreground to the background hard cases as the training progresses. To address this missingness, we understand hard case samples with the help of the scene context, propose the scene-foreground association module, use potential remote sensing spatial scene information to model the association between the target of interest in the foreground and the related context to obtain scene embedding, and apply this information to the feature reinforcement of hard cases. Experiments on four public datasets show that HSONet outperforms current state-of-the-art CD methods, particularly in detecting hard case samples. ",

Most existing methods perform tracking between two consecutive frames while ignoring the motion patterns of the target over a series of frames, which would cause performance degradation in the scenes with sparse points. To break through this limitation, we introduce Sequence-to-Sequence tracking paradigm and a tracker named SeqTrack3D to capture target motion across continuous frames. Unlike previous methods that primarily adopted three strategies: matching two consecutive point clouds, predicting relative motion, or utilizing sequential point clouds to address feature degradation, our SeqTrack3D combines both historical point clouds and bounding box sequences. This novel method ensures robust tracking by leveraging location priors from historical boxes, even in scenes with sparse points. Extensive experiments conducted on large-scale datasets show that SeqTrack3D achieves new state-of-the-art performances, improving by 6.00% on NuScenes and 14.13% on Waymo dataset.

Due to the lack of ground-truth fused images, the fusion output of current deep-learning based methods heavily depends on the loss functions defined mathematically. As it is hard to well mathematically define the fused image without ground truth, the performance of existing fusion methods is limited. In this paper, we first propose to use natural language to express the objective of IVIF, which can avoid the explicit mathematical modeling of fusion output in current losses, and make full use of the advantage of language expression to improve the fusion performance. For this purpose, we present a comprehensive language-expressed fusion objective, and encode relevant texts into the multi-modal embedding space using CLIP. A language-driven fusion model is then constructed in the embedding space, by establishing the relationship among the embedded vectors to represent the fusion objective and input image modalities. Finally, a language-driven loss is derived to make the actual IVIF aligned with the embedded language-driven fusion model via supervised training. Experiments show that our method can obtain much better fusion results than existing techniques. ",

The two embeddings capture the global and local information in annotation axioms by means of the occurring locations of each word in a set of axioms and the co-occurrences of words in each axiom. The self-matching training method increases the robustness of the concept subsumption prediction when predicted superclasses are similar to subclasses and are isolated to other entities in an ontology. Our evaluation experiments show that the self-matching training method with InME outperforms the existing ontology embeddings for the GO and FoodOn ontologies and that the method with the concatenation of CoME and OWL2Vec* outperforms them for the HeLiS ontology.

    "title": "Towards Agile Robots: Intuitive Robot Position Speculation with Neural  Networks",
    "abstract": "The robot position speculation, which determines where the chassis should move, is one key step to control the mobile manipulators. The target position must ensure the feasibility of chassis movement and manipulability, which is guaranteed by randomized sampling and kinematic checking in traditional methods. Addressing the demands of agile robotics, this paper proposes a robot position speculation network(RPSN), a learning-based approach to enhance the agility of mobile manipulators. The RPSN incorporates a differentiable inverse kinematic algorithm and a neural network. Through end-to-end training, the RPSN can speculate positions with a high success rate. We apply the RPSN to mobile manipulators disassembling end-of-life electric vehicle batteries (EOL-EVBs). Extensive experiments on various simulated environments and physical mobile manipulators demonstrate that the probability of the initial position provided by RPSN being the ideal position is 96.67%. From the kinematic constraint perspective, it achieves 100% generation of the ideal position on average within 1.28 attempts. Much lower than that of random sampling, 31.04. Moreover, the proposed method demonstrates superior data efficiency over pure neural network approaches. The proposed RPSN enables the robot to quickly infer feasible target positions by intuition. This work moves towards building agile robots that can act swiftly like humans. ",

    "abstract": "Detecting objects across various scales remains a significant challenge in computer vision, particularly in tasks such as Rice Leaf Disease (RLD) detection, where objects exhibit considerable scale variations. Traditional object detection methods often struggle to address these variations, resulting in missed detections or reduced accuracy. In this study, we propose the multi-scale Attention Pyramid module (mAPm), a novel approach that integrates dilated convolutions into the Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) to enhance multi-scale information ex-traction. Additionally, we incorporate a global Multi-Head Self-Attention (MHSA) mechanism and a deconvolutional layer to refine the up-sampling process. We evaluate mAPm on YOLOv7 using the MRLD and COCO datasets. Compared to vanilla FPN, BiFPN, NAS-FPN, PANET, and ACFPN, mAPm achieved a significant improvement in Average Precision (AP), with a +2.61% increase on the MRLD dataset compared to the baseline FPN method in YOLOv7. This demonstrates its effectiveness in handling scale variations. Furthermore, the versatility of mAPm allows its integration into various FPN-based object detection models, showcasing its potential to advance object detection techniques. ",

    "abstract": "Recommender systems serve a dual purpose for users: sifting out inappropriate or mismatched information while accurately identifying items that align with their preferences. Numerous recommendation algorithms are designed to provide users with a personalized array of information tailored to their preferences. Nevertheless, excessive personalization can confine users within a \"filter bubble\". Consequently, achieving the right balance between accuracy and diversity in recommendations is a pressing concern. To address this challenge, exemplified by music recommendation, we introduce the Diversified Weighted Hypergraph music Recommendation algorithm (DWHRec). In the DWHRec algorithm, the initial connections between users and listened tracks are represented by a weighted hypergraph. Simultaneously, associations between artists, albums and tags with tracks are also appended to the hypergraph. To explore users' latent preferences, a hypergraph-based random walk embedding method is applied to the constructed hypergraph. In our investigation, accuracy is gauged by the alignment between the user and the track, whereas the array of recommended track types measures diversity. We rigorously compared DWHRec against seven state-of-the-art recommendation algorithms using two real-world music datasets. The experimental results validate DWHRec as a solution that adeptly harmonizes accuracy and diversity, delivering a more enriched musical experience. Beyond music recommendation, DWHRec can be extended to cater to other scenarios with similar data structures. ",

    "abstract": "Location prediction forecasts a user's location based on historical user mobility traces. To tackle the intrinsic sparsity issue of real-world user mobility traces, spatiotemporal contexts have been shown as significantly useful. Existing solutions mostly incorporate spatiotemporal distances between locations in mobility traces, either by feeding them as additional inputs to Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) or by using them to search for informative past hidden states for prediction. However, such distance-based methods fail to capture the time-varying temporal regularities of human mobility, where human mobility is often more regular in the morning than in other periods, for example; this suggests the usefulness of the actual timestamps besides the temporal distances. Against this background, we propose REPLAY, a general RNN architecture learning to capture the time-varying temporal regularities for location prediction. Specifically, REPLAY not only resorts to the spatiotemporal distances in sparse trajectories to search for the informative past hidden states, but also accommodates the time-varying temporal regularities by incorporating smoothed timestamp embeddings using Gaussian weighted averaging with timestamp-specific learnable bandwidths, which can flexibly adapt to the temporal regularities of different strengths across different timestamps. Our extensive evaluation compares REPLAY against a sizable collection of state-of-the-art techniques on two real-world datasets. Results show that REPLAY consistently and significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 7.7\\%-10.9\\% in the location prediction task, and the bandwidths reveal interesting patterns of the time-varying temporal regularities.

Existing works consider either a synchronous framework, necessitating full agent participation and global synchronization, or assume user homogeneity with identical behaviors. We overcome these limitations by considering (1) federated agents operating in an asynchronous communication paradigm, where no mandatory synchronization is required and all agents communicate independently with the server, (2) heterogeneous user behaviors, where users can be stratified into $J \\le |\\mathcal{U}|$ latent user clusters, each exhibiting distinct preferences. For this setting, we propose a UCB-type algorithm with delicate communication protocols. Through theoretical analysis, we give sub-linear regret bounds on par with those achieved in the synchronous framework, while incurring only logarithmic communication costs. Empirical evaluation on synthetic and real-world datasets validates our algorithm's superior performance in terms of regrets and communication costs. ",

In this work, we conduct an in-depth analysis of this challenge and find that modality dominance has a significant negative impact on the model training, greatly degrading the missing modality performance. Motivated by Grad-CAM, we introduce a novel indicator, gradients, to monitor and reduce modality dominance which widely exists in the missing-modality scenario. In aid of this indicator, we present a novel Gradient-guided Modality Decoupling (GMD) method to decouple the dependency on dominating modalities. Specifically, GMD removes the conflicted gradient components from different modalities to achieve this decoupling, significantly improving the performance. In addition, to flexibly handle modal-incomplete data, we design a parameter-efficient Dynamic Sharing (DS) framework which can adaptively switch on/off the network parameters based on whether one modality is available. We conduct extensive experiments on three popular multimodal benchmarks, including BraTS 2018 for medical segmentation, CMU-MOSI, and CMU-MOSEI for sentiment analysis. The results show that our method can significantly outperform the competitors, showing the effectiveness of the proposed solutions.

    "abstract": "Speech quality estimation has recently undergone a paradigm shift from human-hearing expert designs to machine-learning models. However, current models rely mainly on supervised learning, which is time-consuming and expensive for label collection. To solve this problem, we propose VQScore, a self-supervised metric for evaluating speech based on the quantization error of a vector-quantized-variational autoencoder (VQ-VAE). The training of VQ-VAE relies on clean speech; hence, large quantization errors can be expected when the speech is distorted. To further improve correlation with real quality scores, domain knowledge of speech processing is incorporated into the model design. We found that the vector quantization mechanism could also be used for self-supervised speech enhancement (SE) model training. To improve the robustness of the encoder for SE, a novel self-distillation mechanism combined with adversarial training is introduced. In summary, the proposed speech quality estimation method and enhancement models require only clean speech for training without any label requirements. Experimental results show that the proposed VQScore and enhancement model are competitive with supervised baselines. The code will be released after publication. ",

In this fashion, message passing in the coarsened graph acts along persistent pooled topology, leading to improved performance.

This can cause oscillations during training, harming its sample efficiency and final policy performance. Recent work has shown that control theory can help with the convergence of a GAN's training. This paper extends this line of work, conducting a control-theoretic analysis of GAIL and deriving a novel controller that not only pushes GAIL to the desired equilibrium but also achieves asymptotic stability in a 'one-step' setting.

Additionally, the instability of matching in the early stages of training engenders inconsistencies in the optimization objectives of DETRs. To address these issues, we have devised an innovative training methodology termed step-by-step training.

Without reliance on any supplementary training data, DEYO surpasses all existing real-time object detectors in both speed and accuracy.

In reality, the real-world graph data typically show dynamics over time, with changing node attributes and edge structure, leading to the severe graph data distribution shift issue. This issue is compounded by the diverse and complex nature of distribution shifts, which can significantly impact the performance of graph learning methods in degraded generalization and adaptation capabilities, posing a substantial challenge to their effectiveness. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review and summary of the latest approaches, strategies, and insights that address distribution shifts within the context of graph learning. Concretely, according to the observability of distributions in the inference stage and the availability of sufficient supervision information in the training stage, we categorize existing graph learning methods into several essential scenarios, including graph domain adaptation learning, graph out-of-distribution learning, and graph continual learning. For each scenario, a detailed taxonomy is proposed, with specific descriptions and discussions of existing progress made in distribution-shifted graph learning. Additionally, we discuss the potential applications and future directions for graph learning under distribution shifts with a systematic analysis of the current state in this field. The survey is positioned to provide general guidance for the development of effective graph learning algorithms in handling graph distribution shifts, and to stimulate future research and advancements in this area.

    "abstract": "Temporal Graph Learning (TGL) has become a prevalent technique across diverse real-world applications, especially in domains where data can be represented as a graph and evolves over time. Although TGL has recently seen notable progress in algorithmic solutions, its theoretical foundations remain largely unexplored. This paper aims at bridging this gap by investigating the generalization ability of different TGL algorithms (e.g., GNN-based, RNN-based, and memory-based methods) under the finite-wide over-parameterized regime. We establish the connection between the generalization error of TGL algorithms and \"the number of layers/steps\" in the GNN-/RNN-based TGL methods and \"the feature-label alignment (FLA) score\", where FLA can be used as a proxy for the expressive power and explains the performance of memory-based methods. Guided by our theoretical analysis, we propose Simplified-Temporal-Graph-Network, which enjoys a small generalization error, improved overall performance, and lower model complexity. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Our theoretical findings and proposed algorithm offer essential insights into TGL from a theoretical standpoint, laying the groundwork for the designing practical TGL algorithms in future studies. ",

    "abstract": "The rise of generative neural networks has triggered an increased demand for intellectual property (IP) protection in generated content. Deep watermarking techniques, recognized for their flexibility in IP protection, have garnered significant attention. However, the surge in adversarial transferable attacks poses unprecedented challenges to the security of deep watermarking techniques-an area currently lacking systematic investigation. This study fills this gap by introducing two effective transferable attackers to assess the vulnerability of deep watermarks against erasure and tampering risks. Specifically, we initially define the concept of local sample density, utilizing it to deduce theorems on the consistency of model outputs. Upon discovering that perturbing samples towards high sample density regions (HSDR) of the target class enhances targeted adversarial transferability, we propose the Easy Sample Selection (ESS) mechanism and the Easy Sample Matching Attack (ESMA) method. Additionally, we propose the Bottleneck Enhanced Mixup (BEM) that integrates information bottleneck theory to reduce the generator's dependence on irrelevant noise. Experiments show a significant enhancement in the success rate of targeted transfer attacks for both ESMA and BEM-ESMA methods. We further conduct a comprehensive evaluation using ESMA and BEM-ESMA as measurements, considering model architecture and watermark encoding length, and achieve some impressive findings. ",

Typically, these topological layouts in modern GNNs are deterministically computed (e.g., attention-based GNNs) or locally sampled (e.g., GraphSage) under heuristic assumptions. In this paper, we for the first time pose that these layouts can be globally sampled via Langevin dynamics following Boltzmann distribution equipped with explicit physical energy, leading to higher feasibility in the physical world. We argue that such a collection of sampled/optimized layouts can capture the wide energy distribution and bring extra expressivity on top of WL-test, therefore easing downstream tasks. As such, we propose Distributional Edge Layouts (DELs) to serve as a complement to a variety of GNNs. DEL is a pre-processing strategy independent of subsequent GNN variants, thus being highly flexible. Experimental results demonstrate that DELs consistently and substantially improve a series of GNN baselines, achieving state-of-the-art performance on multiple datasets. ",

Most research on adversarial attacks and corresponding defense methods focuses only on scenarios where adversarial samples are directly generated by the attack model. In this study, we explore a more practical scenario in behavior-based authentication, where adversarial samples are collected from the attacker. The generated adversarial samples from the model are replicated by attackers with a certain level of discrepancy. We propose an eXplainable AI (XAI) based defense strategy against adversarial attacks in such scenarios. A feature selector, trained with our method, can be used as a filter in front of the original authenticator. It filters out features that are more vulnerable to adversarial attacks or irrelevant to authentication, while retaining features that are more robust.

Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) was introduced by the IEEE TSN Task Group as an enhancement to Ethernet to provide high quality of service (QoS) for real-time traffic. In a TSN network, applications signal their QoS requirements to the network before transmitting data. The network then allocates resources to meet these requirements. However, TSN-unaware applications can neither perform this registration process nor profit from TSN's QoS benefits. The contributions of this paper are twofold. First, we introduce a novel network architecture in which an additional device autonomously signals the QoS requirements of TSN-unaware applications to the network. Second, we propose a processing method to detect real-time streams in a network and extract the necessary information for the TSN stream signaling. It leverages a Deep Recurrent Neural Network (DRNN) to detect periodic traffic, extracts an accurate traffic description, and uses traffic classification to determine the source application. As a result, our proposal allows TSN-unaware applications to benefit from TSNs QoS guarantees. Our evaluations underline the effectiveness of the proposed architecture and processing method. ",

    "abstract": "Although many large language models (LLMs) have been trained to refuse harmful requests, they are still vulnerable to jailbreaking attacks, which rewrite the original prompt to conceal its harmful intent. In this paper, we propose a new method for defending LLMs against jailbreaking attacks by ``backtranslation''. Specifically, given an initial response generated by the target LLM from an input prompt, our backtranslation prompts a language model to infer an input prompt that can lead to the response. The inferred prompt is called the backtranslated prompt which tends to reveal the actual intent of the original prompt, since it is generated based on the LLM's response and is not directly manipulated by the attacker. We then run the target LLM again on the backtranslated prompt, and we refuse the original prompt if the model refuses the backtranslated prompt. We explain that the proposed defense provides several benefits on its effectiveness and efficiency. We empirically demonstrate that our defense significantly outperforms the baselines, in the cases that are hard for the baselines, and our defense also has little impact on the generation quality for benign input prompts.

Improving DCNN's robustness is of great significance to the safety-critical applications, such as autonomous driving and industry automation. Inspired by the principal way that human eyes recognize objects, i.e., largely relying on the shape features, this paper first employs the edge detectors as layer kernels and designs a binary edge feature branch (BEFB for short) to learn the binary edge features, which can be easily integrated into any popular backbone. The four edge detectors can learn the horizontal, vertical, positive diagonal, and negative diagonal edge features, respectively, and the branch is stacked by multiple Sobel layers (using edge detectors as kernels) and one threshold layer. The binary edge features learned by the branch, concatenated with the texture features learned by the backbone, are fed into the fully connected layers for classification. We integrate the proposed branch into VGG16 and ResNet34, respectively, and conduct experiments on multiple datasets. Experimental results demonstrate the BEFB is lightweight and has no side effects on training. And the accuracy of the BEFB integrated models is better than the original ones on all datasets when facing FGSM, PGD, and C\\&W attacks. Besides, BEFB integrated models equipped with the robustness enhancing techniques can achieve better classification accuracy compared to the original models. The work in this paper for the first time shows it is feasible to enhance the robustness of DCNNs through combining both shape-like features and texture features. ",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we focus on the detection of semantic changes in Slovene, a less resourced Slavic language with two million speakers. Detecting and tracking semantic changes provides insights into the evolution of the language caused by changes in society and culture. Recently, several systems have been proposed to aid in this study, but all depend on manually annotated gold standard datasets for evaluation. In this paper, we present the first Slovene dataset for evaluating semantic change detection systems, which contains aggregated semantic change scores for 104 target words obtained from more than 3000 manually annotated sentence pairs. We evaluate several existing semantic change detection methods on this dataset and also propose a novel approach based on optimal transport that improves on the existing state-of-the-art systems with an error reduction rate of 22.8%.

    "title": "Resolution-Agnostic Neural Compression for High-Fidelity Portrait Video  Conferencing via Implicit Radiance Fields",
    "abstract": "Video conferencing has caught much more attention recently. High fidelity and low bandwidth are two major objectives of video compression for video conferencing applications. Most pioneering methods rely on classic video compression codec without high-level feature embedding and thus can not reach the extremely low bandwidth. Recent works instead employ model-based neural compression to acquire ultra-low bitrates using sparse representations of each frame such as facial landmark information, while these approaches can not maintain high fidelity due to 2D image-based warping. In this paper, we propose a novel low bandwidth neural compression approach for high-fidelity portrait video conferencing using implicit radiance fields to achieve both major objectives. We leverage dynamic neural radiance fields to reconstruct high-fidelity talking head with expression features, which are represented as frame substitution for transmission. The overall system employs deep model to encode expression features at the sender and reconstruct portrait at the receiver with volume rendering as decoder for ultra-low bandwidth. In particular, with the characteristic of neural radiance fields based model, our compression approach is resolution-agnostic, which means that the low bandwidth achieved by our approach is independent of video resolution, while maintaining fidelity for higher resolution reconstruction. Experimental results demonstrate that our novel framework can (1) construct ultra-low bandwidth video conferencing, (2) maintain high fidelity portrait and (3) have better performance on high-resolution video compression than previous works.

    "abstract": "Biological neural networks do not only include long-term memory and weight multiplication capabilities, as commonly assumed in artificial neural networks, but also more complex functions such as short-term memory, short-term plasticity, and meta-plasticity - all collocated within each synapse. Here, we demonstrate memristive nano-devices based on SrTiO3 that inherently emulate all these synaptic functions. These memristors operate in a non-filamentary, low conductance regime, which enables stable and energy efficient operation. They can act as multi-functional hardware synapses in a class of bio-inspired deep neural networks (DNN) that make use of both long- and short-term synaptic dynamics and are capable of meta-learning or \"learning-to-learn\". The resulting bio-inspired DNN is then trained to play the video game Atari Pong, a complex reinforcement learning task in a dynamic environment. Our analysis shows that the energy consumption of the DNN with multi-functional memristive synapses decreases by about two orders of magnitude as compared to a pure GPU implementation. Based on this finding, we infer that memristive devices with a better emulation of the synaptic functionalities do not only broaden the applicability of neuromorphic computing, but could also improve the performance and energy costs of certain artificial intelligence applications.

    "abstract": "In this work, we propose a Distributional Semantic resource enriched with linguistic and lexical information extracted from electronic dictionaries, designed to address the challenge of bridging the gap between the continuous semantic values represented by distributional vectors and the discrete descriptions offered by general semantics theory. Recently, many researchers have concentrated on the nexus between embeddings and a comprehensive theory of semantics and meaning. This often involves decoding the representation of word meanings in Distributional Models into a set of discrete, manually constructed properties such as semantic primitives or features, using neural decoding techniques. Our approach introduces an alternative strategy grounded in linguistic data. We have developed a collection of domain-specific co-occurrence matrices, derived from two sources: a classification of Italian nouns categorized into 4 semantic traits and 20 concrete noun sub-categories, and a list of Italian verbs classified according to their semantic classes. In these matrices, the co-occurrence values for each word are calculated exclusively with a defined set of words pertinent to a particular lexical domain. The resource comprises 21 domain-specific matrices, one comprehensive matrix, and a Graphical User Interface. Our model facilitates the generation of reasoned semantic descriptions of concepts by selecting matrices directly associated with concrete conceptual knowledge, such as a matrix based on location nouns and the concept of animal habitats. We assessed the utility of the resource through two experiments, achieving promising outcomes in both: the automatic classification of animal nouns and the extraction of animal features. ",

    "abstract": "Multi-person pose estimation (MPPE), which aims to locate keypoints for all persons in the frames, is an active research branch of computer vision. Variable human poses and complex scenes make MPPE dependent on both local details and global structures, and the absence of them may cause keypoint feature misalignment. In this case, high-order spatial interactions that can effectively link the local and global information of features are particularly important. However, most methods do not have spatial interactions, and a few methods have low-order spatial interactions but they are difficult to achieve a good balance between accuracy and complexity. To address the above problems, a Dual-Residual Spatial Interaction Network (DRSI-Net) for MPPE with high accuracy and low complexity is proposed in this paper. DRSI-Net recursively performs residual spatial information interactions on neighbor features, so that more useful spatial information can be retained and more similarities can be obtained between shallow and deep extracted features. The channel and spatial dual attention mechanism introduced in the multi-scale feature fusion also helps the network to adaptively focus on features relevant to target keypoints and further refine generated poses. At the same time, by optimizing interactive channel dimensions and dividing gradient flow, the spatial interaction module is designed to be lightweight, which reduces the complexity of the network. According to the experimental results on the COCO dataset, the proposed DRSI-Net outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in both accuracy and complexity. ",

We of er a revolutionary paradigm that uses cutting-edge edge computing techniques to optimize data transmission and storage in order to meet this problem. Our approach encompasses data compression for images and videos, coupled with a data aggregation technique for numerical data. Specifically, we propose a novel compression algorithm that performs better than the traditional Bzip2, in terms of data compression ratio and throughput. We also designed as an addition a data aggregation algorithm that basically performs very well by reducing on the time to process the overhead of individual data packets there by reducing on the network traf ic. A key aspect of our approach is its ability to operate in resource-constrained environments, such as that typically found in a local beehive farm application from where we obtained various datasets. To achieve this, we carefully explore key parameters such as throughput, delay tolerance, compression rate, and data retransmission. This ensures that our approach can meet the unique requirements of robust network management while minimizing the impact on resources. Overall, our study presents and majorly focuses on a holistic solution for optimizing data transmission and processing across robust sensor networks for specifically local beehive image and video data files. Our approach has the potential to significantly improve the ef iciency and ef ectiveness of robust sensor network management, thereby supporting sustainable practices in various IoT applications such as in Bee Hive Data Management.

For some small linear forests, we do show linear-time algorithms for solving Diameter. For other linear forests H, we make progress towards linear-time algorithms by considering specific diameter values. If H is a linear forest, the maximum value of the diameter of any graph in a connected H-free graph class is some constant dmax dependent only on H. We give linear-time algorithms for deciding if a connected H-free graph has diameter dmax, for several linear forests H. In contrast, for one such linear forest H, Diameter cannot be solved in subquadratic time for H-free graphs under SETH.

We also introduce the novel progress measure for modular arithmetic; Fourier Frequency Sparsity and Fourier Coefficient Ratio, which not only indicate the late generalization but also characterize distinctive internal representations of grokked models per modular operation.

These limitations hamper its application to deep neural network architectures for medical image segmentation.

The efficiency and flexibility of the adopted non-parameter strategy enable for the first time an efficient implementation of 3D affine group equivariant convolutional neural networks for volumetric data.

Our approach includes extensive experimentation on vision transformers using various vision datasets, demonstrating that LTE is competitive with standard pre-training. ",

    "abstract": "Embedding models are integral to AI applications like semantic search, personalized recommendations, and retrieval augmented generation for LLMs, necessitating high-quality training data. However, the limited scalability of manual data curation prompts the need for automated methods to ensure data integrity. Traditional unsupervised triplet mining automates training data generation, crucial for embedding model training, yet inadvertently injects biases and noise, thereby degrading model performance. Addressing this, we introduce GISTEmbed, a novel strategy that enhances in-batch negative selection during contrastive training through a guide model. This approach departs from reliance on random sampling and equal utility assumption of batch negatives, significantly reducing noise from data quality issues and improving model fine-tuning. Benchmarked against the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB), GISTEmbed showcases consistent performance improvements across various model sizes and achieves state-of-the-art results in select categories. This framework enables significant enhancements for smaller models by leveraging the capabilities of powerful yet resource-intensive large models. GISTEmbed can potentially revolutionize the creation of highly efficient, smaller models, democratizing access to advanced AI technologies. Making these technologies more accessible and cost-effective, especially for applications constrained by resources, significantly expands the impact and accessibility of state-of-the-art AI solutions across diverse sectors.

    "abstract": "Neural operators learn mappings between function spaces, which is practical for learning solution operators of PDEs and other scientific modeling applications. Among them, the Fourier neural operator (FNO) is a popular architecture that performs global convolutions in the Fourier space. However, such global operations are often prone to over-smoothing and may fail to capture local details. In contrast, convolutional neural networks (CNN) can capture local features but are limited to training and inference at a single resolution. In this work, we present a principled approach to operator learning that can capture local features under two frameworks by learning differential operators and integral operators with locally supported kernels. Specifically, inspired by stencil methods, we prove that we obtain differential operators under an appropriate scaling of the kernel values of CNNs. To obtain local integral operators, we utilize suitable basis representations for the kernels based on discrete-continuous convolutions. Both these approaches preserve the properties of operator learning and, hence, the ability to predict at any resolution. Adding our layers to FNOs significantly improves their performance, reducing the relative L2-error by 34-72% in our experiments on turbulent 2D Navier-Stokes fluid flow and the spherical shallow water equations.

We present a suite of self-supervised learning objectives for multi-pitch estimation, which encourage the concentration of support around harmonics, invariance to timbral transformations, and equivariance to geometric transformations. These objectives are sufficient to train an entirely convolutional autoencoder to produce multi-pitch salience-grams directly, without any fine-tuning.

Despite recent advances in this topic, most existing causal discovery algorithms operate under two key assumptions: (i) the underlying graph is acyclic, and (ii) the available data is complete. These assumptions can be problematic as many real-world systems contain feedback loops (e.g., biological systems), and practical scenarios frequently involve missing data. In this work, we propose a novel framework, named MissNODAGS, for learning cyclic causal graphs from partially missing data. Under the additive noise model, MissNODAGS learns the causal graph by alternating between imputing the missing data and maximizing the expected log-likelihood of the visible part of the data in each training step, following the principles of the expectation-maximization (EM) framework. Through synthetic experiments and real-world single-cell perturbation data, we demonstrate improved performance when compared to using state-of-the-art imputation techniques followed by causal learning on partially missing interventional data.

Bigger differences of a network architecture are beneficial to extract more complementary structural information to enhance robustness of an obtained super-resolution model.

The lower network utilizes a symmetric architecture to enhance relations of different layers to mine more structural information, which is complementary with a upper network for image super-resolution.

Despite its flexibility and steerability, beamforming with circular microphone arrays suffers from significant performance degradation at frequencies corresponding to zeros of the Bessel functions. To conquer this constraint, baffled or concentric circular microphone arrays have been studied; however, the former needs a bulky baffle that interferes with the original sound field whereas the latter requires more microphones that increase the complexity and cost, both of which are undesirable in practical applications. To tackle this challenge, this paper proposes a circular microphone array equipped with virtual microphones, which resolves the performance degradation commonly associated with circular microphone arrays without resorting to physical modifications. The sound pressures at the virtual microphones are predicted from those measured by the physical microphones based on an acoustics-informed neural network, and then the sound pressures measured by the physical microphones and those predicted at the virtual microphones are integrated to design the beamformer. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach not only eliminates the performance degradation but also suppresses spatial aliasing at high frequencies, thereby underscoring its promising potential.

In this context, effectively controlling Type I error rates ($\\alpha$) without compromising the statistical power ($1-\\beta$) of these systems can build trust and reduce costs related to false discoveries, particularly when follow-up procedures are expensive. Leveraging the principles of conformal prediction emerges as a promising approach for providing respective statistical guarantees by calibrating a model's uncertainty. This work introduces a novel framework for anomaly detection, termed cross-conformal anomaly detection, building upon well-known cross-conformal methods designed for prediction tasks. With that, it addresses a natural research gap by extending previous works in the context of inductive conformal anomaly detection, relying on the split-conformal approach for model calibration. Drawing on insights from conformal prediction, we demonstrate that the derived methods for calculating cross-conformal $p$-values strike a practical compromise between statistical efficiency (full-conformal) and computational efficiency (split-conformal) for uncertainty-quantified anomaly detection on benchmark datasets.

The test performance of a model tends to decrease as the label noise rate increases. Over recent years, several methods have been proposed to mitigate the impact of label noise in medical image classification and enhance the robustness of the model. Predominantly, these works have employed CNN-based architectures as the backbone of their classifiers for feature extraction. However, in recent years, Vision Transformer (ViT)-based backbones have replaced CNNs, demonstrating improved performance and a greater ability to learn more generalizable features, especially when the dataset is large. Nevertheless, no prior work has rigorously investigated how transformer-based backbones handle the impact of label noise in medical image classification. In this paper, we investigate the architectural robustness of ViT against label noise and compare it to that of CNNs. We use two medical image classification datasets -- COVID-DU-Ex, and NCT-CRC-HE-100K -- both corrupted by injecting label noise at various rates.

To learn complex sequential patterns in neural networks, memories of past activities need to persist on significantly longer timescales than relaxation times of single-neuron activity. While recurrent networks can produce such long transients, training these networks in a biologically plausible way is challenging. One approach has been reservoir computing, where only weights from a recurrent network to a readout are learned. Other models achieve learning of recurrent synaptic weights using propagated errors. However, their biological plausibility typically suffers from issues with locality, resource allocation or parameter scales and tuning. We suggest that many of these issues can be alleviated by considering dendritic information storage and computation. By applying a fully local, always-on plasticity rule we are able to learn complex sequences in a recurrent network comprised of two populations. Importantly, our model is resource-efficient, enabling the learning of complex sequences using only a small number of neurons. We demonstrate these features in a mock-up of birdsong learning, in which our networks first learn a long, non-Markovian sequence that they can then reproduce robustly despite external disturbances.

Several recent works argue that the brain supports these abilities by forming neural representations that encode such latent structures in flexible, generalizable ways. However, it remains unclear what aspects of neural population activity are contributing to these computational capabilities. Here, we develop an analytical theory linking the mesoscopic statistics of a neural population's activity to generalization performance on a multi-task learning problem. To do this, we rely on a generative model in which different tasks depend on a common, unobserved latent structure and predictions are formed from a linear readout of a neural population's activity. We show that three geometric measures of the population activity determine generalization performance in these settings. Using this theory, we find that experimentally observed factorized (or disentangled) representations naturally emerge as an optimal solution to the multi-task learning problem. We go on to show that when data is scarce, optimal codes compress less informative latent variables, and when data is abundant, optimal codes expand this information in the state space. We validate predictions from our theory using biological and artificial neural network data. Our results therefore tie neural population geometry to the multi-task learning problem and make normative predictions of the structure of population activity in these settings. ",

Extensive experiments demonstrate that our distilled version of WavLM Base+ not only outperforms DPHuBERT but also achieves state-of-the-art results in the 30M parameters model class across several SUPERB tasks.
