    "title": "Label Informed Contrastive Pretraining for Node Importance Estimation on  Knowledge Graphs",
    "abstract": "Node Importance Estimation (NIE) is a task of inferring importance scores of the nodes in a graph. Due to the availability of richer data and knowledge, recent research interests of NIE have been dedicating to knowledge graphs for predicting future or missing node importance scores. Existing state-of-the-art NIE methods train the model by available labels, and they consider every interested node equally before training. However, the nodes with higher importance often require or receive more attention in real-world scenarios, e.g., people may care more about the movies or webpages with higher importance. To this end, we introduce Label Informed ContrAstive Pretraining (LICAP) to the NIE problem for being better aware of the nodes with high importance scores. Specifically, LICAP is a novel type of contrastive learning framework that aims to fully utilize the continuous labels to generate contrastive samples for pretraining embeddings. Considering the NIE problem, LICAP adopts a novel sampling strategy called top nodes preferred hierarchical sampling to first group all interested nodes into a top bin and a non-top bin based on node importance scores, and then divide the nodes within top bin into several finer bins also based on the scores. The contrastive samples are generated from those bins, and are then used to pretrain node embeddings of knowledge graphs via a newly proposed Predicate-aware Graph Attention Networks (PreGAT), so as to better separate the top nodes from non-top nodes, and distinguish the top nodes within top bin by keeping the relative order among finer bins. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the LICAP pretrained embeddings can further boost the performance of existing NIE methods and achieve the new state-of-the-art performance regarding both regression and ranking metrics.

We explore if and how regulatory fit (i.e., tuning the goal-pursuit mechanism to individuals' internal regulatory focus) can increase persuasion and adoption. We conducted a between-subject experiment (N = 236) presenting participants with the IoT Inspector in gain (\"Privacy Enhancing Technology\" -- PET) or loss (\"Privacy Preserving Technology\" -- PPT) framing. Results show that the effect of regulatory fit on adoption is mediated by trust and privacy calculus processes: prevention-focused users who read the PPT message trust the tool more. Furthermore, privacy calculus favors using the tool when promotion-focused individuals read the PET message. We discuss the contribution of understanding the cognitive mechanisms behind regulatory fit in privacy decision-making to support privacy protection. ",

We explore a design space of meronymous communication, where people can reveal carefully chosen aspects of their identity and also leverage trusted endorsers to gain credibility. We implemented these ideas in a system for scholars to meronymously seek and receive paper recommendations on Twitter and Mastodon. A formative study with 20 scholars confirmed that scholars see benefits to participating but are deterred due to social anxiety. From a month-long public deployment, we found that with meronymity, junior scholars could comfortably ask ``newbie'' questions and get responses from senior scholars who they normally found intimidating. Responses were also tailored to the aspects about themselves that junior scholars chose to reveal. ",

Different from many existing neural network surrogates operating on high-dimensional discretized fields, we propose to learn the dynamics of the system in the latent space with much coarser discretizations. In our proposed framework - Latent Neural PDE Solver (LNS), a non-linear autoencoder is first trained to project the full-order representation of the system onto the mesh-reduced space, then a temporal model is trained to predict the future state in this mesh-reduced space. This reduction process simplifies the training of the temporal model by greatly reducing the computational cost accompanying a fine discretization. We study the capability of the proposed framework and several other popular neural PDE solvers on various types of systems including single-phase and multi-phase flows along with varying system parameters. We showcase that it has competitive accuracy and efficiency compared to the neural PDE solver that operates on full-order space. ",

    "abstract": "Post-hoc out-of-distribution (OOD) detection has garnered intensive attention in reliable machine learning. Many efforts have been dedicated to deriving score functions based on logits, distances, or rigorous data distribution assumptions to identify low-scoring OOD samples. Nevertheless, these estimate scores may fail to accurately reflect the true data density or impose impractical constraints. To provide a unified perspective on density-based score design, we propose a novel theoretical framework grounded in Bregman divergence, which extends distribution considerations to encompass an exponential family of distributions. Leveraging the conjugation constraint revealed in our theorem, we introduce a \\textsc{ConjNorm} method, reframing density function design as a search for the optimal norm coefficient $p$ against the given dataset. In light of the computational challenges of normalization, we devise an unbiased and analytically tractable estimator of the partition function using the Monte Carlo-based importance sampling technique. Extensive experiments across OOD detection benchmarks empirically demonstrate that our proposed \\textsc{ConjNorm} has established a new state-of-the-art in a variety of OOD detection setups, outperforming the current best method by up to 13.25$\\%$ and 28.19$\\%$ (FPR95) on CIFAR-100 and ImageNet-1K, respectively.

In this paper, we introduce a novel deep learning method, Confidence-Aware Contrastive Conditional Consistency Model (4CNet), for mobile robot map prediction during resource-limited exploration in multi-robot environments. 4CNet uniquely incorporates: 1) a conditional consistency model for map prediction in irregularly shaped unknown regions, 2) a contrastive map-trajectory pretraining framework for a trajectory encoder that extracts spatial information from the trajectories of nearby robots during map prediction, and 3) a confidence network to measure the uncertainty of map prediction for effective exploration under resource constraints. We incorporate 4CNet within our proposed robot exploration with map prediction architecture, 4CNet-E. We then conduct extensive comparison studies with 4CNet-E and state-of-the-art heuristic and learning methods to investigate both map prediction and exploration performance in environments consisting of uneven terrain and irregularly shaped obstacles. Results showed that 4CNet-E obtained statistically significant higher prediction accuracy and area coverage with varying environment sizes, number of robots, energy budgets, and communication limitations. Real-world mobile robot experiments were performed and validated the feasibility and generalizability of 4CNet-E for mobile robot map prediction and exploration. ",

    "abstract": "Urban research has long recognized that neighbourhoods are dynamic and relational. However, lack of data, methodologies, and computer processing power have hampered a formal quantitative examination of neighbourhood relational dynamics. To make progress on this issue, this study proposes a graph neural network (GNN) approach that permits combining and evaluating multiple sources of information about internal characteristics of neighbourhoods, their past characteristics, and flows of groups among them, potentially providing greater expressive power in predictive models. By exploring a public large-scale dataset from Yelp, we show the potential of our approach for considering structural connectedness in predicting neighbourhood attributes, specifically to predict local culture. Results are promising from a substantive and methodologically point of view. Substantively, we find that either local area information (e.g. area demographics) or group profiles (tastes of Yelp reviewers) give the best results in predicting local culture, and they are nearly equivalent in all studied cases. Methodologically, exploring group profiles could be a helpful alternative where finding local information for specific areas is challenging, since they can be extracted automatically from many forms of online data. Thus, our approach could empower researchers and policy-makers to use a range of data sources when other local area information is lacking. ",

Multiplex graphs, a special type of heterogeneous graphs, possess richer information, provide better modeling capabilities and integrate more detailed data from potentially different sources. The diverse edge types in multiplex graphs provide more context and insights into the underlying processes of representation learning. In this paper, we tackle the problem of learning representations for nodes in multiplex networks in an unsupervised or self-supervised manner.

We conduct experiments on various open- and closed-source LLMs, quantitatively and qualitatively demonstrating that our method significantly degrades their math problem-solving ability. We identify shared vulnerabilities among LLMs and propose a cost-effective approach to attack high-cost models.

Using this theoretical problem formulation, we create a benchmark that consists of a mixture of HT-free and HT-infected restructured circuits while preserving their original functionalities. The restructured circuits are randomly infected by HTs, causing a situation where the defender is uncertain if a circuit is infected or not. We believe that our innovative dataset will help the community better judge the detection quality of different methods by comparing their success rates in circuit classification. We use our developed benchmark to evaluate three state-of-the-art HT detection tools to show baseline results for this approach. We use Principal Component Analysis to assess the strength of our benchmark, where we observe that some restructured HT-infected circuits are mapped closely to HT-free circuits, leading to significant label misclassification by detectors.

In times of financial hardship, alleviating mortgage burdens is essential for supporting affected households. The mortgage servicing industry plays a vital role in offering this assistance, yet there has been limited research modelling the complex relationship between households and servicers. To bridge this gap, we developed an agent-based model that explores household behavior and the effectiveness of relief measures during financial distress. Our model represents households as adaptive learning agents with realistic financial attributes. These households experience exogenous income shocks, which may influence their ability to make mortgage payments. Mortgage servicers provide relief options to these households, who then choose the most suitable relief based on their unique financial circumstances and individual preferences. We analyze the impact of various external shocks and the success of different mortgage relief strategies on specific borrower subgroups. Through this analysis, we show that our model can not only replicate real-world mortgage studies but also act as a tool for conducting a broad range of what-if scenario analyses. Our approach offers fine-grained insights that can inform the development of more effective and inclusive mortgage relief solutions. ",

Therefore, in this study, imitation-regularized optimal transport (I-OT) on networks was investigated. It encodes prior knowledge on the network by imitating a given prior distribution.

These attack methods have garnered considerable attention from researchers in recent years. However, there is still a lack of research on designing adversarial defense methods specifically for visual object tracking. To address these issues, we propose an effective additional pre-processing network called DuaLossDef that eliminates adversarial perturbations during the tracking process. DuaLossDef is deployed ahead of the search branche or template branche of the tracker to apply defensive transformations to the input images. Moreover, it can be seamlessly integrated with other visual trackers as a plug-and-play module without requiring any parameter adjustments. We train DuaLossDef using adversarial training, specifically employing Dua-Loss to generate adversarial samples that simultaneously attack the classification and regression branches of the tracker. Extensive experiments conducted on the OTB100, LaSOT, and VOT2018 benchmarks demonstrate that DuaLossDef maintains excellent defense robustness against adversarial attack methods in both adaptive and non-adaptive attack scenarios. Moreover, when transferring the defense network to other trackers, it exhibits reliable transferability. Finally, DuaLossDef achieves a processing time of up to 5ms/frame, allowing seamless integration with existing high-speed trackers without introducing significant computational overhead. We will make our code publicly available soon. ",

Theoretical validation indicates that smaller singular values predominantly contribute to constructing noise information. In the exclusion process, tensor QR decomposition is employed to reasonably reduce the size of the target tensor. Subsequently, we address a tensor $L_{2,1}$ Norm Minimization via T-QR (TLNMTQR) based method to effectively isolate the noise, markedly improving computational speed without compromising accuracy. Concurrently, by integrating the asymmetric spatial-temporal total variation regularization method (ASSTV), our objective is to augment the flexibility and efficacy of our algorithm in handling time series data. Ultimately, our method underwent rigorous testing with real-world data, affirmatively showcasing the superiority of our algorithm in terms of speed, precision, and robustness. ",

    "abstract": "Model inversion attacks (MIAs) seek to infer the private training data of a target classifier by generating synthetic images that reflect the characteristics of the target class through querying the model. However, prior studies have relied on full access to the target model, which is not practical in real-world scenarios. Additionally, existing black-box MIAs assume that the image prior and target model follow the same distribution.

In response to this challenge, fault detection assumes a pivotal role in ensuring the secure deployment of cryptosystems. Even when a cryptosystem boasts mathematical security, its practical implementation may remain susceptible to exploitation through side-channel attacks. In this paper, we propose a lightweight fault detection architecture tailored for modular exponentiation, a building block of numerous cryptographic applications spanning from classical cryptography to post quantum cryptography. Based on our simulation and implementation results on ARM Cortex-A72 processor, and AMD/Xilinx Zynq Ultrascale+, and Artix-7 FPGAs, our approach achieves an error detection rate close to 100%, all while introducing a modest computational overhead of approximately 7% and area overhead of less than 1% compared to the unprotected architecture.

Conventional hardware solutions, such as digital signal processors (DSPs) and more recently, graphic processing units (GPUs), provide various degrees of parallelism, yet they both fail to take into account the cyclical and consecutive character of WBP. Furthermore, the large amount of data in WBPs cannot be processed quickly in symmetric multiprocessors (SMPs) due to the unpredictability of memory latency. To address this issue, we propose a hierarchical dataflow-driven architecture to accelerate WBP.

Previous methods for numerical solution of time dependent PDEs often use finite difference for time, and a spectral scheme for the spatial dimensions, which leads to slow linear convergence. Spectral collocation space-time methods show exponential convergence, however, for realistic problems they need to solve large four-dimensional systems. We overcome this difficulty by using a TT approach as its complexity only grows linearly with the number of dimensions. We show that our TT space-time Chebyshev spectral collocation method converges exponentially, when the solution of the CDR is smooth, and demonstrate that it leads to very high compression of linear operators from terabytes to kilobytes in TT-format, and tens of thousands times speedup when compared to full grid space-time spectral method. These advantages allow us to obtain the solutions at much higher resolutions. ",

Then the outer convexification is introduced to transform integer variables into relaxed binary controls. To approximate binary solutions properly within training, the soft-argmax operator is applied to the neural network with the fact that all the operations of this scheme are differentiable. Moreover, this operator can help push the relaxed binary variables close to 0 or 1. To evaluate the strategy effect, we deployed it to a 2-speed electric vehicle (EV). In contrast to the mature solver Bonmin, our proposed method not only achieves similar energy-saving effects but also significantly reduces the solution time to meet real-time requirements. This results in a notable energy savings of 6.02% compared to the rule-based method. ",

The process of adding varied multimodal annotations is not only time-consuming but also labor-intensive. To tackle these challenges, we propose an auto-generated scheme based on multi-task learning to generate pseudo labels. This approach allows us to simultaneously train for the global multimodal interaction task and the separate cross-modal interaction subtasks, enabling us to learn and leverage both consistency and differentiation effectively. Subsequently, experimental results validate the effectiveness of pseudo labels, and our approach surpasses previous textual and multimodal baseline models on two widely accessible benchmark datasets, providing a solution to the MRHP problem.

We model the pixel-wise representation as Probabilistic Representations (PR) via multivariate Gaussian distribution and tune the contribution of the ambiguous representations to tolerate the risk of inaccurate guidance in contrastive learning. Furthermore, we introduce Global Distribution Prototypes (GDP) by gathering all PRs throughout the whole training process. Since the GDP contains the information of all representations with the same class, it is robust from the instant noise in representations and bears the intra-class variance of representations. In addition, we generate Virtual Negatives (VNs) based on GDP to involve the contrastive learning process. Extensive experiments on two public benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our PRCL framework. ",

    "abstract": "Most existing methods for predicting drug-drug interactions (DDI) predominantly concentrate on capturing the explicit relationships among drugs, overlooking the valuable implicit correlations present between drug pairs (DPs), which leads to weak predictions. To address this issue, this paper introduces a hierarchical multi-relational graph representation learning (HMGRL) approach. Within the framework of HMGRL, we leverage a wealth of drug-related heterogeneous data sources to construct heterogeneous graphs, where nodes represent drugs and edges denote clear and various associations. The relational graph convolutional network (RGCN) is employed to capture diverse explicit relationships between drugs from these heterogeneous graphs. Additionally, a multi-view differentiable spectral clustering (MVDSC) module is developed to capture multiple valuable implicit correlations between DPs. Within the MVDSC, we utilize multiple DP features to construct graphs, where nodes represent DPs and edges denote different implicit correlations. Subsequently, multiple DP representations are generated through graph cutting, each emphasizing distinct implicit correlations. The graph-cutting strategy enables our HMGRL to identify strongly connected communities of graphs, thereby reducing the fusion of irrelevant features. By combining every representation view of a DP, we create high-level DP representations for predicting DDIs. Two genuine datasets spanning three distinct tasks are adopted to gauge the efficacy of our HMGRL. Experimental outcomes unequivocally indicate that HMGRL surpasses several leading-edge methods in performance. ",

In this work, we analyze a convolutional neural network (CNN) trained in the classification task and present an algorithm to extract the diffusion pathways of individual pixels to identify the locations of pixels in an input image associated with object classes. The pathways allow us to test the causal components which are important for classification and the pathway-based representations are clearly distinguishable between categories. We find that the few largest pathways of an individual pixel from an image tend to cross the feature maps in each layer that is important for classification. And the large pathways of images of the same category are more consistent in their trends than those of different categories. We also apply the pathways to understanding adversarial attacks, object completion, and movement perception. Further, the total number of pathways on feature maps in all layers can clearly discriminate the original, deformed, and target samples. ",

Tools empower humans to overcome physiological limitations, fostering the creation of magnificent civilizations.

Previous studies in this field have predominantly pursued two distinct approaches to augment the tool invocation capabilities of LLMs. The first approach emphasizes the construction of relevant datasets for model fine-tuning. The second approach, in contrast, aims to fully exploit the inherent reasoning abilities of LLMs through in-context learning strategies. In this work, we introduce a novel tool invocation pipeline designed to control massive real-world APIs. This pipeline mirrors the human task-solving process, addressing complicated real-life user queries. At each step, we guide LLMs to summarize the achieved results and determine the next course of action. We term this pipeline `from Summary to action', Sum2Act for short. Empirical evaluations of our Sum2Act pipeline on the ToolBench benchmark show significant performance improvements, outperforming established methods like ReAct and DFSDT.

    "abstract": "Out-of-distribution detection is a crucial technique for deploying machine learning models in the real world to handle the unseen scenarios.In this paper, we propose a simple but effective Neural Activation Prior (NAP) for out-of-distribution detection (OOD). Our neural activation prior is based on a key observation that, for a channel before the global pooling layer of a fully trained neural network, the probability of a few of its neurons being activated with a larger response by an in-distribution (ID) sample is significantly higher than that by an OOD sample. An intuitive explanation is each channel in a model fully trained on ID dataset would play a role in detecting a certain pattern in the samples within the ID dataset, and a few neurons can be activated with a large response when the pattern is detected in an input sample. Thus, a new scoring function based on this prior is proposed to highlight the role of these strongly activated neurons in OOD detection. This approach is plug-and-play and does not lead to any performance degradation on in-distribution data classification and requires no extra training or statistics from training or external datasets. Notice that previous methods primarily rely on post-global-pooling features of the neural networks, while the within-channel distribution information we leverage would be discarded by the global pooling operator. Consequently, our method is orthogonal to existing approaches and can be effectively combined with them in various applications. Experimental results show that our method achieves the state-of-the-art performance on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and ImageNet datasets, which demonstrates the power of the proposed prior. ",

Specially, we focus on the utilization of the associated \\emph{textual data} of items (eg product title) and study how text features can be effectively fused with ID features in sequential recommendation. However, there exists distinct data characteristics for the two kinds of item features, making a direct fusion method (eg adding text and ID embeddings as item representation) become less effective. To address this issue, we propose a novel {\\ul \\emph{Te}}xt-I{\\ul \\emph{D}} semantic fusion approach for sequential {\\ul \\emph{Rec}}ommendation, namely \\textbf{\\our}.

In the frequency domain, the global sequential characteristics of the original sequences are inherently aggregated into the transformed representations, so that we can employ simple multiplicative operations to effectively fuse the two kinds of item features. Our fusion approach can be proved to have the same effects of contextual convolution, so as to achieving sequence-level semantic fusion. In order to further improve the fusion performance, we propose to enhance the discriminability of the text embeddings from the text encoder, by adaptively injecting positional information via a mixture-of-experts~(MoE) modulation method.

    "abstract": "Traffic incident detection plays a key role in intelligent transportation systems, which has gained great attention in transport engineering. In the past, traditional machine learning (ML) based detection methods achieved good performance under a centralised computing paradigm, where all data are transmitted to a central server for building ML models therein. Nowadays, deep neural networks based federated learning (FL) has become a mainstream detection approach to enable the model training in a decentralised manner while warranting local data governance. Such neural networks-centred techniques, however, have overshadowed the utility of well-established ML-based detection methods. In this work, we aim to explore the potential of potent conventional ML-based detection models in modern traffic scenarios featured by distributed data. We leverage an elegant but less explored distributed optimisation framework named Network Lasso, with guaranteed global convergence for convex problem formulations, integrate the potent convex ML model with it, and compare it with centralised learning, local learning, and federated learning methods atop a well-known traffic incident detection dataset. Experimental results show that the proposed network lasso-based approach provides a promising alternative to the FL-based approach in data-decentralised traffic scenarios, with a strong convergence guarantee while rekindling the significance of conventional ML-based detection methods.

When heterogeneous robots are deployed within an environment, maps obtained from classical SLAM approaches might not be shared between all agents within a team of robots, e.g. due to a mismatch in sensor type, or a difference in physical robot dimensions. Our approach extracts the 3D geometry and semantic description of building elements (e.g. material, element type, color) from BIM, and represents this knowledge in a graph. Based on queries on the graph and knowledge of the skills of the robot, we can generate skill-specific maps that can be used during the execution of localization or navigation tasks. The approach is validated with data from complex build environments and integrated into existing navigation frameworks. ",

To effectively obtain the spatially variant PSFs of a real camera without requiring any ground-truth PSFs, we propose a novel self-supervised learning method that leverages the pair of real sharp and blurred images, which can be easily captured by changing the aperture setting of the camera. In our PSF estimation, we assume rotationally symmetric PSFs and introduce the polar coordinate system to more accurately learn the PSF estimation network. We also handle the focus breathing phenomenon that occurs in real DfD situations.

Considering that the existence of the reflection changes the polarization state of a scene, some existing methods have exploited polarized images for reflection removal.

In contrast, we propose a polarization-to-polarization approach that applies polarized images as the inputs and predicts \"polarized\" reflection and transmission images using two sequential networks to facilitate the separation task by utilizing the interrelated polarization information between the reflection and the transmission. We further adopt a recurrent framework, where the predicted reflection and transmission images are used to iteratively refine each other.

    "abstract": "Pre-training of neural networks has recently revolutionized the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and has before demonstrated its effectiveness in computer vision. At the same time, advances around the detection of fake news were mainly driven by the context-based paradigm, where different types of signals (e.g. from social media) form graph-like structures that hold contextual information apart from the news article to classify. We propose to merge these two developments by applying pre-training of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) in the domain of context-based fake news detection. Our experiments provide an evaluation of different pre-training strategies for graph-based misinformation detection and demonstrate that transfer learning does currently not lead to significant improvements over training a model from scratch in the domain. We argue that a major current issue is the lack of suitable large-scale resources that can be used for pre-training. ",

While some previous learning-based methods integrated a physical scattering function for simultaneous stereo-matching and dehazing, simply removing fog might not aid depth estimation because the fog itself can provide crucial depth cues. In this work, we introduce a framework based on contrastive feature distillation (CFD). This strategy combines feature distillation from merged clean-fog features with contrastive learning, ensuring balanced dependence on fog depth hints and clean matching features. This framework helps to enhance model generalization across both clean and foggy environments.

    "abstract": "In recent years, the rapid development of deep learning technology has brought new prospects to the field of vulnerability detection. Many vulnerability detection methods involve converting source code into images for detection, yet they often overlook the quality of the generated images. Due to the fact that vulnerability images lack clear and continuous contours, unlike images used in object detection, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) tend to lose semantic information during the convolution and pooling processes. Therefore, this paper proposes a pixel row oversampling method based on code line concatenation to generate more continuous code features, addressing the issue of discontinuity in code image coloration.Building upon these contributions, we propose the vulnerability detection system VulMCI and conduct tests on the SARD and NVD datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that VulMCI outperforms seven state-of-the-art vulnerability detectors (namely Checkmarx, FlawFinder, RATS, VulDeePecker, SySeVR, VulCNN, and Devign). Compared to other image-based methods, VulMCI shows improvements in various metrics, including a 2.877\\% increase in True Positive Rate (TPR), a 5.446\\% increase in True Negative Rate (TNR), and a 5.91\\% increase in Accuracy (ACC). On the NVD real-world dataset, VulMCI achieves an average accuracy of 5.162\\%, confirming its value in practical vulnerability detection applications. ",

The proposed ConvDTW-ACS method utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network for classifying overlapping image chunks extracted from the full audio spectrogram. Then, our custom Dynamic Time Warping algorithm aligns the sequence of predicted probabilities to the sequence of surface types in the track, from which timestamps of the surface type boundaries can be extracted. The method was evaluated on a real-world dataset collected from the Ford Manufacturing Plant in Valencia (Spain), achieving a mean error of 166 milliseconds when delimiting, within the audio, the boundaries of the surfaces in the track. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in accurately segmenting different surface types, which could enable the development of more specialized AI systems to improve the quality inspection process.

In this work, we propose a novel NAS algorithm that encodes user preferences for the trade-off between performance and hardware metrics, and yields representative and diverse architectures across multiple devices in just one search run. To this end, we parameterize the joint architectural distribution across devices and multiple objectives via a hypernetwork that can be conditioned on hardware features and preference vectors, enabling zero-shot transferability to new devices. Extensive experiments with up to 19 hardware devices and 3 objectives showcase the effectiveness and scalability of our method. Finally, we show that, without additional costs, our method outperforms existing MOO NAS methods across qualitatively different search spaces and datasets, including MobileNetV3 on ImageNet-1k and a Transformer space on machine translation.

    "abstract": "Exposure correction aims to enhance images suffering from improper exposure to achieve satisfactory visual effects. Despite recent progress, existing methods generally mitigate either overexposure or underexposure in input images, and they still struggle to handle images with mixed exposure, i.e., one image incorporates both overexposed and underexposed regions. The mixed exposure distribution is non-uniform and leads to varying representation, which makes it challenging to address in a unified process. In this paper, we introduce an effective Region-aware Exposure Correction Network (RECNet) that can handle mixed exposure by adaptively learning and bridging different regional exposure representations. Specifically, to address the challenge posed by mixed exposure disparities, we develop a region-aware de-exposure module that effectively translates regional features of mixed exposure scenarios into an exposure-invariant feature space. Simultaneously, as de-exposure operation inevitably reduces discriminative information, we introduce a mixed-scale restoration unit that integrates exposure-invariant features and unprocessed features to recover local information. To further achieve a uniform exposure distribution in the global image, we propose an exposure contrastive regularization strategy under the constraints of intra-regional exposure consistency and inter-regional exposure continuity. Extensive experiments are conducted on various datasets, and the experimental results demonstrate the superiority and generalization of our proposed method.

    "abstract": "Existing object detection models are mainly trained on large-scale labeled datasets. However, annotating data for novel aerial object classes is expensive since it is time-consuming and may require expert knowledge. Thus, it is desirable to study label-efficient object detection methods on aerial images. In this work, we propose a zero-shot method for aerial object detection named visual Description Regularization, or DescReg. Concretely, we identify the weak semantic-visual correlation of the aerial objects and aim to address the challenge with prior descriptions of their visual appearance. Instead of directly encoding the descriptions into class embedding space which suffers from the representation gap problem, we propose to infuse the prior inter-class visual similarity conveyed in the descriptions into the embedding learning. The infusion process is accomplished with a newly designed similarity-aware triplet loss which incorporates structured regularization on the representation space. We conduct extensive experiments with three challenging aerial object detection datasets, including DIOR, xView, and DOTA. The results demonstrate that DescReg significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art ZSD methods with complex projection designs and generative frameworks, e.g., DescReg outperforms best reported ZSD method on DIOR by 4.5 mAP on unseen classes and 8.1 in HM. We further show the generalizability of DescReg by integrating it into generative ZSD methods as well as varying the detection architecture. ",

Until recently, the main focus of research was the structural characteristics of this model. The main aim of this paper is to complement previous findings with systematic and data-driven analyses on the positive and negative sentiments of social relationships, across different cultures, communities and topics of discussion. A total of 26 datasets were collected for this work. It was found that contrary to previous findings, the influence of culture is not easily ``overwhelmed'' by that of the topic of discussion. However, more specific and polarising topics do lead to noticeable increases in negativity across all cultures. These negativities also appear to be stable across the different levels of the ENM, which contradicts previous hypotheses. Finally, the number of generic topics being discussed between users seems to be a good predictor of the overall positivity of their relationships. ",

This study aims to train a deep learning model to both generate patient-specific volume-meshes of the pulmonary artery from 3D cardiac MRI data and directly estimate CFD flow fields. This study used 135 3D cardiac MRIs from both a public and private dataset. The pulmonary arteries in the MRIs were manually segmented and converted into volume-meshes. CFD simulations were performed on ground truth meshes and interpolated onto point-point correspondent meshes to create the ground truth dataset. The dataset was split 85/10/15 for training, validation and testing. Image2Flow, a hybrid image and graph convolutional neural network, was trained to transform a pulmonary artery template to patient-specific anatomy and CFD values. Image2Flow was evaluated in terms of segmentation and accuracy of CFD predicted was assessed using node-wise comparisons. Centerline comparisons of Image2Flow and CFD simulations performed using machine learning segmentation were also performed. Image2Flow achieved excellent segmentation accuracy with a median Dice score of 0.9 (IQR: 0.86-0.92). The median node-wise normalized absolute error for pressure and velocity magnitude was 11.98% (IQR: 9.44-17.90%) and 8.06% (IQR: 7.54-10.41), respectively. Centerline analysis showed no significant difference between the Image2Flow and conventional CFD simulated on machine learning-generated volume-meshes. This proof-of-concept study has shown it is possible to simultaneously perform patient specific volume-mesh based segmentation and pressure and flow field estimation. Image2Flow completes segmentation and CFD in ~205ms, which ~7000 times faster than manual methods, making it more feasible in a clinical environment. ",

However, the reasons behind its remarkable effectiveness remain unclear. Specifically, in other research fields, contrastive SSL shares similarities in both theory and practical performance with non-contrastive SSL (e.g., alignment & uniformity, Barlow Twins, and VICReg). However, in SRL, contrastive SSL outperforms non-contrastive SSL significantly. Therefore, two questions arise: First, what commonalities enable various contrastive losses to achieve superior performance in SRL? Second, how can we make non-contrastive SSL, which is similar to contrastive SSL but ineffective in SRL, effective? To address these questions, we start from the perspective of gradients and discover that four effective contrastive losses can be integrated into a unified paradigm, which depends on three components: the Gradient Dissipation, the Weight, and the Ratio. Then, we conduct an in-depth analysis of the roles these components play in optimization and experimentally demonstrate their significance for model performance. Finally, by adjusting these components, we enable non-contrastive SSL to achieve outstanding performance in SRL. ",

    "abstract": "In this work, we explore the potential of self-supervised learning from unlabeled electron microscopy datasets, taking a step toward building a foundation model in this field. We show how self-supervised pretraining facilitates efficient fine-tuning for a spectrum of downstream tasks, including semantic segmentation, denoising, noise & background removal, and super-resolution. Experimentation with varying model complexities and receptive field sizes reveals the remarkable phenomenon that fine-tuned models of lower complexity consistently outperform more complex models with random weight initialization. We demonstrate the versatility of self-supervised pretraining across various downstream tasks in the context of electron microscopy, allowing faster convergence and better performance. We conclude that self-supervised pretraining serves as a powerful catalyst, being especially advantageous when limited annotated data are available and efficient scaling of computational cost are important.

    "title": "Grid-Based Continuous Normal Representation for Anomaly Detection",
    "abstract": "There have been significant advancements in anomaly detection in an unsupervised manner, where only normal images are available for training. Several recent methods aim to detect anomalies based on a memory, comparing the input and the directly stored normal features (or trained features with normal images). However, such memory-based approaches operate on a discrete feature space implemented by the nearest neighbor or attention mechanism, suffering from poor generalization or an identity shortcut issue outputting the same as input, respectively. Furthermore, the majority of existing methods are designed to detect single-class anomalies, resulting in unsatisfactory performance when presented with multiple classes of objects. To tackle all of the above challenges, we propose GRAD, a novel anomaly detection method for representing normal features within a \"continuous\" feature space, enabled by transforming spatial features into coordinates and mapping them to continuous grids. Furthermore, we carefully design the grids tailored for anomaly detection, representing both local and global normal features and fusing them effectively. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that GRAD successfully generalizes the normal features and mitigates the identity shortcut, furthermore, GRAD effectively handles diverse classes in a single model thanks to the high-granularity global representation. In an evaluation using the MVTec AD dataset, GRAD significantly outperforms the previous state-of-the-art method by reducing 65.0\\% of the error for multi-class unified anomaly detection.

    "abstract": "In the realm of distributed systems tasked with managing and processing large-scale graph-structured data, optimizing graph partitioning stands as a pivotal challenge. The primary goal is to minimize communication overhead and runtime cost. However, alongside the computational complexity associated with optimal graph partitioning, a critical factor to consider is memory overhead. Real-world graphs often reach colossal sizes, making it impractical and economically unviable to load the entire graph into memory for partitioning. This is also a fundamental premise in distributed graph processing, where accommodating a graph with non-distributed systems is unattainable. Currently, existing streaming partitioning algorithms exhibit a skew-oblivious nature, yielding satisfactory partitioning results exclusively for specific graph types. In this paper, we propose a novel streaming partitioning algorithm, the Skewness-aware Vertex-cut Partitioner S5P, designed to leverage the skewness characteristics of real graphs for achieving high-quality partitioning. S5P offers high partitioning quality by segregating the graph's edge set into two subsets, head and tail sets. Following processing by a skewness-aware clustering algorithm, these two subsets subsequently undergo a Stackelberg graph game. Our extensive evaluations conducted on substantial real-world and synthetic graphs demonstrate that, in all instances, the partitioning quality of S5P surpasses that of existing streaming partitioning algorithms, operating within the same load balance constraints. For example, S5P can bring up to a 51% improvement in partitioning quality compared to the top partitioner among the baselines. Lastly, we showcase that the implementation of S5P results in up to an 81% reduction in communication cost and a 130% increase in runtime efficiency for distributed graph processing tasks on PowerGraph.

Existing works on handover failure detection and prevention focus on preventing failures due to object slip or external disturbances.

To address this deficit, we present the multimodal Handover Failure Detection dataset, which consists of failures induced by the human participant, such as ignoring the robot or not releasing the object. We also present two baseline methods for handover failure detection: (i) a video classification method using 3D CNNs and (ii) a temporal action segmentation approach which jointly classifies the human action, robot action and overall outcome of the action. The results show that video is an important modality, but using force-torque data and gripper position help improve failure detection and action segmentation accuracy. ",

    "abstract": "In response to growing concerns about user privacy, legislators have introduced new regulations and laws such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) that force websites to obtain user consent before activating personal data collection, fundamental to providing targeted advertising. The cornerstone of this consent-seeking process involves the use of Privacy Banners, the technical mechanism to collect users' approval for data collection practices. Consent management platforms (CMPs) have emerged as practical solutions to make it easier for website administrators to properly manage consent, allowing them to outsource the complexities of managing user consent and activating advertising features. This paper presents a detailed and longitudinal analysis of the evolution of CMPs spanning nine years. We take a twofold perspective: Firstly, thanks to the HTTP Archive dataset, we provide insights into the growth, market share, and geographical spread of CMPs. Noteworthy observations include the substantial impact of GDPR on the proliferation of CMPs in Europe. Secondly, we analyse millions of user interactions with a medium-sized CMP present in thousands of websites worldwide. We observe how even small changes in the design of Privacy Banners have a critical impact on the user's giving or denying their consent to data collection. For instance, over 60% of users do not consent when offered a simple \"one-click reject-all\" option. Conversely, when opting out requires more than one click, about 90% of users prefer to simply give their consent. The main objective is in fact to eliminate the annoying privacy banner rather the make an informed decision. Curiously, we observe iOS users exhibit a higher tendency to accept cookies compared to Android users, possibly indicating greater confidence in the privacy offered by Apple devices. ",

LOTL techniques are well hidden inside the stream of events generated by common legitimate activities, moreover threat actors often camouflage activity through obfuscation, making them particularly difficult to detect without incurring in plenty of false alarms, even using machine learning. To improve the performance of models in such an harsh environment, we propose an augmentation framework to enhance and diversify the presence of LOTL malicious activity inside legitimate logs. Guided by threat intelligence, we generate a dataset by injecting attack templates known to be employed in the wild, further enriched by malleable patterns of legitimate activities to replicate the behavior of evasive threat actors. We conduct an extensive ablation study to understand which models better handle our augmented dataset, also manipulated to mimic the presence of model-agnostic evasion and poisoning attacks. Our results suggest that augmentation is needed to maintain high-predictive capabilities, robustness to attack is achieved through specific hardening techniques like adversarial training, and it is possible to deploy near-real-time models with almost-zero false alarms.

Existing multi-agent control strategies face scalability limitations, struggling to handle arbitrary numbers of entities.

We propose a data driven approach to address these limitations by introducing a decentralized control system using neural network policies trained in simulation. Leveraging permutation invariant neural network architectures and model-free reinforcement learning, our approach allows control agents to autonomously determine the relative importance of different entities without being biased by ordering or limited by a fixed capacity. We validate our approach through both simulations and real-world experiments involving multiple wheeled-legged quadrupedal robots, demonstrating their collaborative control capabilities. We prove the effectiveness of our architectural choice through experiments with three exemplary multi-entity problems. Our analysis underscores the pivotal role of the end-to-end trained permutation invariant encoders in achieving scalability and improving the task performance in multi-object manipulation or multi-goal navigation problems. The adaptability of our policy is further evidenced by its ability to manage varying numbers of entities in a zero-shot manner, showcasing near-optimal autonomous task distribution and collision avoidance behaviors.

In this study, we present a novel automated approach, Attention-Guided Denoising Diffusion Anomaly Detection (AG-DDAD), designed to assess breast cosmesis following surgery, addressing the limitations of conventional supervised learning and existing anomaly detection models. Our approach leverages the attention mechanism of the distillation with no label (DINO) self-supervised Vision Transformer (ViT) in combination with a diffusion model to achieve high-quality image reconstruction and precise transformation of discriminative regions. By training the diffusion model on unlabeled data predominantly with normal cosmesis, we adopt an unsupervised anomaly detection perspective to automatically score the cosmesis. Real-world data experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, providing visually appealing representations and quantifiable scores for cosmesis evaluation. Compared to commonly used rule-based programs, our fully automated approach eliminates the need for manual annotations and offers objective evaluation. Moreover, our anomaly detection model exhibits state-of-the-art performance, surpassing existing models in accuracy. Going beyond the scope of breast cosmesis, our research represents a significant advancement in unsupervised anomaly detection within the medical domain, thereby paving the way for future investigations.

The conventional method for maximizing adversarial transferability involves: (1) fine-tuning hyperparameters to generate multiple batches of adversarial examples on the substitute model; (2) conserving the batch of adversarial examples that have the best comprehensive performance on substitute model and target model, and discarding the others. In this work, we revisit the second step of this process in the context of fine-tuning hyperparameters to craft adversarial examples, where multiple batches of fine-tuned adversarial examples often appear in a single high error hilltop. We demonstrate that averaging multiple batches of adversarial examples under different hyperparameter configurations, which refers to as \"adversarial example soups\", can often enhance adversarial transferability. Compared with traditional methods, the proposed method incurs no additional generation time and computational cost. Besides, our method is orthogonal to existing transfer-based methods and can be combined with them seamlessly to generate more transferable adversarial examples. Extensive experiments on the ImageNet dataset show that our methods achieve a higher attack success rate than the state-of-the-art attacks. ",

We investigate the training dynamics of the classifier by applying SVD to the weights motivated by the observation that freezing weights results in constant singular values. We find that there are differences when training in IID and non-IID settings. Based on this finding, we introduce two regularization terms for local training to continuously emulate IID settings: (1) variance in the dimension-wise probability distribution of the classifier and (2) hyperspherical uniformity of representations of the encoder. These regularizations promote local models to act as if it were in an IID setting regardless of the local data distribution, thus offsetting proneness to bias while being flexible to the data. On extensive experiments in both label-shift and feature-shift settings, we verify that our method achieves highest performance by a large margin especially in highly non-IID cases in addition to being scalable to larger models and datasets.

Despite some promising results, previous studies either required a tedious workflow or limited opportunities for downstream emphysema subtyping, limiting efficient adaptation on a large-scale study. To alleviate this dilemma, we developed an end-to-end deep learning framework based on an existing HMMF segmentation framework.

The intersection of machine learning and causal inference has yielded various effective CATE estimators. However, deploying these estimators in practice is often hindered by the absence of counterfactual labels, making it challenging to select the desirable CATE estimator using conventional model selection procedures like cross-validation. Existing approaches for CATE estimator selection, such as plug-in and pseudo-outcome metrics, face two inherent challenges. Firstly, they are required to determine the metric form and the underlying machine learning models for fitting nuisance parameters or plug-in learners. Secondly, they lack a specific focus on selecting a robust estimator. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a novel approach, the Distributionally Robust Metric (DRM), for CATE estimator selection. The proposed DRM not only eliminates the need to fit additional models but also excels at selecting a robust CATE estimator. Experimental studies demonstrate the efficacy of the DRM method, showcasing its consistent effectiveness in identifying superior estimators while mitigating the risk of selecting inferior ones. ",

    "title": "A Modular System for Enhanced Robustness of Multimedia Understanding  Networks via Deep Parametric Estimation",
    "abstract": "In multimedia understanding tasks, corrupted samples pose a critical challenge, because when fed to machine learning models they lead to performance degradation. In the past, three groups of approaches have been proposed to handle noisy data: i) enhancer and denoiser modules to improve the quality of the noisy data, ii) data augmentation approaches, and iii) domain adaptation strategies. All the aforementioned approaches come with drawbacks that limit their applicability; the first has high computational costs and requires pairs of clean-corrupted data for training, while the others only allow deployment of the same task/network they were trained on (\\ie, when upstream and downstream task/network are the same). In this paper, we propose SyMPIE to solve these shortcomings. To this end, we design a small, modular, and efficient (just 2GFLOPs to process a Full HD image) system to enhance input data for robust downstream multimedia understanding with minimal computational cost. Our SyMPIE is pre-trained on an upstream task/network that should not match the downstream ones and does not need paired clean-corrupted samples. Our key insight is that most input corruptions found in real-world tasks can be modeled through global operations on color channels of images or spatial filters with small kernels. We validate our approach on multiple datasets and tasks, such as image classification (on ImageNetC, ImageNetC-Bar, VizWiz, and a newly proposed mixed corruption benchmark named ImageNetC-mixed) and semantic segmentation (on Cityscapes, ACDC, and DarkZurich) with consistent improvements of about 5\\% relative accuracy gain across the board. The code of our approach and the new ImageNetC-mixed benchmark will be made available upon publication. ",

    "abstract": "The human cognitive system exhibits remarkable flexibility and generalization capabilities, partly due to its ability to form low-dimensional, compositional representations of the environment. In contrast, standard neural network architectures often struggle with abstract reasoning tasks, overfitting, and requiring extensive data for training. This paper investigates the impact of the relational bottleneck -- a mechanism that focuses processing on relations among inputs -- on the learning of factorized representations conducive to compositional coding and the attendant flexibility of processing. We demonstrate that such a bottleneck not only improves generalization and learning efficiency, but also aligns network performance with human-like behavioral biases. Networks trained with the relational bottleneck developed orthogonal representations of feature dimensions latent in the dataset, reflecting the factorized structure thought to underlie human cognitive flexibility. Moreover, the relational network mimics human biases towards regularity without pre-specified symbolic primitives, suggesting that the bottleneck fosters the emergence of abstract representations that confer flexibility akin to symbols.

    "abstract": "Autoregressive (AR) and Non-autoregressive (NAR) models are two types of generative models for Neural Machine Translation (NMT). AR models predict tokens in a word-by-word manner and can effectively capture the distribution of real translations. NAR models predict tokens by extracting bidirectional contextual information which can improve the inference speed but they suffer from performance degradation. Previous works utilized AR models to enhance NAR models by reducing the training data's complexity or incorporating the global information into AR models by virtue of NAR models. However, those investigated methods only take advantage of the contextual information of a single type of model while neglecting the diversity in the contextual information that can be provided by different types of models. In this paper, we propose a novel generic collaborative learning method, DCMCL, where AR and NAR models are treated as collaborators instead of teachers and students. To hierarchically leverage the bilateral contextual information, token-level mutual learning and sequence-level contrastive learning are adopted between AR and NAR models. Extensive experiments on four widely used benchmarks show that the proposed DCMCL method can simultaneously improve both AR and NAR models with up to 1.38 and 2.98 BLEU scores respectively, and can also outperform the current best-unified model with up to 0.97 BLEU scores for both AR and NAR decoding.

    "abstract": "Deep extreme classification (XC) aims to train an encoder architecture and an accompanying classifier architecture to tag a data point with the most relevant subset of labels from a very large universe of labels. XC applications in ranking, recommendation and tagging routinely encounter tail labels for which the amount of training data is exceedingly small. Graph convolutional networks (GCN) present a convenient but computationally expensive way to leverage task metadata and enhance model accuracies in these settings. This paper formally establishes that in several use cases, the steep computational cost of GCNs is entirely avoidable by replacing GCNs with non-GCN architectures. The paper notices that in these settings, it is much more effective to use graph data to regularize encoder training than to implement a GCN. Based on these insights, an alternative paradigm RAMEN is presented to utilize graph metadata in XC settings that offers significant performance boosts with zero increase in inference computational costs. RAMEN scales to datasets with up to 1M labels and offers prediction accuracy up to 15% higher on benchmark datasets than state of the art methods, including those that use graph metadata to train GCNs. RAMEN also offers 10% higher accuracy over the best baseline on a proprietary recommendation dataset sourced from click logs of a popular search engine. Code for RAMEN will be released publicly. ",

The impact of AIGC and its implications are of key importance to social platforms, e.g., regarding the implementation of policies, community formation, and algorithmic design. Yet, to date, we know little about how the arrival of AIGC has impacted the social media ecosystem. To fill this gap, we present a comprehensive study of Pixiv, an online community for artists who wish to share and receive feedback on their illustrations. Pixiv hosts over 100 million artistic submissions and receives more than 1 billion page views per month (as of 2023). Importantly, it allows both human and AI generated content to be uploaded. Exploiting this, we perform the first analysis of the impact that AIGC has had on the social media ecosystem, through the lens of Pixiv. Based on a dataset of 15.2 million posts (including 2.4 million AI-generated images), we measure the impact of AIGC on the Pixiv community, as well as the differences between AIGC and human-generated content in terms of content creation and consumption patterns. Our results offer key insight to how AIGC is changing the dynamics of social media platforms like Pixiv. ",

    "abstract": "Attributed to the frequent coupling of co-occurring objects and the limited supervision from image-level labels, the challenging co-occurrence problem is widely present and leads to false activation of objects in weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS). In this work, we devise a 'Separate and Conquer' scheme SeCo to tackle this issue from dimensions of image space and feature space. In the image space, we propose to 'separate' the co-occurring objects with image decomposition by subdividing images into patches. Importantly, we assign each patch a category tag from Class Activation Maps (CAMs), which spatially helps remove the co-context bias and guide the subsequent representation. In the feature space, we propose to 'conquer' the false activation by enhancing semantic representation with multi-granularity knowledge contrast. To this end, a dual-teacher-single-student architecture is designed and tag-guided contrast is conducted to guarantee the correctness of knowledge and further facilitate the discrepancy among co-occurring objects. We streamline the multi-staged WSSS pipeline end-to-end and tackle co-occurrence without external supervision. Extensive experiments are conducted, validating the efficiency of our method tackling co-occurrence and the superiority over previous single-staged and even multi-staged competitors on PASCAL VOC and MS COCO.

    "abstract": "Despite the widespread adoption of higher-order mathematical structures such as hypergraphs, methodological tools for their analysis lag behind those for traditional graphs. This work addresses a critical gap in this context by proposing two micro-canonical random null models for directed hypergraphs: the Directed Hypergraph Configuration Model (DHCM) and the Directed Hypergraph JOINT Model (DHJM). These models preserve essential structural properties of directed hypergraphs such as node in- and out-degree sequences and hyperedge head and tail size sequences, or their joint tensor. We also describe two efficient MCMC algorithms, NuDHy-Degs and NuDHy-JOINT, to sample random hypergraphs from these ensembles. To showcase the interdisciplinary applicability of the proposed null models, we present three distinct use cases in sociology, epidemiology, and economics. First, we reveal the oscillatory behavior of increased homophily in opposition parties in the US Congress over a 40-year span, emphasizing the role of higher-order structures in quantifying political group homophily. Second, we investigate non-linear contagion in contact hyper-networks, demonstrating that disparities between simulations and theoretical predictions can be explained by considering higher-order joint degree distributions. Last, we examine the economic complexity of countries in the global trade network, showing that local network properties preserved by NuDHy explain the main structural economic complexity indexes. This work pioneers the development of null models for directed hypergraphs, addressing the intricate challenges posed by their complex entity relations, and providing a versatile suite of tools for researchers across various domains.

Such processes can often be accurately modeled via stochastic differential equations (SDEs), which naturally imply causal relationships via \"which variables enter the differential of which other variables\". In this paper, we develop a kernel-based test of conditional independence (CI) on \"path-space\" -- solutions to SDEs -- by leveraging recent advances in signature kernels. We demonstrate strictly superior performance of our proposed CI test compared to existing approaches on path-space. Then, we develop constraint-based causal discovery algorithms for acyclic stochastic dynamical systems (allowing for loops) that leverage temporal information to recover the entire directed graph. Assuming faithfulness and a CI oracle, our algorithm is sound and complete. We empirically verify that our developed CI test in conjunction with the causal discovery algorithm reliably outperforms baselines across a range of settings. ",

    "abstract": "Open-set graph learning is a practical task that aims to classify the known class nodes and to identify unknown class samples as unknowns. Conventional node classification methods usually perform unsatisfactorily in open-set scenarios due to the complex data they encounter, such as out-of-distribution (OOD) data and in-distribution (IND) noise. OOD data are samples that do not belong to any known classes. They are outliers if they occur in training (OOD noise), and open-set samples if they occur in testing. IND noise are training samples which are assigned incorrect labels. The existence of IND noise and OOD noise is prevalent, which usually cause the ambiguity problem, including the intra-class variety problem and the inter-class confusion problem. Thus, to explore robust open-set learning methods is necessary and difficult, and it becomes even more difficult for non-IID graph data.To this end, we propose a unified framework named ROG$_{PL}$ to achieve robust open-set learning on complex noisy graph data, by introducing prototype learning. In specific, ROG$_{PL}$ consists of two modules, i.e., denoising via label propagation and open-set prototype learning via regions. The first module corrects noisy labels through similarity-based label propagation and removes low-confidence samples, to solve the intra-class variety problem caused by noise. The second module learns open-set prototypes for each known class via non-overlapped regions and remains both interior and border prototypes to remedy the inter-class confusion problem.The two modules are iteratively updated under the constraints of classification loss and prototype diversity loss. To the best of our knowledge, the proposed ROG$_{PL}$ is the first robust open-set node classification method for graph data with complex noise. ",

Since the attackers' goal is typically to maximize the system damage, we assume they solve an adversarial optimal control problem. An adaptive resilience factor is then designed as a function of the intensity function of a Hawkes process, a point process model estimating the occurrence of random events in time, trained on a moving window to estimate the return time of the next attack. We demonstrate the resulting MPC strategy's effectiveness in 2 attack scenarios on a real system with actual data, the regulated Olginate dam of Lake Como. ",

    "abstract": "A major goal in neuroscience is to discover neural data representations that generalize. This goal is challenged by variability along recording sessions (e.g. environment), subjects (e.g. varying neural structures), and sensors (e.g. sensor noise), among others. Recent work has begun to address generalization across sessions and subjects, but few study robustness to sensor failure which is highly prevalent in neuroscience experiments. In order to address these generalizability dimensions we first collect our own electroencephalography dataset with numerous sessions, subjects, and sensors, then study two time series models: EEGNet (Lawhern et al., 2018) and TOTEM (Talukder et al., 2024). EEGNet is a widely used convolutional neural network, while TOTEM is a discrete time series tokenizer and transformer model. We find that TOTEM outperforms or matches EEGNet across all generalizability cases. Finally through analysis of TOTEM's latent codebook we observe that tokenization enables generalization. ",

    "abstract": "Next-token prediction (NTP), the go-to training paradigm in training large language models, involves predicting the next token in a sequence. Departing from traditional one-hot classification, in NTP, multiple tokens with varying frequencies follow each given context. This work frames NTP training as cross-entropy minimization over distinct contexts, each associated with a sparse empirical probability vector across a finite vocabulary. It then addresses the following question: do gradient-based optimizers exhibit a bias towards solutions with specific structure as the NTP training loss reaches its lower bound (entropy)? Specifically, for linear NTP models trained using gradient descent (GD), we make the following contributions: Firstly, we determine NTP-separability conditions on the data, under which GD can attain its lower bound. We also demonstrate that these conditions hold under overparameterization. Secondly, we establish that the parameters of GD projected onto an appropriate data subspace converge to the unique solution of a system of linear equations, which requires the logits' difference of in-support tokens to be equal to the log-ratio of their respective probabilities. Meanwhile, on the orthogonal subspace, the parameters diverge and converge in the direction of the solution of a max-margin quadratic program, minimizing the Euclidean norm of parameters satisfying the \\NTP-separability conditions. Akin to prior research on implicit bias of one-hot classification, our work opens exciting avenues for future research that can lead to better understanding optimization, generalization and robustness principles of models trained with NTP.

    "abstract": "In Federated Learning (FL), devices that participate in the training usually have heterogeneous resources, i.e., energy availability. In current deployments of FL, devices that do not fulfill certain hardware requirements are often dropped from the collaborative training. However, dropping devices in FL can degrade training accuracy and introduce bias or unfairness. Several works have tacked this problem on an algorithmic level, e.g., by letting constrained devices train a subset of the server neural network (NN) model. However, it has been observed that these techniques are not effective w.r.t. accuracy. Importantly, they make simplistic assumptions about devices' resources via indirect metrics such as multiply accumulate (MAC) operations or peak memory requirements. In this work, for the first time, we consider on-device accelerator design for FL with heterogeneous devices. We utilize compressed arithmetic formats and approximate computing, targeting to satisfy limited energy budgets. Using a hardware-aware energy model, we observe that, contrary to the state of the art's moderate energy reduction, our technique allows for lowering the energy requirements (by 4x) while maintaining higher accuracy.

Then, we split the classical BEV detection architecture into two stages and propose an uneven BEV grid design to handle the convergence instability caused by the aforementioned challenges. Moreover, we develop a sparse BEV feature projection strategy to reduce computational cost and a unified domain alignment method to handle heterogeneous domains. Combining these techniques, a unified detector UniMODE is derived, which surpasses the previous state-of-the-art on the challenging Omni3D dataset (a large-scale dataset including both indoor and outdoor scenes) by 4.9% AP_3D, revealing the first successful generalization of a BEV detector to unified 3D object detection.

    "abstract": "Self-supervised approaches for electroencephalography (EEG) representation learning face three specific challenges inherent to EEG data: (1) The low signal-to-noise ratio which challenges the quality of the representation learned, (2) The wide range of amplitudes from very small to relatively large due to factors such as the inter-subject variability, risks the models to be dominated by higher amplitude ranges, and (3) The absence of explicit segmentation in the continuous-valued sequences which can result in less informative representations. To address these challenges, we introduce EEG2Rep, a self-prediction approach for self-supervised representation learning from EEG. Two core novel components of EEG2Rep are as follows: 1) Instead of learning to predict the masked input from raw EEG, EEG2Rep learns to predict masked input in latent representation space, and 2) Instead of conventional masking methods, EEG2Rep uses a new semantic subsequence preserving (SSP) method which provides informative masked inputs to guide EEG2Rep to generate rich semantic representations. In experiments on 6 diverse EEG tasks with subject variability, EEG2Rep significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods. We show that our semantic subsequence preserving improves the existing masking methods in self-prediction literature and find that preserving 50\\% of EEG recordings will result in the most accurate results on all 6 tasks on average. Finally, we show that EEG2Rep is robust to noise addressing a significant challenge that exists in EEG data. Models and code are available at: https://github.com/Navidfoumani/EEG2Rep ",

    "abstract": "We consider the problem of dynamic channel allocation (DCA) in cognitive communication networks with the goal of maximizing a global signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) measure under a specified target quality of service (QoS)-SINR for each network. The shared bandwidth is partitioned into K channels with frequency separation. In contrast to the majority of existing studies that assume perfect orthogonality or a one- to-one user-channel allocation mapping, this paper focuses on real-world systems experiencing inter-carrier interference (ICI) and channel reuse by multiple large-scale networks. This realistic scenario significantly increases the problem dimension, rendering existing algorithms inefficient. We propose a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning (RL) framework for distributed DCA, named Channel Allocation RL To Overlapped Networks (CARLTON). The CARLTON framework is based on the Centralized Training with Decentralized Execution (CTDE) paradigm, utilizing the DeepMellow value-based RL algorithm. To ensure robust performance in the interference-laden environment we address, CARLTON employs a low-dimensional representation of observations, generating a QoS-type measure while maximizing a global SINR measure and ensuring the target QoS-SINR for each network. Our results demonstrate exceptional performance and robust generalization, showcasing superior efficiency compared to alternative state-of-the-art methods, while achieving a marginally diminished performance relative to a fully centralized approach.

The UTG is a UWB-based proximity service that provides a seamless gate pass system without requiring real-time mobile device (MD) tapping. The location of MD is calculated using DL-TDoA, and the MD communicates with the nearest UTG using DS-TWR to open the gate. Therefore, the knowledge about the exact location of MD is the main challenge of UTG, and hence we provide the solutions for both DL-TDoA and DS-TWR. In this paper, we propose dynamic anchor selection for extremely accurate DL-TDoA localization and pose prediction for DS-TWR, called DynaPose. The pose is defined as the actual location of MD on the human body, which affects the localization accuracy. DynaPose is based on line-of-sight (LOS) and non-LOS (NLOS) classification using deep learning for anchor selection and pose prediction. Deep learning models use the UWB channel impulse response and the inertial measurement unit embedded in the smartphone. DynaPose is implemented on Samsung Galaxy Note20 Ultra and Qorvo UWB board to show the feasibility and applicability. DynaPose achieves a LOS/NLOS classification accuracy of 0.984, 62% higher DL-TDoA localization accuracy, and ultimately detects four different poses with an accuracy of 0.961 in real-time. ",

The method involves training a set of base models on bootstrap samples from the training data, followed by a meta-learner trained on the base model outputs and true labels to find an optimal aggregation scheme. The experimental evaluation demonstrates significant improvements over other state-of-the-art machine learning methods on the validation set. Specifically, BagStacking achieved a MAP score of 0.306, outperforming LightGBM (0.234) and classic Stacking (0.286). Additionally, the run-time of BagStacking was measured at 3828 seconds, illustrating an efficient approach compared to Regular Stacking's 8350 seconds.

However, noisy and missing modalities are a common issue in real-world clinical settings. In this study, we propose a comprehensive pipeline aiming to compensate for the missing or noisy modalities when performing sleep apnea detection. Unlike other existing studies, our proposed model works with any combination of available modalities. Our experiments show that the proposed model outperforms other state-of-the-art approaches in sleep apnea detection using various subsets of available data and different levels of noise, and maintains its high performance (AUROC>0.9) even in the presence of high levels of noise or missingness.

We use double-boundary hyper-boxes to represent granules, and customize the adaptation procedures to enhance the robustness of outer boxes for data coverage and noise suppression, while ensuring that inner boxes remain flexible to capture drifts. The classifier evolves from scratch, incorporates new classes on the fly, and performs local incremental feature weighting. As an application, we focus on the classification of emotion-related patterns within electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. Emotion recognition is crucial for enhancing the realism and interactivity of computer systems. We extract features from the Fourier spectrum of EEG signals obtained from 28 individuals engaged in playing computer games -- a public dataset. Each game elicits a different predominant emotion: boredom, calmness, horror, or joy. We analyze individual electrodes, time window lengths, and frequency bands to assess the accuracy and interpretability of resulting user-independent neural models. The findings indicate that both brain hemispheres assist classification, especially electrodes on the temporal (T8) and parietal (P7) areas, alongside contributions from frontal and occipital electrodes. While patterns may manifest in any band, the Alpha (8-13Hz), Delta (1-4Hz), and Theta (4-8Hz) bands, in this order, exhibited higher correspondence with the emotion classes. The eGNN-C+ demonstrates effectiveness in learning EEG data. It achieves an accuracy of 81.7% and a 0.0029 II interpretability using 10-second time windows, even in face of a highly-stochastic time-varying 4-class classification problem. ",

Now we have an opportunity to test the validity of the laws governing planetary systems and take steps to discover the relationships between the physical parameters of planets and stars. Firstly, we present the results of a search for additional exoplanets in 229 multi-planetary systems that house at least three or more confirmed planets, employing a logarithmic spacing between planets in our Solar System known as the Titius-Bode (TB) relation. We find that the planets in $\\sim53\\%$ of these systems adhere to a logarithmic spacing relation remarkably better than the Solar System planets. We predict the presence of 426 additional exoplanets, 47 of which are located within the habitable zone (HZ), and five of the 47 planets have a maximum mass limit of 0.1-2$M_{\\oplus}$ and a maximum radius lower than 1.25$R_{\\oplus}$. Secondly, we employ efficient machine learning approaches to analyze a dataset comprising 762 confirmed exoplanets and eight Solar System planets, aiming to characterize their fundamental quantities. We classify the data into two main classes: 'small' and 'giant' planets, with cut-off values at $R_{p}=8.13R_{\\oplus}$ and $M_{p}=52.48M_{\\oplus}$. Giant planets have lower densities, suggesting higher H-He mass fractions, while small planets are denser, composed mainly of heavier elements. We highlight that planetary mass, orbital period, and stellar mass play crucial roles in predicting exoplanet radius.

We propose the neural infinite impulse response filter field (NIIRF) method that instead estimates the coefficients of cascaded IIR filters. IIR filters mimic the modal nature of HRTFs, thus needing fewer coefficients to approximate them well compared to FIR filters. We find that our method can match the performance of existing NF-based methods on multiple datasets, even outperforming them when measurements are sparse.

    "abstract": "Extracting information efficiently from quantum systems is a major component of quantum information processing tasks. Randomized measurements, or classical shadows, enable predicting many properties of arbitrary quantum states using few measurements. While random single qubit measurements are experimentally friendly and suitable for learning low-weight Pauli observables, they perform poorly for nonlocal observables. Prepending a shallow random quantum circuit before measurements maintains this experimental friendliness, but also has favorable sample complexities for observables beyond low-weight Paulis, including high-weight Paulis and global low-rank properties such as fidelity. However, in realistic scenarios, quantum noise accumulated with each additional layer of the shallow circuit biases the results. To address these challenges, we propose the robust shallow shadows protocol. Our protocol uses Bayesian inference to learn the experimentally relevant noise model and mitigate it in postprocessing. This mitigation introduces a bias-variance trade-off: correcting for noise-induced bias comes at the cost of a larger estimator variance. Despite this increased variance, as we demonstrate on a superconducting quantum processor, our protocol correctly recovers state properties such as expectation values, fidelity, and entanglement entropy, while maintaining a lower sample complexity compared to the random single qubit measurement scheme. We also theoretically analyze the effects of noise on sample complexity and show how the optimal choice of the shallow shadow depth varies with noise strength. This combined theoretical and experimental analysis positions the robust shallow shadow protocol as a scalable, robust, and sample-efficient protocol for characterizing quantum states on current quantum computing platforms.

This is made possible with three main features, namely, model order reduction, a long short-term memory (LSTM) networks, and Newton's second law (e.g., the equation of motion). Model order reduction is essential for handling structural systems with inherent redundancy and enhancing model efficiency. The LSTM network captures temporal dependencies, enabling accurate prediction of time series responses. The equation of motion is manipulated to learn system nonlinearities and confines the solution space within physically interpretable results. These features enable model training with relatively sparse data and offer benefits in terms of accuracy, interpretability, and robustness. Furthermore, a dataset of seismically designed archetype ductile planar steel moment resistant frames under horizontal seismic loading, available in the DesignSafe-CI Database, is considered for evaluation of the proposed method. The resulting metamodel is capable of handling more complex data compared to existing physics-guided LSTM models and outperforms other non-physics data-driven neural networks. ",

    "abstract": "Grant-free random access (RA) has been recognized as a promising solution to support massive connectivity due to the removal of the uplink grant request procedures. While most endeavours assume perfect synchronization among users and the base station, this paper investigates asynchronous grant-free massive RA, and develop efficient algorithms for joint user activity detection, synchronization delay detection, and channel estimation. Considering the sparsity on user activity, we formulate a sparse signal recovery problem and propose to utilize the framework of orthogonal approximate message passing (OAMP) to deal with the non-independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) Gaussian pilot matrices caused by the synchronization delays. In particular, an OAMP-based algorithm is developed to fully harness the common sparsity among received pilot signals from multiple base station antennas. To reduce the computational complexity, we further propose a free probability AMP (FPAMP)-based algorithm, which exploits the rectangular free cumulants to make the cost-effective AMP framework compatible to general pilot matrices. Simulation results demonstrate that the two proposed algorithms outperform various baselines, and the FPAMP-based algorithm reduces 40% of the computations while maintaining comparable detection/estimation accuracy with the OAMP-based algorithm.

    "abstract": "With the increasing demand for audiovisual services, telecom service providers and application developers are compelled to ensure that their services provide the best possible user experience. Particularly, services such as videoconferencing are very sensitive to network conditions. Therefore, their performance should be monitored in real time in order to adjust parameters to any network perturbation. In this paper, we developed a parametric model for estimating the perceived audiovisual quality in videoconference services. Our model is developed with the nonlinear autoregressive exogenous (NARX) recurrent neural network and estimates the perceived quality in terms of mean opinion score (MOS). We validate our model using the publicly available INRS bitstream audiovisual quality dataset. This dataset contains bitstream parameters such as loss per frame, bit rate and video duration. We compare the proposed model against state-of-the-art methods based on machine learning and show our model to outperform these methods in terms of mean square error (MSE=0.150) and Pearson correlation coefficient (R=0.931) ",

Low-light scenes pose two distinct challenges: information loss due to insufficient illumination and undesirable brightness shifts. Low-light image enhancement (LLIE) refers to image enhancement technology tailored to handle this scenario. We introduce CPGA-Net, an innovative LLIE network that combines dark/bright channel priors and gamma correction via deep learning and integrates features inspired by the Atmospheric Scattering Model and the Retinex Theory. This approach combines the use of traditional and deep learning methodologies, designed within a simple yet efficient architectural framework that focuses on essential feature extraction. The resulting CPGA-Net is a lightweight network with only 0.025 million parameters and 0.030 seconds for inference time, yet it achieves superior performance over existing LLIE methods on both objective and subjective evaluation criteria. Furthermore, we utilized knowledge distillation with explainable factors and proposed an efficient version that achieves 0.018 million parameters and 0.006 seconds for inference time. The proposed approaches inject new solution ideas into LLIE, providing practical applications in challenging low-light scenarios. ",

    "abstract": "Implicit neural representations (INRs) have emerged as a promising approach for video storage and processing, showing remarkable versatility across various video tasks. However, existing methods often fail to fully leverage their representation capabilities, primarily due to inadequate alignment of intermediate features during target frame decoding. This paper introduces a universal boosting framework for current implicit video representation approaches. Specifically, we utilize a conditional decoder with a temporal-aware affine transform module, which uses the frame index as a prior condition to effectively align intermediate features with target frames. Besides, we introduce a sinusoidal NeRV-like block to generate diverse intermediate features and achieve a more balanced parameter distribution, thereby enhancing the model's capacity. With a high-frequency information-preserving reconstruction loss, our approach successfully boosts multiple baseline INRs in the reconstruction quality and convergence speed for video regression, and exhibits superior inpainting and interpolation results. Further, we integrate a consistent entropy minimization technique and develop video codecs based on these boosted INRs. Experiments on the UVG dataset confirm that our enhanced codecs significantly outperform baseline INRs and offer competitive rate-distortion performance compared to traditional and learning-based codecs.

These curvatures have a rich mathematical theory and they have recently found success as a tool to analyze networks across a wide range of domains. In this work, we consider the problem of constructing graphs with a prescribed set of discrete edge curvatures, and explore the space of such graphs. We address this problem in two ways: first, we develop an evolutionary algorithm to sample graphs with discrete curvatures close to a given set. We use this algorithm to explore how other network statistics vary when constrained by the discrete curvatures in the network. Second, we solve the exact reconstruction problem for the specific case of Forman-Ricci curvature. By leveraging the theory of Markov bases, we obtain a finite set of rewiring moves that connects the space of all graphs with a fixed discrete curvature. ",

    "abstract": "Neural fields, also known as implicit neural representations (INRs), have shown a remarkable capability of representing, generating, and manipulating various data types, allowing for continuous data reconstruction at a low memory footprint. Though promising, INRs applied to video compression still need to improve their rate-distortion performance by a large margin, and require a huge number of parameters and long training iterations to capture high-frequency details, limiting their wider applicability. Resolving this problem remains a quite challenging task, which would make INRs more accessible in compression tasks. We take a step towards resolving these shortcomings by introducing neural representations for videos NeRV++, an enhanced implicit neural video representation, as more straightforward yet effective enhancement over the original NeRV decoder architecture, featuring separable conv2d residual blocks (SCRBs) that sandwiches the upsampling block (UB), and a bilinear interpolation skip layer for improved feature representation. NeRV++ allows videos to be directly represented as a function approximated by a neural network, and significantly enhance the representation capacity beyond current INR-based video codecs. We evaluate our method on UVG, MCL JVC, and Bunny datasets, achieving competitive results for video compression with INRs. This achievement narrows the gap to autoencoder-based video coding, marking a significant stride in INR-based video compression research. ",

In this paper, we built Cox proportional hazard (CoxPH) models that predict the recurrence free survival (RFS) of oropharyngeal HNC patients. Our models utilise both clinical information and multimodal radiomics features extracted from tumour regions in Computed Tomography (CT) and Positron Emission Tomography (PET). Furthermore, we were one of the first studies to explore the impact of segmentation accuracy on the predictive power of the extracted radiomics features, through under- and over-segmentation study. Our models were trained using the HEad and neCK TumOR (HECKTOR) challenge data, and the best performing model achieved a concordance index (C-index) of 0.74 for the model utilising clinical information and multimodal CT and PET radiomics features, which compares favourably with the model that only used clinical information (C-index of 0.67). Our under- and over-segmentation study confirms that segmentation accuracy affects radiomics extraction, however, it affects PET and CT differently. ",
