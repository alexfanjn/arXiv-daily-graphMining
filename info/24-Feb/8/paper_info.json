    "abstract": "Memory-based Dynamic Graph Neural Networks (MDGNNs) are a family of dynamic graph neural networks that leverage a memory module to extract, distill, and memorize long-term temporal dependencies, leading to superior performance compared to memory-less counterparts. However, training MDGNNs faces the challenge of handling entangled temporal and structural dependencies, requiring sequential and chronological processing of data sequences to capture accurate temporal patterns. During the batch training, the temporal data points within the same batch will be processed in parallel, while their temporal dependencies are neglected. This issue is referred to as temporal discontinuity and restricts the effective temporal batch size, limiting data parallelism and reducing MDGNNs' flexibility in industrial applications. This paper studies the efficient training of MDGNNs at scale, focusing on the temporal discontinuity in training MDGNNs with large temporal batch sizes. We first conduct a theoretical study on the impact of temporal batch size on the convergence of MDGNN training. Based on the analysis, we propose PRES, an iterative prediction-correction scheme combined with a memory coherence learning objective to mitigate the effect of temporal discontinuity, enabling MDGNNs to be trained with significantly larger temporal batches without sacrificing generalization performance. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach enables up to a 4x larger temporal batch (3.4x speed-up) during MDGNN training. ",

    "title": "LightHGNN: Distilling Hypergraph Neural Networks into MLPs for  $100\\times$ Faster Inference",
    "abstract": "Hypergraph Neural Networks (HGNNs) have recently attracted much attention and exhibited satisfactory performance due to their superiority in high-order correlation modeling. However, it is noticed that the high-order modeling capability of hypergraph also brings increased computation complexity, which hinders its practical industrial deployment. In practice, we find that one key barrier to the efficient deployment of HGNNs is the high-order structural dependencies during inference. In this paper, we propose to bridge the gap between the HGNNs and inference-efficient Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLPs) to eliminate the hypergraph dependency of HGNNs and thus reduce computational complexity as well as improve inference speed. Specifically, we introduce LightHGNN and LightHGNN$^+$ for fast inference with low complexity. LightHGNN directly distills the knowledge from teacher HGNNs to student MLPs via soft labels, and LightHGNN$^+$ further explicitly injects reliable high-order correlations into the student MLPs to achieve topology-aware distillation and resistance to over-smoothing. Experiments on eight hypergraph datasets demonstrate that even without hypergraph dependency, the proposed LightHGNNs can still achieve competitive or even better performance than HGNNs and outperform vanilla MLPs by $16.3$ on average. Extensive experiments on three graph datasets further show the average best performance of our LightHGNNs compared with all other methods. Experiments on synthetic hypergraphs with 5.5w vertices indicate LightHGNNs can run $100\\times$ faster than HGNNs, showcasing their ability for latency-sensitive deployments. ",

    "abstract": "Ensuring traffic safety is crucial, which necessitates the detection and prevention of road surface defects. As a result, there has been a growing interest in the literature on the subject, leading to the development of various road surface defect detection methods. The methods for detecting road defects can be categorised in various ways depending on the input data types or training methodologies. The predominant approach involves image-based methods, which analyse pixel intensities and surface textures to identify defects. Despite their popularity, image-based methods share the distinct limitation of vulnerability to weather and lighting changes. To address this issue, researchers have explored the use of additional sensors, such as laser scanners or LiDARs, providing explicit depth information to enable the detection of defects in terms of scale and volume. However, the exploration of data beyond images has not been sufficiently investigated. In this survey paper, we provide a comprehensive review of road surface defect detection studies, categorising them based on input data types and methodologies used. Additionally, we review recently proposed non-image-based methods and discuss several challenges and open problems associated with these techniques. ",

We introduce a novel \"adaptive visual sector\" mechanism that mimics the dynamic allocation of attention human drivers exhibit based on factors like spatial orientation, proximity, and driving speed. Additionally, we develop a \"dynamic traffic graph\" using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Graph Attention Networks (GAT) to capture spatio-temporal dependencies among agents.

Despite their transforming impact, DNNs face two critical challenges: the vulnerability to adversarial attacks and the increasing computational costs associated with more complex and larger models. In this paper, we introduce an effective method designed to simultaneously enhance adversarial robustness and execution efficiency. Unlike prior studies that enhance robustness via uniformly injecting noise, we introduce a non-uniform noise injection algorithm, strategically applied at each DNN layer to disrupt adversarial perturbations introduced in attacks. By employing approximation techniques, our approach identifies and protects essential neurons while strategically introducing noise into non-essential neurons. Our experimental results demonstrate that our method successfully enhances both robustness and efficiency across several attack scenarios, model architectures, and datasets. ",

We also extend the DSB to discrete domains by proving an equivalence between token $n$-gram frequencies and the moments of embedding vectors, and by finding empirical evidence for the bias in LLMs. Finally we use optimal transport methods to surgically edit the low-order statistics of one class to match those of another, and show that early-training networks treat the edited samples as if they were drawn from the target class.

We argue that the overall objective of the framework reveals an underlying interconnection between two regression models in the encoding and decoding layers. We propose a solution to the nested regressions problem by summarizing their dependence on two regularization terms that are jointly optimized. Our extensive experiments on different datasets and various machine learning models, including LeNet5, RepVGG, and Vision Transformer (ViT), demonstrate that NeRCC accurately approximates the original predictions in a wide range of stragglers, outperforming the state-of-the-art by up to 23%.

In addition, while synthetic graph generation has become pivotal for privacy and scalability considerations, the impact of generative learning algorithms on the structural bias has not yet been investigated. Motivated by this, this work focuses on the analysis and mitigation of structural bias for both real and synthetic graphs. Specifically, we first theoretically analyze the sources of structural bias that result in disparity for the predictions of dyadic relations. To alleviate the identified bias factors, we design a novel fairness regularizer that offers a versatile use. Faced with the bias amplification in graph generation models that is brought to light in this work, we further propose a fair graph generation framework, FairWire, by leveraging our fair regularizer design in a generative model.

This paper describes and develops the technical details for the LC Method, and then shows how the LC Method works through a numerical example. The quadratic LC method described here can be extended to polynomials in one variable of degree greater than two, in order to find initial approximations to their roots.

Addressing this critical issue, our study introduces innovative methodologies for estimating the traffic load of sleeping SBSs in a vHetNet including the integration of a high altitude platform as a super macro base station into the terrestrial network. We propose three distinct spatial interpolation-based estimation schemes: clustering-based, distance based, and random neighboring selection. Employing a real data set for empirical validations, we compare the estimation performance of the developed traffic load estimation schemes and assess the impact of estimation errors. Our findings demonstrate that accurate estimation of sleeping SBSs' traffic loads is essential for making network power consumption optimization methods both feasible and applicable in vHetNets. ",

Without introducing more trainable parameters, this effective mechanism can significantly improve the accuracy of PINNs. The proposed architecture is evaluated on four benchmark examples (Allan-Cahn equation, Helmholtz equation, Burgers equation and 1D convection equation). Comparisons between the proposed architecture and different PINN structures demonstrate the superior performance of the DM-PINN in both accuracy and efficiency. ",

It is challenging because clients often have non-independent and identically distributed (non-iid) data, leading to potentially noisy or divergent updates. The risk of malicious clients amplifies the challenge especially when there's no access to clients' local data or a benchmark root dataset. In this paper, we introduce a novel method called Fair, Robust, and Efficient Client Assessment (FRECA) for quantifying client contributions in FL. FRECA employs a framework called FedTruth to estimate the global model's ground truth update, balancing contributions from all clients while filtering out impacts from malicious ones. This approach is robust against Byzantine attacks and incorporates a Byzantine-resilient aggregation algorithm. FRECA is also efficient, as it operates solely on local model updates and requires no validation operations or datasets. Our experimental results show that FRECA can accurately and efficiently quantify client contributions in a robust manner. ",

The rewards of arms are homogeneous among the clients, following time-invariant stochastic distributions that are revealed to the participants only when the system is secure enough. The system's objective is to efficiently ensure the cumulative rewards gained by the honest participants. To this end and to the best of our knowledge, we are the first to incorporate advanced techniques from blockchains, as well as novel mechanisms, into the system to design optimal strategies for honest participants. This allows various malicious behaviors and the maintenance of participant privacy. More specifically, we randomly select a pool of validators who have access to all participants, design a brand-new consensus mechanism based on digital signatures for these validators, invent a UCB-based strategy that requires less information from participants through secure multi-party computation, and design the chain-participant interaction and an incentive mechanism to encourage participants' participation. Notably, we are the first to prove the theoretical guarantee of the proposed algorithms by regret analyses in the context of optimality in blockchains. Unlike existing work that integrates blockchains with learning problems such as federated learning which mainly focuses on numerical optimality, we demonstrate that the regret of honest participants is upper bounded by $log{T}$.

Conventional computing architectures face challenges in meeting the demanding processing requirements of compute-intensive CNN applications, as they suffer from limited throughput and low utilization. To this end, specialized accelerators have been developed to speed up CNN computations. However, as we demonstrate in this paper via extensive design space exploration, different neural network models have different characteristics, which calls for different accelerator architectures and configurations to match their computing demand. We show that a one-size-fits-all fixed architecture does not guarantee optimal power/energy/performance trade-off. To overcome this challenge, this paper proposes ARMAN, a novel reconfigurable systolic-array-based accelerator architecture based on Monolithic 3D (M3D) technology for CNN inference. The proposed accelerator offers the flexibility to reconfigure among different scale-up or scale-out arrangements depending on the neural network structure, providing the optimal trade-off across power, energy, and performance for various neural network models. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through evaluations of multiple benchmarks. The results demonstrate that the proposed accelerator exhibits up to 2x, 2.24x, 1.48x, and 2x improvements in terms of execution cycles, power, energy, and EDP respectively, over the non-configurable architecture.

    "abstract": "Pretraining on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) has shown great power in facilitating various downstream tasks. As pretraining generally requires huge amount of data and computational resources, the pretrained GNNs are high-value Intellectual Properties (IP) of the legitimate owner. However, adversaries may illegally copy and deploy the pretrained GNN models for their downstream tasks. Though initial efforts have been made to watermark GNN classifiers for IP protection, these methods require the target classification task for watermarking, and thus are not applicable to self-supervised pretraining of GNN models. Hence, in this work, we propose a novel framework named PreGIP to watermark the pretraining of GNN encoder for IP protection while maintain the high-quality of the embedding space. PreGIP incorporates a task-free watermarking loss to watermark the embedding space of pretrained GNN encoder. A finetuning-resistant watermark injection is further deployed. Theoretical analysis and extensive experiments show the effectiveness of {\\method} in IP protection and maintaining high-performance for downstream tasks. ",

    "abstract": "One of the most fundamental problems in tiling theory is the domino problem: given a set of tiles and tiling rules, decide if there exists a way to tile the plane using copies of tiles and following their rules. The problem is known to be undecidable in general and even for sets of Wang tiles, which are unit square tiles wearing colours on their edges which can be assembled provided they share the same colour on their common edge, as proven by Berger in the 1960s. In this paper, we focus on Wang tilesets. We prove that the domino problem is decidable for robust tilesets, i.e. tilesets that either cannot tile the plane or can but, if so, satisfy some particular invariant provably. We establish that several famous tilesets considered in the literature are robust. We give arguments that this is true for all tilesets unless they are produced from non-robust Turing machines: a Turing machine is said to be non-robust if it does not halt and furthermore does so non-provably. As a side effect of our work, we provide a sound and relatively complete method for proving that a tileset can tile the plane. Our analysis also provides explanations for the observed similarities between proofs in the literature for various tilesets, as well as of phenomena that have been observed experimentally in the systematic study of tilesets using computer methods.

We then use a multivariate version of the mutual information called the total correlation, to construct a latent factor representation of the data within each cluster to learn the local HOIs. We use Local CorEx to explore HOIs in synthetic and real world data to extract hidden insights about the data structure.

    "abstract": "Spectrum sharing between terrestrial 5G and incumbent networks in the satellite bands presents a promising avenue to satisfy the ever-increasing bandwidth demand of the next-generation wireless networks. However, protecting incumbent operations from harmful interference poses a fundamental challenge in accommodating terrestrial broadband cellular networks in the satellite bands. State-of-the-art spectrum-sharing policies usually consider several worst-case assumptions and ignore site-specific contextual factors in making spectrum-sharing decisions, and thus, often results in under-utilization of the shared band for the secondary licensees. To address such limitations, this paper introduces CAT3S (Context-Aware Terrestrial-Satellite Spectrum Sharing) framework that empowers the coexisting terrestrial 5G network to maximize utilization of the shared satellite band without creating harmful interference to the incumbent links by exploiting the contextual factors. CAT3S consists of the following two components: (i) context-acquisition unit to collect and process essential contextual information for spectrum sharing and (ii) context-aware base station (BS) control unit to optimize the set of operational BSs and their operation parameters (i.e., transmit power and active beams per sector). To evaluate the performance of the CAT3S, a realistic spectrum coexistence case study over the 12 GHz band is considered. Experiment results demonstrate that the proposed CAT3S achieves notably higher spectrum utilization than state-of-the-art spectrum-sharing policies in different weather contexts. ",

However, lacking introspection into the 5G Radio Access Network (RAN), cloud gaming servers are ill-poised to cope with the vagaries of the wireless last hop to a mobile client, while 5G network operators run mostly closed networks, limiting their potential for co-design with the wider internet and user applications. This paper presents Telesa, a passive, incrementally-deployable, and independently-deployable Standalone 5G network telemetry system that streams fine-grained RAN capacity, latency, and retransmission information to application servers to enable better millisecond scale, application-level decisions on offered load and bit rate adaptation than end-to-end latency measurements or end-to-end packet losses currently permit. We design, implement, and evaluate a Telesa telemetry-enhanced game streaming platform, demonstrating exact congestion-control that can better adapt game video bitrate while simultaneously controlling end-to-end latency, thus maximizing game quality of experience. Our experimental evaluation on a production 5G Standalone network demonstrates a 178-249% Quality of Experience improvement versus two state-of-the-art cloud gaming applications. ",

Fairness aims to reduce model bias for social/demographic sub-groups. Privacy via differential privacy (DP) mechanisms, on the other hand, limits the impact of any individual's training data on the resulting model. The trade-offs between privacy and fairness goals of trustworthy ML pose a challenge to those wishing to address both. We show that DP amplifies gender, racial, and religious bias when fine-tuning large language models (LLMs), producing models more biased than ones fine-tuned without DP. We find the cause of the amplification to be a disparity in convergence of gradients across sub-groups. Through the case of binary gender bias, we demonstrate that Counterfactual Data Augmentation (CDA), a known method for addressing bias, also mitigates bias amplification by DP. As a consequence, DP and CDA together can be used to fine-tune models while maintaining both fairness and privacy. ",

    "abstract": "Next-gen networks require significant evolution of management to enable automation and adaptively adjust network configuration based on traffic dynamics. The advent of software-defined networking (SDN) and programmable switches enables flexibility and programmability. However, traditional techniques that decide traffic policies are usually based on hand-crafted programming optimization and heuristic algorithms. These techniques make non-realistic assumptions, e.g., considering static network load and topology, to obtain tractable solutions, which are inadequate for next-gen networks. In this paper, we design and develop a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approach for adaptive traffic routing. We design a deep graph convolutional neural network (DGCNN) integrated into the DRL framework to learn the traffic behavior from not only the network topology but also link and node attributes. We adopt the Deep Q-Learning technique to train the DGCNN model in the DRL framework without the need for a labeled training dataset, enabling the framework to quickly adapt to traffic dynamics. The model leverages q-value estimates to select the routing path for every traffic flow request, balancing exploration and exploitation. We perform extensive experiments with various traffic patterns and compare the performance of the proposed approach with the Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) protocol. The experimental results show the effectiveness and adaptiveness of the proposed framework by increasing the network throughput by up to 7.8% and reducing the traffic delay by up to 16.1% compared to OSPF.

The robustness of SOT faces two main challenges: tiny target and fast motion. These challenges are especially manifested in videos captured by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV), where the target is usually far away from the camera and often with significant motion relative to the camera. To evaluate the robustness of SOT methods, we propose BioDrone -- the first bionic drone-based visual benchmark for SOT. Unlike existing UAV datasets, BioDrone features videos captured from a flapping-wing UAV system with a major camera shake due to its aerodynamics. BioDrone hence highlights the tracking of tiny targets with drastic changes between consecutive frames, providing a new robust vision benchmark for SOT. To date, BioDrone offers the largest UAV-based SOT benchmark with high-quality fine-grained manual annotations and automatically generates frame-level labels, designed for robust vision analyses. Leveraging our proposed BioDrone, we conduct a systematic evaluation of existing SOT methods, comparing the performance of 20 representative models and studying novel means of optimizing a SOTA method (KeepTrack KeepTrack) for robust SOT. Our evaluation leads to new baselines and insights for robust SOT. Moving forward, we hope that BioDrone will not only serve as a high-quality benchmark for robust SOT, but also invite future research into robust computer vision.

Unlike previous research focused on small-scale and object-centric NeRF reconstruction, our approach addresses multiple challenges, including (1) Addressing the issue of slow training and rendering associated with large models. (2) Meeting the computational demands necessitated by modeling a substantial number of images, requiring extensive resources such as high-performance GPUs. (3) Overcoming significant artifacts and low visual fidelity commonly observed in large-scale reconstruction tasks due to limited model capacity.

This decomposition approach not only decouples rendering time from the scene size but also enables rendering to scale seamlessly to arbitrarily large environments. Moreover, it allows for per-block updates of the environment, enhancing the flexibility and adaptability of the reconstruction process. Additionally, we propose a projection-guided novel view re-rendering strategy, which aids in effectively utilizing the independently trained sub-scenes to generate superior rendering results. We evaluate our approach on existing datasets as well as against our own drone footage, improving reconstruction speed by 10x over classical photogrammetry software and 50x over state-of-the-art large-scale NeRF solution, on a single GPU with similar rendering quality.

Most existing methods based on Reinforcement Learning (RL) are difficult to implement in the real world due to unrealistic assumptions, such as having access to environment dynamics, reward signals, and online interactions with the environment. To address these limitations, we propose an unsupervised method named Offline Imitation Learning based Anomaly Detection (OIL-AD), which detects anomalies in decision-making sequences using two extracted behaviour features: action optimality and sequential association. Our offline learning model is an adaptation of behavioural cloning with a transformer policy network, where we modify the training process to learn a Q function and a state value function from normal trajectories. We propose that the Q function and the state value function can provide sufficient information about agents' behavioural data, from which we derive two features for anomaly detection. The intuition behind our method is that the action optimality feature derived from the Q function can differentiate the optimal action from others at each local state, and the sequential association feature derived from the state value function has the potential to maintain the temporal correlations between decisions (state-action pairs). Our experiments show that OIL-AD can achieve outstanding online anomaly detection performance with up to 34.8% improvement in F1 score over comparable baselines. ",

    "abstract": "On the Stack Overflow (SO) Q&A site, users often request solutions to their code-related problems (e.g., errors, unexpected behavior). Unfortunately, they often miss required code snippets during their question submission, which could prevent their questions from getting prompt and appropriate answers. In this study, we conduct an empirical study investigating the cause & effect of missing code snippets in SO questions whenever required. Here, our contributions are threefold. First, we analyze how the presence or absence of required code snippets affects the correlation between question types (missed code, included code after requests & had code snippets during submission) and corresponding answer meta-data (e.g., presence of an accepted answer). According to our analysis, the chance of getting accepted answers is three times higher for questions that include required code snippets during their question submission than those that missed the code. We also investigate whether the confounding factors (e.g., user reputation) affect questions receiving answers besides the presence or absence of required code snippets. We found that such factors do not hurt the correlation between the presence or absence of required code snippets and answer meta-data. Second, we surveyed 64 practitioners to understand why users miss necessary code snippets. About 60% of them agree that users are unaware of whether their questions require any code snippets. Third, we thus extract four text-based features (e.g., keywords) and build six ML models to identify the questions that need code snippets. Our models can predict the target questions with 86.5% precision, 90.8% recall, 85.3% F1-score, and 85.2% overall accuracy.

Insights from the visualization highlight the potential of Gini Impurity and MI-based feature selection to enhance ransomware detection systems by effectively discriminating between ransomware classes. The analysis reveals that approximately 68% of ransomware incidents involve BTC transactions within the range of 1.46 to 2.56, with an average of 2.01 BTC transactions per attack. The findings emphasize the dynamic and adaptable nature of ransomware demands, suggesting that there is no fixed amount for specific cyberattacks, highlighting the evolving landscape of ransomware threats.

    "abstract": "Algorithms designed for addressing typical supervised classification problems can only learn from a fixed set of samples and labels, making them unsuitable for the real world, where data arrives as a stream of samples often associated with multiple labels over time. This motivates the study of task-agnostic continual multi-label learning problems. While algorithms using deep learning approaches for continual multi-label learning have been proposed in the recent literature, they tend to be computationally heavy. Although spiking neural networks (SNNs) offer a computationally efficient alternative to artificial neural networks, existing literature has not used SNNs for continual multi-label learning. Also, accurately determining multiple labels with SNNs is still an open research problem. This work proposes a dual output spiking architecture (DOSA) to bridge these research gaps. A novel imbalance-aware loss function is also proposed, improving the multi-label classification performance of the model by making it more robust to data imbalance. A modified F1 score is presented to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed loss function in handling imbalance. Experiments on several benchmark multi-label datasets show that DOSA trained with the proposed loss function shows improved robustness to data imbalance and obtains better continual multi-label learning performance than CIFDM, a previous state-of-the-art algorithm.

Due to the nonlinearity of neural networks, these methods often lack satisfactory theoretical justification. In this work, we rigorously discuss the convergence of a successful unsupervised approach that utilizes untrained convolutional neural networks to represent solutions to linear ill-posed problems. Untrained neural networks have particular appeal for many applications because they do not require paired training data. The regularization property of the approach relies solely on the architecture of the neural network instead. Due to the vast over-parameterization of the employed neural network, suitable early stopping is essential for the success of the method. We establish that the classical discrepancy principle is an adequate method for early stopping of two-layer untrained convolutional neural networks learned by gradient descent, and furthermore, it yields an approximation with minimax optimal convergence rates. Numerical results are also presented to illustrate the theoretical findings. ",

The feature shuffle, intuitively, perturbs the dependence between graph topology and features (A-X dependence) for GNNs to learn from. Surprisingly, we observe a consistent and significant improvement in GNN performance following the feature shuffle. Having overlooked the impact of A-X dependence on GNNs, the prior literature does not provide a satisfactory understanding of the phenomenon. Thus, we raise two research questions. First, how should A-X dependence be measured, while controlling for potential confounds? Second, how does A-X dependence affect GNNs? In response, we (i) propose a principled measure for A-X dependence, (ii) design a random graph model that controls A-X dependence, (iii) establish a theory on how A-X dependence relates to graph convolution, and (iv) present empirical analysis on real-world graphs that aligns with the theory. We conclude that A-X dependence mediates the effect of graph convolution, such that smaller dependence improves GNN-based node classification. ",

To overcome this challenge, in this study, we evaluate several strategies for fine-tuning the OpenLlama LLM for question answering over life science knowledge graphs. In particular, we propose an end-to-end data augmentation approach for extending a set of existing queries over a given knowledge graph towards a larger dataset of semantically enriched question-to-SPARQL query pairs, enabling fine-tuning even for datasets where these pairs are scarce. In this context, we also investigate the role of semantic \"clues\" in the queries, such as meaningful variable names and inline comments. Finally, we evaluate our approach over the real-world Bgee gene expression knowledge graph and we show that semantic clues can improve model performance by up to 33% compared to a baseline with random variable names and no comments included.

However, most existing open-vocabulary detectors learn by aligning region embeddings with categorical labels (e.g., bicycle) only, disregarding the capability of VLMs on aligning visual embeddings with fine-grained text description of object parts (e.g., pedals and bells). This paper presents DVDet, a Descriptor-Enhanced Open Vocabulary Detector that introduces conditional context prompts and hierarchical textual descriptors that enable precise region-text alignment as well as open-vocabulary detection training in general. Specifically, the conditional context prompt transforms regional embeddings into image-like representations that can be directly integrated into general open vocabulary detection training. In addition, we introduce large language models as an interactive and implicit knowledge repository which enables iterative mining and refining visually oriented textual descriptors for precise region-text alignment. Extensive experiments over multiple large-scale benchmarks show that DVDet outperforms the state-of-the-art consistently by large margins. ",

Enhancing the capabilities of NeRFs in open-vocabulary 3D semantic perception tasks has been a recent focus. However, current methods that extract semantics directly from Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) for semantic field learning encounter difficulties due to noisy and view-inconsistent semantics provided by CLIP. To tackle these limitations, we propose OV-NeRF, which exploits the potential of pre-trained vision and language foundation models to enhance semantic field learning through proposed single-view and cross-view strategies. First, from the single-view perspective, we introduce Region Semantic Ranking (RSR) regularization by leveraging 2D mask proposals derived from SAM to rectify the noisy semantics of each training view, facilitating accurate semantic field learning. Second, from the cross-view perspective, we propose a Cross-view Self-enhancement (CSE) strategy to address the challenge raised by view-inconsistent semantics. Rather than invariably utilizing the 2D inconsistent semantics from CLIP, CSE leverages the 3D consistent semantics generated from the well-trained semantic field itself for semantic field training, aiming to reduce ambiguity and enhance overall semantic consistency across different views. Extensive experiments validate our OV-NeRF outperforms current state-of-the-art methods, achieving a significant improvement of 20.31% and 18.42% in mIoU metric on Replica and Scannet, respectively. Furthermore, our approach exhibits consistent superior results across various CLIP configurations, further verifying its robustness. ",

To hinder them, most defenses alter how models are trained (e.g., adversarial training) or inference is made (e.g., randomized smoothing). Still, while these approaches markedly improve models' adversarial robustness, models remain highly susceptible to adversarial examples. Identifying that, in certain domains such as traffic-sign recognition, objects are implemented per standards specifying how artifacts (e.g., signs) should be designed, we propose a novel approach for improving adversarial robustness. Specifically, we offer a method to redefine standards, making minor changes to existing ones, to defend against adversarial examples. We formulate the problem of artifact design as a robust optimization problem, and propose gradient-based and greedy search methods to solve it. We evaluated our approach in the domain of traffic-sign recognition, allowing it to alter traffic-sign pictograms (i.e., symbols within the signs) and their colors. We found that, combined with adversarial training, our approach led to up to 25.18\\% higher robust accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods against two adversary types, while further increasing accuracy on benign inputs.

The surrogate gradients method is commonly used to train SNNs, but often comes with an accuracy disadvantage over ANNs counterpart.

Moreover, we propose the Complementary Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (CLIF) Neuron. CLIF creates extra paths to facilitate the backpropagation in computing temporal gradient while keeping binary output. CLIF is hyperparameter-free and features broad applicability. Extensive experiments on a variety of datasets demonstrate CLIF's clear performance advantage over other neuron models.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we focus on a realistic yet challenging task, Single Domain Generalization Object Detection (S-DGOD), where only one source domain's data can be used for training object detectors, but have to generalize multiple distinct target domains. In S-DGOD, both high-capacity fitting and generalization abilities are needed due to the task's complexity. Differentiable Neural Architecture Search (NAS) is known for its high capacity for complex data fitting and we propose to leverage Differentiable NAS to solve S-DGOD. However, it may confront severe over-fitting issues due to the feature imbalance phenomenon, where parameters optimized by gradient descent are biased to learn from the easy-to-learn features, which are usually non-causal and spuriously correlated to ground truth labels, such as the features of background in object detection data. Consequently, this leads to serious performance degradation, especially in generalizing to unseen target domains with huge domain gaps between the source domain and target domains. To address this issue, we propose the Generalizable loss (G-loss), which is an OoD-aware objective, preventing NAS from over-fitting by using gradient descent to optimize parameters not only on a subset of easy-to-learn features but also the remaining predictive features for generalization, and the overall framework is named G-NAS. Experimental results on the S-DGOD urban-scene datasets demonstrate that the proposed G-NAS achieves SOTA performance compared to baseline methods.

However, targeting the training dataset must be thought of as auxiliary in the same sense that the training set is an approximate substitute for the population distribution, and the latter is the data of interest. Yet despite its popularity, an aspect that remains unexplored is the relationship of DD to its generalization, particularly across uncommon subgroups. That is, how can we ensure that a model trained on the synthetic dataset performs well when faced with samples from regions with low population density? Here, the representativeness and coverage of the dataset become salient over the guaranteed training error at inference. Drawing inspiration from distributionally robust optimization, we introduce an algorithm that combines clustering with the minimization of a risk measure on the loss to conduct DD.

We compare different analog-to-digital converter (ADC) parametrizations in a fair manner by keeping the ADC power consumption constant. Here, 1-, 2-, and 3-bit quantization is investigated with different oversampling factors. We analytically compute the statistics of the detection variable, and we propose the optimal as well as several suboptimal detection schemes for arbitrary quantization resolutions. Then, we evaluate the symbol error rate (SER) of the different detectors for a 16- and a 64-ary quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) constellation. The results indicate that there is a noticeable performance degradation of the suboptimal detection schemes compared to the optimal scheme when the constellation size is larger than the number of quantization levels. Furthermore, at low signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs), 1-bit quantization outperforms 2- and 3-bit quantization, respectively, even when employing higher-order constellations. We confirm our analytical results by Monte Carlo simulations. Both a pure line-of-sight (LoS) and a more realistically modeled indoor THz channel are considered. Then, we optimize the input signal constellation with respect to SER for 1-bit quantization. The results show that the minimum SER can be lowered significantly for 16-QAM by increasing the distance between the inner and outer points of the input constellation. For larger constellations, however, the achievable reduction of the minimum SER is much smaller compared to 16-QAM. ",

    "abstract": "The detection of echolocation clicks is key in understanding the intricate behaviors of cetaceans and monitoring their populations. Cetacean species relying on clicks for navigation, foraging and even communications are sperm whales (Physeter macrocephalus) and a variety of dolphin groups. Echolocation clicks are wideband signals of short duration that are often emitted in sequences of varying inter-click-intervals. While datasets and models for clicks exist, the detection and classification of clicks present a significant challenge, mostly due to the diversity of clicks' structures, overlapping signals from simultaneously emitting animals, and the abundance of noise transients from, for example, snapping shrimps and shipping cavitation noise. This paper provides a survey of the many detection and classification methodologies of clicks, ranging from 2002 to 2023. We divide the surveyed techniques into categories by their methodology. Specifically, feature analysis (e.g., phase, ICI and duration), frequency content, energy based detection, supervised and unsupervised machine learning, template matching and adaptive detection approaches. Also surveyed are open access platforms for click detections, and databases openly available for testing. Details of the method applied for each paper are given along with advantages and limitations, and for each category we analyze the remaining challenges. The paper also includes a performance comparison for several schemes over a shared database. Finally, we provide tables summarizing the existing detection schemes in terms of challenges address, methods, detection and classification tools applied, features used and applications. ",

    "title": "Progressive Gradient Flow for Robust N:M Sparsity Training in  Transformers",
    "abstract": "N:M Structured sparsity has garnered significant interest as a result of relatively modest overhead and improved efficiency. Additionally, this form of sparsity holds considerable appeal for reducing the memory footprint owing to their modest representation overhead. There have been efforts to develop training recipes for N:M structured sparsity, they primarily focus on low-sparsity regions ($\\sim$50\\%). Nonetheless, performance of models trained using these approaches tends to decline when confronted with high-sparsity regions ($>$80\\%). In this work, we study the effectiveness of existing sparse training recipes at \\textit{high-sparsity regions} and argue that these methods fail to sustain the model quality on par with low-sparsity regions. We demonstrate that the significant factor contributing to this disparity is the presence of elevated levels of induced noise in the gradient magnitudes. To mitigate this undesirable effect, we employ decay mechanisms to progressively restrict the flow of gradients towards pruned elements. Our approach improves the model quality by up to 2$\\%$ and 5$\\%$ in vision and language models at high sparsity regime, respectively. We also evaluate the trade-off between model accuracy and training compute cost in terms of FLOPs. At iso-training FLOPs, our method yields better performance compared to conventional sparse training recipes, exhibiting an accuracy improvement of up to 2$\\%$.

This is supported by phenotypic plasticity: individuals sharing the same genotype that is expressed differently for different classes of individuals, each specializing in one task. In this work, we evolve a swarm of simulated robots with phenotypic plasticity to study the emergence of specialized collective behavior during an emergent perception task. Phenotypic plasticity is realized in the form of heterogeneity of behavior by dividing the genotype into two components, with one different neural network controller associated to each component. The whole genotype, expressing the behavior of the whole group through the two components, is subject to evolution with a single fitness function. We analyse the obtained behaviors and use the insights provided by these results to design an online regulatory mechanism. Our experiments show three main findings: 1) The sub-groups evolve distinct emergent behaviors. 2) The effectiveness of the whole swarm depends on the interaction between the two sub-groups, leading to a more robust performance than with singular sub-group behavior. 3) The online regulatory mechanism enhances overall performance and scalability.

In this paper, we aim to leverage these capabilities to support the training of reinforcement learning (RL) agents. In principle, VLMs are well suited for this purpose, as they can naturally analyze image-based observations and provide feedback (reward) on learning progress. However, inference in VLMs is computationally expensive, so querying them frequently to compute rewards would significantly slowdown the training of an RL agent. To address this challenge, we propose a framework named Code as Reward (VLM-CaR). VLM-CaR produces dense reward functions from VLMs through code generation, thereby significantly reducing the computational burden of querying the VLM directly. We show that the dense rewards generated through our approach are very accurate across a diverse set of discrete and continuous environments, and can be more effective in training RL policies than the original sparse environment rewards.

In this work, we propose to model social motion forecasting in a shared human-robot representation space, which facilitates us to synthesize robot motions that interact with humans in social scenarios despite not observing any robot in the motion training. We develop a transformer-based architecture called ECHO, which operates in the aforementioned shared space to predict the future motions of the agents encountered in social scenarios. Contrary to prior works, we reformulate the social motion problem as the refinement of the predicted individual motions based on the surrounding agents, which facilitates the training while allowing for single-motion forecasting when only one human is in the scene. We evaluate our model in multi-person and human-robot motion forecasting tasks and obtain state-of-the-art performance by a large margin while being efficient and performing in real-time. Additionally, our qualitative results showcase the effectiveness of our approach in generating human-robot interaction behaviors that can be controlled via text commands. ",

To address this issue, we propose hierarchical motion planning and robust control strategy using the front-active steering system in complex scenarios with various slippery road adhesion coefficients while considering vehicle uncertain parameters. Behaviors of human vehicles (HVs) are considered and modeled in the form of a car-following model via the Intelligent Driver Model (IDM). Then, in the upper layer, the motion planner first generates an optimal trajectory by using the artificial potential field (APF) algorithm to formulate any surrounding objects, e.g., road marks, boundaries, and static/dynamic obstacles. To track the generated optimal trajectory, in the lower layer, an offline-constrained output feedback robust model predictive control (RMPC) is employed for the linear parameter varying (LPV) system by applying linear matrix inequality (LMI) optimization method that ensures the robustness against the model parameter uncertainties. Furthermore, by augmenting the system model, our proposed approach, called offline RMPC, achieves outstanding efficiency compared to three existing RMPC approaches, e.g., offset-offline RMPC, online RMPC, and offline RMPC without an augmented model (offline RMPC w/o AM), in both improving computing time and reducing input vibrations.

    "abstract": "The decoder-only Transformer architecture with causal masking and relative position encoding (RPE) has become the de facto choice in language modeling. Despite its exceptional performance across various tasks, we have identified two limitations: First, it requires all attention scores to be non-zero and sum up to 1, even if the current embedding has sufficient self-contained information. This compels the model to assign disproportional excessive attention to specific tokens. Second, RPE-based Transformers are not universal approximators due to their limited capacity at encoding absolute positional information, which limits their application in position-critical tasks. In this work, we propose StableMask: a parameter-free method to address both limitations by refining the causal mask. It introduces pseudo-attention values to balance attention distributions and encodes absolute positional information via a progressively decreasing mask ratio. StableMask's effectiveness is validated both theoretically and empirically, showing significant enhancements in language models with parameter sizes ranging from 71M to 1.4B across diverse datasets and encoding methods. We further show that it naturally supports (1) efficient extrapolation without special tricks such as StreamingLLM and (2) easy integration with existing attention optimization techniques. ",

Our findings indicate that periodically activated networks are \\textit{notably more well-behaved}, from the NTK perspective, than ReLU activated networks. Additionally, we give an application to the memorization capacity of such networks and verify our theoretical predictions empirically.

Noisy PLL (NPLL) relaxes this constraint by allowing some partial labels to not contain the true label, enhancing the practicality of the problem. Our work centers on NPLL and presents a minimalistic framework called SARI that initially assigns pseudo-labels to images by exploiting the noisy partial labels through a weighted nearest neighbour algorithm. These pseudo-label and image pairs are then used to train a deep neural network classifier with label smoothing and standard regularization techniques. The classifier's features and predictions are subsequently employed to refine and enhance the accuracy of pseudo-labels. SARI combines the strengths of Average Based Strategies (in pseudo labelling) and Identification Based Strategies (in classifier training) from the literature. We perform thorough experiments on seven datasets and compare SARI against nine NPLL and PLL methods from the prior art.

Central to our approach is that we reconceive time-series forecasting as a self-supervised, multi-patch prediction task, which, compared to traditional mask-and-reconstruction methods, captures temporal dynamics in patch representations more effectively. Our strategy encompasses two-stage training: (i). a causal continual pre-training phase on various time-series datasets, anchored on next patch prediction, effectively syncing LLM capabilities with the intricacies of time-series data; (ii). fine-tuning for multi-patch prediction in the targeted time-series context.

Such a design directly transposes individual patches into temporal sequences, thereby significantly bolstering the model's proficiency in mastering temporal patch-based representations. aLLM4TS demonstrates superior performance in several downstream tasks, proving its effectiveness in deriving temporal representations with enhanced transferability and marking a pivotal advancement in the adaptation of LLMs for time-series analysis.

In this paper, we consider explicitly modeling the generation process of states with the causal graphical model, based on which we augment the policy. We formulate the causal structure updating into the RL interaction process with active intervention learning of the environment. To optimize the derived objective, we propose a framework with theoretical performance guarantees that alternates between two steps: using interventions for causal structure learning during exploration and using the learned causal structure for policy guidance during exploitation. Due to the lack of public benchmarks that allow direct intervention in the state space, we design the root cause localization task in our simulated fault alarm environment and then empirically show the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method against state-of-the-art baselines. Theoretical analysis shows that our performance improvement attributes to the virtuous cycle of causal-guided policy learning and causal structure learning, which aligns with our experimental results.

We propose to consider nilpotent base vectors with a nilpotency index of two. In these spaces, denoted $Cl_{p,q,r}$, allows generalizing over approaches based on dual numbers (which cannot be modelled using $Cl_{p,q}$) and capturing patterns that emanate from the absence of higher-order interactions between real and complex parts of entity embeddings. We design two new models for the discovery of the parameters $p$, $q$, and $r$. The first model uses a greedy search to optimize $p$, $q$, and $r$. The second predicts $(p, q,r)$ based on an embedding of the input knowledge graph computed using neural networks. The results of our evaluation on seven benchmark datasets suggest that nilpotent vectors can help capture embeddings better. Our comparison against the state of the art suggests that our approach generalizes better than other approaches on all datasets w.r.t. the MRR it achieves on validation data.

To achieve a focus on learning shape features, the textures are randomized during the rendering of the training data. By treating the texture as noise, the need for real-world object instances or their final appearance during training data generation is eliminated. The TLESS and ITODD datasets, specifically created for industrial settings in robotics and featuring textureless and metallic objects, were used for evaluation. Texture agnosticity also increases the robustness against image perturbations such as imaging noise, motion blur, and brightness changes, which are common in robotics applications.

    "title": "Toward Accurate Camera-based 3D Object Detection via Cascade Depth  Estimation and Calibration",
    "abstract": "Recent camera-based 3D object detection is limited by the precision of transforming from image to 3D feature spaces, as well as the accuracy of object localization within the 3D space. This paper aims to address such a fundamental problem of camera-based 3D object detection: How to effectively learn depth information for accurate feature lifting and object localization. Different from previous methods which directly predict depth distributions by using a supervised estimation model, we propose a cascade framework consisting of two depth-aware learning paradigms. First, a depth estimation (DE) scheme leverages relative depth information to realize the effective feature lifting from 2D to 3D spaces. Furthermore, a depth calibration (DC) scheme introduces depth reconstruction to further adjust the 3D object localization perturbation along the depth axis. In practice, the DE is explicitly realized by using both the absolute and relative depth optimization loss to promote the precision of depth prediction, while the capability of DC is implicitly embedded into the detection Transformer through a depth denoising mechanism in the training phase. The entire model training is accomplished through an end-to-end manner. We propose a baseline detector and evaluate the effectiveness of our proposal with +2.2%/+2.7% NDS/mAP improvements on NuScenes benchmark, and gain a comparable performance with 55.9%/45.7% NDS/mAP. Furthermore, we conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate its generality based on various detectors with about +2% NDS improvements. ",

    "abstract": "Autonomous robots are often employed for data collection due to their efficiency and low labour costs. A key task in robotic data acquisition is planning paths through an initially unknown environment to collect observations given platform-specific resource constraints, such as limited battery life. Adaptive online path planning in 3D environments is challenging due to the large set of valid actions and the presence of unknown occlusions. To address these issues, we propose a novel deep reinforcement learning approach for adaptively replanning robot paths to map targets of interest in unknown 3D environments. A key aspect of our approach is a dynamically constructed graph that restricts planning actions local to the robot, allowing us to quickly react to newly discovered obstacles and targets of interest. For replanning, we propose a new reward function that balances between exploring the unknown environment and exploiting online-collected data about the targets of interest. Our experiments show that our method enables more efficient target detection compared to state-of-the-art learning and non-learning baselines. We also show the applicability of our approach for orchard monitoring using an unmanned aerial vehicle in a photorealistic simulator. ",

TAP is a novel network timing method that aims to achieve sub-microsecond synchronization over air interface. This paper investigates the improvement and end-to-end realization of TAP. This paper first analyzes the effectiveness and deficiencies of TAP by establishing an equivalent clock model which evaluates TAP from timing error composition and allan variance. Second, this paper proposes a detailed base station and terminal design and the corresponding improvement of TAP. Both hardware compensation and protocol software design are taken into account so as to minimize timing error and system cost while maximizing compatibility with 3GPP. Finally, this paper presents a TAP end-to-end 5G prototype system developed based on software defined radio base station and COTS baseband module. The field test results show that the proposed scheme effectively solves the problems of TAP in application and robustly achieves 200ns level timing accuracy in various situations. The average accuracy with long observations can reach 1 nanosecond. It is 2$\\sim$3 orders of magnitude better than common network timing methods, including NTP, PTP and the original TAP. ",

Among 43717 SRGs from dataset by Edward Spence, proposed vertex invariants alone were able to distinguish all but 4 pairs of graphs, which were easily distinguished by further application of proposed edge invariants. Specifically, proposed vertex invariants are traces or sorted diagonals of $(A|_{N_a})^p$ adjacency matrix $A$ restricted to $N_a$ neighborhood of vertex $a$, already for $p=3$ distinguishing all SRGs from 6 out of 13 sets in this dataset, 8 if adding $p=4$.

As one of the most promising directions, graph condensation methods address these issues by employing gradient matching, aiming to condense the full graph into a more concise yet information-rich synthetic set. Though encouraging, these strategies primarily emphasize matching directions of the gradients, which leads to deviations in the training trajectories. Such deviations are further magnified by the differences between the condensation and evaluation phases, culminating in accumulated errors, which detrimentally affect the performance of the condensed graphs. In light of this, we propose a novel graph condensation method named \\textbf{C}raf\\textbf{T}ing \\textbf{R}ationa\\textbf{L} trajectory (\\textbf{CTRL}), which offers an optimized starting point closer to the original dataset's feature distribution and a more refined strategy for gradient matching.

We give a complete characterization of graphs $H$ for which CVD on $H$-free graphs is polynomially solvable and for which it is NP-complete.

    "abstract": "Deep neural networks have useful applications in many different tasks, however their performance can be severely affected by changes in the data distribution. For example, in the biomedical field, their performance can be affected by changes in the data (different machines, populations) between training and test datasets. To ensure robustness and generalization to real-world scenarios, test-time adaptation has been recently studied as an approach to adjust models to a new data distribution during inference. Test-time batch normalization is a simple and popular method that achieved compelling performance on domain shift benchmarks. It is implemented by recalculating batch normalization statistics on test batches. Prior work has focused on analysis with test data that has the same label distribution as the training data. However, in many practical applications this technique is vulnerable to label distribution shifts, sometimes producing catastrophic failure. This presents a risk in applying test time adaptation methods in deployment. We propose to tackle this challenge by only selectively adapting channels in a deep network, minimizing drastic adaptation that is sensitive to label shifts. Our selection scheme is based on two principles that we empirically motivate: (1) later layers of networks are more sensitive to label shift (2) individual features can be sensitive to specific classes. We apply the proposed technique to three classification tasks, including CIFAR10-C, Imagenet-C, and diagnosis of fatty liver, where we explore both covariate and label distribution shifts. We find that our method allows to bring the benefits of TTA while significantly reducing the risk of failure common in other methods, while being robust to choice in hyperparameters. ",

The evidence includes demonstrations showing that hate-text classifiers perform similarly to hate-meme classifiers in a zero-shot setting. Simultaneously, the introduction of captions generated from images of memes to the hate-meme classifier worsens performance by an average F1 of 0.02. Through blackbox explanations, we identify a substantial contribution of the text modality (average of 83%), which diminishes with the introduction of meme's image captions (52%). Additionally, our evaluation on a newly created confounder dataset reveals higher performance on text confounders as compared to image confounders with an average $\\Delta$F1 of 0.18. ",

Nevertheless, existing methods often fall short of accurately replicating the original graph for certain datasets, thereby failing to achieve the objective of lossless condensation. To understand this phenomenon, we investigate the potential reasons and reveal that the previous state-of-the-art trajectory matching method provides biased and restricted supervision signals from the original graph when optimizing the condensed one. This significantly limits both the scale and efficacy of the condensed graph. In this paper, we make the first attempt toward \\textit{lossless graph condensation} by bridging the previously neglected supervision signals. Specifically, we employ a curriculum learning strategy to train expert trajectories with more diverse supervision signals from the original graph, and then effectively transfer the information into the condensed graph with expanding window matching. Moreover, we design a loss function to further extract knowledge from the expert trajectories.

    "abstract": "This article presents a novel method for establishing an information theoretically secure encryption key over wireless channels. It exploits the fact that data transmission over wireless links is accompanied by packet error, while noise terms, and thereby the error events observed by two separate receivers are independent of each other. A number of data packets, with random data, are transmitted from a first legitimate node, say Alice, to a second legitimate node, say Bob. Bob identifies all packets that are received error-free in the first transmission attempt and sends their indices to Alice over a public channel. Then, both Alice and Bob mix the contents of identified packets, e.g., using a hash function, and thereby derive an identical encryption key. Since error events from Alice to Bob is independent of error events from Alice to Eve, the chances that Eve has successfully received all packets used in key generation error-free diminishes as the number of packet increases. In many wireless standards, the first stage in error detection and Automatic Repeat Request (ARQ) is deployed at the PHY/MAC (Physical Layer/Medium Access Control) layer. In such setups, the first re-transmission is manged by the PHY/MAC layer without informing higher layers. This makes it impossible to directly access the information related to packet errors through high-level programming interfaces available to an end-user. A method is presented for determining packets received error-free in first transmission attempts through high-level programming. Examples are presented in conjunction with an LTE cellular network. ",

The size of the observed neighborhood limits the generalizability to different graphs and affects the reactivity of agents, the quality of the selected actions, and the communication overhead. This work focuses on generalizability and resolves the trade-off in observed neighborhood size with a continuous information flow in the whole graph. We propose a recurrent message-passing model that iterates with the environment's steps and allows nodes to create a global representation of the graph by exchanging messages with their neighbors. Agents receive the resulting learned graph observations based on their location in the graph. Our approach can be used in a decentralized manner at runtime and in combination with a reinforcement learning algorithm of choice. We evaluate our method across 1000 diverse graphs in the context of routing in communication networks and find that it enables agents to generalize and adapt to changes in the graph. ",

Graph neural networks (GNN) are neural models that operate over graphs, enabling the model to leverage the complex relationships and dependencies in graph-structured data. A graph explanation is a subgraph which is an `almost sufficient' statistic of the input graph with respect to its classification label. Consequently, the classification label is invariant, with high probability, to perturbations of graph edges not belonging to its explanation subgraph. This work considers two methods for leveraging such perturbation invariances in the design and training of GNNs. First, explanation-assisted learning rules are considered. It is shown that the sample complexity of explanation-assisted learning can be arbitrarily smaller than explanation-agnostic learning. Next, explanation-assisted data augmentation is considered, where the training set is enlarged by artificially producing new training samples via perturbation of the non-explanation edges in the original training set. It is shown that such data augmentation methods may improve performance if the augmented data is in-distribution, however, it may also lead to worse sample complexity compared to explanation-agnostic learning rules if the augmented data is out-of-distribution.

    "abstract": "In the wake of increasing numbers of attacks on radio communication systems, a range of techniques are being deployed to increase the security of these systems. One such technique is radio fingerprinting, in which the transmitter can be identified and authenticated by observing small hardware differences expressed in the signal. Fingerprinting has been explored in particular in the defense of satellite systems, many of which are insecure and cannot be retrofitted with cryptographic security. In this paper, we evaluate the effectiveness of radio fingerprinting techniques under interference and jamming attacks, usually intended to deny service. By taking a pre-trained fingerprinting model and gathering a new dataset in which different levels of Gaussian noise and tone jamming have been added to the legitimate signal, we assess the attacker power required in order to disrupt the transmitter fingerprint such that it can no longer be recognized. We compare this to Gaussian jamming on the data portion of the signal, obtaining the remarkable result that transmitter fingerprints are still recognizable even in the presence of moderate levels of noise. Through deeper analysis of the results, we conclude that it takes a similar amount of jamming power in order to disrupt the fingerprint as it does to jam the message contents itself, so it is safe to include a fingerprinting system to authenticate satellite communication without opening up the system to easier denial-of-service attacks.

    "title": "Causal Representation Learning from Multiple Distributions: A General  Setting",
    "abstract": "In many problems, the measured variables (e.g., image pixels) are just mathematical functions of the hidden causal variables (e.g., the underlying concepts or objects). For the purpose of making predictions in changing environments or making proper changes to the system, it is helpful to recover the hidden causal variables $Z_i$ and their causal relations represented by graph $\\mathcal{G}_Z$. This problem has recently been known as causal representation learning. This paper is concerned with a general, completely nonparametric setting of causal representation learning from multiple distributions (arising from heterogeneous data or nonstationary time series), without assuming hard interventions behind distribution changes. We aim to develop general solutions in this fundamental case; as a by product, this helps see the unique benefit offered by other assumptions such as parametric causal models or hard interventions. We show that under the sparsity constraint on the recovered graph over the latent variables and suitable sufficient change conditions on the causal influences, interestingly, one can recover the moralized graph of the underlying directed acyclic graph, and the recovered latent variables and their relations are related to the underlying causal model in a specific, nontrivial way. In some cases, each latent variable can even be recovered up to component-wise transformations. Experimental results verify our theoretical claims. ",

    "abstract": "Topology optimization is a critical task in engineering design, where the goal is to optimally distribute material in a given space for maximum performance. We introduce Neural Implicit Topology Optimization (NITO), a novel approach to accelerate topology optimization problems using deep learning. NITO stands out as one of the first frameworks to offer a resolution-free and domain-agnostic solution in deep learning-based topology optimization. NITO synthesizes structures with up to seven times better structural efficiency compared to SOTA diffusion models and does so in a tenth of the time. In the NITO framework, we introduce a novel method, the Boundary Point Order-Invariant MLP (BPOM), to represent boundary conditions in a sparse and domain-agnostic manner, moving away from expensive simulation-based approaches. Crucially, NITO circumvents the domain and resolution limitations that restrict Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models to a structured domain of fixed size -- limitations that hinder the widespread adoption of CNNs in engineering applications. This generalizability allows a single NITO model to train and generate solutions in countless domains, eliminating the need for numerous domain-specific CNNs and their extensive datasets. Despite its generalizability, NITO outperforms SOTA models even in specialized tasks, is an order of magnitude smaller, and is practically trainable at high resolutions that would be restrictive for CNNs. This combination of versatility, efficiency, and performance underlines NITO's potential to transform the landscape of engineering design optimization problems through implicit fields. ",

    "abstract": "Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has shown great potential in enabling robots to find certain objects (e.g., `find a fridge') in environments like homes or schools. This task is known as Object-Goal Navigation (ObjectNav). DRL methods are predominantly trained and evaluated using environment simulators. Although DRL has shown impressive results, the simulators may be biased or limited. This creates a risk of shortcut learning, i.e., learning a policy tailored to specific visual details of training environments. We aim to deepen our understanding of shortcut learning in ObjectNav, its implications and propose a solution. We design an experiment for inserting a shortcut bias in the appearance of training environments. As a proof-of-concept, we associate room types to specific wall colors (e.g., bedrooms with green walls), and observe poor generalization of a state-of-the-art (SOTA) ObjectNav method to environments where this is not the case (e.g., bedrooms with blue walls). We find that shortcut learning is the root cause: the agent learns to navigate to target objects, by simply searching for the associated wall color of the target object's room. To solve this, we propose Language-Based (L-B) augmentation. Our key insight is that we can leverage the multimodal feature space of a Vision-Language Model (VLM) to augment visual representations directly at the feature-level, requiring no changes to the simulator, and only an addition of one layer to the model. Where the SOTA ObjectNav method's success rate drops 69%, our proposal has only a drop of 23%. ",

    "abstract": "We study the optimal transport (OT) problem for measures supported on a graph metric space. Recently, Le et al. (2022) leverage the graph structure and propose a variant of OT, namely Sobolev transport (ST), which yields a closed-form expression for a fast computation. However, ST is essentially coupled with the $L^p$ geometric structure within its definition which makes it nontrivial to utilize ST for other prior structures. In contrast, the classic OT has the flexibility to adapt to various geometric structures by modifying the underlying cost function. An important instance is the Orlicz-Wasserstein (OW) which moves beyond the $L^p$ structure by leveraging the \\emph{Orlicz geometric structure}. Comparing to the usage of standard $p$-order Wasserstein, OW remarkably helps to advance certain machine learning approaches. Nevertheless, OW brings up a new challenge on its computation due to its two-level optimization formulation. In this work, we leverage a specific class of convex functions for Orlicz structure to propose the generalized Sobolev transport (GST). GST encompasses the ST as its special case, and can be utilized for prior structures beyond the $L^p$ geometry. In connection with the OW, we show that one only needs to simply solve a univariate optimization problem to compute the GST, unlike the complex two-level optimization problem in OW. We empirically illustrate that GST is several-order faster than the OW. Moreover, we provide preliminary evidences on the advantages of GST for document classification and for several tasks in topological data analysis. ",

    "abstract": "Radiotherapy is a primary treatment for cancers with the aim of applying sufficient radiation dose to the planning target volume (PTV) while minimizing dose hazards to the organs at risk (OARs). Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have automated the radiotherapy plan-making by predicting the dose maps. However, current CNN-based methods ignore the remarkable dose difference in the dose map, i.e., high dose value in the interior PTV while low value in the exterior PTV, leading to a suboptimal prediction. In this paper, we propose a triplet-constraint transformer (TCtrans) with multi-scale refinement to predict the high-quality dose distribution. Concretely, a novel PTV-guided triplet constraint is designed to refine dose feature representations in the interior and exterior PTV by utilizing the explicit geometry of PTV. Furthermore, we introduce a multi-scale refinement (MSR) module to effectively fulfill the triplet constraint in different decoding layers with multiple scales. Besides, a transformer encoder is devised to learn the important global dosimetric knowledge. Experiments on a clinical cervical cancer dataset demonstrate the superiority of our method. ",

This work is set on the existence of one (or multiple) soft information sources, independent of the network considered, assuming this extra knowledge is modeled by a vector of fuzzy sets (or a family of vectors). This information may represent, for example, how much some people agree with a specific law, or their position against several politicians. We emphasize the importance of being able to manage the vagueness which usually appears in real life because of the common use of linguistic terms. Then, we propose a constructive method to build fuzzy measures from fuzzy sets. These measures are the basis of a new representation model which combines the information of a network with that of fuzzy sets, specifically when it comes to linguistic terms. We propose a specific application of that model in terms of finding communities in a network with additional soft information. To do so, we propose an efficient algorithm and measure its performance by means of a benchmarking process, obtaining high-quality results. ",

We numerically test our decoder and show that for a large range of lattice sizes and noise levels it delivers a logical error probability that outperforms the Minimal-Weight-Perfect-Matching (MWPM) decoder, sometimes by more than an order of magnitude.

In this study, we employ complex-valued neural networks to estimate room transfer functions in the frequency range of the first room resonances, using a few irregularly distributed microphones. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time complex-valued neural networks are used to estimate room transfer functions. To analyze the benefits of applying complex-valued optimization to the considered task, we compare the proposed technique with a state-of-the-art real-valued neural network method and a state-of-the-art kernel-based signal processing approach for sound field reconstruction, showing that the proposed technique exhibits relevant advantages in terms of phase accuracy and overall quality of the reconstructed sound field.

We characterize exactly how adapting to the data is crucial for the network to efficiently learn non-linear functions in the direction of the gradient -- where at initialization it can only express linear functions in this regime. To our knowledge, our results provides the first tight description of the impact of feature learning in the generalization of two-layer neural networks in the large learning rate regime $\\eta=\\Theta_{d}(d)$, beyond perturbative finite width corrections of the conjugate and neural tangent kernels.

In this paper, a novel solving mode is proposed for characterizing multiscale dynamics through a decoupling method. By modelling large-scale dynamics independently and treating small-scale dynamics as a slaved system, a Spectral PINN is developed to approach the small-scale system in an orthogonal basis functional space. The effectiveness of the method is demonstrated through extensive numerical experiments, including one-dimensional Kuramot-Sivashinsky (KS) equation, two- and three-dimensional Navier-Stokes (NS) equations, showcasing its versatility in addressing problems of fluid dynamics. Furthermore, we also delve into the application of the proposed approach to more complex problems, including non-uniform meshes, complex geometries, large-scale data with noise, and high-dimensional small-scale dynamics. The discussions about these scenarios contribute to a comprehensive understanding of the method's capabilities and limitations. This novel decoupling approach simplifies the analysis and prediction of spatiotemporal systems, where large-scale data can be obtained with low computational demands, followed by Spectral PINNs for capturing small-scale dynamics with improved efficiency and accuracy.
