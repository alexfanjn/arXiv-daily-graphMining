    "abstract": "Behavior cloning of expert demonstrations can speed up learning optimal policies in a more sample-efficient way over reinforcement learning. However, the policy cannot extrapolate well to unseen states outside of the demonstration data, creating covariate shift (agent drifting away from demonstrations) and compounding errors. In this work, we tackle this issue by extending the region of attraction around the demonstrations so that the agent can learn how to get back onto the demonstrated trajectories if it veers off-course. We train a generative backwards dynamics model and generate short imagined trajectories from states in the demonstrations. By imitating both demonstrations and these model rollouts, the agent learns the demonstrated paths and how to get back onto these paths. With optimal or near-optimal demonstrations, the learned policy will be both optimal and robust to deviations, with a wider region of attraction. On continuous control domains, we evaluate the robustness when starting from different initial states unseen in the demonstration data. While both our method and other imitation learning baselines can successfully solve the tasks for initial states in the training distribution, our method exhibits considerably more robustness to different initial states.

    "abstract": "Pretraining a language model (LM) on text has been shown to help various downstream NLP tasks. Recent works show that a knowledge graph (KG) can complement text data, offering structured background knowledge that provides a useful scaffold for reasoning. However, these works are not pretrained to learn a deep fusion of the two modalities at scale, limiting the potential to acquire fully joint representations of text and KG. Here we propose DRAGON (Deep Bidirectional Language-Knowledge Graph Pretraining), a self-supervised approach to pretraining a deeply joint language-knowledge foundation model from text and KG at scale. Specifically, our model takes pairs of text segments and relevant KG subgraphs as input and bidirectionally fuses information from both modalities. We pretrain this model by unifying two self-supervised reasoning tasks, masked language modeling and KG link prediction. DRAGON outperforms existing LM and LM+KG models on diverse downstream tasks including question answering across general and biomedical domains, with +5% absolute gain on average. In particular, DRAGON achieves notable performance on complex reasoning about language and knowledge (+10% on questions involving long contexts or multi-step reasoning) and low-resource QA (+8% on OBQA and RiddleSense), and new state-of-the-art results on various BioNLP tasks.

    "abstract": "The concerning rise of hateful content on online platforms has increased the attention towards automatic hate speech detection, commonly formulated as a supervised classification task. State-of-the-art deep learning-based approaches usually require a substantial amount of labeled resources for training. However, annotating hate speech resources is expensive, time-consuming, and often harmful to the annotators. This creates a pressing need to transfer knowledge from the existing labeled resources to low-resource hate speech corpora with the goal of improving system performance. For this, neighborhood-based frameworks have been shown to be effective. However, they have limited flexibility. In our paper, we propose a novel training strategy that allows flexible modeling of the relative proximity of neighbors retrieved from a resource-rich corpus to learn the amount of transfer. In particular, we incorporate neighborhood information with Optimal Transport, which permits exploiting the geometry of the data embedding space. By aligning the joint embedding and label distributions of neighbors, we demonstrate substantial improvements over strong baselines, in low-resource scenarios, on different publicly available hate speech corpora.

However, how to generate adversarial examples with categorical data is an important problem but lack of extensive exploration. Previously established methods leverage greedy search method, which can be very time-consuming to conduct successful attack. This also limits the development of adversarial training and potential defenses for categorical data. To tackle this problem, we propose Probabilistic Categorical Adversarial Attack (PCAA), which transfers the discrete optimization problem to a continuous problem that can be solved efficiently by Projected Gradient Descent. In our paper, we theoretically analyze its optimality and time complexity to demonstrate its significant advantage over current greedy based attacks. Moreover, based on our attack, we propose an efficient adversarial training framework.

By jointly exploiting the context of data and its importance to the task, an emerging communication paradigm shift to semantic level and effectiveness level is envisioned to be a key revolution in Sixth Generation (6G) networks. However, an explicit and systematic communication framework incorporating both semantic level and effectiveness level has not been proposed yet. In this article, we propose a generic task-oriented and semantics-aware (TOSA) communication framework for various tasks with diverse data types, which incorporates both semantic level information and effectiveness level performance metrics. We first analyze the unique characteristics of all data types, and summarise the semantic information, along with corresponding extraction methods. We then propose a detailed TOSA communication framework for different time critical and non-critical tasks. In the TOSA framework, we present the TOSA information, extraction methods, recovery methods, and effectiveness level performance metrics. Last but not least, we present a TOSA framework tailored for Virtual Reality (VR) data with interactive VR tasks to validate the effectiveness of the proposed TOSA communication framework. ",

    "abstract": "Location trajectories collected by smartphones and other devices represent a valuable data source for applications such as location-based services. Likewise, trajectories have the potential to reveal sensitive information about individuals, e.g., religious beliefs or sexual orientations. Accordingly, trajectory datasets require appropriate sanitization. Due to their strong theoretical privacy guarantees, differential private publication mechanisms receive much attention. However, the large amount of noise required to achieve differential privacy yields structural differences, e.g., ship trajectories passing over land. We propose a deep learning-based Reconstruction Attack on Protected Trajectories (RAoPT), that leverages the mentioned differences to partly reconstruct the original trajectory from a differential private release. The evaluation shows that our RAoPT model can reduce the Euclidean and Hausdorff distances between the released and original trajectories by over 68% on two real-world datasets under protection with $\\varepsilon \\leq 1$. In this setting, the attack increases the average Jaccard index of the trajectories' convex hulls, representing a user's activity space, by over 180%. Trained on the GeoLife dataset, the model still reduces the Euclidean and Hausdorff distances by over 60% for T-Drive trajectories protected with a state-of-the-art mechanism ($\\varepsilon = 0.1$). This work highlights shortcomings of current trajectory publication mechanisms, and thus motivates further research on privacy-preserving publication schemes. ",

In multi-agent navigation problems, the optimal actions depend heavily on the agents' density. Their interaction patterns grow exponentially with respect to such density, making it hard for learning-based methods to generalize. We propose to switch the learning objectives from predicting the optimal actions to predicting sets of admissible actions, which we call control admissibility models (CAMs), such that they can be easily composed and used for online inference for an arbitrary number of agents. We design CAMs using graph neural networks and develop training methods that optimize the CAMs in the standard model-free setting, with the additional benefit of eliminating the need for reward engineering typically required to balance collision avoidance and goal-reaching requirements. We evaluate the proposed approach in multi-agent navigation environments. We show that the CAM models can be trained in environments with only a few agents and be easily composed for deployment in dense environments with hundreds of agents, achieving better performance than state-of-the-art methods.

For many safety-critical ML tasks, such as financial forecasting, fraudulent detection, and anomaly detection, the data samples are usually mixed-type, which contain plenty of numerical and categorical features at the same time. However, how to generate adversarial examples with mixed-type data is still seldom studied. In this paper, we propose a novel attack algorithm M-Attack, which can effectively generate adversarial examples in mixed-type data. Based on M-Attack, attackers can attempt to mislead the targeted classification model's prediction, by only slightly perturbing both the numerical and categorical features in the given data samples. More importantly, by adding designed regularizations, our generated adversarial examples can evade potential detection models, which makes the attack indeed insidious. Through extensive empirical studies, we validate the effectiveness and efficiency of our attack method and evaluate the robustness of existing classification models against our proposed attack. The experimental results highlight the feasibility of generating adversarial examples toward machine learning models in real-world applications. ",

However, humans operating MTRs often have difficulty navigating in densely populated environments due to limited situation awareness and narrow field-of-view, which reduces user acceptance and satisfaction. Shared autonomy in navigation has been studied primarily in static environments or in situations where only one pedestrian interacts with the robot. We present a multimodal shared autonomy approach, leveraging visual and haptic guidance, to provide navigation assistance for remote operators in densely-populated environments. It uses a modified form of reciprocal velocity obstacles for generating safe control inputs while taking social proxemics constraints into account. Two different visual guidance designs, as well as haptic force rendering, were proposed to convey safe control input. We conducted a user study to compare the merits and limitations of multimodal navigation assistance to haptic or visual assistance alone on a shared navigation task. The study involved 15 participants operating a virtual telepresence robot in a virtual hall with moving pedestrians, using the different assistance modalities. We evaluated navigation performance, transparency and cooperation, as well as user preferences. Our results showed that participants preferred multimodal assistance with a visual guidance trajectory over haptic or visual modalities alone, although it had no impact on navigation performance. Additionally, we found that visual guidance trajectories conveyed a higher degree of understanding and cooperation than equivalent haptic cues in a navigation task. ",

This allows a robot to autonomously build object models that are visually and dynamically accurate from still images and videos of objects in motion. The resulting Dynamics-Augmented Neural Objects (DANOs) are simulated with an existing differentiable simulation engine, Dojo, interacting with other standard simulation objects, such as spheres, planes, and robots specified as URDFs. A robot can use this simulation to optimize grasps and manipulation trajectories of neural objects, or to improve the neural object models through gradient-based real-to-simulation transfer. We demonstrate the pipeline to learn the coefficient of friction of a bar of soap from a real video of the soap sliding on a table.

To create a diverse set of filters, we use anisotropic wavelet basis filters, being sensitive to both different directions and band-passes. This filter set overcomes the over-smoothing behavior of conventional graph neural networks. To further improve the model's performance, we add a function that perturbs the feature maps in the last layer ahead of fully connected layers, forcing the network to learn more discriminative features overall. The resulting correspondence maps show state-of-the-art performance on the benchmark datasets based on average geodesic errors and superior robustness to discretization in 3D meshes.

In and of itself, question generation can be considered 'AI-hard', as there is a lack of unanimously agreed sense of what makes a question 'good' or 'bad'. In this paper, we tackle two fundamental problems in parallel: on one hand, we try to solve the scaling problem, where question-generation and answering applications have to be applied to a massive amount of text without ground truth labeling. The usual approach to solve this problem is to either downsample or summarize. However, there are critical risks of misinformation with these approaches. On the other hand, and related to the misinformation problem, we try to solve the 'safety' problem, as many public institutions rely on a much higher level of accuracy for the content they provide. We introduce an adversarial approach to tackle the question generation safety problem with scale. Specifically, we designed a question-answering system that specifically prunes out unanswerable questions that may be generated, and further increases the quality of the answers that are generated. We build a production-ready, easily-plugged pipeline that can be used on any given body of text, that is scalable and immune from generating any hate speech, profanity, or misinformation. Based on the results, we are able to generate more than six times the number of quality questions generated by the abstractive approach, with a perceived quality being 44% higher, according to a survey of 168 participants.

    "abstract": "Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) increasingly use LiDAR-based object detection systems to perceive other vehicles and pedestrians on the road. While existing attacks on LiDAR-based autonomous driving architectures focus on lowering the confidence score of AV object detection models to induce obstacle misdetection, our research discovers how to leverage laser-based spoofing techniques to selectively remove the LiDAR point cloud data of genuine obstacles at the sensor level before being used as input to the AV perception. The ablation of this critical LiDAR information causes autonomous driving obstacle detectors to fail to identify and locate obstacles and, consequently, induces AVs to make dangerous automatic driving decisions. In this paper, we present a method invisible to the human eye that hides objects and deceives autonomous vehicles' obstacle detectors by exploiting inherent automatic transformation and filtering processes of LiDAR sensor data integrated with autonomous driving frameworks. We call such attacks Physical Removal Attacks (PRA), and we demonstrate their effectiveness against three popular AV obstacle detectors (Apollo, Autoware, PointPillars), and we achieve 45{\\deg} attack capability. We evaluate the attack impact on three fusion models (Frustum-ConvNet, AVOD, and Integrated-Semantic Level Fusion) and the consequences on the driving decision using LGSVL, an industry-grade simulator. In our moving vehicle scenarios, we achieve a 92.7% success rate removing 90% of a target obstacle's cloud points. Finally, we demonstrate the attack's success against two popular defenses against spoofing and object hiding attacks and discuss two enhanced defense strategies to mitigate our attack. ",

However, many domain adaptation algorithms suffer with failure to operate adaptation in presence of target domain heterogeneity (which is always present in reality) and presence of multiple inhabitants dramatically hinders their generalizability producing unsatisfactory results for semi-supervised and unseen activity learning tasks. We propose \\emph{AEDA}, a novel deep auto-encoder-based model to enable semi-supervised domain adaptation in the existence of target domain heterogeneity and how to incorporate it to empower heterogeneity to any homogeneous deep domain adaptation architecture for cross-domain activity learning. Experimental evaluation on 18 different heterogeneous and multi-inhabitants use-cases of 8 different domains created from 2 publicly available human activity datasets (wearable and ambient smart homes) shows that \\emph{AEDA} outperforms (max. 12.8\\% and 8.9\\% improvements for ambient smart home and wearables) over existing domain adaptation techniques for both seen and unseen activity learning in a heterogeneous setting.

However, fair classification can be under the risk of poisoning attacks that deliberately insert malicious training samples to manipulate the trained classifiers' performance. In this work, we study the poisoning scenario where the attacker can insert a small fraction of samples into training data, with arbitrary sensitive attributes as well as other predictive features. We demonstrate that the fairly trained classifiers can be greatly vulnerable to such poisoning attacks, with much worse accuracy & fairness trade-off, even when we apply some of the most effective defenses (originally proposed to defend traditional classification tasks). As countermeasures to defend fair classification tasks, we propose a general and theoretically guaranteed framework which accommodates traditional defense methods to fair classification against poisoning attacks. Through extensive experiments, the results validate that the proposed defense framework obtains better robustness in terms of accuracy and fairness than representative baseline methods. ",

    "abstract": "Weed management plays an important role in many modern agricultural applications. Conventional weed control methods mainly rely on chemical herbicides or hand weeding, which are often cost-ineffective, environmentally unfriendly, or even posing a threat to food safety and human health. Recently, automated/robotic weeding using machine vision systems has seen increased research attention with its potential for precise and individualized weed treatment. However, dedicated, large-scale, and labeled weed image datasets are required to develop robust and effective weed identification systems but they are often difficult and expensive to obtain. To address this issue, data augmentation approaches, such as generative adversarial networks (GANs), have been explored to generate highly realistic images for agricultural applications. Yet, despite some progress, those approaches are often complicated to train or have difficulties preserving fine details in images. In this paper, we present the first work of applying diffusion probabilistic models (also known as diffusion models) to generate high-quality synthetic weed images based on transfer learning. Comprehensive experimental results show that the developed approach consistently outperforms several state-of-the-art GAN models, representing the best trade-off between sample fidelity and diversity and highest FID score on a common weed dataset, CottonWeedID15. In addition, the expanding dataset with synthetic weed images can apparently boost model performance on four deep learning (DL) models for the weed classification tasks. Furthermore, the DL models trained on CottonWeedID15 dataset with only 10% of real images and 90% of synthetic weed images achieve a testing accuracy of over 94%, showing high-quality of the generated weed samples.

    "abstract": "Message passing neural networks (MPNNs) have become a dominant flavor of graph neural networks (GNNs) in recent years. Yet, MPNNs come with notable limitations; namely, they are at most as powerful as the 1-dimensional Weisfeiler-Leman (1-WL) test in distinguishing graphs in a graph isomorphism testing frame-work. To this end, researchers have drawn inspiration from the k-WL hierarchy to develop more expressive GNNs. However, current k-WL-equivalent GNNs are not practical for even small values of k, as k-WL becomes combinatorially more complex as k grows. At the same time, several works have found great empirical success in graph learning tasks without highly expressive models, implying that chasing expressiveness with a coarse-grained ruler of expressivity like k-WL is often unneeded in practical tasks. To truly understand the expressiveness-complexity tradeoff, one desires a more fine-grained ruler, which can more gradually increase expressiveness. Our work puts forth such a proposal: Namely, we first propose the (k, c)(<=)-SETWL hierarchy with greatly reduced complexity from k-WL, achieved by moving from k-tuples of nodes to sets with <=k nodes defined over <=c connected components in the induced original graph. We show favorable theoretical results for this model in relation to k-WL, and concretize it via (k, c)(<=)-SETGNN, which is as expressive as (k, c)(<=)-SETWL. Our model is practical and progressively-expressive, increasing in power with k and c. We demonstrate effectiveness on several benchmark datasets, achieving several state-of-the-art results with runtime and memory usage applicable to practical graphs.

The system combines two considerably different models: an end-to-end Sound Event Detection Transformer (SEDT) and a frame-wise model, Metric Learning and Focal Loss CNN (MLFL-CNN). The former is an event-wise model which learns event-level representations and predicts sound event categories and boundaries directly, while the latter is based on the widely adopted frame-classification scheme, under which each frame is classified into event categories and event boundaries are obtained by post-processing such as thresholding and smoothing. For SEDT, self-supervised pre-training using unlabeled data is applied, and semi-supervised learning is adopted by using an online teacher, which is updated from the student model using the Exponential Moving Average (EMA) strategy and generates reliable pseudo labels for weakly-labeled and unlabeled data. For the frame-wise model, the ICT-TOSHIBA system of DCASE 2021 Task 4 is used. Experimental results show that the hybrid system considerably outperforms either individual model and achieves psds1 of 0.420 and psds2 of 0.783 on the validation set without external data.

Thus, there exists extensive literature on the topic that has recently shifted toward deep detection models due to advances in deep learning and graph neural networks (GNNs). A vast majority of prior work focuses on detecting node/edge/subgraph anomalies within a single graph, with much less work on graph-level anomaly detection in a graph database. This work aims to fill two gaps in the literature: We (1) design GLAM, an end-to-end graph-level anomaly detection model based on GNNs, and (2) focus on unsupervised model selection, which is notoriously hard due to lack of any labels, yet especially critical for deep NN based models with a long list of hyper-parameters. Further, we propose a new pooling strategy for graph-level embedding, called MMD-pooling, that is geared toward detecting distribution anomalies which has not been considered before. Through extensive experiments on 15 real-world datasets, we show that (i) GLAM outperforms node-level and two-stage (i.e. not end-to-end) baselines, and (ii) model selection picks a significantly more effective model than expectation (i.e. average) -- without using any labels -- among candidates with otherwise large variation in performance.

Experiments on three common discourse parsing tasks (News Discourse Profiling, Rhetorical Structure Theory based Discourse Parsing and Penn Discourse Treebank based Discourse Parsing) show that powered by recent pretrained language models, our simplied feature extractors obtain better generalizabilities and meanwhile achieve comparable or even better system performance. The simplified feature extractors have fewer learnable parameters and less processing time.

To improve the prediction accuracy of the neural network, we also introduce a novel auxiliary line strategy and an efficient network model during meshing. The strategy first employs a priori auxiliary lines to provide ground truth data and then uses these data to construct a loss term to better constrain the convergence of the subsequent training. The experimental results indicate that the proposed method is effective and robust.

Existing face forgery detection methods directly utilize the obtained public shared or centralized data for training but ignore the personal privacy and security issues when personal data couldn't be centralizedly shared in real-world scenarios. Additionally, different distributions caused by diverse artifact types would further bring adverse influences on the forgery detection task. To solve the mentioned problems, the paper proposes a novel generalized residual Federated learning for face Forgery detection (FedForgery). The designed variational autoencoder aims to learn robust discriminative residual feature maps to detect forgery faces (with diverse or even unknown artifact types). Furthermore, the general federated learning strategy is introduced to construct distributed detection model trained collaboratively with multiple local decentralized devices, which could further boost the representation generalization. Experiments conducted on publicly available face forgery detection datasets prove the superior performance of the proposed FedForgery.

Each target in the video data has rich spatio-temporal context information. Most existing methods only focus on the temporal context, ignoring the role of the spatial context in anomaly detection. The spatial context information represents the relationship between the detection target and surrounding targets. Anomaly detection makes a lot of sense. To this end, a video anomaly detection algorithm based on target spatio-temporal context fusion is proposed. Firstly, the target in the video frame is extracted through the target detection network to reduce background interference. Then the optical flow map of two adjacent frames is calculated. Motion features are used multiple targets in the video frame to construct spatial context simultaneously, re-encoding the target appearance and motion features, and finally reconstructing the above features through the spatio-temporal dual-stream network, and using the reconstruction error to represent the abnormal score. The algorithm achieves frame-level AUCs of 98.5% and 86.3% on the UCSDped2 and Avenue datasets, respectively. On the UCSDped2 dataset, the spatio-temporal dual-stream network improves frames by 5.1% and 0.3%, respectively, compared to the temporal and spatial stream networks. After using spatial context encoding, the frame-level AUC is enhanced by 1%, which verifies the method's effectiveness. ",

Considering the relevance between codes in a large-scale code corpus, the soft-labeled contrastive pre-training can obtain fine-grained soft-labels through an iterative adversarial manner and use them to learn better code representation. The positive sample construction is another key for contrastive pre-training. Previous works use transformation-based methods like variable renaming to generate semantically equal positive codes. However, they usually result in the generated code with a highly similar surface form, and thus mislead the model to focus on superficial code structure instead of code semantics. To encourage SCodeR to capture semantic information from the code, we utilize code comments and abstract syntax sub-trees of the code to build positive samples. We conduct experiments on four code-related tasks over seven datasets. Extensive experimental results show that SCodeR achieves new state-of-the-art performance on all of them, which illustrates the effectiveness of the proposed pre-training method. ",

Nevertheless, the recursive nodes fetching and aggregation in message-passing cause inference latency when deploying GNNs to large-scale graphs. One promising inference acceleration direction is to distill the GNNs into message-passing-free student multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs). However, the MLP student cannot fully learn the structure knowledge due to the lack of structure inputs, which causes inferior performance in the heterophily and inductive scenarios. To address this, we intend to inject structure information into MLP-like students in low-latency and interpretable ways. Specifically, we first design a Structure-Aware MLP (SA-MLP) student that encodes both features and structures without message-passing. Then, we introduce a novel structure-mixing knowledge distillation strategy to enhance the learning ability of MLPs for structure information. Furthermore, we design a latent structure embedding approximation technique with two-stage distillation for inductive scenarios. Extensive experiments on eight benchmark datasets under both transductive and inductive settings show that our SA-MLP can consistently outperform the teacher GNNs, while maintaining faster inference as MLPs.

    "abstract": "Multi-modal 3D object detection has been an active research topic in autonomous driving. Nevertheless, it is non-trivial to explore the cross-modal feature fusion between sparse 3D points and dense 2D pixels. Recent approaches either fuse the image features with the point cloud features that are projected onto the 2D image plane or combine the sparse point cloud with dense image pixels. These fusion approaches often suffer from severe information loss, thus causing sub-optimal performance. To address these problems, we construct the homogeneous structure between the point cloud and images to avoid projective information loss by transforming the camera features into the LiDAR 3D space. In this paper, we propose a homogeneous multi-modal feature fusion and interaction method (HMFI) for 3D object detection. Specifically, we first design an image voxel lifter module (IVLM) to lift 2D image features into the 3D space and generate homogeneous image voxel features. Then, we fuse the voxelized point cloud features with the image features from different regions by introducing the self-attention based query fusion mechanism (QFM). Next, we propose a voxel feature interaction module (VFIM) to enforce the consistency of semantic information from identical objects in the homogeneous point cloud and image voxel representations, which can provide object-level alignment guidance for cross-modal feature fusion and strengthen the discriminative ability in complex backgrounds. We conduct extensive experiments on the KITTI and Waymo Open Dataset, and the proposed HMFI achieves better performance compared with the state-of-the-art multi-modal methods. Particularly, for the 3D detection of cyclist on the KITTI benchmark, HMFI surpasses all the published algorithms by a large margin. ",

    "abstract": "Synthetic data generation has become an emerging tool to help improve the adversarial robustness in classification tasks since robust learning requires a significantly larger amount of training samples compared with standard classification tasks. Among various deep generative models, the diffusion model has been shown to produce high-quality synthetic images and has achieved good performance in improving the adversarial robustness. However, diffusion-type methods are typically slow in data generation as compared with other generative models. Although different acceleration techniques have been proposed recently, it is also of great importance to study how to improve the sample efficiency of generated data for the downstream task. In this paper, we first analyze the optimality condition of synthetic distribution for achieving non-trivial robust accuracy. We show that enhancing the distinguishability among the generated data is critical for improving adversarial robustness. Thus, we propose the Contrastive-Guided Diffusion Process (Contrastive-DP), which adopts the contrastive loss to guide the diffusion model in data generation. We verify our theoretical results using simulations and demonstrate the good performance of Contrastive-DP on image datasets. ",

    "abstract": "Video conferencing platforms have been appropriated during the COVID-19 pandemic for different purposes, including classroom teaching. However, the platforms are not designed for many of these objectives. When users, like educationists, select a platform, it is unclear which platform will perform better given the same network and hardware resources to meet the required Quality of Experience (QoE). Similarly, when developers design a new video conferencing platform, they do not have clear guidelines for making design choices given the QoE requirements. In this paper, we provide a set of networks and systems measurements, and quantitative user studies to measure the performance of video conferencing apps in terms of both, Quality of Service (QoS) and QoE. Using those metrics, we measure the performance of Google Meet, Microsoft Teams, and Zoom, which are three popular platforms in education and business. We find a substantial difference in how the three apps treat video and audio streams. We see that their choice of treatment affects their consumption of hardware resources. Our quantitative user studies confirm the findings of our quantitative measurements. While each platform has its benefits, we find that no app is ideal. A user can choose a suitable platform depending on which of the following, audio, video, or network bandwidth, CPU, or memory are more important. ",

Furthermore, ROSE can be easily incorporated into existing fine-tuning methods to improve their adversarial robustness further.

To enable training of deep monocular estimation models with various sources of datasets, state-of-the-art methods adopt image-level normalization strategies to generate affine-invariant depth representations. However, learning with image-level normalization mainly emphasizes the relations of pixel representations with the global statistic in the images, such as the structure of the scene, while the fine-grained depth difference may be overlooked. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-scale depth normalization method that hierarchically normalizes the depth representations based on spatial information and depth distributions. Compared with previous normalization strategies applied only at the holistic image level, the proposed hierarchical normalization can effectively preserve the fine-grained details and improve accuracy. We present two strategies that define the hierarchical normalization contexts in the depth domain and the spatial domain, respectively. Our extensive experiments show that the proposed normalization strategy remarkably outperforms previous normalization methods, and we set new state-of-the-art on five zero-shot transfer benchmark datasets.

Existing defenses are often effective only against a specific type of targeted attack, significantly degrade the generalization performance, or are prohibitive for standard deep learning pipelines. In this work, we propose an efficient defense mechanism that significantly reduces the success rate of various data poisoning attacks, and provides theoretical guarantees for the performance of the model. Targeted attacks work by adding bounded perturbations to a randomly selected subset of training data to match the targets' gradient or representation. We show that: (i) under bounded perturbations, only a number of poisons can be optimized to have a gradient that is close enough to that of the target and make the attack successful; (ii) such effective poisons move away from their original class and get isolated in the gradient space; (iii) dropping examples in low-density gradient regions during training can successfully eliminate the effective poisons, and guarantees similar training dynamics to that of training on full data. Our extensive experiments show that our method significantly decreases the success rate of state-of-the-art targeted attacks, including Gradient Matching and Bullseye Polytope, and easily scales to large datasets.

    "abstract": "Creating large annotated datasets represents a major bottleneck for the development of deep learning models in radiology. To overcome this, we propose a combined use of weak labels (imprecise, but fast-to-create annotations) and Transfer Learning (TL). Specifically, we explore inductive TL, where source and target domains are identical, but tasks are different due to a label shift: our target labels are created manually by three radiologists, whereas the source weak labels are generated automatically from textual radiology reports. We frame knowledge transfer as hyperparameter optimization, thus avoiding heuristic choices that are frequent in related works. We investigate the relationship between model size and TL, comparing a low-capacity VGG with a higher-capacity SEResNeXt. The task that we address is change detection in follow-up glioma imaging: we extracted 1693 T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging difference maps from 183 patients, and classified them into stable or unstable according to tumor evolution. Weak labeling allowed us to increase dataset size more than 3-fold, and improve VGG classification results from 75% to 82% Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC) (p=0.04). Mixed training from scratch led to higher performance than fine-tuning or feature extraction. To assess generalizability, we also ran inference on an open dataset (BraTS-2015: 15 patients, 51 difference maps), reaching up to 76% AUC. Overall, results suggest that medical imaging problems may benefit from smaller models and different TL strategies with respect to computer vision problems, and that report-generated weak labels are effective in improving model performances. Code, in-house dataset and BraTS labels are released. ",

Understanding the meaning of sentences is a prerequisite before applying any natural language processing(NLP) techniques to automatically recognize the textual entailment. A text entails a hypothesis if and only if the true value of the hypothesis follows the text. Classical approaches generally utilize the feature value of each word from word embedding to represent the sentences. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to identifying the textual entailment relationship between text and hypothesis, thereby introducing a new semantic feature focusing on empirical threshold-based semantic text representation. We employ an element-wise Manhattan distance vector-based feature that can identify the semantic entailment relationship between the text-hypothesis pair. We carried out several experiments on a benchmark entailment classification(SICK-RTE) dataset. We train several machine learning(ML) algorithms applying both semantic and lexical features to classify the text-hypothesis pair as entailment, neutral, or contradiction. Our empirical sentence representation technique enriches the semantic information of the texts and hypotheses found to be more efficient than the classical ones. In the end, our approach significantly outperforms known methods in understanding the meaning of the sentences for the textual entailment classification task. ",

The ability to make predictions on an individual level is useful, as it allows supermarkets to accurately perform targeted marketing. However, given the expected number of shoppers and their diverse behaviours, making accurate predictions on an individual level is difficult. This problem does not only arise in shopper behaviour, but also in various business processes, such as predicting when an invoice will be paid. In this paper we present CAPiES, a framework that focuses on this trade-off in an online setting. By making predictions on a larger number of entities at a time, we improve the predictive accuracy but at the potential cost of usefulness since we can say less about the individual entities. CAPiES is developed in an online setting, where we continuously update the prediction model and make new predictions over time. We show the existence of the trade-off in an experimental evaluation in two real-world scenarios: a supermarket with over 160 000 shoppers and a paint factory with over 171 000 invoices. ",

Meanwhile, the overwhelming majority of objects in real-world graphs are normal, bringing the class imbalance problem as well. To bridge the gaps, this paper devises a novel Data Augmentation-based Graph Anomaly Detection (DAGAD) framework for attributed graphs, equipped with three specially designed modules: 1) an information fusion module employing graph neural network encoders to learn representations, 2) a graph data augmentation module that fertilizes the training set with generated samples, and 3) an imbalance-tailored learning module to discriminate the distributions of the minority (anomalous) and majority (normal) classes.

    "abstract": "The fundamental principle of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) is to exploit the structural information of the data by aggregating the neighboring nodes using a graph convolution. Therefore, understanding its influence on the network performance is crucial. Convolutions based on graph Laplacian have emerged as the dominant choice with the symmetric normalization of the adjacency matrix $A$, defined as $D^{-1/2}AD^{-1/2}$, being the most widely adopted one, where $D$ is the degree matrix. However, some empirical studies show that row normalization $D^{-1}A$ outperforms it in node classification. Despite the widespread use of GNNs, there is no rigorous theoretical study on the representation power of these convolution operators, that could explain this behavior. In this work, we analyze the influence of the graph convolutions theoretically using Graph Neural Tangent Kernel in a semi-supervised node classification setting. Under a Degree Corrected Stochastic Block Model, we prove that: (i) row normalization preserves the underlying class structure better than other convolutions; (ii) performance degrades with network depth due to over-smoothing, but the loss in class information is the slowest in row normalization; (iii) skip connections retain the class information even at infinite depth, thereby eliminating over-smoothing.

    "abstract": "Identifying unfamiliar inputs, also known as out-of-distribution (OOD) detection, is a crucial property of any decision making process. A simple and empirically validated technique is based on deep ensembles where the variance of predictions over different neural networks acts as a substitute for input uncertainty. Nevertheless, a theoretical understanding of the inductive biases leading to the performance of deep ensemble's uncertainty estimation is missing. To improve our description of their behavior, we study deep ensembles with large layer widths operating in simplified linear training regimes, in which the functions trained with gradient descent can be described by the neural tangent kernel. We identify two sources of noise, each inducing a distinct inductive bias in the predictive variance at initialization. We further show theoretically and empirically that both noise sources affect the predictive variance of non-linear deep ensembles in toy models and realistic settings after training. Finally, we propose practical ways to eliminate part of these noise sources leading to significant changes and improved OOD detection in trained deep ensembles. ",

    "abstract": "Eye movements are known to reflect cognitive processes in reading, and psychological reading research has shown that eye gaze patterns differ between readers with and without dyslexia. In recent years, researchers have attempted to classify readers with dyslexia based on their eye movements using Support Vector Machines (SVMs). However, these approaches (i) are based on highly aggregated features averaged over all words read by a participant, thus disregarding the sequential nature of the eye movements, and (ii) do not consider the linguistic stimulus and its interaction with the reader's eye movements. In the present work, we propose two simple sequence models that process eye movements on the entire stimulus without the need of aggregating features across the sentence. Additionally, we incorporate the linguistic stimulus into the model in two ways -- contextualized word embeddings and manually extracted linguistic features. The models are evaluated on a Mandarin Chinese dataset containing eye movements from children with and without dyslexia. Our results show that (i) even for a logographic script such as Chinese, sequence models are able to classify dyslexia on eye gaze sequences, reaching state-of-the-art performance, and (ii) incorporating the linguistic stimulus does not help to improve classification performance.

While most Adversarial Training algorithms aim at defending attacks constrained within low magnitude Lp norm bounds, real-world adversaries are not limited by such constraints. In this work, we aim to achieve adversarial robustness within larger bounds, against perturbations that may be perceptible, but do not change human (or Oracle) prediction. The presence of images that flip Oracle predictions and those that do not makes this a challenging setting for adversarial robustness. We discuss the ideal goals of an adversarial defense algorithm beyond perceptual limits, and further highlight the shortcomings of naively extending existing training algorithms to higher perturbation bounds. In order to overcome these shortcomings, we propose a novel defense, Oracle-Aligned Adversarial Training (OA-AT), to align the predictions of the network with that of an Oracle during adversarial training. The proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art performance at large epsilon bounds (such as an L-inf bound of 16/255 on CIFAR-10) while outperforming existing defenses (AWP, TRADES, PGD-AT) at standard bounds (8/255) as well.

Most state-of-the-art methods enforce similarity between various augmentations of a given image, while some methods additionally use contrastive approaches to explicitly ensure diverse representations. While these approaches have indeed shown promising direction, they require a significantly larger number of training iterations when compared to the supervised counterparts. In this work, we explore reasons for the slow convergence of these methods, and further propose to strengthen them using well-posed auxiliary tasks that converge significantly faster, and are also useful for representation learning. The proposed method utilizes the task of rotation prediction to improve the efficiency of existing state-of-the-art methods.

    "abstract": "As an essential processing step before the fusing of infrared and visible images, the performance of image registration determines whether the two images can be fused at correct spatial position. In the actual scenario, the varied imaging devices may lead to a change in perspective or time gap between shots, making significant non-rigid spatial relationship in infrared and visible images. Even if a large number of feature points are matched, the registration accuracy may still be inadequate, affecting the result of image fusion and other vision tasks. To alleviate this problem, we propose a Semantic-Aware on-Demand registration network (SA-DNet), which mainly purpose is to confine the feature matching process to the semantic region of interest (sROI) by designing semantic-aware module (SAM) and HOL-Deep hybrid matching module (HDM). After utilizing TPS to transform infrared and visible images based on the corresponding feature points in sROI, the registered images are fused using image fusion module (IFM) to achieve a fully functional registration and fusion network. Moreover, we point out that for different demands, this type of approach allows us to select semantic objects for feature matching as needed and accomplishes task-specific registration based on specific requirements. To demonstrate the robustness of SA-DNet for non-rigid distortions, we conduct extensive experiments by comparing SA-DNet with five state-of-the-art infrared and visible image feature matching methods, and the experimental results show that our method adapts better to the presence of non-rigid distortions in the images and provides semantically well-registered images.

Before algorithms can be involved in such high-stakes decisions they need to \"know when they don't know\", i.e., they need to estimate their predictive uncertainty. This allows them to defer potentially erroneous predictions to a human pathologist, thus increasing their safety. Here, we evaluate the predictive performance and calibration of several uncertainty estimation methods on clinical histopathology data. We show that a distance-aware uncertainty estimation method outperforms commonly used approaches, such as Monte Carlo dropout and deep ensembles. However, we observe a drop in predictive performance and calibration on novel samples across all uncertainty estimation methods tested. We also investigate the use of uncertainty thresholding to reject out-of-distribution samples for selective prediction.

This is in contrast to requiring behaviour specified in advance (e.g. by hard-coded rules). Formalization of this problem has enabled great progress in many applications with large real-world impact, including translation, speech recognition, self-driving cars, and drug discovery. But practical instantiations of this formalism make many assumptions - for example, that data are i.i.d.: independent and identically distributed - whose soundness is seldom investigated. And in making great progress in such a short time, the field has developed many norms and ad-hoc standards, focused on a relatively small range of problem settings. As applications of ML, particularly in artificial intelligence (AI) systems, become more pervasive in the real world, we need to critically examine these assumptions, norms, and problem settings, as well as the methods that have become de-facto standards. There is much we still do not understand about how and why deep networks trained with stochastic gradient descent are able to generalize as well as they do, why they fail when they do, and how they will perform on out-of-distribution data. In this thesis I cover some of my work towards better understanding deep net generalization, identify several ways assumptions and problem settings fail to generalize to the real world, and propose ways to address those failures in practice.

To optimize the amount of cash in payment terminals, it is necessary to minimize the cost of servicing them and ensure that there are no excess funds in the network. The purpose of this work is to create a cash management system in the network of payment terminals. The article discusses the solution to the problem of determining the optimal amount of funds to be loaded into the terminals, and the effective frequency of collection, which allows to get additional income by investing the released funds. The paper presents the results of predicting daily cash withdrawals at ATMs using a triple exponential smoothing model, a recurrent neural network with long short-term memory, and a model of singular spectrum analysis. These forecasting models allowed us to obtain a sufficient level of correct forecasts with good accuracy and completeness. The results of forecasting cash withdrawals were used to build a discrete optimal control model, which was used to develop an optimal schedule for adding funds to the payment terminal. It is proved that the efficiency and reliability of the proposed model is higher than that of the classical Baumol-Tobin inventory management model: when tested on the time series of three ATMs, the discrete optimal control model did not allow exhaustion of funds and allowed to earn on average 30% more than the classical model.

    "abstract": "Popular instant messaging applications such as WhatsApp and Signal provide end-to-end encryption for billions of users. They rely on a centralized, application-specific server to distribute public keys and relay encrypted messages between the users. Therefore, they prevent passive attacks but are vulnerable to some active attacks. A malicious or hacked server can distribute fake keys to users to perform man-in-the-middle or impersonation attacks. While typical secure messaging applications provide a manual method for users to detect these attacks, this burdens users, and studies show it is ineffective in practice. This paper presents KTACA, a completely automated approach for key verification that is oblivious to users and easy to deploy. We motivate KTACA by designing two approaches to automatic key verification. One approach uses client auditing (KTCA) and the second uses anonymous key monitoring (AKM). Both have relatively inferior security properties, leading to KTACA, which combines these approaches to provide the best of both worlds. We provide a security analysis of each defense, identifying which attacks they can automatically detect. We implement the active attacks to demonstrate they are possible, and we also create a prototype implementation of all the defenses to measure their performance and confirm their feasibility. Finally, we discuss the strengths and weaknesses of each defense, the overhead on clients and service providers, and deployment considerations. ",

ESNs are easy to train and only require a small number of trainable parameters, but are still black-box models. We show how LRP can be applied to ESNs in order to open the black-box. We also show how ESNs can be used not only for time series prediction but also for image classification: Our ESN model serves as a detector for El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) from sea surface temperature anomalies.

However, such deep neural networks are difficult to interpret and lack robustness, which slows the deployment of these AI-powered algorithms in practice. To improve their usability, increasing research efforts have been devoted to developing interpretable and robust machine learning methods, among which the causal inference approach recently gained traction as it provides interpretable and actionable information. Moreover, most of these methods are developed for image or sequential data which do not satisfy specific requirements of mobility data analysis. This vision paper emphasizes research challenges in deep learning-based mobility analysis that require interpretability and robustness, summarizes recent developments in using causal inference for improving the interpretability and robustness of machine learning methods, and highlights opportunities in developing causally-enabled machine learning models tailored for mobility analysis. This research direction will make AI in the transportation sector more interpretable and reliable, thus contributing to safer, more efficient, and more sustainable future transportation systems. ",

One of the dominant architectures is graph attention due to its ability to make predictions using weighted edge features and not only node features. In this paper we analyze, theoretically and empirically, graph attention networks and their ability of correctly labelling nodes in a classic classification task. More specifically, we study the performance of graph attention on the classic contextual stochastic block model (CSBM). In CSBM the nodes and edge features are obtained from a mixture of Gaussians and the edges from a stochastic block model. We consider a general graph attention mechanism that takes random edge features as input to determine the attention coefficients. We study two cases, in the first one, when the edge features are noisy, we prove that the majority of the attention coefficients are up to a constant uniform. This allows us to prove that graph attention with edge features is not better than simple graph convolution for achieving perfect node classification. Second, we prove that when the edge features are clean graph attention can distinguish intra- from inter-edges and this makes graph attention better than classic graph convolution. ",

    "title": "Diverse Misinformation: Impacts of Human Biases on Detection of  Deepfakes on Networks",
    "abstract": "Social media users are not equally susceptible to all misinformation. We call ``diverse misinformation'' the complex relationships between human biases and demographics represented in misinformation, and its impact on our susceptibility to misinformation is currently unknown. To investigate how users' biases impact susceptibility, we explore computer-generated videos called deepfakes as a type of diverse misinformation. We chose deepfakes as a case study for three reasons: 1.) their classification as misinformation is more objective; 2.) we can control the demographics of the persona presented; and 3.) deepfakes are a real-world concern with associated harms that need to be better understood. Our paper presents a survey (N=2,000) where U.S.-based participants are exposed to videos and asked questions about their attributes, not knowing they might be a deepfake. Our analysis investigates the extent to which different users are duped and by what perceived demographics of deepfake personas. First, if users not explicitly looking for deepfakes are not particularly accurate classifiers. Importantly, accuracy varies significantly by demographics, and participants are generally better at classifying videos that match them (especially male, white, and young participants). We extrapolate from these results to understand the population-level impacts of these biases using an idealized mathematical model of the interplay between diverse misinformation and crowd correction. Our model suggests that a diverse set of contacts might provide ``herd correction'' where friends can protect each other's blind spots. Altogether, human biases and the attributes of misinformation matter greatly, but having a diverse social group may help reduce susceptibility to misinformation. ",

    "abstract": "Training state-of-the-art Automated Speech Recognition (ASR) models typically requires a substantial amount of transcribed speech. In this work, we demonstrate that a modality-matched joint speech and text model can be leveraged to train a massively multilingual ASR model without any supervised (manually transcribed) speech for some languages. This paper explores the use of jointly learnt speech and text representations in a massively multilingual, zero supervised speech, real-world setting to expand the set of languages covered by ASR with only unlabeled speech and text in the target languages. Using the FLEURS dataset, we define the task to cover $102$ languages, where transcribed speech is available in $52$ of these languages and can be used to improve end-to-end ASR quality on the remaining $50$. First, we show that by combining speech representations with byte-level text representations and use of language embeddings, we can dramatically reduce the Character Error Rate (CER) on languages with no supervised speech from 64.8\\% to 30.8\\%, a relative reduction of 53\\%. Second, using a subset of South Asian languages we show that Maestro-U can promote knowledge transfer from languages with supervised speech even when there is limited to no graphemic overlap. Overall, Maestro-U closes the gap to oracle performance by 68.5\\% relative and reduces the CER of 19 languages below 15\\%. ",

In this work, we study this question by contrasting social biases with non-social biases stemming from choices made during dataset construction that might not even be discernible to the human eye. To do so, we empirically simulate various alternative constructions for a given benchmark based on innocuous modifications (such as paraphrasing or random-sampling) that maintain the essence of their social bias. On two well-known social bias benchmarks (Winogender and BiasNLI) we observe that these shallow modifications have a surprising effect on the resulting degree of bias across various models. We hope these troubling observations motivate more robust measures of social biases. ",

    "abstract": "Detecting occluded objects still remains a challenge for state-of-the-art object detectors. The objective of this work is to improve the detection for such objects, and thereby improve the overall performance of a modern object detector. To this end we make the following four contributions: (1) We propose a simple 'plugin' module for the detection head of two-stage object detectors to improve the recall of partially occluded objects. The module predicts a tri-layer of segmentation masks for the target object, the occluder and the occludee, and by doing so is able to better predict the mask of the target object. (2) We propose a scalable pipeline for generating training data for the module by using amodal completion of existing object detection and instance segmentation training datasets to establish occlusion relationships. (3) We also establish a COCO evaluation dataset to measure the recall performance of partially occluded and separated objects. (4) We show that the plugin module inserted into a two-stage detector can boost the performance significantly, by only fine-tuning the detection head, and with additional improvements if the entire architecture is fine-tuned. COCO results are reported for Mask R-CNN with Swin-T or Swin-S backbones, and Cascade Mask R-CNN with a Swin-B backbone. ",

In this paper, we examine an alternative way of extracting speaker and emotion information from self-supervised trained models, based on the correlations between the coefficients of the representations - correlation pooling.

    "abstract": "As an economical and efficient fundus imaging modality, retinal fundus images have been widely adopted in clinical fundus examination. Unfortunately, fundus images often suffer from quality degradation caused by imaging interferences, leading to misdiagnosis. Despite impressive enhancement performances that state-of-the-art methods have achieved, challenges remain in clinical scenarios. For boosting the clinical deployment of fundus image enhancement, this paper proposes the pyramid constraint to develop a degradation-invariant enhancement network (PCE-Net), which mitigates the demand for clinical data and stably enhances unknown data. Firstly, high-quality images are randomly degraded to form sequences of low-quality ones sharing the same content (SeqLCs). Then individual low-quality images are decomposed to Laplacian pyramid features (LPF) as the multi-level input for the enhancement. Subsequently, a feature pyramid constraint (FPC) for the sequence is introduced to enforce the PCE-Net to learn a degradation-invariant model. Extensive experiments have been conducted under the evaluation metrics of enhancement and segmentation. The effectiveness of the PCE-Net was demonstrated in comparison with state-of-the-art methods and the ablation study. The source code of this study is publicly available at https://github.com/HeverLaw/PCENet-Image-Enhancement. ",

    "abstract": "Simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) is a method that constructs a map of an unknown environment and localizes the position of a moving agent on the map simultaneously. Extended Kalman filter (EKF) has been widely adopted as a low complexity solution for online SLAM, which relies on a motion and measurement model of the moving agent. In practice, however, acquiring precise information about these models is very challenging, and the model mismatch effect causes severe performance loss in SLAM. In this paper, inspired by the recently proposed KalmanNet, we present a robust EKF algorithm using the power of deep learning for online SLAM, referred to as Split-KalmanNet. The key idea of Split-KalmanNet is to compute the Kalman gain using the Jacobian matrix of a measurement function and two recurrent neural networks (RNNs). The two RNNs independently learn the covariance matrices for a prior state estimate and the innovation from data. The proposed split structure in the computation of the Kalman gain allows to compensate for state and measurement model mismatch effects independently. Numerical simulation results verify that Split-KalmanNet outperforms the traditional EKF and the state-of-the-art KalmanNet algorithm in various model mismatch scenarios. ",

We give a general framework for designing consistent algorithms for such complex design goals by viewing the learning problem as an optimization problem over the set of feasible confusion matrices. We provide multiple instantiations of our framework under different assumptions on the performance metrics and constraints, and in each case show rates of convergence to the optimal (feasible) classifier (and this asymptotic consistency).

Moreover, a quantum convolutional neural network (QCNN) is the quantum-version of CNN because it can process high-dimensional vector inputs in contrast to QNN. However, due to the nature of quantum computing, it is difficult to scale up the QCNN to extract a sufficient number of features due to barren plateaus. Motivated by this, a novel 3D scalable QCNN (sQCNN-3D) is proposed for point cloud data processing in classification applications. Furthermore, reverse fidelity training (RF-Train) is additionally considered on top of sQCNN-3D for diversifying features with a limited number of qubits using the fidelity of quantum computing. Our data-intensive performance evaluation verifies that the proposed algorithm achieves desired performance. ",

    "abstract": "In fault detection and diagnosis of prognostics and health management (PHM) systems, most of the methodologies utilize machine learning (ML) or deep learning (DL) through which either some features are extracted beforehand (in the case of ML) or filters are used to extract features autonomously (in case of DL) to perform the critical classification task. Particularly in the fault detection and diagnosis of industrial robots where electric current, vibration or acoustic emissions signals are the primary sources of information, a feature domain that can map the signals into their constituent components with compressed information at different levels can reduce the complexities and size of typical ML and DL-based frameworks. The Deep Scattering Spectrum (DSS) is one of the strategies that use the Wavelet Transform (WT) analogy to separate and extract the information encoded in a signal's various temporal and frequency domains. As a result, the focus of this work is on the study of the DSS's relevance to fault detection and daignosis for mechanical components of industrail robots. We used multiple industrial robots and distinct mechanical faults to build an approach for classifying the faults using low-variance features extracted from the input signals. The presented approach was implemented on the practical test benches and demonstrated satisfactory performance in fault detection and diagnosis for simple and complex classification problems with a classification accuracy of 99.7% and 88.1%, respectively.

    "abstract": "Complex high-dimensional co-occurrence data are increasingly popular from a complex system of interacting physical, biological and social processes in discretely indexed modifiable areal units or continuously indexed locations of a study region for landscape-based mechanism. Modeling, predicting and interpreting complex co-occurrences are very general and fundamental problems of statistical and machine learning in a broad variety of real-world modern applications. Probability and conditional probability of co-occurrence are introduced by being defined in a general setting with set functions to develop a rigorous measure-theoretic foundation for the inherent challenge of data sparseness. The data sparseness is a main challenge inherent to probabilistic modeling and reasoning of co-occurrence in statistical inference. The behavior of a class of natural integrals called E-integrals is investigated based on the defined conditional probability of co-occurrence. The results on the properties of E-integral are presented. The paper offers a novel measure-theoretic framework where E-integral as a basic measure-theoretic concept can be the starting point for the expectation functional approach preferred by Whittle (1992) and Pollard (2001) to the development of probability theory for the inherent challenge of co-occurrences emerging in modern high-dimensional co-occurrence data problems and opens the doors to more sophisticated and interesting research in complex high-dimensional co-occurrence data science.

    "abstract": "Despite the great promise of quantum machine learning models, there are several challenges one must overcome before unlocking their full potential. For instance, models based on quantum neural networks (QNNs) can suffer from excessive local minima and barren plateaus in their training landscapes. Recently, the nascent field of geometric quantum machine learning (GQML) has emerged as a potential solution to some of those issues. The key insight of GQML is that one should design architectures, such as equivariant QNNs, encoding the symmetries of the problem at hand. Here, we focus on problems with permutation symmetry (i.e., the group of symmetry $S_n$), and show how to build $S_n$-equivariant QNNs. We provide an analytical study of their performance, proving that they do not suffer from barren plateaus, quickly reach overparametrization, and can generalize well from small amounts of data. To verify our results, we perform numerical simulations for a graph state classification task. Our work provides the first theoretical guarantees for equivariant QNNs, thus indicating the extreme power and potential of GQML. ",
