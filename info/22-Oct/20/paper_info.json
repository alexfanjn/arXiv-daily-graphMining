    "abstract": "In this paper, we present AnalogVNN, a simulation framework built on PyTorch which can simulate the effects of optoelectronic noise, limited precision, and signal normalization present in photonic neural network accelerators. We use this framework to train and optimize linear and convolutional neural networks with up to 9 layers and ~1.7 million parameters, while gaining insights into how normalization, activation function, reduced precision, and noise influence accuracy in analog photonic neural networks. By following the same layer structure design present in PyTorch, the AnalogVNN framework allows users to convert most digital neural network models to their analog counterparts with just a few lines of code, taking full advantage of the open-source optimization, deep learning, and GPU acceleration libraries available through PyTorch.

    "abstract": "The goal of this thesis is to develop the optimisation and generalisation theoretic foundations of learning in artificial neural networks. On optimisation, a new theoretical framework is proposed for deriving architecture-dependent first-order optimisation algorithms. The approach works by combining a \"functional majorisation\" of the loss function with \"architectural perturbation bounds\" that encode an explicit dependence on neural architecture. The framework yields optimisation methods that transfer hyperparameters across learning problems. On generalisation, a new correspondence is proposed between ensembles of networks and individual networks. It is argued that, as network width and normalised margin are taken large, the space of networks that interpolate a particular training set concentrates on an aggregated Bayesian method known as a \"Bayes point machine\". This correspondence provides a route for transferring PAC-Bayesian generalisation theorems over to individual networks. More broadly, the correspondence presents a fresh perspective on the role of regularisation in networks with vastly more parameters than data. ",

Given a single observed RGB image of the target, we can predict the translation and rotation of the camera by minimizing the residual between pixels rendered from a fast NeRF model and pixels in the observed image. We integrate a momentum-based camera extrinsic optimization procedure into Instant Neural Graphics Primitives, a recent exceptionally fast NeRF implementation. By introducing parallel Monte Carlo sampling into the pose estimation task, our method overcomes local minima and improves efficiency in a more extensive search space. We also show the importance of adopting a more robust pixel-based loss function to reduce error.

Thanks to the augmented data, we reduce the computation time and the number of demonstrations needed by IL, while providing robustness to sensing and process uncertainty. We tailor our approach to the task of learning a trajectory tracking visuomotor policy for an aerial robot, leveraging a 3D mesh of the environment as part of the data augmentation process.

    "abstract": "When reputation evaluation indicators become targets, existing indicators will lose the role of indicating the true quality; At present, the evaluation of discipline reputation mostly focuses on subjective evaluation based on objective data, and there is a dispute about reliability and validity; Due to different indicators and weight settings, it is difficult to make horizontal comparison among disciplines; The evaluation also has a certain time lag. In order to solve the above four problems, this study explores a new method of discipline reputation evaluation. Taking the business administration discipline as an example, it collects data of 5848 doctoral graduates who first entered teaching posts, establishes a directed adjacency matrix from the employment unit to the doctoral degree awarding unit, and uses the theory and method of social network analysis to conduct quantitative analysis on the doctoral mutual employment network. The results show that: (1) PhD exchange network can explain discipline reputation and is a new indicator to measure discipline reputation; (2) From the perspective of employment behavior among colleges and universities, there is horizontal flow and downward flow between the head colleges and universities, and downward flow is mainly among the middle and lower colleges. There is a time lag between college talent recruitment and academic achievement output. Therefore, the mining of the structural characteristics and network evolution trend of the PhD exchange network based on the \"foot voting\" of doctoral graduates is faster than the discipline ranking based on the follow-up achievement indicators to reflect the changes in the discipline quality, which can be used to warn the changes in the discipline quality.

    "abstract": "Understanding the determinants underlying variations in urban health status is important for informing urban design and planning, as well as public health policies. Multiple heterogeneous urban features could modulate the prevalence of diseases across different neighborhoods in cities and across different cities. This study examines heterogeneous features related to socio-demographics, population activity, mobility, and the built environment and their non-linear interactions to examine intra- and inter-city disparity in prevalence of four disease types: obesity, diabetes, cancer, and heart disease. Features related to population activity, mobility, and facility density are obtained from large-scale anonymized mobility data. These features are used in training and testing graph attention network (GAT) models to capture non-linear feature interactions as well as spatial interdependence among neighborhoods. We tested the models in five U.S. cities across the four disease types. The results show that the GAT model can predict the health status of people in neighborhoods based on the top five determinant features. The findings unveil that population activity and built-environment features along with socio-demographic features differentiate the health status of neighborhoods to such a great extent that a GAT model could predict the health status using these features with high accuracy. The results also show that the model trained on one city can predict health status in another city with high accuracy, allowing us to quantify the inter-city similarity and discrepancy in health status. The model and findings provide novel approaches and insights for urban designers, planners, and public health officials to better understand and improve health disparities in cities by considering the significant determinant features and their interactions.

To address this lack of extensibility and robustness, we propose a novel approach for automatically constructing domain-specific knowledge graphs that contain information relevant to the identification of aspect terms. We introduce a methodology for injecting information from these knowledge graphs into Transformer models, including two alternative mechanisms for knowledge insertion: via query enrichment and via manipulation of attention patterns. We demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets for cross-domain aspect term extraction using our approach and investigate how the amount of external knowledge available to the Transformer impacts model performance.

Such a context urges the adoption of artificial intelligence (AI)-driven zero-touch management and orchestration (MANO) of the end-to-end (E2E) slices under stringent service level agreements (SLAs). Specifically, the trustworthiness of the AI black-boxes in real deployment can be achieved by explainable AI (XAI) tools to build transparency between the interacting actors in the slicing ecosystem, such as tenants, infrastructure providers and operators. Inspired by the turbo principle, this paper presents a novel iterative explainable federated learning (FL) approach where a constrained resource allocation model and an \\emph{explainer} exchange -- in a closed loop (CL) fashion -- soft attributions of the features as well as inference predictions to achieve a transparent and SLA-aware zero-touch service management (ZSM) of 6G network slices at RAN-Edge setup under non-independent identically distributed (non-IID) datasets. In particular, we quantitatively validate the faithfulness of the explanations via the so-called attribution-based \\emph{confidence metric} that is included as a constraint in the run-time FL optimization task. In this respect, Integrated-Gradient (IG) as well as Input $\\times$ Gradient and SHAP are used to generate the attributions for the turbo explainable FL (TEFL), wherefore simulation results under different methods confirm its superiority over an unconstrained Integrated-Gradient \\emph{post-hoc} FL baseline.

    "abstract": "When a dynamical system can be modeled as a sequence of observations, Granger causality is a powerful approach for detecting predictive interactions between its variables. However, traditional Granger causal inference has limited utility in domains where the dynamics need to be represented as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) rather than as a linear sequence, such as with cell differentiation trajectories. Here, we present GrID-Net, a framework based on graph neural networks with lagged message passing for Granger causal inference on DAG-structured systems. Our motivating application is the analysis of single-cell multimodal data to identify genomic loci that mediate the regulation of specific genes. To our knowledge, GrID-Net is the first single-cell analysis tool that accounts for the temporal lag between a genomic locus becoming accessible and its downstream effect on a target gene's expression. We applied GrID-Net on multimodal single-cell assays that profile chromatin accessibility (ATAC-seq) and gene expression (RNA-seq) in the same cell and show that it dramatically outperforms existing methods for inferring regulatory locus-gene links, achieving up to 71% greater agreement with independent population genetics-based estimates. By extending Granger causality to DAG-structured dynamical systems, our work unlocks new domains for causal analyses and, more specifically, opens a path towards elucidating gene regulatory interactions relevant to cellular differentiation and complex human diseases at unprecedented scale and resolution.

Therefore, we propose an intra-source style augmentation (ISSA) method to improve domain generalization in semantic segmentation. Our method is based on a novel masked noise encoder for StyleGAN2 inversion. The model learns to faithfully reconstruct the image preserving its semantic layout through noise prediction. Random masking of the estimated noise enables the style mixing capability of our model, i.e. it allows to alter the global appearance without affecting the semantic layout of an image. Using the proposed masked noise encoder to randomize style and content combinations in the training set, ISSA effectively increases the diversity of training data and reduces spurious correlation. As a result, we achieve up to $12.4\\%$ mIoU improvements on driving-scene semantic segmentation under different types of data shifts, i.e., changing geographic locations, adverse weather conditions, and day to night. ISSA is model-agnostic and straightforwardly applicable with CNNs and Transformers. It is also complementary to other domain generalization techniques, e.g., it improves the recent state-of-the-art solution RobustNet by $3\\%$ mIoU in Cityscapes to Dark Z\\\"urich. ",

Towards this, we propose a simple yet effective training strategy called Gradual Batch Alternation that can adapt from a large labeled source domain to an insufficiently labeled target domain. The idea is to initiate the training with the batch of samples from the source and target domain data in an alternate fashion, but then gradually reduce the amount of the source domain data over time as the training progresses. This way the model slowly shifts towards the target domain and eventually better adapt to it. The domain adaptation experiments for 3D object detection on four benchmark autonomous driving datasets, namely ONCE, PandaSet, Waymo, and nuScenes, demonstrate significant performance gains over prior arts and strong baselines.

A fundamental problem in this type of data is comparison: given a set of such graphs, can we rank how similar they are, in such a way that we capture their geometric \"shape\" in the plane? In this paper we explore a method to compare two such embedded graphs, via a simplified combinatorial representation called a tail-less merge tree which encodes the structure based on a fixed direction. First, we examine the properties of a distance designed to compare merge trees called the branching distance, and show that the distance as defined in previous work fails to satisfy some of the requirements of a metric. We incorporate this into a new distance function called average branching distance to compare graphs by looking at the branching distance for merge trees defined over many directions. Despite the theoretical issues, we show that the definition is still quite useful in practice by using our open-source code to cluster data sets of embedded graphs. ",

A popular approach to this problem is first to train teacher models and then to use their confident predictions as pseudo ground-truth labels when training a student model. To obtain the best result, however, thresholds for prediction confidence must be adjusted. This process typically involves iterative search and repeated training of student models and is time-consuming. Therefore, we develop a method to optimize the thresholds without iterative optimization by maximizing the $F_\\beta$-score on a validation dataset, which measures the quality of pseudo labels and can be measured without training a student model. We experimentally demonstrate that our proposed method achieves an mAP comparable to that of grid search on the COCO and VOC datasets. ",

YOLO is very accurate in object detection and the centroid tracking algorithm can track any moving object efficiently.

In this paper, a speaker- and age-invariant training approach based on adversarial multi-task learning is proposed. The system consists of one generator shared network that learns to generate speaker- and age-invariant features connected to three discrimination networks, for phoneme, age, and speaker. The generator network is trained to minimize the phoneme-discrimination loss and maximize the speaker- and age-discrimination losses in an adversarial multi-task learning fashion. The generator network is a Time Delay Neural Network (TDNN) architecture while the three discriminators are feed-forward networks.

    "abstract": "Driving is very challenging when the visibility of a road lane marking is low, obscured or often invisible due to abrupt environmental change which may lead to severe vehicle clash. A large volume of research has been done on lane marking detection. Most of the lane detection methods suffer from four types of major problems: (i) abrupt illumination change due to change in time (day, night), weather, road, etc.; (ii) lane markings get obscured partially or fully when they are colored, eroded or occluded; (iii) blurred view created by adverse weather like rain or snow; and (iv) incorrect lane detection due to presence of other lookalike lines e.g. guardrails, pavement marking, road divider, vehicle lines, the shadow of trees, etc. In this paper, we proposed a robust lane detection and tracking method to detect lane marking considering the abovementioned challenging conditions. In this method, we introduced three key technologies. First, the bilateral filter is applied to smooth and preserve the edges and we introduced an optimized intensity threshold range (OITR) to improve the performance of the canny operator which detects the edges of low intensity (colored, eroded, or blurred) lane markings. Second, we proposed a robust lane verification technique, the angle and length-based geometric constraint (ALGC) algorithm followed by Hough Transform, to verify the characteristics of lane marking and to prevent incorrect lane detection. Finally, a novel lane tracking technique, the horizontally adjustable lane repositioning range (HALRR) algorithm is proposed, which can keep track of the lane position. To evaluate the performance of the proposed method we used the DSDLDE dataset with 1080x1920 resolutions at 24 frames/sec. Experimental results show that the average detection rate is 97.36%, and the average detection time is 29.06msec per frame, which outperformed the state-of-the-art method. ",

The representation learning of the heterogeneous star graph containing text nodes and type nodes is investigated in this paper. In addition, we revise the graph attention mechanism into a hybrid form to address its unreasonableness in specific topologies. The model performs the type-supervised sequence labeling after updating nodes in the graph. The annotation scheme is an extension of the single-layer sequence labeling and is able to cope with the vast majority of nested entities. Extensive experiments on public NER datasets reveal the effectiveness of our model in extracting both flat and nested entities.

    "title": "CLUTR: Curriculum Learning via Unsupervised Task Representation Learning",
    "abstract": "Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms are often known for sample inefficiency and difficult generalization. Recently, Unsupervised Environment Design (UED) emerged as a new paradigm for zero-shot generalization by simultaneously learning a task distribution and agent policies on the sampled tasks. This is a non-stationary process where the task distribution evolves along with agent policies, creating an instability over time. While past works demonstrated the potential of such approaches, sampling effectively from the task space remains an open challenge, bottlenecking these approaches. To this end, we introduce CLUTR: a novel curriculum learning algorithm that decouples task representation and curriculum learning into a two-stage optimization. It first trains a recurrent variational autoencoder on randomly generated tasks to learn a latent task manifold. Next, a teacher agent creates a curriculum by maximizing a minimax REGRET-based objective on a set of latent tasks sampled from this manifold. By keeping the task manifold fixed, we show that CLUTR successfully overcomes the non-stationarity problem and improves stability. Our experimental results show CLUTR outperforms PAIRED, a principled and popular UED method, in terms of generalization and sample efficiency in the challenging CarRacing and navigation environments: showing an 18x improvement on the F1 CarRacing benchmark. CLUTR also performs comparably to the non-UED state-of-the-art for CarRacing, outperforming it in nine of the 20 tracks. CLUTR also achieves a 33% higher solved rate than PAIRED on a set of 18 out-of-distribution navigation tasks. ",

Recently, Bubeck and Sellke proved a lower bound on the Lipschitz constant of functions that fit the training data in terms of their number of parameters. This raises an interesting open question, do -- and can -- functions with more parameters, but not necessarily more computational cost, have better robustness? We study this question for sparse Mixture of Expert models (MoEs), that make it possible to scale up the model size for a roughly constant computational cost. We theoretically show that under certain conditions on the routing and the structure of the data, MoEs can have significantly smaller Lipschitz constants than their dense counterparts. The robustness of MoEs can suffer when the highest weighted experts for an input implement sufficiently different functions. We next empirically evaluate the robustness of MoEs on ImageNet using adversarial attacks and show they are indeed more robust than dense models with the same computational cost. We make key observations showing the robustness of MoEs to the choice of experts, highlighting the redundancy of experts in models trained in practice. ",

To obtain prediction regions, we use conformal prediction, a statistical tool for uncertainty quantification, that requires availability of offline trajectory data - a reasonable assumption in many applications such as autonomous driving. The prediction regions are valid, i.e., they hold with a user-defined probability, so that the MPC is provably safe. We illustrate the results in the self-driving car simulator CARLA at a pedestrian-filled intersection. The strength of our approach is compatibility with state of the art trajectory predictors, e.g., RNNs and LSTMs, while making no assumptions on the underlying trajectory-generating distribution.

Most existing literature addresses this problem by using causal structures inferred from domain knowledge. However, there are numerous phenomenons where domain knowledge is insufficient, and the causal mechanisms must be learnt from the feedback data. Discovering the causal mechanism from RS feedback data is both novel and challenging, since RS itself is a source of intervention that can influence both the users' exposure and their willingness to interact. Also for this reason, most existing solutions become inappropriate since they require data collected free from any RS. In this paper, we first formulate the underlying causal mechanism as a causal structural model and describe a general causal structure learning framework grounded in the real-world working mechanism of RS. The essence of our approach is to acknowledge the unknown nature of RS intervention. We then derive the learning objective from our framework and propose an augmented Lagrangian solver for efficient optimization. We conduct both simulation and real-world experiments to demonstrate how our approach compares favorably to existing solutions, together with the empirical analysis from sensitivity and ablation studies.

In particular, nested entity recognition receives extensive attention for the widespread existence of the nesting scenario. The latest research migrates the well-established paradigm of set prediction in object detection to cope with entity nesting.

An end-to-end entity detection approach with proposer and regressor is presented in this paper to tackle the issues. First, the proposer utilizes the feature pyramid network to generate high-quality entity proposals. Then, the regressor refines the proposals for generating the final prediction. The model adopts encoder-only architecture and thus obtains the advantages of the richness of query semantics, high precision of entity localization, and easiness for model training. Moreover, we introduce the novel spatially modulated attention and progressive refinement for further improvement. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model achieves advanced performance in flat and nested NER, achieving a new state-of-the-art F1 score of 80.74 on the GENIA dataset and 72.38 on the WeiboNER dataset.

    "abstract": "Generating 3D point cloud (PC) data from noisy sonar measurements is a problem that has potential applications for bathymetry mapping, artificial object inspection, mapping of aquatic plants and fauna as well as underwater navigation and localization of vehicles such as submarines. Side-scan sonar sensors are available in inexpensive cost ranges, especially in fish-finders, where the transducers are usually mounted to the bottom of a boat and can approach shallower depths than the ones attached to an Uncrewed Underwater Vehicle (UUV) can. However, extracting 3D information from side-scan sonar imagery is a difficult task because of its low signal-to-noise ratio and missing angle and depth information in the imagery. Since most algorithms that generate a 3D point cloud from side-scan sonar imagery use Shape from Shading (SFS) techniques, extracting 3D information is especially difficult when the seafloor is smooth, is slowly changing in depth, or does not have identifiable objects that make acoustic shadows. This paper introduces an efficient algorithm that generates a sparse 3D point cloud from side-scan sonar images. This computation is done in a computationally efficient manner by leveraging the geometry of the first sonar return combined with known positions provided by GPS and down-scan sonar depth measurement at each data point. Additionally, this paper implements another algorithm that uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using transfer learning to perform object detection on side-scan sonar images collected in real life and generated with a simulation. The algorithm was tested on both real and synthetic images to show reasonably accurate anomaly detection and classification. ",

Thus, the design of activation functions is still an important topic in deep learning research.

In this paper, we propose a new activation function, named as \"DLU\", and investigate its approximation ability for functions with various smoothness and structures. Our theoretical results show that DLU networks can process competitive approximation performance with rational and ReLU networks, and have some advantages.

When trained on a backdoor-poisoned dataset, a DNN behaves normally on most benign test samples but makes incorrect predictions to the target class when the test sample has the backdoor pattern incorporated (i.e., contains a backdoor trigger). Here we focus on image classification tasks and show that supervised training may build stronger association between the backdoor pattern and the associated target class than that between normal features and the true class of origin. By contrast, self-supervised representation learning ignores the labels of samples and learns a feature embedding based on images' semantic content. %We thus propose to use unsupervised representation learning to avoid emphasising backdoor-poisoned training samples and learn a similar feature embedding for samples of the same class. Using a feature embedding found by self-supervised representation learning, a data cleansing method, which combines sample filtering and re-labeling, is developed. Experiments on CIFAR-10 benchmark datasets show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in mitigating backdoor attacks. ",

Previous work utilizes a predefined template to paraphrase the original sentence into a structure target sequence, which can be easily decoded as quadruplets of the form (aspect category, aspect term, opinion term, sentiment polarity). The template involves the four elements in a fixed order. However, we observe that this solution contradicts with the order-free property of the ASQP task, since there is no need to fix the template order as long as the quadruplet is extracted correctly. Inspired by the observation, we study the effects of template orders and find that some orders help the generative model achieve better performance. It is hypothesized that different orders provide various views of the quadruplet. Therefore, we propose a simple but effective method to identify the most proper orders, and further combine multiple proper templates as data augmentation to improve the ASQP task. Specifically, we use the pre-trained language model to select the orders with minimal entropy. By fine-tuning the pre-trained language model with these template orders, our approach improves the performance of quad prediction, and outperforms state-of-the-art methods significantly in low-resource settings.

Artificial neural network models were created, in which the spectroscopy data and the measured compression curves were used as an input individually and in different combinations in order to estimate the dissolution profiles.

While confusion matrices have been effective for comparative evaluation of classification and object detection models, our framework fills two key gaps. First, we relate the performance of object detection to formal requirements defined over downstream high-level planning tasks. In particular, we provide empirical results that show that the choice of a good object detection algorithm, with respect to formal requirements on the overall system, significantly depends on the downstream planning and control design. Secondly, unlike the traditional confusion matrix, our metrics account for variations in performance with respect to the distance between the ego and the object being detected.

In the detection step, CFAR detector is applied to detect each candidate frequency, and remove the most unlikely frequency component. Then, the Newton refinements are used to refine the remaining parameters. The relationship between the false alarm rate and the required threshold is established. By comparing with the NOMP, NOMP-CFAR has only $1$ dB performance loss in additive white Gaussian noise scenario with false alarm probability $10^{-2}$ and detection probability $0.8$ without knowledge of noise variance. For varied noise variance scenario, NOMP-CFAR still preserves its CFAR property, while NOMP violates the CFAR.

To denoise implicit feedback, some efforts have been devoted to graph data augmentation (GDA) methods. Although the bi-level optimization thought of GDA guarantees better recommendation performance theoretically, it also leads to expensive time costs and severe space explosion problems. Specifically, bi-level optimization involves repeated traversal of all positive and negative instances after each optimization of the recommendation model. In this paper, we propose a new denoising paradigm, i.e., Quick Graph Conversion (QGrace), to effectively transform the original interaction graph into a purified (for positive instances) and densified (for negative instances) interest graph during the recommendation model training process. In QGrace, we leverage the gradient matching scheme based on elaborated generative models to fulfill the conversion and generation of an interest graph, elegantly overcoming the high time and space cost problems. To enable recommendation models to run on interest graphs that lack implicit feedback data, we provide a fine-grained objective function from the perspective of alignment and uniformity. The experimental results on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that the QGrace outperforms the state-of-the-art GDA methods and recommendation models in effectiveness and robustness. ",

Furthermore, live encoders use the fastest available preset for encoding to ensure the minimum possible latency in streaming. For live encoders, it is expected that the encoding speed is equal to the video framerate. An optimized encoding preset may result in (i) increased Quality of Experience (QoE) and (ii) improved CPU utilization while encoding. In this light, this paper introduces a Content-Adaptive encoder Preset prediction Scheme (CAPS) for adaptive live video streaming applications. In this scheme, the encoder preset is determined using Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT)-energy-based low-complexity spatial and temporal features for every video segment, the number of CPU threads allocated for each encoding instance, and the target encoding speed. Experimental results show that CAPS yields an overall quality improvement of 0.83 dB PSNR and 3.81 VMAF with the same bitrate, compared to the fastest preset encoding of the HTTP Live Streaming (HLS) bitrate ladder using x265 HEVC open-source encoder.

Especially, we get 44.98%, 38.42% and 40.76% F1 score on BC5CDR, KD-DTI and DDI end-to-end relation extraction tasks respectively, and 78.2% accuracy on PubMedQA, creating a new record. Our case study on text generation further demonstrates the advantage of BioGPT on biomedical literature to generate fluent descriptions for biomedical terms.

Existing augmentation methods either manipulate the words in the original text that require hand-crafted in-domain knowledge, or leverage generative models which solicit dependency order among entities. To alleviate the excessive reliance on the dependency order among entities in existing augmentation paradigms, we develop an entity-to-text instead of text-to-entity based data augmentation method named: EnTDA to decouple the dependencies between entities by adding, deleting, replacing and swapping entities, and adopt these augmented data to bootstrap the generalization ability of the NER model. Furthermore, we introduce a diversity beam search to increase the diversity of the augmented data. Experiments on thirteen NER datasets across three tasks (flat NER, nested NER, and discontinuous NER) and two settings (full data NER and low resource NER) show that EnTDA could consistently outperform the baselines.

    "abstract": "Because of their abundance of amino acids, polysaccharides, and many other nutrients that benefit human beings, mushrooms are deservedly popular as dietary cuisine both worldwide and in China. However, if people eat poisonous fungi by mistake, they may suffer from nausea, vomiting, mental disorder, acute anemia, or even death. Each year in China, there are around 8000 people became sick, and 70 died as a result of eating toxic mushrooms by mistake. It is counted that there are thousands of kinds of mushrooms among which only around 900 types are edible, thus without specialized knowledge, the probability of eating toxic mushrooms by mistake is very high. Most people deem that the only characteristic of poisonous mushrooms is a bright colour, however, some kinds of them do not correspond to this trait. In order to prevent people from eating these poisonous mushrooms, we propose to use deep learning methods to indicate whether a mushroom is toxic through analyzing hundreds of edible and toxic mushrooms smartphone pictures. We crowdsource a mushroom image dataset that contains 250 images of poisonous mushrooms and 200 images of edible mushrooms. The Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is a specialized type of artificial neural networks that use a mathematical operation called convolution in place of general matrix multiplication in at least one of their layers, which can generate a relatively precise result by analyzing a huge amount of images, and thus is very suitable for our research. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model has high credibility and can provide a decision-making basis for the selection of edible fungi, so as to reduce the morbidity and mortality caused by eating poisonous mushrooms. We also open source our hand collected mushroom image dataset so that peer researchers can also deploy their own model to advance poisonous mushroom identification. ",

In order to address this issue, this work presents the first corpus annotated with naturally occurring metaphors in Spanish large enough to develop systems to perform metaphor detection. The presented dataset, CoMeta, includes texts from various domains, namely, news, political discourse, Wikipedia and reviews. In order to label CoMeta, we apply the MIPVU method, the guidelines most commonly used to systematically annotate metaphor on real data. We use our newly created dataset to provide competitive baselines by fine-tuning several multilingual and monolingual state-of-the-art large language models. Furthermore, by leveraging the existing VUAM English data in addition to CoMeta, we present the, to the best of our knowledge, first cross-lingual experiments on supervised metaphor detection. Finally, we perform a detailed error analysis that explores the seemingly high transfer of everyday metaphor across these two languages and datasets. ",

For highly nonlinear problems with insufficient data set, the prediction accuracy of NN models becomes unstable, resulting in a decrease in the accuracy of ensembles. Therefore, this study proposes a frequency distribution-based ensemble that identifies core prediction values, which are expected to be concentrated near the true prediction value. The frequency distribution-based ensemble classifies core prediction values supported by multiple prediction values by conducting statistical analysis with a frequency distribution, which is based on various prediction values obtained from a given prediction point. The frequency distribution-based ensemble can improve predictive performance by excluding prediction values with low accuracy and coping with the uncertainty of the most frequent value. An adaptive sampling strategy that sequentially adds samples based on the core prediction variance calculated as the variance of the core prediction values is proposed to improve the predictive performance of the frequency distribution-based ensemble efficiently. Results of various case studies show that the prediction accuracy of the frequency distribution-based ensemble is higher than that of Kriging and other existing ensemble methods. In addition, the proposed adaptive sampling strategy effectively improves the predictive performance of the frequency distribution-based ensemble compared with the previously developed space-filling and prediction variance-based strategies.

However, they treat all labels and label embeddings as uncorrelated individuals, ignoring the dependencies among them. Besides, they conduct the decoding for the two tasks independently, without leveraging the correlations between them. Therefore, in this paper, we first construct a Heterogeneous Label Graph (HLG) containing two kinds of topologies: (1) statistical dependencies based on labels' co-occurrence patterns and hierarchies in slot labels; (2) rich relations among the label nodes. Then we propose a novel model termed ReLa-Net. It can capture beneficial correlations among the labels from HLG. The label correlations are leveraged to enhance semantic-label interactions. Moreover, we also propose the label-aware inter-dependent decoding mechanism to further exploit the label correlations for decoding. Experiment results show that our ReLa-Net significantly outperforms previous models. Remarkably, ReLa-Net surpasses the previous best model by over 20\\% in terms of overall accuracy on MixATIS dataset. ",

    "abstract": "We consider the general setting for partial matching of two or multiple graphs, in the sense that not necessarily all the nodes in one graph can find their correspondences in another graph and vice versa. We take a universe matching perspective to this ubiquitous problem, whereby each node is either matched into an anchor in a virtual universe graph or regarded as an outlier. Such a universe matching scheme enjoys a few important merits, which have not been adopted in existing learning-based graph matching (GM) literature. First, the subtle logic for inlier matching and outlier detection can be clearly modeled, which is otherwise less convenient to handle in the pairwise matching scheme. Second, it enables end-to-end learning especially for universe level affinity metric learning for inliers matching, and loss design for gathering outliers together. Third, the resulting matching model can easily handle new arriving graphs under online matching, or even the graphs coming from different categories of the training set. To our best knowledge, this is the first deep learning network that can cope with two-graph matching, multiple-graph matching, online matching, and mixture graph matching simultaneously. Extensive experimental results show the state-of-the-art performance of our method in these settings. ",

We focus on the $\\epsilon$-coreset for robust clustering, a small proxy of the dataset that preserves the clustering cost within $\\epsilon$-relative error for all center sets. Our main result is an $\\epsilon$-coreset of size $O(m + \\mathrm{poly}(k \\epsilon^{-1}))$ that can be constructed in near-linear time. This significantly improves previous results, which either suffers an exponential dependence on $(m + k)$ [Feldman and Schulman, SODA'12], or has a weaker bi-criteria guarantee [Huang et al., FOCS'18]. Furthermore, we show this dependence in $m$ is nearly-optimal, and the fact that it is isolated from other factors may be crucial for dealing with large number of outliers. We construct our coresets by adapting to the outlier setting a recent framework [Braverman et al., FOCS'22] which was designed for capacity-constrained clustering, overcoming a new challenge that the participating terms in the cost, particularly the excluded $m$ outlier points, are dependent on the center set $C$. We validate our coresets on various datasets, and we observe a superior size-accuracy tradeoff compared with popular baselines including uniform sampling and sensitivity sampling. We also achieve a significant speedup of existing approximation algorithms for robust clustering using our coresets. ",

    "abstract": "This paper proposes an efficient iris localization method without using iris segmentation and circle fitting. Conventional iris localization methods first extract iris regions by using semantic segmentation methods such as U-Net. Afterward, the inner and outer iris circles are localized using the traditional circle fitting algorithm. However, this approach requires high-resolution encoder-decoder networks for iris segmentation, so it causes computational costs to be high. In addition, traditional circle fitting tends to be sensitive to noise in input images and fitting parameters, causing the iris recognition performance to be poor. To solve these problems, we propose an iris localization network (ILN), that can directly localize pupil and iris circles with eyelid points from a low-resolution iris image. We also introduce a pupil refinement network (PRN) to improve the accuracy of pupil localization. Experimental results show that the combination of ILN and PRN works in 34.5 ms for one iris image on a CPU, and its localization performance outperforms conventional iris segmentation methods. In addition, generalized evaluation results show that the proposed method has higher robustness for datasets in different domain than other segmentation methods. Furthermore, we also confirm that the proposed ILN and PRN improve the iris recognition accuracy. ",

    "abstract": "In this work, we empirically confirm that non-autoregressive translation with an iterative refinement mechanism (IR-NAT) suffers from poor acceleration robustness because it is more sensitive to decoding batch size and computing device setting than autoregressive translation (AT). Inspired by it, we attempt to investigate how to combine the strengths of autoregressive and non-autoregressive translation paradigms better. To this end, we demonstrate through synthetic experiments that prompting a small number of AT's predictions can promote one-shot non-autoregressive translation to achieve the equivalent performance of IR-NAT. Following this line, we propose a new two-stage translation prototype called hybrid-regressive translation (HRT). Specifically, HRT first generates discontinuous sequences via autoregression (e.g., make a prediction every k tokens, k>1) and then fills in all previously skipped tokens at once in a non-autoregressive manner. We also propose a bag of techniques to effectively and efficiently train HRT without adding any model parameters. HRT achieves the state-of-the-art BLEU score of 28.49 on the WMT En-De task and is at least 1.5x faster than AT, regardless of batch size and device. In addition, another bonus of HRT is that it successfully inherits the good characteristics of AT in the deep-encoder-shallow-decoder architecture. Concretely, compared to the vanilla HRT with a 6-layer encoder and 6-layer decoder, the inference speed of HRT with a 12-layer encoder and 1-layer decoder is further doubled on both GPU and CPU without BLEU loss.

This model allows assessing how various elements like the duration of external influence, targeted market segment, or intensity of action affect the outcome regarding market greening level. The model evaluation results indicate that governing bodies, depending on the market \"openness\" to green activities, can adjust the duration and intensity of the proposed action. The strength of the impact can be changed by the public or private authority with the use of obligatory or voluntary rules and the proportion of influenced banks.

We found that comment deletion decreased subsequent rule-breaking behavior in shorter threads (20 or fewer comments), even among other participants, suggesting that the intervention prevented conversations from derailing. Further, the effect of deletion on the affected user's subsequent rule-breaking behavior was longer-lived than its effect on reducing commenting in general, suggesting that users were deterred from rule-breaking but not from continuing to comment. However, hiding (rather than deleting) content had small and statistically insignificant effects.

Existing traffic control systems only possess a local perspective over the multiple scales of traffic evolution, namely the intersection level, the corridor level, and the region level respectively. Capturing uncertainty under complex traffic spatio-temporal interactions is a very difficult problem and we often experience how fragile such systems are in reality. But luckily, despite its complex mechanics, traffic is described by various periodic phenomena. Workday flow distributions in the morning and evening commuting times can be exploited to make traffic adaptive and robust to disruptions. Additionally, controlling traffic is also based on a periodic process, choosing the phase of green time to allocate to opposite directions right of the pass and complementary red time phase for adjacent directions. In our work, we consider a novel system for road traffic control based on a network of interacting oscillators. Such a model has the advantage to capture temporal and spatial interactions of traffic light phasing as well as the network-level evolution of the traffic macroscopic features (i.e. flow, density). In this study, we propose a new realization of the antifragile control framework to control a network of interacting oscillator-based traffic light models to achieve region-level flow optimization. We demonstrate that antifragile control can capture the volatility of the urban road environment and the uncertainty about the distribution of the disruptions that can occur. We complement our control-theoretic design and analysis with experiments on a real-world setup comparatively discussing the benefits of an antifragile design for traffic control. ",

Experimental results show that the proposed techniques effectively tame the non-optimal trajectories for policy constraint offline RL methods, evaluated on a set of contaminated D4RL Mujoco and Adroit datasets.

    "abstract": "Recently, unsupervised adversarial training (AT) has been extensively studied to attain robustness with the models trained upon unlabeled data. To this end, previous studies have applied existing supervised adversarial training techniques to self-supervised learning (SSL) frameworks. However, all have resorted to untargeted adversarial learning as obtaining targeted adversarial examples is unclear in the SSL setting lacking of label information. In this paper, we propose a novel targeted adversarial training method for the SSL frameworks. Specifically, we propose a target selection algorithm for the adversarial SSL frameworks; it is designed to select the most confusing sample for each given instance based on similarity and entropy, and perturb the given instance toward the selected target sample. Our method significantly enhances the robustness of an SSL model without requiring large batches of images or additional models, unlike existing works aimed at achieving the same goal. Moreover, our method is readily applicable to general SSL frameworks that only uses positive pairs. We validate our method on benchmark datasets, on which it obtains superior robust accuracies, outperforming existing unsupervised adversarial training methods. ",

    "abstract": "Existing adversarial learning methods for enhancing the robustness of deep neural networks assume the availability of a large amount of data from which we can generate adversarial examples. However, in an adversarial meta-learning setting, the model needs to train with only a few adversarial examples to learn a robust model for unseen tasks, which is a very difficult goal to achieve. Further, learning transferable robust representations for unseen domains is a difficult problem even with a large amount of data. To tackle such a challenge, we propose a novel adversarial self-supervised meta-learning framework with bilevel attacks which aims to learn robust representations that can generalize across tasks and domains. Specifically, in the inner loop, we update the parameters of the given encoder by taking inner gradient steps using two different sets of augmented samples, and generate adversarial examples for each view by maximizing the instance classification loss. Then, in the outer loop, we meta-learn the encoder parameter to maximize the agreement between the two adversarial examples, which enables it to learn robust representations. We experimentally validate the effectiveness of our approach on unseen domain adaptation tasks, on which it achieves impressive performance. Specifically, our method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art meta-adversarial learning methods on few-shot learning tasks, as well as self-supervised learning baselines in standard learning settings with large-scale datasets.

These scores need to be transformed into actual predictions by thresholding, so that the proportion of examples marked as anomalies equals the expected proportion of anomalies, called contamination factor. Unfortunately, there are no good methods for estimating the contamination factor itself. We address this need from a Bayesian perspective, introducing a method for estimating the posterior distribution of the contamination factor of a given unlabeled dataset. We leverage on outputs of several anomaly detectors as a representation that already captures the basic notion of anomalousness and estimate the contamination using a specific mixture formulation. Empirically on 22 datasets, we show that the estimated distribution is well-calibrated and that setting the threshold using the posterior mean improves the anomaly detectors' performance over several alternative methods.

Traditionally, the notion of authorship and its accompanying privacy concern is only toward human authors. However, in recent years, due to the explosive advancements in Neural Text Generation (NTG) techniques in NLP, capable of synthesizing human-quality open-ended texts (so-called \"neural texts\"), one has to now consider authorships by humans, machines, or their combination. Due to the implications and potential threats of neural texts when used maliciously, it has become critical to understand the limitations of traditional AA/AO solutions and develop novel AA/AO solutions in dealing with neural texts. In this survey, therefore, we make a comprehensive review of recent literature on the attribution and obfuscation of neural text authorship from a Data Mining perspective, and share our view on their limitations and promising research directions.

Specifically, a simple yet effective asymmetric input approach is proposed to make different data flows through the teacher and student networks.

Besides, to further explore the semantic information of the teacher network and obtain effective discriminative boundaries, the Weight Mask Block (WMB) and the post-segmentation module are proposede. WMB leverages a weighted strategy by exploring teacher-student feature maps to highlight anomalous features. The post-segmentation module further learns the anomalous features and obtains valid discriminative boundaries.

This paper proposes a fusion method of shallow and deep features to fully use ENF information by exploiting the complementary nature of features at different levels to more accurately describe the changes in inconsistency produced by tampering operations to raw digital audio. The method achieves 97.03% accuracy on three classic databases: Carioca 1, Carioca 2, and New Spanish. In addition, we have achieved an accuracy of 88.31% on the newly constructed database GAUDI-DI.

A central concept in cryptocurrencies is \"mining pools\", groups of cooperating cryptocurrency miners who agree to share block rewards in proportion to their contributed mining power. Despite many promised benefits of cryptocurrencies, they are equally utilized for malicious activities; e.g., ransomware payments, stealthy command, control, etc. Thus, understanding the interplay between cryptocurrencies, particularly the mining pools, and other essential infrastructure for profiling and modeling is important. In this paper, we study the interplay between mining pools and public clouds by analyzing their communication association through passive domain name system (pDNS) traces. We observe that 24 cloud providers have some association with mining pools as observed from the pDNS query traces, where popular public cloud providers, namely Amazon and Google, have almost 48% of such an association. Moreover, we found that the cloud provider presence and cloud provider-to-mining pool association both exhibit a heavy-tailed distribution, emphasizing an intrinsic preferential attachment model with both mining pools and cloud providers. We measure the security risk and exposure of the cloud providers, as that might aid in understanding the intent of the mining: among the top two cloud providers, we found almost 35% and 30% of their associated endpoints are positively detected to be associated with malicious activities, per the virustotal.com scan. Finally, we found that the mining pools presented in our dataset are predominantly used for mining Metaverse currencies, highlighting a shift in cryptocurrency use, and demonstrating the prevalence of mining using public clouds.

This paper proposes disentangled representations with adversarial training to selectively balance the confounders in the binary treatment setting for the ITE estimation. The adversarial training of treatment policy selectively encourages treatment-agnostic balanced representations for the confounders and helps to estimate the ITE in the observational studies via counterfactual inference. Empirical results on synthetic and real-world datasets, with varying degrees of confounding, prove that our proposed approach improves the state-of-the-art methods in achieving lower error in the ITE estimation.

In this paper, we examine how WBs on discretized meshes relate to the geometry of the underlying manifold. We first provide a generic stability result with respect to the input cost matrices.

However, I will argue that these models are not suitable as neural models of human language. Firstly, because they fail on fundamental boundary conditions, such as the amount of learning they require. This would in fact imply that the mechanisms of GPT and brain language processing are fundamentally different. Secondly, because they do not possess the logistics of access needed for compositional and productive human language processing. Neural architectures could possess logistics of access based on small-world like network structures, in which processing does not consist of symbol manipulation but of controlling the flow of activation. In this view, two complementary approaches would be needed to investigate the relation between brain and cognition. Investigating learning methods could reveal how 'learned cognition' as found in deep learning could develop in the brain. However, neural architectures with logistics of access should also be developed to account for 'productive cognition' as required for natural or artificial human language processing. Later on, these approaches could perhaps be combined to see how such architectures could develop by learning and development from a simpler basis. ",

A popular choice for finding such communities is to find subgraphs with a high average degree. While useful, interpreting such subgraphs may be difficult.

In this paper, we study finding dense subgraphs that can be explained with the labels on edges. More specifically, we are looking for a set of labels so that the induced subgraph has a high average degree. There are many ways to induce a subgraph from a set of labels, and we study two cases: First, we study conjunctive-induced dense subgraphs, where the subgraph edges need to have all labels. Secondly, we study disjunctive-induced dense subgraphs, where the subgraph edges need to have at least one label. We show that both problems are $\\textbf{NP}$-hard. Because of the hardness, we resort to greedy heuristics. We show that we can implement the greedy search efficiently: the respective running times for finding conjunctive-induced and disjunctive-induced dense subgraphs are in $\\mathcal{O}(p \\log k)$ and $\\mathcal{O}(p \\log^2 k)$, where $p$ is the number of edge-label pairs and $k$ is the number of labels.

Compared with static graphs, dynamic graphs are the integrative reflection of both the temporal-invariant or stable characteristics of nodes and the dynamic-fluctuate preference changing with time. However, existing dynamic graph representation learning methods generally confound these two types of information into a shared representation space, which may lead to poor explanation, less robustness, and a limited ability when applied to different downstream tasks. Taking the real dynamic graphs of daily capital transactions on Tencent as an example, the learned representation of the state-of-the-art method achieves only 32% accuracy in predicting temporal-invariant characteristics of users like annual income. In this paper, we introduce a novel temporal invariance-fluctuation disentangled representation learning framework for dynamic graphs, namely DyTed. In particular, we propose a temporal-invariant representation generator and a dynamic-fluctuate representation generator with carefully designed pretext tasks to identify the two types of representations in dynamic graphs. To further enhance the disentanglement or separation, we propose a disentanglement-aware discriminator under an adversarial learning framework. Extensive experiments on Tencent and five commonly used public datasets demonstrate that the different parts of our disentangled representation can achieve state-of-the-art performance on various downstream tasks, as well as be more robust against noise, and is a general framework that can further improve existing methods.

    "abstract": "Embedded topic models are able to learn interpretable topics even with large and heavy-tailed vocabularies. However, they generally hold the Euclidean embedding space assumption, leading to a basic limitation in capturing hierarchical relations. To this end, we present a novel framework that introduces hyperbolic embeddings to represent words and topics. With the tree-likeness property of hyperbolic space, the underlying semantic hierarchy among words and topics can be better exploited to mine more interpretable topics. Furthermore, due to the superiority of hyperbolic geometry in representing hierarchical data, tree-structure knowledge can also be naturally injected to guide the learning of a topic hierarchy. Therefore, we further develop a regularization term based on the idea of contrastive learning to inject prior structural knowledge efficiently. Experiments on both topic taxonomy discovery and document representation demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves improved performance against existing embedded topic models. ",

    "abstract": "Deep Neural Network (DNN) based point cloud semantic segmentation has presented significant achievements on large-scale labeled aerial laser point cloud datasets. However, annotating such large-scaled point clouds is time-consuming. Due to density variations and spatial heterogeneity of the Airborne Laser Scanning (ALS) point clouds, DNNs lack generalization capability and thus lead to unpromising semantic segmentation, as the DNN trained in one region underperform when directly utilized in other regions. However, Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) is a promising way to solve this problem by pre-training a DNN model utilizing unlabeled samples followed by a fine-tuned downstream task involving very limited labels. Hence, this work proposes a hard-negative sample aware self-supervised contrastive learning method to pre-train the model for semantic segmentation. The traditional contrastive learning for point clouds selects the hardest negative samples by solely relying on the distance between the embedded features derived from the learning process, potentially evolving some negative samples from the same classes to reduce the contrastive learning effectiveness. Therefore, we design an AbsPAN (Absolute Positive And Negative samples) strategy based on k-means clustering to filter the possible false-negative samples. Experiments on two typical ALS benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed method is more appealing than supervised training schemes without pre-training. Especially when the labels are severely inadequate (10% of the ISPRS training set), the results obtained by the proposed HAVANA method still exceed 94% of the supervised paradigm performance with full training set.

    "abstract": "Subgraph similarity search, one of the core problems in graph search, concerns whether a target graph approximately contains a query graph. The problem is recently touched by neural methods. However, current neural methods do not consider pruning the target graph, though pruning is critically important in traditional calculations of subgraph similarities. One obstacle to applying pruning in neural methods is {the discrete property of pruning}. In this work, we convert graph pruning to a problem of node relabeling and then relax it to a differentiable problem. Based on this idea, we further design a novel neural network to approximate a type of subgraph distance: the subgraph edit distance (SED). {In particular, we construct the pruning component using a neural structure, and the entire model can be optimized end-to-end.} In the design of the model, we propose an attention mechanism to leverage the information about the query graph and guide the pruning of the target graph. Moreover, we develop a multi-head pruning strategy such that the model can better explore multiple ways of pruning the target graph. The proposed model establishes new state-of-the-art results across seven benchmark datasets. Extensive analysis of the model indicates that the proposed model can reasonably prune the target graph for SED computation.

Thus, it is essential to measure their robustness against various attack methods, especially when a hand-crafted FVR system is used without any countermeasure methods. In this paper, we are the first in the literature to introduce master vein attacks in which we craft a vein-looking image so that it can falsely match with as many identities as possible by the FVR systems. We present two methods for generating master veins for use in attacking these systems. The first uses an adaptation of the latent variable evolution algorithm with a proposed generative model (a multi-stage combination of beta-VAE and WGAN-GP models). The second uses an adversarial machine learning attack method to attack a strong surrogate CNN-based recognition system. The two methods can be easily combined to boost their attack ability. Experimental results demonstrated that the proposed methods alone and together achieved false acceptance rates up to 73.29% and 88.79%, respectively, against Miura's hand-crafted FVR system. We also point out that Miura's system is easily compromised by non-vein-looking samples generated by a WGAN-GP model with false acceptance rates up to 94.21%. The results raise the alarm about the robustness of such systems and suggest that master vein attacks should be considered an important security measure. ",

    "abstract": "The goal of this paper is to investigate a family of optimization problems arising from list homomorphisms, and to understand what the best possible algorithms are if we restrict the problem to bounded-treewidth graphs. For a fixed $H$, the input of the optimization problem LHomVD($H$) is a graph $G$ with lists $L(v)$, and the task is to find a set $X$ of vertices having minimum size such that $(G-X,L)$ has a list homomorphism to $H$. We define analogously the edge-deletion variant LHomED($H$). This expressive family of problems includes members that are essentially equivalent to fundamental problems such as Vertex Cover, Max Cut, Odd Cycle Transversal, and Edge/Vertex Multiway Cut. For both variants, we first characterize those graphs $H$ that make the problem polynomial-time solvable and show that the problem is NP-hard for every other fixed $H$. Second, as our main result, we determine for every graph $H$ for which the problem is NP-hard, the smallest possible constant $c_H$ such that the problem can be solved in time $c^t_H\\cdot n^{O(1)}$ if a tree decomposition of $G$ having width $t$ is given in the input, assuming the SETH. Let $i(H)$ be the maximum size of a set of vertices in $H$ that have pairwise incomparable neighborhoods. For the vertex-deletion variant LHomVD($H$), we show that the smallest possible constant is $i(H)+1$ for every $H$. The situation is more complex for the edge-deletion version. For every $H$, one can solve LHomED($H$) in time $i(H)^t\\cdot n^{O(1)}$ if a tree decomposition of width $t$ is given. However, the existence of a specific type of decomposition of $H$ shows that there are graphs $H$ where LHomED($H$) can be solved significantly more efficiently and the best possible constant can be arbitrarily smaller than $i(H)$. Nevertheless, we determine this best possible constant and (assuming the SETH) prove tight bounds for every fixed $H$. ",

We discuss the deficiencies in previous work and propose our suggestions that the research on the Security-oriented adversarial NLP (SoadNLP) should: (1) evaluate their methods on security tasks to demonstrate the real-world concerns; (2) consider real-world attackers' goals, instead of developing impractical methods. To this end, we first collect, process, and release a security datasets collection Advbench. Then, we reformalize the task and adjust the emphasis on different goals in SoadNLP. Next, we propose a simple method based on heuristic rules that can easily fulfill the actual adversarial goals to simulate real-world attack methods. We conduct experiments on both the attack and the defense sides on Advbench. Experimental results show that our method has higher practical value, indicating that the research paradigm in SoadNLP may start from our new benchmark.

Identifying the informal roles and understanding their subtle changes are critical to designing sociability mechanisms.

We propose a visual analytics system, RoleSeer, to investigate informal roles from the perspectives of behavioral interactions and depict their dynamic interconversions and transitions.

    "abstract": "Masked Image Modeling (MIM) has recently been established as a potent pre-training paradigm. A pretext task is constructed by masking patches in an input image, and this masked content is then predicted by a neural network using visible patches as sole input. This pre-training leads to state-of-the-art performance when finetuned for high-level semantic tasks, e.g. image classification and object detection. In this paper we instead seek to learn representations that transfer well to a wide variety of 3D vision and lower-level geometric downstream tasks, such as depth prediction or optical flow estimation. Inspired by MIM, we propose an unsupervised representation learning task trained from pairs of images showing the same scene from different viewpoints. More precisely, we propose the pretext task of cross-view completion where the first input image is partially masked, and this masked content has to be reconstructed from the visible content and the second image. In single-view MIM, the masked content often cannot be inferred precisely from the visible portion only, so the model learns to act as a prior influenced by high-level semantics. In contrast, this ambiguity can be resolved with cross-view completion from the second unmasked image, on the condition that the model is able to understand the spatial relationship between the two images. Our experiments show that our pretext task leads to significantly improved performance for monocular 3D vision downstream tasks such as depth estimation. In addition, our model can be directly applied to binocular downstream tasks like optical flow or relative camera pose estimation, for which we obtain competitive results without bells and whistles, i.e., using a generic architecture without any task-specific design.

    "abstract": "The training of graph neural networks (GNNs) is extremely time consuming because sparse graph-based operations are hard to be accelerated by hardware. Prior art explores trading off the computational precision to reduce the time complexity via sampling-based approximation. Based on the idea, previous works successfully accelerate the dense matrix based operations (e.g., convolution and linear) with negligible accuracy drop. However, unlike dense matrices, sparse matrices are stored in the irregular data format such that each row/column may have different number of non-zero entries. Thus, compared to the dense counterpart, approximating sparse operations has two unique challenges (1) we cannot directly control the efficiency of approximated sparse operation since the computation is only executed on non-zero entries; (2) sub-sampling sparse matrices is much more inefficient due to the irregular data format. To address the issues, our key idea is to control the accuracy-efficiency trade off by optimizing computation resource allocation layer-wisely and epoch-wisely. Specifically, for the first challenge, we customize the computation resource to different sparse operations, while limit the total used resource below a certain budget. For the second challenge, we cache previous sampled sparse matrices to reduce the epoch-wise sampling overhead. Finally, we propose a switching mechanisms to improve the generalization of GNNs trained with approximated operations. To this end, we propose Randomized Sparse Computation, which for the first time demonstrate the potential of training GNNs with approximated operations. In practice, rsc can achieve up to $11.6\\times$ speedup for a single sparse operation and a $1.6\\times$ end-to-end wall-clock time speedup with negligible accuracy drop. ",

Recent work pointed out the strength of integrating SSLR with single-channel speech enhancement for ASR in noisy environments. This paper further advances this integration by dealing with multi-channel input. We propose a novel end-to-end architecture by integrating dereverberation, beamforming, SSLR, and ASR within a single neural network. Our system achieves the best performance reported in the literature on the CHiME-4 6-channel track with a word error rate (WER) of 1.77%. While the WavLM-based strong SSLR demonstrates promising results by itself, the end-to-end integration with the weighted power minimization distortionless response beamformer, which simultaneously performs dereverberation and denoising, improves WER significantly. Its effectiveness is also validated on the REVERB dataset. ",

    "abstract": "As industrial applications are increasingly automated by machine learning models, enforcing personal data ownership and intellectual property rights requires tracing training data back to their rightful owners. Membership inference algorithms approach this problem by using statistical techniques to discern whether a target sample was included in a model's training set. However, existing methods only utilize the unaltered target sample or simple augmentations of the target to compute statistics. Such a sparse sampling of the model's behavior carries little information, leading to poor inference capabilities. In this work, we use adversarial tools to directly optimize for queries that are discriminative and diverse. Our improvements achieve significantly more accurate membership inference than existing methods, especially in offline scenarios and in the low false-positive regime which is critical in legal settings.

In this work we propose to solve this issue by introducing a new multi-view data augmentation pipeline that preserves alignment among views. Additionally to traditional augmentation of the input image we also propose a second level of augmentation applied directly at the scene level.

Still, many classes of MILPs quickly become unsolvable as their sizes increase, motivating researchers to seek new acceleration techniques for MILPs. With deep learning, they have obtained strong empirical results, and many results were obtained by applying graph neural networks (GNNs) to making decisions in various stages of MILP solution processes. This work discovers a fundamental limitation: there exist feasible and infeasible MILPs that all GNNs will, however, treat equally, indicating GNN's lacking power to express general MILPs. Then, we show that, by restricting the MILPs to unfoldable ones or by adding random features, there exist GNNs that can reliably predict MILP feasibility, optimal objective values, and optimal solutions up to prescribed precision. We conducted small-scale numerical experiments to validate our theoretical findings. ",

We establish non-asymptotic upper bounds for the excess risk of the proposed nonparametric quantile regression function estimators. Our error bounds achieve optimal minimax rate of convergence for the Holder class, and the prefactors of the error bounds depend polynomially on the dimension of the predictor, instead of exponentially. Based on the proposed non-crossing penalized deep quantile regression, we construct conformal prediction intervals that are fully adaptive to heterogeneity. The proposed prediction interval is shown to have good properties in terms of validity and accuracy under reasonable conditions. We also derive non-asymptotic upper bounds for the difference of the lengths between the proposed non-crossing conformal prediction interval and the theoretically oracle prediction interval.

    "abstract": "Computing observables from conditioned dynamics is typically computationally hard, because, although obtaining independent samples efficiently from the unconditioned dynamics is usually feasible, generally most of the samples must be discarded (in a form of importance sampling) because they do not satisfy the imposed conditions. Sampling directly from the conditioned distribution is non-trivial, as conditioning breaks the causal properties of the dynamics which ultimately renders the sampling procedure efficient. One standard way of achieving it is through a Metropolis Monte-Carlo procedure, but this procedure is normally slow and a very large number of Monte-Carlo steps is needed to obtain a small number of statistically independent samples. In this work, we propose an alternative method to produce independent samples from a conditioned distribution. The method learns the parameters of a generalized dynamical model that optimally describe the conditioned distribution in a variational sense. The outcome is an effective, unconditioned, dynamical model, from which one can trivially obtain independent samples, effectively restoring causality of the conditioned distribution. The consequences are twofold: on the one hand, it allows us to efficiently compute observables from the conditioned dynamics by simply averaging over independent samples. On the other hand, the method gives an effective unconditioned distribution which is easier to interpret. The method is flexible and can be applied virtually to any dynamics. We discuss an important application of the method, namely the problem of epidemic risk assessment from (imperfect) clinical tests, for a large family of time-continuous epidemic models endowed with a Gillespie-like sampler. We show that the method compares favorably against the state of the art, including the soft-margin approach and mean-field methods. ",

These models are closely related to the baseline provided for this problem, as they are essentially convolutional recurrent neural networks trained in a mean teacher setting to deal with the heterogeneous annotation of the supplied data. However, the time resolution of the predictions was adapted to deal with the fact that these systems are evaluated using two intersection-based metrics involving different needs in terms of temporal localization. This was done by optimizing the pooling operations. For the first of the defined evaluation scenarios, imposing relatively strict requirements on the temporal localization accuracy, our best model achieved a PSDS score of 0.3609 on the validation data. This is only marginally better than the performance obtained by the baseline system (0.342): The amount of pooling in the baseline network already turned out to be optimal, and thus, no substantial changes were made, explaining this result. For the second evaluation scenario, imposing relatively lax restrictions on the localization accuracy, our best-performing system achieved a PSDS score of 0.7312 on the validation data. This is significantly better than the performance obtained by the baseline model (0.527), which can effectively be attributed to the changes that were applied to the pooling operations of the network.

However, current methods still perform poorly in reconstructing artifact-free MRI images from highly undersampled k-space data. Recently, implicit neural representation (INR) has emerged as a new deep learning paradigm for learning the internal continuity of an object. In this study, we adopted INR to parallel MRI reconstruction. The MRI image was modeled as a continuous function of spatial coordinates. This function was parameterized by a neural network and learned directly from the measured k-space itself without additional fully sampled high-quality training data. Benefitting from the powerful continuous representations provided by INR, the proposed method outperforms existing methods by suppressing the aliasing artifacts and noise, especially at higher acceleration rates and smaller sizes of the auto-calibration signals. The high-quality results and scanning specificity make the proposed method hold the potential for further accelerating the data acquisition of parallel MRI. ",

    "abstract": "Due to their disordered structure, glasses present a unique challenge in predicting the composition-property relationships. Recently, several attempts have been made to predict the glass properties using machine learning techniques. However, these techniques have the limitations, namely, (i) predictions are limited to the components that are present in the original dataset, and (ii) predictions towards the extreme values of the properties, important regions for new materials discovery, are not very reliable due to the sparse datapoints in this region. To address these challenges, here we present a low complexity neural network (LCNN) that provides improved performance in predicting the properties of oxide glasses. In addition, we combine the LCNN with physical and chemical descriptors that allow the development of universal models that can provide predictions for components beyond the training set. By training on a large dataset (~50000) of glass components, we show the LCNN outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms such as XGBoost. In addition, we interpret the LCNN models using Shapely additive explanations to gain insights into the role played by the descriptors in governing the property. Finally, we demonstrate the universality of the LCNN models by predicting the properties for glasses with new components that were not present in the original training set. Altogether, the present approach provides a promising direction towards accelerated discovery of novel glass compositions. ",

There is a long history of methods designed to recover accurately this phase from the phase \"wrapped\" inside $]-\\pi,\\pi]$.

Ultimately, analysing successfully an interferogram amounts to pattern recognition, a task where radial basis function neural networks truly excel at.

The neural network can be trained in parallel and in three stages, using gradient-based supervised learning.
