    "title": "Temporal Spatial Decomposition and Fusion Network for Time Series  Forecasting",
    "abstract": "Feature engineering is required to obtain better results for time series forecasting, and decomposition is a crucial one. One decomposition approach often cannot be used for numerous forecasting tasks since the standard time series decomposition lacks flexibility and robustness. Traditional feature selection relies heavily on preexisting domain knowledge, has no generic methodology, and requires a lot of labor. However, most time series prediction models based on deep learning typically suffer from interpretability issue, so the \"black box\" results lead to a lack of confidence. To deal with the above issues forms the motivation of the thesis. In the paper we propose TSDFNet as a neural network with self-decomposition mechanism and an attentive feature fusion mechanism, It abandons feature engineering as a preprocessing convention and creatively integrates it as an internal module with the deep model. The self-decomposition mechanism empowers TSDFNet with extensible and adaptive decomposition capabilities for any time series, users can choose their own basis functions to decompose the sequence into temporal and generalized spatial dimensions. Attentive feature fusion mechanism has the ability to capture the importance of external variables and the causality with target variables. It can automatically suppress the unimportant features while enhancing the effective ones, so that users do not have to struggle with feature selection. Moreover, TSDFNet is easy to look into the \"black box\" of the deep neural network by feature visualization and analyze the prediction results. We demonstrate performance improvements over existing widely accepted models on more than a dozen datasets, and three experiments showcase the interpretability of TSDFNet. ",

    "title": "Enhancing Mixup-Based Graph Learning for Language Processing via Hybrid  Pooling",
    "abstract": "Graph neural networks (GNNs) have recently been popular in natural language and programming language processing, particularly in text and source code classification. Graph pooling which processes node representation into the entire graph representation, which can be used for multiple downstream tasks, e.g., graph classification, is a crucial component of GNNs. Recently, to enhance graph learning, Manifold Mixup, a data augmentation strategy that mixes the graph data vector after the pooling layer, has been introduced. However, since there are a series of graph pooling methods, how they affect the effectiveness of such a Mixup approach is unclear. In this paper, we take the first step to explore the influence of graph pooling methods on the effectiveness of the Mixup-based data augmentation approach. Specifically, 9 types of hybrid pooling methods are considered in the study, e.g., $\\mathcal{M}_{sum}(\\mathcal{P}_{att},\\mathcal{P}_{max})$. The experimental results on both natural language datasets (Gossipcop, Politifact) and programming language datasets (Java250, Python800) demonstrate that hybrid pooling methods are more suitable for Mixup than the standard max pooling and the state-of-the-art graph multiset transformer (GMT) pooling, in terms of metric accuracy and robustness.

While prior work establishes a theoretical trade-off in robustness against different $L_p$ norms, we show that there is potential for improvement against many commonly used attacks by adopting a domain generalisation approach. Concretely, we treat each type of attack as a domain, and apply the Risk Extrapolation method (REx), which promotes similar levels of robustness against all training attacks. Compared to existing methods, we obtain similar or superior worst-case adversarial robustness on attacks seen during training. Moreover, we achieve superior performance on families or tunings of attacks only encountered at test time. On ensembles of attacks, our approach improves the accuracy from 3.4% the best existing baseline to 25.9% on MNIST, and from 16.9% to 23.5% on CIFAR10. ",

    "abstract": "Deep generative models have shown success in generating 3D shapes with different representations. In this work, we propose Neural Volumetric Mesh Generator(NVMG) which can generate novel and high-quality volumetric meshes. Unlike the previous 3D generative model for point cloud, voxel, and implicit surface, the volumetric mesh representation is a ready-to-use representation in industry with details on both the surface and interior. Generating this such highly-structured data thus brings a significant challenge. We first propose a diffusion-based generative model to tackle this problem by generating voxelized shapes with close-to-reality outlines and structures. We can simply obtain a tetrahedral mesh as a template with the voxelized shape. Further, we use a voxel-conditional neural network to predict the smooth implicit surface conditioned on the voxels, and progressively project the tetrahedral mesh to the predicted surface under regularizations. The regularization terms are carefully designed so that they can (1) get rid of the defects like flipping and high distortion; (2) force the regularity of the interior and surface structure during the deformation procedure for a high-quality final mesh. As shown in the experiments, our pipeline can generate high-quality artifact-free volumetric and surface meshes from random noise or a reference image without any post-processing. Compared with the state-of-the-art voxel-to-mesh deformation method, we show more robustness and better performance when taking generated voxels as input. ",

They are boosted by social interactions among people involved in relationships, and decay between such events, causing the relationships to change. Despite the importance of the evolution of relationships in social networks, there is little work exploring how interactions over extended periods correlate with people's memory imprints of relationship importance. In this paper, we represent memory dynamics by adapting a well-known cognitive science model. Using two unique longitudinal datasets, we fit the model's parameters to maximize agreement of the memory imprints of relationship strengths of a node predicted from call detail records with the ground-truth list of relationships of this node ordered by their strength. We find that this model, trained on one population, predicts not only on this population but also on a different one, suggesting the universality of memory imprints of social interactions among unrelated individuals. This paper lays the foundation for studying the modeling of social interactions as memory imprints, and its potential use as an unobtrusive tool to early detection of individuals with memory malfunctions.

We paired 36 participants over the age of 60, from three diverse geographic locations, and asked them to interact in collaborative VR modules. Video-based observation methods and thematic analyses were used to study the resulting interactions.

So far unsupervised methods that tried to solve this have achieved very limited success as they relied on domain transfer from dataset in air.

While most existing algorithms provide fast approaches for community detection, their results usually contain strictly separated communities. However, most datasets would semantically allow for or even require overlapping communities that can only be determined at much higher computational cost. We build on an efficient algorithm, Fox, that detects such overlapping communities. Fox measures the closeness of a node to a community by approximating the count of triangles which that node forms with that community. We propose LazyFox, a multi-threaded version of the Fox algorithm, which provides even faster detection without an impact on community quality. This allows for the analyses of significantly larger and more complex datasets. LazyFox enables overlapping community detection on complex graph datasets with millions of nodes and billions of edges in days instead of weeks. As part of this work, LazyFox's implementation was published and is available as a tool under an MIT licence at https://github.com/TimGarrels/LazyFox. ",

The proposed non-equilibrium solution, characterized by target sets and measurement functions, evaluates the outcome of learning under a bounded number of rounds of interactions, and it pertains to and generalizes the concept of approximate equilibrium. Leveraging finite-time analysis methods, we discover that under the mirror descent (MD) online-learning framework, the traffic flow trajectory is capable of restoring to the Wardrop non-equilibrium solution after a bounded INS attack. The resulting performance loss is of order $\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(T^{\\beta})$ ($-\\frac{1}{2} \\leq \\beta < 0 )$), with a constant dependent on the size of the traffic network, indicating the resilience of the MD-based INS.

We use both intrinsic evaluation (loss, perplexity) and extrinsic evaluation (downstream sentiment analysis task) to evaluate the performance of our quantum language model. Our quantum model was comparable to its classical counterpart on all the above metrics. We also perform ablation studies to look into the effect of the size of VQC and the size of training data on the performance of the model. Our approach solves privacy concerns without sacrificing downstream task performance. The intractability of quantum operations on classical hardware ensures the confidentiality of the training data and makes it impossible to be recovered by any adversary. ",

    "abstract": "Deep neural networks (DNNs) are utilized in numerous image processing, object detection, and video analysis tasks and need to be implemented using hardware accelerators to achieve practical speed. Logic locking is one of the most popular methods for preventing chip counterfeiting. Nevertheless, existing logic-locking schemes need to sacrifice the number of input patterns leading to wrong output under incorrect keys to resist the powerful satisfiability (SAT)-attack. Furthermore, DNN model inference is fault-tolerant. Hence, using a wrong key for those SAT-resistant logic-locking schemes may not affect the accuracy of DNNs. This makes the previous SAT-resistant logic-locking scheme ineffective on protecting DNN accelerators. Besides, to prevent DNN models from being illegally used, the models need to be obfuscated by the designers before they are provided to end-users. Previous obfuscation methods either require long time to retrain the model or leak information about the model. This paper proposes a joint protection scheme for DNN hardware accelerators and models. The DNN accelerator is modified using a hardware key (Hkey) and a model key (Mkey). Different from previous logic locking, the Hkey, which is used to protect the accelerator, does not affect the output when it is wrong. As a result, the SAT attack can be effectively resisted. On the other hand, a wrong Hkey leads to substantial increase in memory accesses, inference time, and energy consumption and makes the accelerator unusable. A correct Mkey can recover the DNN model that is obfuscated by the proposed method. Compared to previous model obfuscation schemes, our proposed method avoids model retraining and does not leak model information. ",

To address this challenge, we propose an unsupervised domain adaptation framework using contrastive learning and adversarial domain mixup to transfer the knowledge from an existing source data domain to the target COVID-19 data domain. In particular, to bridge the gap between the source domain and the target domain, our method reduces a radial basis function (RBF) based discrepancy between these two domains. Moreover, we leverage the power of domain adversarial examples to establish an intermediate domain mixup, where the latent representations of the input text from both domains could be mixed during the training process.

The proposed structure considers the input samples with different appearances and generates a superior representation with adversarial transfer contrastive training. Finally, multi-objective augmented Lagrangian multipliers encourage the low-rank and sparsity of the presented adversarial contrastive embedding to adaptively estimate the coefficients of the regularizers automatically to the optimum weights. The sparsity constraint suppresses less representative elements in the feature space. The low-rank constraint eliminates trivial and redundant components and enables superior generalization. The performance of the proposed model is verified by conducting ablation studies by using benchmark datasets for scenarios with small data samples. ",

Conversational agents should also maintain a consistent persona to have an engaging conversation with a user. However, text generation datasets are often crowd sourced and thereby have an averaging effect where the style of the generation model is an average style of all the crowd workers that have contributed to the dataset. While one can collect persona-specific datasets for each task, it would be an expensive and time consuming annotation effort. In this work, we propose a novel transfer learning framework which updates only $0.3\\%$ of model parameters to learn style specific attributes for response generation. For the purpose of this study, we tackle the problem of stylistic story ending generation using the ROC stories Corpus. We learn style specific attributes from the PERSONALITY-CAPTIONS dataset.

    "abstract": "Explaining deep learning models is of vital importance for understanding artificial intelligence systems, improving safety, and evaluating fairness. To better understand and control the CNN model, many methods for transparency-interpretability have been proposed. However, most of these works are less intuitive for human understanding and have insufficient human control over the CNN model. We propose a novel method, Transparent and Controllable Network Learning (TCNL), to overcome such challenges. Towards the goal of improving transparency-interpretability, in TCNL, we define some concepts for specific classification tasks through scientific human-intuition study and incorporate concept information into the CNN model. In TCNL, the shallow feature extractor gets preliminary features first. Then several concept feature extractors are built right after the shallow feature extractor to learn high-dimensional concept representations. The concept feature extractor is encouraged to encode information related to the predefined concepts. We also build the concept mapper to visualize features extracted by the concept extractor in a human-intuitive way. TCNL provides a generalizable approach to transparency-interpretability. Researchers can define concepts corresponding to certain classification tasks and encourage the model to encode specific concept information, which to a certain extent improves transparency-interpretability and the controllability of the CNN model. The datasets (with concept sets) for our experiments will also be released (https://github.com/bupt-ai-cz/TCNL). ",

Thus, SO allows its users to suggest edits to improve the quality of a post (i.e., question and answer). However, existing research shows that many suggested edits in SO are rejected due to undesired contents/formats or violating edit guidelines. Such a scenario frustrates or demotivates users who would like to conduct good-quality edits. Therefore, our research focuses on assisting SO users by offering them suggestions on how to improve their editing of posts. First, we manually investigate 764 (382 questions + 382 answers) rejected edits by rollbacks and produce a catalog of 19 rejection reasons. Second, we extract 15 texts and user-based features to capture those rejection reasons. Third, we develop four machine learning models using those features. Our best-performing model can predict rejected edits with 69.1% precision, 71.2% recall, 70.1% F1-score, and 69.8% overall accuracy. Fourth, we introduce an online tool named EditEx that works with the SO edit system. EditEx can assist users while editing posts by suggesting the potential causes of rejections. We recruit 20 participants to assess the effectiveness of EditEx. Half of the participants (i.e., treatment group) use EditEx and another half (i.e., control group) use the SO standard edit system to edit posts. According to our experiment, EditEx can support SO standard edit system to prevent 49% of rejected edits, including the commonly rejected ones. However, it can prevent 12% rejections even in free-form regular edits. The treatment group finds the potential rejection reasons identified by EditEx influential. Furthermore, the median workload suggesting edits using EditEx is half compared to the SO edit system. ",

Measuring similarity (e.g., Jaccard Index) between sets has been a key building block of a wide range of applications, including, plagiarism detection, recommendation, and graph compression. However, as sets have grown in numbers and sizes, the computational cost and storage required for set similarity computation have become substantial, and this has led to the development of hashing and sketching based solutions. In this work, we propose Set2Box, a learning-based approach for compressed representations of sets from which various similarity measures can be estimated accurately in constant time. The key idea is to represent sets as boxes to precisely capture overlaps of sets. Additionally, based on the proposed box quantization scheme, we design Set2Box+, which yields more concise but more accurate box representations of sets. Through extensive experiments on 8 real-world datasets, we show that, compared to baseline approaches, Set2Box+ is (a) Accurate: achieving up to 40.8X smaller estimation error while requiring 60% fewer bits to encode sets, (b) Concise: yielding up to 96.8X more concise representations with similar estimation error, and (c) Versatile: enabling the estimation of four set-similarity measures from a single representation of each set.

Through the high-quality classification of scientific papers, researchers can quickly find the resource content they need from the massive scientific resources. The classification of scientific papers will effectively help researchers filter redundant information, obtain search results quickly and accurately, and improve the search quality, which is necessary for scientific resource management. This paper proposed a science-technique paper classification method based on hypergraph neural network(SPHNN). In the heterogeneous information network of scientific papers, the repeated high-order subgraphs are modeled as hyperedges composed of multiple related nodes. Then the whole heterogeneous information network is transformed into a hypergraph composed of different hyperedges. The graph convolution operation is carried out on the hypergraph structure, and the hyperedges self-attention mechanism is introduced to aggregate different types of nodes in the hypergraph, so that the final node representation can effectively maintain high-order nearest neighbor relationships and complex semantic information. Finally, by comparing with other methods, we proved that the model proposed in this paper has improved its performance. ",

In this work, we propose a self-supervised method for learning representations of geographic locations from unlabeled GPS trajectories to solve downstream geospatial computer vision tasks. Tiles resulting from a raster representation of the earth's surface are modeled as nodes on a graph or pixels of an image. GPS trajectories are modeled as allowed Markovian paths on these nodes. A scalable and distributed algorithm is presented to compute image-like representations, called reachability summaries, of the spatial connectivity patterns between tiles and their neighbors implied by the observed Markovian paths. A convolutional, contractive autoencoder is trained to learn compressed representations, called reachability embeddings, of reachability summaries for every tile. Reachability embeddings serve as task-agnostic, feature representations of geographic locations. Using reachability embeddings as pixel representations for five different downstream geospatial tasks, cast as supervised semantic segmentation problems, we quantitatively demonstrate that reachability embeddings are semantically meaningful representations and result in 4-23% gain in performance, as measured using area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC) metric, when compared to baseline models that use pixel representations that do not account for the spatial connectivity between tiles. Reachability embeddings transform sequential, spatiotemporal mobility data into semantically meaningful tensor representations that can be combined with other sources of imagery and are designed to facilitate multimodal learning in geospatial computer vision.

Some existing studies for the representation learning of homogeneous information networks cannot be applicable to heterogeneous information networks because of the lack of ability to issue heterogeneity.

Due to the closeness and blocking of businesses among different enterprises, there is a serious phenomenon of data islands. To solve the above challenges, aiming at the data information of scientific research teams closely related to science and technology, we proposed an academic heterogeneous information network embedding representation learning method based on federated learning (FedAHE), which utilizes node attention and meta path attention mechanism to learn low-dimensional, dense and real-valued vector representations while preserving the rich topological information and meta-path-based semantic information of nodes in network. Moreover, we combined federated learning with the representation learning of HINs composed of scientific research teams and put forward a federal training mechanism based on dynamic weighted aggregation of parameters (FedDWA) to optimize the node embeddings of HINs.

Therefore, an unsupervised semantic representation learning method of scientific literature based on graph attention mechanism and maximum mutual information (GAMMI) is proposed. By introducing a graph attention mechanism, the weighted summation of nearby node features make the weights of adjacent node features entirely depend on the node features. Depending on the features of the nearby nodes, different weights can be applied to each node in the graph. Therefore, the correlations between vertex features can be better integrated into the model. In addition, an unsupervised graph contrastive learning strategy is proposed to solve the problem of being unlabeled and scalable on large-scale graphs. By comparing the mutual information between the positive and negative local node representations on the latent space and the global graph representation, the graph neural network can capture both local and global information. Experimental results demonstrate competitive performance on various node classification benchmarks, achieving good results and sometimes even surpassing the performance of supervised learning. ",

For the most part, these attacks have been applied directly to isolated neural network models. However, in practice, machine learning models are just a component of a much larger system. By adding just a single preprocessor in front of a classifier, we find that state-of-the-art query-based attacks are as much as seven times less effective at attacking a prediction pipeline than attacking the machine learning model alone. Hence, attacks that are unaware of this invariance inevitably waste a large number of queries to re-discover or overcome it. We, therefore, develop techniques to first reverse-engineer the preprocessor and then use this extracted information to attack the end-to-end system. Our extraction method requires only a few hundred queries to learn the preprocessors used by most publicly available model pipelines, and our preprocessor-aware attacks recover the same efficacy as just attacking the model alone.

Incorporating these morphology rules as prior knowledge into the segmentation model is believed to be an effective way to enhance the accuracy of the segmentation results. Motivated by this, we propose in this work the Topology-Preserving Segmentation Network (TPSN) which can predict segmentation masks with the same topology prescribed for specific tasks. TPSN is a deformation-based model that yields a deformation map through an encoder-decoder architecture to warp the template masks into a target shape approximating the region to segment. Comparing to the segmentation framework based on pixel-wise classification, deformation-based segmentation models that warp a template to enclose the regions are more convenient to enforce geometric constraints. In our framework, we carefully design the ReLU Jacobian regularization term to enforce the bijectivity of the deformation map. As such, the predicted mask by TPSN has the same topology as that of the template prior mask. ",

DCCT mainly exploits the features extracted by two networks to generate two sets of pseudo labels separately by clustering with different parameters. Each network is trained with the pseudo labels generated by its peer network, which can increase the complementarity of the two networks to reduce the impact of noises. Furthermore, we propose dual clustering with dynamic parameters (DCDP) to make the network adaptive and robust to dynamically changing clustering parameters.

    "abstract": "Modern cars provide versatile tools to enhance speech communication. While an in-car communication (ICC) system aims at enhancing communication between the passengers by playing back desired speech via loudspeakers in the car, these loudspeaker signals may disturb a speech enhancement system required for hands-free telephony and automatic speech recognition. In this paper, we focus on speech zone detection, i.e. detecting which passenger in the car is speaking, which is a crucial component of the speech enhancement system. We propose a model-based feedback estimation method to improve robustness of speech zone detection against ICC feedback. Specifically, since the zone detection system typically does not have access to the ICC loudspeaker signals, the proposed method estimates the feedback signal from the observed microphone signals based on a free-field propagation model between the loudspeakers and the microphones as well as the ICC gain. We propose an efficient recursive implementation in the short-time Fourier transform domain using convolutive transfer functions. A realistic simulation study indicates that the proposed method allows to increase the ICC gain by about 6dB while still achieving robust speech zone detection results. ",

However, it is well-known that deep learning models lack the robustness to adversarial examples, which can also invoke security issues to pre-trained models, despite being less explored. In this paper, we delve into the robustness of pre-trained models by introducing Pre-trained Adversarial Perturbations (PAPs), which are universal perturbations crafted for the pre-trained models to maintain the effectiveness when attacking fine-tuned ones without any knowledge of the downstream tasks. To this end, we propose a Low-Level Layer Lifting Attack (L4A) method to generate effective PAPs by lifting the neuron activations of low-level layers of the pre-trained models. Equipped with an enhanced noise augmentation strategy, L4A is effective at generating more transferable PAPs against fine-tuned models. Extensive experiments on typical pre-trained vision models and ten downstream tasks demonstrate that our method improves the attack success rate by a large margin compared with state-of-the-art methods.

Then, to fit a specific target, we encode the raw texts as target-specific features.

In the last years, a plethora of supervised learning algorithms based on deep neural networks has been suggested to address this problem using various modalities. While every modality has its own limitations, there is one common challenge. Namely, supervised learning requires vast amounts of annotated data which is practically hard to collect. In this paper, we benefit from the self-supervised learning paradigm (SSL) that is typically used to learn deep feature representations from unlabeled data. Moreover, we upgrade a contrastive SSL framework, namely SimCLR, widely used in various applications by introducing a temporal feature alignment procedure for Human Activity Recognition. Specifically, we propose integrating a dynamic time warping (DTW) algorithm in a latent space to force features to be aligned in a temporal dimension. Extensive experiments have been conducted for the unimodal scenario with inertial modality as well as in multimodal settings using inertial and skeleton data. According to the obtained results, the proposed approach has a great potential in learning robust feature representations compared to the recent SSL baselines, and clearly outperforms supervised models in semi-supervised learning.

However, the FCTN decomposition suffers from slow computational speed when facing higher-order and large-scale data. Naturally, there arises an interesting question: can a new model be proposed that decomposes the tensor into smaller ones and speeds up the computation of the algorithm? This work gives a positive answer by formulating a novel higher-order tensor decomposition model that utilizes latent matrices based on the tensor network structure, which can decompose a tensor into smaller-scale data than the FCTN decomposition, hence we named it Latent Matrices for Tensor Network Decomposition (LMTN). Furthermore, three optimization algorithms, LMTN-PAM, LMTN-SVD and LMTN-AR, have been developed and applied to the tensor-completion task. In addition, we provide proofs of theoretical convergence and complexity analysis for these algorithms. Experimental results show that our algorithm has the effectiveness in both deep learning dataset compression and higher-order tensor completion, and that our LMTN-SVD algorithm is 3-6 times faster than the FCTN-PAM algorithm and only a 1.8 points accuracy drop.

To ameliorate the robustness of the algorithm, then the strategy was optimized by particle swarm optimization (PSO) and k-fold cross-validation to find the optimal parameters of the neural network in real-time, which constructed a self-adaptive online PSO-GRNN VVP strategy with multi-information fusion to adapt with different operating situations. The self-adaptive online PSO-GRNN VVP strategy was then deployed to a variety of simulated scenarios to test its efficacy under various operating situations. Finally, the simulation results reveal that in urban and highway scenarios, the prediction accuracy is separately increased by 27.8% and 54.5% when compared to the traditional GRNN VVP strategy with fixed parameters utilizing only the historical ego-vehicle velocity dataset.

This is especially seen in medical domains where the annotations are expensive to obtain. Deep Neural Networks have been shown to be vulnerable to adversarial attacks.

In this paper, we provide a framework to make few-shot segmentation models adversarially robust in the medical domain where such attacks can severely impact the decisions made by clinicians who use them. We propose a novel robust few-shot segmentation framework, Prototypical Neural Ordinary Differential Equation (PNODE), that provides defense against gradient-based adversarial attacks. We show that our framework is more robust compared to traditional adversarial defense mechanisms such as adversarial training. Adversarial training involves increased training time and shows robustness to limited types of attacks depending on the type of adversarial examples seen during training. Our proposed framework generalises well to common adversarial attacks like FGSM, PGD and SMIA while having the model parameters comparable to the existing few-shot segmentation models. We show the effectiveness of our proposed approach on three publicly available multi-organ segmentation datasets in both in-domain and cross-domain settings by attacking the support and query sets without the need for ad-hoc adversarial training.

Although, the previous study focuses on rich feature information learning, it is still hard to retrieve the query person due to the occurrence of appearance deformations and background distractors. In this paper, we propose a novel attention-aware relation mixer (ARM) module for person search, which exploits the global relation between different local regions within RoI of a person and make it robust against various appearance deformations and occlusion. The proposed ARM is composed of a relation mixer block and a spatio-channel attention layer. The relation mixer block introduces a spatially attended spatial mixing and a channel-wise attended channel mixing for effectively capturing discriminative relation features within an RoI. These discriminative relation features are further enriched by introducing a spatio-channel attention where the foreground and background discriminability is empowered in a joint spatio-channel space. Our ARM module is generic and it does not rely on fine-grained supervision or topological assumptions, hence being easily integrated into any Faster R-CNN based person search methods. Comprehensive experiments are performed on two challenging benchmark datasets: CUHKSYSU and PRW. Our PS-ARM achieves state-of-the-art performance on both datasets. On the challenging PRW dataset, our PS-ARM achieves an absolute gain of 5 in the mAP score over SeqNet, while operating at a comparable speed. ",

However, in some difficult categories with poor recognition accuracy, the segmentation effects are still not ideal. To this end, in this paper, Intra-subdomain adaptation adversarial learning segmentation method based on Dynamic Pseudo Labels(IDPL) is proposed. The whole process consists of 3 steps: Firstly, the instance-level pseudo label dynamic generation module is proposed, which fuses the class matching information in global classes and local instances, thus adaptively generating the optimal threshold for each class, obtaining high-quality pseudo labels. Secondly, the subdomain classifier module based on instance confidence is constructed, which can dynamically divide the target domain into easy and difficult subdomains according to the relative proportion of easy and difficult instances. Finally, the subdomain adversarial learning module based on self-attention is proposed. It uses multi-head self-attention to confront the easy and difficult subdomains at the class level with the help of generated high-quality pseudo labels, so as to focus on mining the features of difficult categories in the high-entropy region of target domain images, which promotes class-level conditional distribution alignment between the subdomains, improving the segmentation performance of difficult categories. For the difficult categories, the experimental results show that the performance of IDPL is significantly improved compared with other latest mainstream methods. ",

A fully automatic analysis and proof generation framework is proposed, where security parameters can be produced with arbitrarily high confidence via Monte-Carlo simulation for any black-box data processing oracle. This appealing automation property enables analysis of complicated data processing, where the worst-case proof in the classic privacy regime could be loose or even intractable. Furthermore, we show that the magnitude of (necessary) perturbation required in PAC security is not explicitly dependent on dimensionality, which is in contrast to the worst-case information-theoretic lower bound.

Moreover, they neglected the rich information contained in external knowledge, e.g., image captions. In this paper, we propose a novel hierarchical framework for sarcasm detection by exploring both the atomic-level congruity based on multi-head cross attention mechanism and the composition-level congruity based on graph neural networks, where a post with low congruity can be identified as sarcasm. In addition, we exploit the effect of various knowledge resources for sarcasm detection.

    "abstract": "Spiking neural networks, also often referred to as the third generation of neural networks, carry the potential for a massive reduction in memory and energy consumption over traditional, second-generation neural networks. Inspired by the undisputed efficiency of the human brain, they introduce temporal and neuronal sparsity, which can be exploited by next-generation neuromorphic hardware. To open the pathway toward engineering applications, we introduce this exciting technology in the context of continuum mechanics. However, the nature of spiking neural networks poses a challenge for regression problems, which frequently arise in the modeling of engineering sciences. To overcome this problem, a framework for regression using spiking neural networks is proposed. In particular, a network topology for decoding binary spike trains to real numbers is introduced, utilizing the membrane potential of spiking neurons. As the aim of this contribution is a concise introduction to this new methodology, several different spiking neural architectures, ranging from simple spiking feed-forward to complex spiking long short-term memory neural networks, are derived. Several numerical experiments directed towards regression of linear and nonlinear, history-dependent material models are carried out. A direct comparison with counterparts of traditional neural networks shows that the proposed framework is much more efficient while retaining precision and generalizability. All code has been made publicly available in the interest of reproducibility and to promote continued enhancement in this new domain. ",

    "abstract": "The advancement in wireless communication technologies is becoming more demanding and pervasive. One of the fundamental parameters that limit the efficiency of the network are the security challenges. The communication network is vulnerable to security attacks such as spoofing attacks and signal strength attacks. Intrusion detection signifies a central approach to ensuring the security of the communication network. In this paper, an Intrusion Detection System based on the framework of graph theory is proposed. A Layerwise Graph Theory-Based Intrusion Detection System (LGTBIDS) algorithm is designed to detect the attacked node. The algorithm performs the layer-wise analysis to extract the vulnerable nodes and ultimately the attacked node(s). For each layer, every node is scanned for the possibility of susceptible node(s). The strategy of the IDS is based on the analysis of energy efficiency and secrecy rate. The nodes with the energy efficiency and secrecy rate beyond the range of upper and lower thresholds are detected as the nodes under attack. Further, detected node(s) are transmitted with a random sequence of bits followed by the process of re-authentication. The obtained results validate the better performance, low time computations, and low complexity. Finally, the proposed approach is compared with the conventional solution of intrusion detection. ",

    "abstract": "Internet of Things (IoT) applications have the potential to derive sensitive information about individuals. Therefore, developers must exercise due diligence to make sure that data are managed according to the privacy regulations and data protection laws. However, doing so can be a difficult and challenging task. Recent research has revealed that developers typically face difficulties when complying with regulations. One key reason is that, at times, regulations are vague, and could be challenging to extract and enact such legal requirements. In our research paper, we have conducted a systematic analysis of the data protection laws that are used across different continents, namely: (i) General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR), (ii) the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA), (iii) the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), (iv) Australian Privacy Principles (APPs), and (v) New Zealand's Privacy Act 1993. In this technical report, we presented the detailed results of the conducted framework analysis method to attain a comprehensive view of different data protection laws and highlighted the disparities, in order to assist developers in adhering to the regulations across different regions, along with creating a Combined Privacy Law Framework (CPLF). After that, we gave an overview of various Privacy by Design (PbD) schemes developed previously by different researchers. Then, the key principles and individuals' rights of the CPLF were mapped with the privacy principles, strategies, guidelines, and patterns of the Privacy by Design (PbD) schemes in order to investigate the gaps in existing schemes.

In this paper, to mitigate stragglers and improve communication efficiency, a novel local SGD strategy, named HetSyn, is developed. The key point is to keep all the workers computing continually at each synchronization round, and make full use of any effective (completed) local update of each worker regardless of stragglers. An analysis of the average wall-clock time, average number of local updates and average number of uploading workers per round is provided to gauge the performance of HetSyn. The convergence of HetSyn is also rigorously established even when the objective function is nonconvex. Experimental results show the superiority of the proposed HetSyn against state-of-the-art schemes through utilization of additional effective local updates at each worker, and the influence of system parameters is studied. By allowing heterogeneous synchronization with different numbers of local updates across workers, HetSyn provides substantial improvements both in time and communication efficiency. ",

Based on the reformulation, we derive the general solutions of the BCs analytically, which are employed to construct an ansatz that automatically satisfies the BCs. With such a framework, we can train the neural networks without adding extra loss terms and thus efficiently handle geometrically complex PDEs, alleviating the unbalanced competition between the loss terms corresponding to the BCs and PDEs. We theoretically demonstrate that the \"extra fields\" can stabilize the training process. Experimental results on real-world geometrically complex PDEs showcase the effectiveness of our method compared with state-of-the-art baselines. ",

    "abstract": "The conventional view of the congestion control problem in data networks is based on the principle that a flow's performance is uniquely determined by the state of its bottleneck link, regardless of the topological properties of the network. However, recent work has shown that the behavior of congestion-controlled networks is better explained by models that account for the interactions between bottleneck links. These interactions are captured by a latent \\textit{bottleneck structure}, a model describing the complex ripple effects that changes in one part of the network exert on the other parts. In this paper, we present a \\textit{quantitative} theory of bottleneck structures (QTBS), a mathematical and engineering framework comprising a family of polynomial-time algorithms that can be used to reason about a wide variety of network optimization problems, including routing, capacity planning and flow control. QTBS can contribute to traffic engineering by making clear predictions about the relative performance of alternative flow routes, and by providing numerical recommendations for the optimal rate settings of traffic shapers. A particularly novel result in the domain of capacity planning indicates that previously established rules for the design of folded-Clos networks are suboptimal when flows are congestion controlled. We show that QTBS can be used to derive the optimal rules for this important class of topologies, and empirically demonstrate the correctness and efficacy of these results using the BBR and Cubic congestion-control algorithms.

Its distinctive feature is the adaptation of downloading to time-varying situations (e.g., application, location, and time), devices' heterogeneous storage-and-computing capacities, and channel states. A key component of the presented framework is a set of techniques that dynamically compress a downloaded model at the depth-level, parameter-level, or bit-level to support adaptive model downloading. We further propose a virtualized 6G network architecture customized for deploying in-situ model downloading with the key feature of a three-tier (edge, local, and central) AI library. Furthermore, experiments are conducted to quantify 6G connectivity requirements and research opportunities pertaining to the proposed technology are discussed. ",

In this work, we provide a data-centric view to tackle these issues and propose a graph transformation framework named GTrans which adapts and refines graph data at test time to achieve better performance. We provide theoretical analysis on the design of the framework and discuss why adapting graph data works better than adapting the model. Extensive experiments have demonstrated the effectiveness of GTrans on three distinct scenarios for eight benchmark datasets where suboptimal data is presented. Remarkably, GTrans performs the best in most cases with improvements up to 2.8%, 8.2% and 3.8% over the best baselines on three experimental settings. ",

This paper presents a data-driven navigation architecture that uses state-of-the-art neural architectures, namely Conditional Neural Processes, to learn global and local controllers of the mobile robot from observations. Additionally, we leverage a state-of-the-art, deep prediction mechanism to detect situations not similar to the trained ones, where reactive controllers step in to ensure safe navigation. Our results demonstrate that the proposed framework can successfully carry out navigation tasks regarding social norms in the data.

We reveal that batch whitening (BW) based methods do not impose whitening constraints on the embedding, but they only require the embedding to be full-rank. This full-rank constraint is also sufficient to avoid dimensional collapse. Based on our analysis, we propose channel whitening with random group partition (CW-RGP), which exploits the advantages of BW-based methods in preventing collapse and avoids their disadvantages requiring large batch size. Experimental results on ImageNet classification and COCO object detection reveal that the proposed CW-RGP possesses a promising potential for learning good representations.

Instead, this work aims to estimate the contributions of different flexible units to the aggregated flexibility, which is essential for flexible power ranking and pricing. The proposed framework exploits cost-minimising OPF models complemented with cooperative game formulations that are able to capture the combinatorial nature of activating multiple flexible units. Moreover, in contrast to existing studies that imply perfect coordination of units, the proposed framework specifies the actions needed to reach feasible operating points, reflecting the nonlinearities of the network flexibility model. Extensive simulations are performed for different flexibility metrics to demonstrate the applicability of the framework. Depending on the metric selected (capacity, cost, or economic surplus of flexibility), distribution system operators (DSOs) can identify the most critical flexible units or remunerate units for participating in flexibility services provision.

However, if the user interest is learned on the basis of item-level behaviors, the performance may be affected by the following two issues. Firstly, some casual outliers might be included in the behavior sequences as user behaviors are likely to be diverse. Secondly, the span of time intervals between user behaviors is random and irregular, for which a RNN-based module employed from NLP is not perfectly adaptive. To handle these two issues, we propose the Knowledge aware Adaptive Session multi-Topic network(KAST). It can adaptively segment user sessions from the whole user behavior sequence, and maintain similar intents in the same session. Furthermore, in order to improve the quality of session segmentation and representation, a knowledge-aware module is introduced so that the structural information from the user-item interaction can be extracted in an end-to-end manner, and a marginal based loss with these information is merged into the major loss. Through extensive experiments on public benchmarks, we demonstrate that KAST can achieve superior performance than state-of-the-art methods for CTR prediction, and key modules and hyper-parameters are also evaluated.

Recent ViT-inspired convolutional networks such as ConvMixer and ConvNeXt use large-kernel depthwise convolutions whose learned filters have notable structure; this presents an opportunity to study their empirical covariances. In this work, we first observe that such learned filters have highly-structured covariance matrices, and moreover, we find that covariances calculated from small networks may be used to effectively initialize a variety of larger networks of different depths, widths, patch sizes, and kernel sizes, indicating a degree of model-independence to the covariance structure. Motivated by these findings, we then propose a learning-free multivariate initialization scheme for convolutional filters using a simple, closed-form construction of their covariance. Models using our initialization outperform those using traditional univariate initializations, and typically meet or exceed the performance of those initialized from the covariances of learned filters; in some cases, this improvement can be achieved without training the depthwise convolutional filters at all.

KNF imposes appropriate inductive biases for improved robustness against distributional shifts, employing both a global operator to learn shared characteristics, and a local operator to capture changing dynamics, as well as a specially-designed feedback loop to continuously update the learnt operators over time for rapidly varying behaviors. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that Koopman theory is applied to real-world chaotic time series without known governing laws. We demonstrate that KNF achieves the superior performance compared to the alternatives, on multiple time series datasets that are shown to suffer from distribution shifts. ",

The proposed approach aims to improve the rendering realness by minimizing the spectrum discrepancy between real and synthesized images, especially on the high-frequency localized sharpness information which causes image blur visually. Specifically, a patch multi-discriminator scheme is proposed for the adversarial learning, which combines both spectral domain (Fourier Transform and Discrete Wavelet Transform) discriminators as well as the spatial (RGB) domain discriminator to force the generator to capture global and local spectral distributions of the real images. The proposed multi-discriminator scheme not only helps to improve rendering realness, but also enhance the convergence speed and stability of adversarial learning. Moreover, we introduce a noise-resistant voxelisation approach by utilizing both the appearance distance and spatial distance to exclude the spatial outlier points caused by depth noise. Our entire architecture is fully differentiable and can be learned in an end-to-end fashion. Extensive experiments show that our method produces state-of-the-art results for neural point cloud rendering by a significant margin. Our source code will be made public at a later date. ",

    "title": "NMTSloth: Understanding and Testing Efficiency Degradation of Neural  Machine Translation Systems",
    "abstract": "Neural Machine Translation (NMT) systems have received much recent attention due to their human-level accuracy. While existing works mostly focus on either improving accuracy or testing accuracy robustness, the computation efficiency of NMT systems, which is of paramount importance due to often vast translation demands and real-time requirements, has surprisingly received little attention. In this paper, we make the first attempt to understand and test potential computation efficiency robustness in state-of-the-art NMT systems. By analyzing the working mechanism and implementation of 1455 public-accessible NMT systems, we observe a fundamental property in NMT systems that could be manipulated in an adversarial manner to reduce computation efficiency significantly. Our key motivation is to generate test inputs that could sufficiently delay the generation of EOS such that NMT systems would have to go through enough iterations to satisfy the pre-configured threshold. We present NMTSloth, which develops a gradient-guided technique that searches for a minimal and unnoticeable perturbation at character-level, token-level, and structure-level, which sufficiently delays the appearance of EOS and forces these inputs to reach the naturally-unreachable threshold. To demonstrate the effectiveness of NMTSloth, we conduct a systematic evaluation on three public-available NMT systems: Google T5, AllenAI WMT14, and Helsinki-NLP translators. Experimental results show that NMTSloth can increase NMT systems' response latency and energy consumption by 85% to 3153% and 86% to 3052%, respectively, by perturbing just one character or token in the input sentence. Our case study shows that inputs generated by NMTSloth significantly affect the battery power in real-world mobile devices (i.e., drain more than 30 times battery power than normal inputs). ",

    "title": "BayesImposter: Bayesian Estimation Based .bss Imposter Attack on  Industrial Control Systems",
    "abstract": "Over the last six years, several papers used memory deduplication to trigger various security issues, such as leaking heap-address and causing bit-flip in the physical memory. The most essential requirement for successful memory deduplication is to provide identical copies of a physical page. Recent works use a brute-force approach to create identical copies of a physical page that is an inaccurate and time-consuming primitive from the attacker's perspective. Our work begins to fill this gap by providing a domain-specific structured way to duplicate a physical page in cloud settings in the context of industrial control systems (ICSs). Here, we show a new attack primitive - \\textit{BayesImposter}, which points out that the attacker can duplicate the .bss section of the target control DLL file of cloud protocols using the \\textit{Bayesian estimation} technique. Our approach results in less memory (i.e., 4 KB compared to GB) and time (i.e., 13 minutes compared to hours) compared to the brute-force approach used in recent works. We point out that ICSs can be expressed as state-space models; hence, the \\textit{Bayesian estimation} is an ideal choice to be combined with memory deduplication for a successful attack in cloud settings. To demonstrate the strength of \\textit{BayesImposter}, we create a real-world automation platform using a scaled-down automated high-bay warehouse and industrial-grade SIMATIC S7-1500 PLC from Siemens as a target ICS. We demonstrate that \\textit{BayesImposter} can predictively inject false commands into the PLC that can cause possible equipment damage with machine failure in the target ICS. Moreover, we show that \\textit{BayesImposter} is capable of adversarial control over the target ICS resulting in severe consequences, such as killing a person but making it looks like an accident. Therefore, we also provide countermeasures to prevent the attack. ",

Some recent work has started to look at the characteristics of these models, yet many concerns have not been fully addressed. In this work, we conduct a study on emotional corpora to explore a popular self-supervised model -- wav2vec 2.0. Via a set of quantitative analysis, we mainly demonstrate that: 1) wav2vec 2.0 appears to discard paralinguistic information that is less useful for word recognition purposes; 2) for emotion recognition, representations from the middle layer alone perform as well as those derived from layer averaging, while the final layer results in the worst performance in some cases; 3) current self-supervised models may not be the optimal solution for downstream tasks that make use of non-lexical features. Our work provides novel findings that will aid future research in this area and theoretical basis for the use of existing models. ",

    "abstract": "Systems neuroscience relies on two complementary views of neural data, characterized by single neuron tuning curves and analysis of population activity. These two perspectives combine elegantly in neural latent variable models that constrain the relationship between latent variables and neural activity, modeled by simple tuning curve functions. This has recently been demonstrated using Gaussian processes, with applications to realistic and topologically relevant latent manifolds. Those and previous models, however, missed crucial shared coding properties of neural populations. We propose feature sharing across neural tuning curves, which significantly improves performance and leads to better-behaved optimization. We also propose a solution to the problem of ensemble detection, whereby different groups of neurons, i.e., ensembles, can be modulated by different latent manifolds. This is achieved through a soft clustering of neurons during training, thus allowing for the separation of mixed neural populations in an unsupervised manner. These innovations lead to more interpretable models of neural population activity that train well and perform better even on mixtures of complex latent manifolds. Finally, we apply our method on a recently published grid cell dataset, recovering distinct ensembles, inferring toroidal latents and predicting neural tuning curves all in a single integrated modeling framework.

    "abstract": "In many real-world scenarios, such as gene knockout experiments, targeted interventions are often accompanied by unknown interventions at off-target sites. Moreover, different units can get randomly exposed to different unknown interventions, thereby creating a mixture of interventions. Identifying different components of this mixture can be very valuable in some applications. Motivated by such situations, in this work, we study the problem of identifying all components present in a mixture of interventions on a given causal Bayesian Network. We construct an example to show that, in general, the components are not identifiable from the mixture distribution. Next, assuming that the given network satisfies a positivity condition, we show that, if the set of mixture components satisfy a mild exclusion assumption, then they can be uniquely identified. Our proof gives an efficient algorithm to recover these targets from the exponentially large search space of possible targets. In the more realistic scenario, where distributions are given via finitely many samples, we conduct a simulation study to analyze the performance of an algorithm derived from our identifiability proof.

This paper proposes a semi-analytical solutions (SAS) approach for fast and accurate simulation of the natural gas transients. The region of interest is divided into a grid, and an SAS is derived for each grid cell in the form of the multivariate polynomials, of which the coefficients are identified according to the initial value and boundary value conditions. The solutions are solved in a ``time-stepping'' manner; that is, within one time step, the coefficients of the SAS are identified and the initial value of the next time step is evaluated. This approach achieves a much larger grid cell than the widely used finite difference method, and thus enhances the computational efficiency significantly. To further reduce the computation burden, the nonlinear terms in the model are simplified, which induces another SAS scheme that can greatly reduce the time consumption and have minor impact on accuracy. The simulation results on a single pipeline case and a 6-node network case validate the advantages of the proposed SAS approach in accuracy and computational efficiency. ",

Here, a generalization of the Wasserstein distance, using higher-order moments than the mean, is derived. Training a GAN with this higher-order Wasserstein metric is demonstrated to exhibit superior performance, even when adjusted for slightly higher computational cost. This is illustrated generating synthetic antibody sequences. ",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we study the following problem. Consider a setting where a proposal is offered to the vertices of a given network $G$, and the vertices must conduct a vote and decide whether to accept the proposal or reject it. Each vertex $v$ has its own valuation of the proposal; we say that $v$ is \"happy\" if its valuation is positive (i.e., it expects to gain from adopting the proposal) and \"sad\" if its valuation is negative. However, vertices do not base their vote merely on their own valuation. Rather, a vertex $v$ is a proponent of the proposal if a majority of its neighbors are happy with it and an opponent in the opposite case. At the end of the vote, the network collectively accepts the proposal whenever a majority of its vertices are proponents. We study this problem on regular graphs with loops. Specifically, we consider the class ${\\mathcal G}_{n|d|h}$ of $d$-regular graphs of odd order $n$ with all $n$ loops and $h$ happy vertices. We are interested in establishing necessary and sufficient conditions for the class ${\\mathcal G}_{n|d|h}$ to contain a labeled graph accepting the proposal, as well as conditions to contain a graph rejecting the proposal. We also discuss connections to the existing literature and investigate some properties of the obtained conditions. ",

This paper focuses on speaker diarization and proposes to conduct the above bi-directional knowledge transfer alternately. We first introduce an end-to-end neural diarization model that can handle both single- and multi-channel inputs. Using this model, we alternately conduct i) knowledge distillation from a multi-channel model to a single-channel model and ii) finetuning from the distilled single-channel model to a multi-channel model. Experimental results on two-speaker data show that the proposed method mutually improved single- and multi-channel speaker diarization performances. ",

    "abstract": "Magnetic resonance images play an essential role in clinical diagnosis by acquiring the structural information of biological tissue. However, during acquiring magnetic resonance images, patients have to endure physical and psychological discomfort, including irritating noise and acute anxiety. To make the patient feel cozier, technically, it will reduce the retention time that patients stay in the strong magnetic field at the expense of image quality. Therefore, Super-Resolution plays a crucial role in preprocessing the low-resolution images for more precise medical analysis. In this paper, we propose the Flexible Alignment Super-Resolution Network (FASR-Net) for multi-contrast magnetic resonance images Super-Resolution. The core of multi-contrast SR is to match the patches of low-resolution and reference images. However, the inappropriate foreground scale and patch size of multi-contrast MRI sometimes lead to the mismatch of patches. To tackle this problem, the Flexible Alignment module is proposed to endow receptive fields with flexibility. Flexible Alignment module contains two parts: (1) The Single-Multi Pyramid Alignmet module serves for low-resolution and reference image with different scale. (2) The Multi-Multi Pyramid Alignment module serves for low-resolution and reference image with the same scale. Extensive experiments on the IXI and FastMRI datasets demonstrate that the FASR-Net outperforms the existing state-of-the-art approaches. In addition, by comparing the reconstructed images with the counterparts obtained by the existing algorithms, our method could retain more textural details by leveraging multi-contrast images. ",
