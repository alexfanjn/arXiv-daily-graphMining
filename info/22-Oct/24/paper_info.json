    "abstract": "The massive increase of data traffic, the widespread proliferation of wireless applications and the full-scale deployment of 5G and the IoT, imply a steep increase in cellular networks energy use, resulting in a significant carbon footprint. This paper presents a comprehensive model to show the interaction between the networking and energy features of the problem and study the economical and technical viability of green networking. Solar equipment, cell zooming, energy management and dynamic user allocation are considered in the upgrading network planning process. We propose a mixed-integer optimization model to minimize long-term capital costs and operational energy expenditures in a heterogeneous on-grid cellular network with different types of base station, including solar. Based on eight scenarios where realistic costs of solar panels, batteries, and inverters were considered, we first found that solar base stations are currently not economically interesting for cellular operators. We next studied the impact of a significant and progressive carbon tax on reducing greenhouse gas emissions (GHG). We found that, at current energy and equipment prices, a carbon tax ten-fold the current value is the only element that could make green base stations economically viable. ",

    "abstract": "While consolidation strategies form the backbone of many supply chain optimisation problems, exploitation of multi-tier material relationships through consolidation remains an understudied area, despite being a prominent feature of industries that produce complex made-to-order products. In this paper, we propose an optimisation framework for exploiting multi-to-multi relationship between tiers of a supply chain. The resulting formulation is flexible such that quantity discounts, inventory holding and transport costs can be included. The framework introduces a new trade-off between the tiers, resulting in cost reductions at one tier at the expense of increased costs in the other tier, which helps to reduce the overall procurement cost in the supply chain. A mixed integer linear programming model is developed and tested with a range of small to large-scale test problems from aerospace manufacturing. Our comparison to benchmark results show that there is indeed a cost trade-off between two tiers, and that its reduction can be achieved using a holistic approach to reconfiguration. Costs are decreased when second tier fixed ordering costs and the number of machining options increase. Consolidation results in less inventory holding costs for all cases. A number of secondary effects such as simplified supplier selection may also be observed. ",

Conversely, obstinate adversarial examples occur when an adversary finds a small perturbation that preserves the classifier's prediction but changes the true label of an input. Adversarial training and certified robust training have shown some effectiveness in improving the robustness of machine learnt models to fickle adversarial examples. We show that standard adversarial training methods focused on reducing vulnerability to fickle adversarial examples may make a model more vulnerable to obstinate adversarial examples, with experiments for both natural language inference and paraphrase identification tasks. To counter this phenomenon, we introduce Balanced Adversarial Training, which incorporates contrastive learning to increase robustness against both fickle and obstinate adversarial examples. ",

    "abstract": "Trust, security, and privacy are three of the major pillars to assemble the fifth generation network and beyond. Despite such pillars are principally interconnected, they arise a multitude of challenges to be addressed separately. 5G ought to offer flexible and pervasive computing capabilities across multiple domains according to user demands and assuring trustworthy network providers. Distributed marketplaces expect to boost the trading of heterogeneous resources so as to enable the establishment of pervasive service chains between cross-domains. Nevertheless, the need for reliable parties as ``marketplace operators'' plays a pivotal role to achieving a trustworthy ecosystem. One of the principal blockages in managing foreseeable networks is the need of adapting previous trust models to accomplish the new network and business requirements. In this regard, this article is centered on trust management of 5G multi-party networks. The design of a reputation-based trust framework is proposed as a Trust-as-a-Service (TaaS) solution for any distributed multi-stakeholder environment where zero trust and zero-touch principles should be met. Besides, a literature review is also conducted to recognize the network and business requirements currently envisaged. Finally, the validation of the proposed trust framework is performed in a real research environment, the 5GBarcelona testbed, leveraging 12% of a 2.1GHz CPU with 20 cores and 2% of the 30GiB memory. In this regard, these outcomes reveal the feasibility of the TaaS solution in the context of determining reliable network operators. ",

We propose a multi-modal sales forecasting network that combines real-life events from news articles with traditional data such as historical sales and holiday information. Further, we fuse information from general product trends published by Google trends.

We find that the neural retriever has much higher performance when fed neural rather than human captions, despite the fact that the former, unlike the latter, were generated without awareness of the distractors that make the task hard. Even more remarkably, when the same neural captions are given to human subjects, their retrieval performance is almost at chance level.

We formulate weighted adversarial training as a bilevel optimization problem with the upper-level problem corresponding to learning a robust classifier, and the lower-level problem corresponding to learning a parametric function that maps from a sample's \\textit{multi-class margin} to an importance weight.

Different from traditional approaches, we propose ConfMix, the first method that introduces a sample mixing strategy based on region-level detection confidence for adaptive object detector learning. We mix the local region of the target sample that corresponds to the most confident pseudo detections with a source image, and apply an additional consistency loss term to gradually adapt towards the target data distribution. In order to robustly define a confidence score for a region, we exploit the confidence score per pseudo detection that accounts for both the detector-dependent confidence and the bounding box uncertainty. Moreover, we propose a novel pseudo labelling scheme that progressively filters the pseudo target detections using the confidence metric that varies from a loose to strict manner along the training. We perform extensive experiments with three datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance in two of them and approaching the supervised target model performance in the other.

The author explained that end arteries supply the heart and ears. In other words, if they lose blood supply, no other arteries can take over, resulting in tissue damage. Consequently, some earlobes have a diagonal crease, line, or deep fold that resembles a wrinkle. In this paper, we take a step toward detecting this specific marker, commonly known as DELC or Frank's Sign. For this reason, we have made the first DELC dataset available to the public. In addition, we have investigated the performance of numerous cutting-edge backbones on annotated photos. Experimentally, we demonstrate that it is possible to solve this challenge by combining pre-trained encoders with a customized classifier to achieve 97.7% accuracy.

Then, we propose a set of quantitative measures, named Explanation Concentration (XC) scores, that can be used for downstream tasks. These scores quantify the concentration of attributions within the boundaries of detected objects. We evaluate the effectiveness of XC scores via the task of distinguishing true positive (TP) and false positive (FP) detected objects in the KITTI and Waymo datasets. The results demonstrate an improvement of more than 100\\% on both datasets compared to other heuristics such as random guesses and the number of LiDAR points in the bounding box, raising confidence in XC's potential for application in more use cases. Our results also indicate that computationally expensive XAI methods like IG may not be more valuable when used quantitatively compare to simpler methods. ",

The main interest of this paper is directed towards data poisoning attacks involving label-flipping, this kind of attacks occur during the training phase, being the aim of the attacker to compromise the integrity of the targeted machine learning model by drastically reducing the overall accuracy of the model and/or achieving the missclassification of determined samples. This paper is conducted with intention of proposing two new kinds of data poisoning attacks based on label-flipping, the targeted of the attack is represented by a variety of machine learning classifiers dedicated for malware detection using mobile exfiltration data. With that, the proposed attacks are proven to be model-agnostic, having successfully corrupted a wide variety of machine learning models; Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest and KNN are some examples. The first attack is performs label-flipping actions randomly while the second attacks performs label flipping only one of the 2 classes in particular. The effects of each attack are analyzed in further detail with special emphasis on the accuracy drop and the misclassification rate. Finally, this paper pursuits further research direction by suggesting the development of a defense technique that could promise a feasible detection and/or mitigation mechanisms; such technique should be capable of conferring a certain level of robustness to a target model against potential attackers.

Most notably, humans were able to generate adversarial examples much more effortlessly than automated attacks. In this paper, we provide a detailed analysis of exactly how humans create these adversarial examples. By exploring the behavioural patterns of human workers during the generation process, we identify statistically significant tendencies based on which words humans prefer to select for adversarial replacement (e.g., word frequencies, word saliencies, sentiment) as well as where and when words are replaced in an input sequence.

So far, we have seen many studies that investigate and present the performance and computational efficiency of GNNs. However, the work done so far has been carried out using a few high-level GNN frameworks. Although these frameworks provide ease of use, they contain too many dependencies to other existing libraries. The layers of implementation details and the dependencies complicate the performance analysis of GNN models that are built on top of these frameworks, especially while using architectural simulators. Furthermore, different approaches on GNN computation are generally overlooked in prior characterization studies, and merely one of the common computational models is evaluated. Based on these shortcomings and needs that we observed, we developed a benchmark suite that is framework independent, supporting versatile computational models, easily configurable and can be used with architectural simulators without additional effort. Our benchmark suite, which we call gSuite, makes use of only hardware vendor's libraries and therefore it is independent of any other frameworks. gSuite enables performing detailed performance characterization studies on GNN Inference using both contemporary GPU profilers and architectural GPU simulators. To illustrate the benefits of our new benchmark suite, we perform a detailed characterization study with a set of well-known GNN models with various datasets; running gSuite both on a real GPU card and a timing-detailed GPU simulator.

Alternatively, one can treat the entire object as unknown and use a more general volumetric representation, without making use of the known sound speed. Both lead to strongly nonlinear and nonconvex optimization problems for which recursive linearization provides a useful framework for numerical analysis. After extending our shape optimization approach developed earlier for impenetrable bodies, we carry out a systematic study of both methods and compare their performance on a variety of examples. Our findings indicate that the volumetric approach is more robust, even though the number of degrees of freedom is significantly larger.

In this paper, we propose a layer-wise orthogonal training method (LOT) to effectively train 1-Lipschitz convolution layers via parametrizing an orthogonal matrix with an unconstrained matrix. We then efficiently compute the inverse square root of a convolution kernel by transforming the input domain to the Fourier frequency domain. On the other hand, as existing works show that semi-supervised training helps improve empirical robustness, we aim to bridge the gap and prove that semi-supervised learning also improves the certified robustness of Lipschitz-bounded models. We conduct comprehensive evaluations for LOT under different settings. We show that LOT significantly outperforms baselines regarding deterministic l2 certified robustness, and scales to deeper neural networks. Under the supervised scenario, we improve the state-of-the-art certified robustness for all architectures (e.g. from 59.04% to 63.50% on CIFAR-10 and from 32.57% to 34.59% on CIFAR-100 at radius rho = 36/255 for 40-layer networks). With semi-supervised learning over unlabelled data, we are able to improve state-of-the-art certified robustness on CIFAR-10 at rho = 108/255 from 36.04% to 42.39%. In addition, LOT consistently outperforms baselines on different model architectures with only 1/3 evaluation time. ",

    "title": "Sinophobia, misogyny, facism, and many more: A multi-ethnic approach to  identifying anti-Asian racism in social media",
    "abstract": "Anti-Asian hate/toxic/racial speech has recently increased, especially in response to the outbreak of COVID-19. However, heavy focus on the COVID-19 context and subsequent Sinophobia may have over-represented Chinese-attacking phenomena rather than offering insights applicable to pan-Asian communities. To fill this gap, this paper underscores a cross-ethnic contextual understanding by taking a multi-ethnic approach to identifying and describing anti-Asian racism expressed in Twitter. The study examines (1) cross-ethnicity difference (or similarity) of anti-Asian expressions; (2) temporal dynamics of cross-ethnicity difference/similarity; (3) topical contexts underlying anti-Asian tweets; and (4) comparison between Sinophobic tweets and pan-Asian or non-Chinese Asian targeting tweets. The study uses a 12 month-long large-scale tweets that contain ethnicity-indicative search keywords, from which anti-Asian tweets are identified using deep-learning models. Multiple correspondence analysis and topic modeling are employed to address research questions. Results show anti-Asian speeches are fragmented into several distinctive groups, and such groupings change dynamically in response to political, social, and cultural reality surrounding ethnic relations. Findings suggest that China is not a representative entity for pan-Asian ethnicity: Most of the times during the observed period, anti-China tweets are positioned distantly from generically mentioned anti-Asian tweets in the $n$-gram-based multidimensional space. Moreover, generic anti-Asian tweets show greater topical similarities to the combined set of tweets that attack other Asian ethnic groups than to the anti-China tweets. Pan-Asian tweets and China-specific tweets become semantically similar in the aftermath of the pandemic outbreak (from Feb. 2020 to Apr. 2020) yet only temporarily. ",

For motion planning, we use rapidly exploring random trees (RRTs) on a set of generated motion primitives to search for dynamically feasible trajectory sequences and collision-free path to the goal.

    "abstract": "The value of unknown parameters of multibody systems is crucial for prediction, monitoring, and control, sometimes estimated using a biased physics-based model leading to incorrect outcomes. Discovering motion equations of multibody systems from time-series data is challenging as they consist of complex rational functions, constants as function arguments, and diverse function terms, which are not trivial to guess. This study aims at developing an evolutionary symbolic sparse regression approach for the system identification of multibody systems. The procedure discovers equations of motion and system parameters appearing as either constant values in function arguments or coefficients of function expressions. A genetic programming algorithm is written to generate symbolic function expressions, in which a hard-thresholding regression method is embedded. In an evolutionary manner, the complex functional forms, constant arguments, and unknown coefficients are identified to eventually discover the governing equation of a given system. A fitness measure is presented to promote parsimony in distilled equations and reduction in fit-to-data error. Hybrid discrete-continuous dynamical systems are also investigated, for which an approach is suggested to determine both mode number and system submodels. The performance and efficiency of the suggested evolutionary symbolic sparse regression methodology are evaluated in a simulation environment. The capability of the developed approach is also demonstrated by studying several multibody systems. The procedure is efficient and gives the possibility to estimate system parameters and distill respective governing equations. This technique reduces the risk that the function dictionary does not cover all functionality required to unravel hidden physical laws and the need for prior knowledge of the mechanism of interest.

    "abstract": "Graph neural networks (GNNs) find applications in various domains such as computational biology, natural language processing, and computer security. Owing to their popularity, there is an increasing need to explain GNN predictions since GNNs are black-box machine learning models. One way to address this is counterfactual reasoning where the objective is to change the GNN prediction by minimal changes in the input graph. Existing methods for counterfactual explanation of GNNs are limited to instance-specific local reasoning. This approach has two major limitations of not being able to offer global recourse policies and overloading human cognitive ability with too much information. In this work, we study the global explainability of GNNs through global counterfactual reasoning. Specifically, we want to find a small set of representative counterfactual graphs that explains all input graphs. Towards this goal, we propose GCFExplainer, a novel algorithm powered by vertex-reinforced random walks on an edit map of graphs with a greedy summary. Extensive experiments on real graph datasets show that the global explanation from GCFExplainer provides important high-level insights of the model behavior and achieves a 46.9% gain in recourse coverage and a 9.5% reduction in recourse cost compared to the state-of-the-art local counterfactual explainers.

World models have previously been shown to improve sample-efficiency in simulated environments with few objects, but have not yet been applied successfully to environments with many objects. In environments with many objects, often only a small number of them are moving or interacting at the same time. In this paper, we investigate integrating this inductive bias of sparse interactions into the latent dynamics of world models trained from pixels. First, we introduce Variational Sparse Gating (VSG), a latent dynamics model that updates its feature dimensions sparsely through stochastic binary gates. Moreover, we propose a simplified architecture Simple Variational Sparse Gating (SVSG) that removes the deterministic pathway of previous models, resulting in a fully stochastic transition function that leverages the VSG mechanism. We evaluate the two model architectures in the BringBackShapes (BBS) environment that features a large number of moving objects and partial observability, demonstrating clear improvements over prior models.

The proposed ConvMR model addresses the multi-relation issue in two aspects: (1) Encoding the multi-relations between an entity pair into a unified vector that maintains the semantic connection. (2) Since not all relations are necessary while joining multi-relations, we propose an attention-based relation encoder to automatically assign weights to different relations based on semantic hierarchy. Experimental results on two popular datasets, FB15k-237 and WN18RR, achieved consistent improvements on the mean rank. We also found that ConvMR is efficient to deal with less frequent entities. ",

To understand such utilities, previous works probe representations of speech models to reveal which & how speech related information is encoded in the learned representations. While encoding properties have been extensively explored from the perspective of acoustics, phonetics, and semantics, the physical grounding by speech production has not yet received full attention. To bridge this gap, we conduct a comprehensive analysis to link speech representations to articulatory trajectories measured by electromagnetic articulography (EMA). Our analysis is based on a linear probing approach where we measure articulatory score as an average correlation of linear mapping to EMA. We analyze a set of SSL models selected from the leaderboard of the SU- PERB benchmark and perform further detailed analyses on two major models, Wav2Vec 2.0 and HuBERT. Surprisingly, representations from the recent speech SSL models are highly correlated with EMA traces (best: r = 0.81), and only 5 minutes were sufficient to train a linear model with high performance (r = 0.77). Our findings suggest that SSL models learn to closely align with continuous articulations and provide a novel insight into speech SSL. ",

    "abstract": "To develop effective and efficient graph similarity learning (GSL) models, a series of data-driven neural algorithms have been proposed in recent years. Although GSL models are frequently deployed in privacy-sensitive scenarios, the user privacy protection of neural GSL models has not drawn much attention. To comprehensively understand the privacy protection issues, we first introduce the concept of attackable representation to systematically characterize the privacy attacks that each model can face. Inspired by the qualitative results, we propose a novel Privacy-Preserving neural Graph Matching network model, named PPGM, for graph similarity learning. To prevent reconstruction attacks, the proposed model does not communicate node-level representations between devices. Instead, we learn multi-perspective graph representations based on learnable context vectors. To alleviate the attacks to graph properties, the obfuscated features that contain information from both graphs are communicated. In this way, the private properties of each graph can be difficult to infer. Based on the node-graph matching techniques while calculating the obfuscated features, PPGM can also be effective in similarity measuring. To quantitatively evaluate the privacy-preserving ability of neural GSL models, we further propose an evaluation protocol via training supervised black-box attack models. Extensive experiments on widely-used benchmarks show the effectiveness and strong privacy-protection ability of the proposed model PPGM. The code is available at: https://github.com/RUCAIBox/PPGM. ",

However, it requires massive task-specific data, which may not be plausible in many real-world applications. Data augmentation methods such as representation interpolation, token replacement, or augmentation with models are applied to tackle this problem. However, these data augmentation methods either potentially cause shifts in decision boundaries (representation interpolation), are not expressive enough (token replacement), or introduce too much computational overhead (augmentation with models). To this end, we propose AugPro (Augmentation with Projection), an effective and efficient data augmentation method for distillation. Our method builds on top of representation interpolation augmentation methods to maintain the diversity of expressions and converts the augmented data to tokens to avoid shifting decision boundaries. It uses simple operations that come with little computational overhead. The results on multiple GLUE tasks show that our methods can improve distillation performance by a large margin at a low time cost. ",

This has recently been linked with the curvature and spectral gap of the graph. On the other hand, adding edges to the message-passing graph can lead to increasingly similar node representations and a problem known as oversmoothing. We propose a computationally efficient algorithm that prevents oversquashing by systematically adding edges to the graph based on spectral expansion. We combine this with a relational architecture, which lets the GNN preserve the original graph structure and provably prevents oversmoothing.

Specifically, we experiment with ideas such as using different checkpoint selection strategies, calculating weighted average instead of simple mean, making use of gradient information and fine-tuning the interpolation weights on development data. Our results confirm the necessity of applying checkpoint averaging for optimal performance, but also suggest that the landscape between the converged checkpoints is rather flat and not much further improvement compared to simple averaging is to be obtained.

For machine translation, despite the evolution from long short-term memory networks to Transformer networks, plus the introduction and development of attention mechanism, encoder-decoder is still the de facto neural network architecture for state-of-the-art models. While the motivation for decoding information from some hidden space is straightforward, the strict separation of the encoding and decoding steps into an encoder and a decoder in the model architecture is not necessarily a must. Compared to the task of autoregressive language modeling in the target language, machine translation simply has an additional source sentence as context. Given the fact that neural language models nowadays can already handle rather long contexts in the target language, it is natural to ask whether simply concatenating the source and target sentences and training a language model to do translation would work. In this work, we investigate the aforementioned concept for machine translation. Specifically, we experiment with bilingual translation, translation with additional target monolingual data, and multilingual translation. In all cases, this alternative approach performs on par with the baseline encoder-decoder Transformer, suggesting that an encoder-decoder architecture might be redundant for neural machine translation.

    "title": "GaitMAST: Motion-Aware Spatio-Temporal Feature Learning Network for  Cross-View Gait Recognition",
    "abstract": "As a unique biometric that can be perceived at a distance, gait has broad applications in person authentication, social security and so on. Existing gait recognition methods pay attention to extracting either spatial or spatiotemporal representations. However, they barely consider extracting diverse motion features, a fundamental characteristic in gaits, from gait sequences. In this paper, we propose a novel motion-aware spatiotemporal feature learning network for gait recognition, termed GaitMAST, which can unleash the potential of motion-aware features. In the shallow layer, specifically, we propose a dual-path frame-level feature extractor, in which one path extracts overall spatiotemporal features and the other extracts motion salient features by focusing on dynamic regions. In the deeper layers, we design a two-branch clip-level feature extractor, in which one focuses on fine-grained spatial information and the other on motion detail preservation. Consequently, our GaitMAST preserves the individual's unique walking patterns well, further enhancing the robustness of spatiotemporal features. Extensive experimental results on two commonly-used cross-view gait datasets demonstrate the superior performance of GaitMAST over existing state-of-the-art methods. On CASIA-B, our model achieves an average rank-1 accuracy of 94.1%. In particular, GaitMAST achieves rank-1 accuracies of 96.1% and 88.1% under the bag-carry and coat wearing conditions, respectively, outperforming the second best by a large margin and demonstrating its robustness against spatial variations.

    "abstract": "Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) has been widely used to estimate the healthy operation of some urban roads and underground facilities. When identifying subsurface anomalies by GPR in an area, the obtained data could be unbalanced, and the numbers and types of possible underground anomalies could not be acknowledged in advance. In this paper, a novel method is proposed to improve the subsurface anomaly detection from GPR B-scan images. A normal (i.e. without subsurface objects) GPR image section is firstly collected in the detected area. Concerning that the GPR image is essentially the representation of electromagnetic (EM) wave and propagation time, and to preserve both the subsurface background and objects' details, the normal GPR image is segmented and then fused with simulated GPR images that contain different kinds of objects to generate the synthetic data for the detection area based on the wavelet decompositions. Pre-trained CNNs could then be fine-tuned with the synthetic data, and utilized to extract features of segmented GPR images subsequently obtained in the detection area. The extracted features could be classified by the one-class learning algorithm in the feature space without pre-set anomaly types or numbers. The conducted experiments demonstrate that fine-tuning the pre-trained CNN with the proposed synthetic data could effectively improve the feature extraction of the network for the objects in the detection area. Besides, the proposed method requires only a section of normal data that could be easily obtained in the detection area, and could also meet the timeliness requirements in practical applications. ",

Recent neural models on code summarization are trained and evaluated on large-scale multi-project datasets consisting of independent code-summary pairs. Despite the technical advances, their effectiveness on a specific project is rarely explored. In practical scenarios, however, developers are more concerned with generating high-quality summaries for their working projects. And these projects may not maintain sufficient documentation, hence having few historical code-summary pairs. To this end, we investigate low-resource project-specific code summarization, a novel task more consistent with the developers' requirements. To better characterize project-specific knowledge with limited training samples, we propose a meta transfer learning method by incorporating a lightweight fine-tuning mechanism into a meta-learning framework. Experimental results on nine real-world projects verify the superiority of our method over alternative ones and reveal how the project-specific knowledge is learned. ",

Such potential enhancement, however, relies on an efficient positioning of the FlyBSs as well as a management of resources. In this paper, we study the problem of sum capacity maximization in an extended model for mobile networks where multiple FlyBSs are deployed between the ground base station and the users. Due to an inclusion of multiple hops, the existing solutions for two-hop networks cannot be applied due to the incurred backhaul constraints for each hop. To this end, we propose an analytical approach based on an alternating optimization of the FlyBSs' 3D positions as well as the association of the users to the FlyBSs over time. The proposed optimization is provided under practical constraints on the FlyBS's flying speed and altitude as well as the constraints on the achievable capacity at the backhaul link. The proposed solution is of a low complexity and extends the sum capacity by 23%-38% comparing to state-of-the-art solutions. ",

    "abstract": "In recent years, the standard hybrid DNN-HMM speech recognizers are outperformed by the end-to-end speech recognition systems. One of the very promising approaches is the grapheme Wav2Vec 2.0 model, which uses the self-supervised pretraining approach combined with transfer learning of the fine-tuned speech recognizer. Since it lacks the pronunciation vocabulary and language model, the approach is suitable for tasks where obtaining such models is not easy or almost impossible. In this paper, we use the Wav2Vec speech recognizer in the task of spoken term detection over a large set of spoken documents. The method employs a deep LSTM network which maps the recognized hypothesis and the searched term into a shared pronunciation embedding space in which the term occurrences and the assigned scores are easily computed. The paper describes a bootstrapping approach that allows the transfer of the knowledge contained in traditional pronunciation vocabulary of DNN-HMM hybrid ASR into the context of grapheme-based Wav2Vec. The proposed method outperforms the previously published system based on the combination of the DNN-HMM hybrid ASR and phoneme recognizer by a large margin on the MALACH data in both English and Czech languages.

The phoneme confusion network generated by a phoneme recognizer is processed by the deep LSTM network which projects each segment of the confusion network into an embedding space. The searched term is projected into the same embedding space using another deep LSTM network. The relevance score is then computed using a simple dot-product in the embedding space and calibrated using a sigmoid function to predict the probability of occurrence. The location of the searched term is then estimated from the sequence of output probabilities. The deep LSTM networks are trained in a self-supervised manner from paired recognition hypotheses on word and phoneme levels.

    "abstract": "Today's RKE systems implement disposable rolling codes, making every key fob button press unique, effectively preventing simple replay attacks. However, a prior attack called RollJam was proven to break all rolling code-based systems in general. By a careful sequence of signal jamming, capturing, and replaying, an attacker can become aware of the subsequent valid unlock signal that has not been used yet. RollJam, however, requires continuous deployment indefinitely until it is exploited. Otherwise, the captured signals become invalid if the key fob is used again without RollJam in place. We introduce RollBack, a new replay-and-resynchronize attack against most of today's RKE systems. In particular, we show that even though the one-time code becomes invalid in rolling code systems, replaying a few previously captured signals consecutively can trigger a rollback-like mechanism in the RKE system. Put differently, the rolling codes become resynchronized back to a previous code used in the past from where all subsequent yet already used signals work again. Moreover, the victim can still use the key fob without noticing any difference before and after the attack. Unlike RollJam, RollBack does not necessitate jamming at all. Furthermore, it requires signal capturing only once and can be exploited at any time in the future as many times as desired. This time-agnostic property is particularly attractive to attackers, especially in car-sharing/renting scenarios where accessing the key fob is straightforward. However, while RollJam defeats virtually any rolling code-based system, vehicles might have additional anti-theft measures against malfunctioning key fobs, hence against RollBack. Our ongoing analysis (covering Asian vehicle manufacturers for the time being) against different vehicle makes and models has revealed that ~70% of them are vulnerable to RollBack. ",

To alleviate the expensive cost of manual annotations for temporal boundary labels, we are dedicated to the weakly supervised setting, where only video-level descriptions are provided for training. Most of the existing weakly supervised methods generate a candidate segment set and learn cross-modal alignment through a MIL-based framework. However, the temporal structure of the video as well as the complicated semantics in the sentence are lost during the learning. In this work, we propose a novel candidate-free framework: Fine-grained Semantic Alignment Network (FSAN), for weakly supervised TLG. Instead of view the sentence and candidate moments as a whole, FSAN learns token-by-clip cross-modal semantic alignment by an iterative cross-modal interaction module, generates a fine-grained cross-modal semantic alignment map, and performs grounding directly on top of the map. Extensive experiments are conducted on two widely-used benchmarks: ActivityNet-Captions, and DiDeMo, where our FSAN achieves state-of-the-art performance. ",

The proposed method uses an advanced rendering method in combination with transfer learning and an intermediate supervision architecture to address this problem. It is shown that the model presented in this paper, named Intermediate Heatmap Model (IHM), generalizes to real images when trained on synthetic data. To avoid the need for an exact textured 3D model of the tool in question, it is shown that the model will generalize to an unseen tool when trained on a set of different 3D models of the same type of tool. IHM is compared to two existing approaches to keypoint detection and it is shown that it outperforms those at detecting tool landmarks, trained on synthetic data. ",

For a cardinality constraint, we propose an algorithm achieving a near-optimal $\\left(1-\\frac{1}{e}-O(\\varepsilon)\\right)$-approximation guarantee (for arbitrary $\\varepsilon > 0$) with only a polynomial number of queries to the noisy value oracle, which improves the exponential query complexity of [Singer et al., 2018].

Our main approaches are to design a novel local search framework that can handle the effect of noise and to construct certain smoothing surrogate functions for noise reduction. ",

    "abstract": "We study the enumeration of answers to Unions of Conjunctive Queries (UCQs) with optimal time guarantees. More precisely, we wish to identify the queries that can be solved with linear preprocessing time and constant delay. Despite the basic nature of this problem, it was shown only recently that UCQs can be solved within these time bounds if they admit free-connex union extensions, even if all individual CQs in the union are intractable with respect to the same complexity measure. Our goal is to understand whether there exist additional tractable UCQs, not covered by the currently known algorithms. As a first step, we show that some previously unclassified UCQs are hard using the classic 3SUM hypothesis, via a known reduction from 3SUM to triangle listing in graphs. As a second step, we identify a question about a variant of this graph task which is unavoidable if we want to classify all self-join free UCQs: is it possible to decide the existence of a triangle in a vertex-unbalanced tripartite graph in linear time? We prove that this task is equivalent in hardness to some family of UCQs. Finally, we show a dichotomy for unions of two self-join-free CQs if we assume the answer to this question is negative. As a result, to reason about a class of enumeration problems defined by UCQs, it is enough to study the single decision problem of detecting triangles in unbalanced graphs. As of today, we know of no algorithm that comes close to solving this decision problem within the required time bounds. Our conclusion is that, without a breakthrough for triangle detection, we have no hope to find an efficient algorithm for additional unions of two self-join free CQs. On the other hand, if we will one day have such a triangle detection algorithm, we will immediately obtain an efficient algorithm for a family of UCQs that are currently not known to be tractable. ",

Building on the idea of behavioral testing, we propose a novel framework, which pins down the causal effect of various factors in the input, e.g., the surface form of the problem text, the operands and math operators on the output solution. By grounding the behavioral analysis in a causal graph describing an intuitive reasoning process, we study the behavior of language models in terms of robustness and sensitivity to direct interventions in the input space. We apply our framework on a test bed of bivariate math word problems. Our analysis shows that robustness does not appear to continuously improve as a function of scale, but that the recent LLM, GPT-3-Instruct (175B), achieves a dramatic improvement in both robustness and sensitivity, compared to all other GPT variants.

    "abstract": "Two key challenges facing modern deep learning are mitigating deep networks' vulnerability to adversarial attacks and understanding deep learning's generalization capabilities. Towards the first issue, many defense strategies have been developed, with the most common being Adversarial Training (AT). Towards the second challenge, one of the dominant theories that has emerged is the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) -- a characterization of neural network behavior in the infinite-width limit. In this limit, the kernel is frozen, and the underlying feature map is fixed. In finite widths, however, there is evidence that feature learning happens at the earlier stages of the training (kernel learning) before a second phase where the kernel remains fixed (lazy training). While prior work has aimed at studying adversarial vulnerability through the lens of the frozen infinite-width NTK, there is no work that studies the adversarial robustness of the empirical/finite NTK during training. In this work, we perform an empirical study of the evolution of the empirical NTK under standard and adversarial training, aiming to disambiguate the effect of adversarial training on kernel learning and lazy training. We find under adversarial training, the empirical NTK rapidly converges to a different kernel (and feature map) than standard training. This new kernel provides adversarial robustness, even when non-robust training is performed on top of it. Furthermore, we find that adversarial training on top of a fixed kernel can yield a classifier with $76.1\\%$ robust accuracy under PGD attacks with $\\varepsilon = 4/255$ on CIFAR-10. ",

    "title": "Neuro-Symbolic Causal Reasoning Meets Signaling Game for Emergent  Semantic Communications",
    "abstract": "Semantic communication (SC) aims to communicate reliably with minimal data transfer while simultaneously providing seamless connectivity to heterogeneous services and users. In this paper, a novel emergent SC (ESC) system framework is proposed and is composed of a signaling game for emergent language design and a neuro-symbolic (NeSy) artificial intelligence (AI) approach for causal reasoning. In order to design the language, the signaling game is solved using an alternating maximization between the communicating node's utilities. The emergent language helps create a context-aware transmit vocabulary (minimal semantic representation) and aids the reasoning process (enabling generalization to unseen scenarios) by splitting complex messages into simpler reasoning tasks for the receiver. The causal description at the transmitter is then modeled (a neural component) as a posterior distribution of the relevant attributes present in the data. Using the reconstructed causal state, the receiver evaluates a set of logical formulas (symbolic part) to execute its task. The nodes NeSy reasoning components are implemented by the recently proposed AI tool called Generative Flow Networks, and they are optimized for higher semantic reliability. The ESC system is designed to enhance the novel metrics of semantic information, reliability, distortion and similarity that are designed using rigorous algebraic properties from category theory thereby generalizing the metrics beyond Shannon's notion of uncertainty. Simulation results validate the ability of ESC to communicate efficiently (with reduced bits) and achieve better semantic reliability than conventional wireless and state-of-the-art systems that do not exploit causal reasoning capabilities.

Unfortunately, the use of XAI in machine learning introduces new privacy risks, which currently remain largely unnoticed.

To counter such an attack, we propose k-anonymous counterfactual explanations and introduce pureness as a new metric to evaluate the validity of these k-anonymous counterfactual explanations.

    "abstract": "Neural networks are a powerful class of non-linear functions. However, their black-box nature makes it difficult to explain their behaviour and certify their safety. Abstraction techniques address this challenge by transforming the neural network into a simpler, over-approximated function. Unfortunately, existing abstraction techniques are slack, which limits their applicability to small local regions of the input domain. In this paper, we propose Global Interval Neural Network Abstractions with Center-Exact Reconstruction (GINNACER). Our novel abstraction technique produces sound over-approximation bounds over the whole input domain while guaranteeing exact reconstructions for any given local input. Our experiments show that GINNACER is several orders of magnitude tighter than state-of-the-art global abstraction techniques, while being competitive with local ones. ",

In this study, we investigate the use of predictions from graph neural networks (GNNs) in the form of heatmaps to improve the Hybrid Genetic Search (HGS), a state-of-the-art algorithm for the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP). The crossover and local-search components of HGS are instrumental in finding improved solutions, yet these components essentially rely on simple greedy or random choices. It seems intuitive to attempt to incorporate additional knowledge at these levels. Throughout a vast experimental campaign on more than 10,000 problem instances, we show that exploiting more sophisticated strategies using measures of node relatedness (heatmaps, or simply distance) within these algorithmic components can significantly enhance performance. However, contrary to initial expectations, we also observed that heatmaps did not present significant advantages over simpler distance measures for these purposes. Therefore, we faced a common -- though rarely documented -- situation of overkill: GNNs can indeed improve performance on an important optimization task, but an ablation analysis demonstrated that simpler alternatives perform equally well.

The emotions of different entities have been considered only partially in emotion semantic role labeling, a task that relates semantic roles to emotion cue words. Proposing a related task, we narrow the focus on the experiencers of events, and assign an emotion (if any holds) to each of them. To this end, we represent each emotion both categorically and with appraisal variables, as a psychological access to explaining why a person develops a particular emotion. On an event description corpus, our experiencer-aware models of emotions and appraisals outperform the experiencer-agnostic baselines, showing that disregarding event participants is an oversimplification for the emotion detection task.

    "abstract": "Constraint monitoring aims to monitor the violation of constraints in business processes, e.g., an invoice should be cleared within 48 hours after the corresponding goods receipt, by analyzing event data. Existing techniques for constraint monitoring assume that a single case notion exists in a business process, e.g., a patient in a healthcare process, and each event is associated with the case notion. However, in reality, business processes are object-centric, i.e., multiple case notions (objects) exist, and an event may be associated with multiple objects. For instance, an Order-To-Cash (O2C) process involves order, item, delivery, etc., and they interact when executing an event, e.g., packing multiple items together for a delivery. The existing techniques produce misleading insights when applied to such object-centric business processes. In this work, we propose an approach to monitoring constraints in object-centric business processes. To this end, we introduce Object-Centric Constraint Graphs (OCCGs) to represent constraints that consider the interaction of objects. Next, we evaluate the constraints represented by OCCGs by analyzing Object-Centric Event Logs (OCELs) that store the interaction of different objects in events. We have implemented a web application to support the proposed approach and conducted two case studies using a real-life SAP ERP system. ",

However, neural systems lack the interpretability of bag-of-words models; it is not trivial to connect a query change to a change in the latent space that ultimately determines the retrieval results. To shed light on this embedding space, we learn a \"query decoder\" that, given a latent representation of a neural search engine, generates the corresponding query. We show that it is possible to decode a meaningful query from its latent representation and, when moving in the right direction in latent space, to decode a query that retrieves the relevant paragraph. In particular, the query decoder can be useful to understand \"what should have been asked\" to retrieve a particular paragraph from the collection. We employ the query decoder to generate a large synthetic dataset of query reformulations for MSMarco, leading to improved retrieval performance. On this data, we train a pseudo-relevance feedback (PRF) T5 model for the application of query suggestion that outperforms both query reformulation and PRF information retrieval baselines. ",

Assuming independent Poisson point processes for node distribution, stochastic geometry approaches are exploited to characterize the ergodic secrecy rate. A lower bound on the ergodic secrecy rate along with closed-form expressions for the lower bound on the ergodic rates of the legitimate users in a special case are derived.

However, most theoretical analyses thus far have been limited to linear PDEs. In this work, we take a step towards studying the representational power of neural networks for approximating solutions to nonlinear PDEs. We focus on a class of PDEs known as \\emph{nonlinear elliptic variational PDEs}, whose solutions minimize an \\emph{Euler-Lagrange} energy functional $\\mathcal{E}(u) = \\int_\\Omega L(\\nabla u) dx$. We show that if composing a function with Barron norm $b$ with $L$ produces a function of Barron norm at most $B_L b^p$, the solution to the PDE can be $\\epsilon$-approximated in the $L^2$ sense by a function with Barron norm $O\\left(\\left(dB_L\\right)^{p^{\\log(1/\\epsilon)}}\\right)$. By a classical result due to Barron [1993], this correspondingly bounds the size of a 2-layer neural network needed to approximate the solution. Treating $p, \\epsilon, B_L$ as constants, this quantity is polynomial in dimension, thus showing neural networks can evade the curse of dimensionality. Our proof technique involves neurally simulating (preconditioned) gradient in an appropriate Hilbert space, which converges exponentially fast to the solution of the PDE, and such that we can bound the increase of the Barron norm at each iterate. Our results subsume and substantially generalize analogous prior results for linear elliptic PDEs. ",

Under the few-shot scenario, models are often required to conduct classification given limited labeled samples. Existing graph few-shot learning methods typically leverage Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and perform classification across a series of meta-tasks. Nevertheless, these methods generally rely on the original graph (i.e., the graph that the meta-task is sampled from) to learn node representations. Consequently, the graph structure used in each meta-task is identical. Since the class sets are different across meta-tasks, node representations should be learned in a task-specific manner to promote classification performance. Therefore, to adaptively learn node representations across meta-tasks, we propose a novel framework that learns a task-specific structure for each meta-task. To handle the variety of nodes across meta-tasks, we extract relevant nodes and learn task-specific structures based on node influence and mutual information. In this way, we can learn node representations with the task-specific structure tailored for each meta-task. We further conduct extensive experiments on five node classification datasets under both single- and multiple-graph settings to validate the superiority of our framework over the state-of-the-art baselines.

Traditional approaches, such as those currently used for deep brain stimulation, have largely followed a trial- and-error strategy to search for effective open-loop stimulation parameters, a strategy that is inefficient and does not generalize to closed-loop activity-dependent stimulation. Approach: To achieve goal-directed closed-loop neurostimulation, we propose the use of brain co-processors, devices which exploit artificial intelligence (AI) to shape neural activity and bridge injured neural circuits for targeted repair and rehabilitation. Here we investigate a specific type of co-processor called a \"neural co-processor\" which uses artificial neural networks (ANNs) to learn optimal closed-loop stimulation policies. The co-processor adapts the stimulation policy as the biological circuit itself adapts to the stimulation, achieving a form of brain-device co-adaptation. We tested the neural co-processor's ability to restore function after stroke by simulating a variety of lesions in a previously published cortical model of grasping. Main results: Our results show that a neural co-processor can restore reaching and grasping function after a simulated stroke in a cortical model, achieving recovery towards healthy function in the range 75-90%. Significance: This is the first proof-of-concept demonstration, using computer simulations, of a neural co-processor for activity-dependent closed-loop neurosimulation for optimizing a rehabilitation goal after injury. Our results provide insights on how such co-processors may eventually be developed for in vivo use to learn complex adaptive stimulation policies for a variety of neural rehabilitation and neuroprosthetic applications.

To meet these challenges, we propose a DTI prediction model built on molecular structure of drugs and sequence of target proteins.

We target to evaluate performance of DTI prediction models using CDK descriptors.

As these devices are typically constrained by computational and energy resources, the KWS model should be designed with a small footprint. In our previous work, we developed lightweight dynamic filters which extract a robust feature map within a noisy environment. The learning variables of the dynamic filter are jointly optimized with KWS weights by using Cross-Entropy (CE) loss. CE loss alone, however, is not sufficient for high performance when the SNR is low. In order to train the network for more robust performance in noisy environments, we introduce the LOw Variant Orthogonal (LOVO) loss. The LOVO loss is composed of a triplet loss applied on the output of the dynamic filter, a spectral norm-based orthogonal loss, and an inner class distance loss applied in the KWS model. These losses are particularly useful in encouraging the network to extract discriminatory features in unseen noise environments. ",

    "abstract": "Deep neural networks are powerful tools to model observations over time with non-linear patterns. Despite the widespread use of neural networks in such settings, most theoretical developments of deep neural networks are under the assumption of independent observations, and theoretical results for temporally dependent observations are scarce. To bridge this gap, we study theoretical properties of deep neural networks on modeling non-linear time series data. Specifically, non-asymptotic bounds for prediction error of (sparse) feed-forward neural network with ReLU activation function is established under mixing-type assumptions. These assumptions are mild such that they include a wide range of time series models including auto-regressive models. Compared to independent observations, established convergence rates have additional logarithmic factors to compensate for additional complexity due to dependence among data points. The theoretical results are supported via various numerical simulation settings as well as an application to a macroeconomic data set. ",

    "abstract": "In general, traders test their trading strategies by applying them on the historical market data (backtesting), and then apply to the future trades the strategy that achieved the maximum profit on such past data. In this paper, we propose a new trading strategy, called DNN-forwardtesting, that determines the strategy to apply by testing it on the possible future predicted by a deep neural network that has been designed to perform stock price forecasts and trained with the market historical data. In order to generate such an historical dataset, we first perform an exploratory data analysis on a set of ten securities and, in particular, analize their volatility through a novel k-means-based procedure. Then, we restrict the dataset to a small number of assets with the same volatility coefficient and use such data to train a deep feed-forward neural network that forecasts the prices for the next 30 days of open stocks market. Finally, our trading system calculates the most effective technical indicator by applying it to the DNNs predictions and uses such indicator to guide its trades. The results confirm that neural networks outperform classical statistical techniques when performing such forecasts, and their predictions allow to select a trading strategy that, when applied to the real future, increases Expectancy, Sharpe, Sortino, and Calmar ratios with respect to the strategy selected through traditional backtesting.

    "abstract": "Direct policy search has been widely applied in modern reinforcement learning and continuous control. However, the theoretical properties of direct policy search on nonsmooth robust control synthesis have not been fully understood. The optimal $\\mathcal{H}_\\infty$ control framework aims at designing a policy to minimize the closed-loop $\\mathcal{H}_\\infty$ norm, and is arguably the most fundamental robust control paradigm. In this work, we show that direct policy search is guaranteed to find the global solution of the robust $\\mathcal{H}_\\infty$ state-feedback control design problem. Notice that policy search for optimal $\\mathcal{H}_\\infty$ control leads to a constrained nonconvex nonsmooth optimization problem, where the nonconvex feasible set consists of all the policies stabilizing the closed-loop dynamics. We show that for this nonsmooth optimization problem, all Clarke stationary points are global minimum. Next, we identify the coerciveness of the closed-loop $\\mathcal{H}_\\infty$ objective function, and prove that all the sublevel sets of the resultant policy search problem are compact. Based on these properties, we show that Goldstein's subgradient method and its implementable variants can be guaranteed to stay in the nonconvex feasible set and eventually find the global optimal solution of the $\\mathcal{H}_\\infty$ state-feedback synthesis problem. Our work builds a new connection between nonconvex nonsmooth optimization theory and robust control, leading to an interesting global convergence result for direct policy search on optimal $\\mathcal{H}_\\infty$ synthesis.

    "abstract": "Neural transducers have gained popularity in production ASR systems, achieving human level recognition accuracy on standard benchmark datasets. However, their performance significantly degrades in the presence of crosstalks, especially when the background speech/noise is non-negligible as compared to the primary speech (i.e. low signal-to-noise ratio). Anchored speech recognition refers to a class of methods that use information from an anchor segment (e.g., wake-words) to recognize device-directed speech while ignoring interfering background speech/noise. In this paper, we investigate anchored speech recognition in the context of neural transducers. We use a tiny auxiliary network to extract context information from the anchor segment, and explore encoder biasing and joiner gating to guide the transducer towards the target speech. Moreover, to improve the robustness of context embedding extraction, we propose auxiliary training objectives to disentagle lexical content from speaking style. Our proposed methods are evaluated on synthetic LibriSpeech-based mixtures, where they improve word error rates by up to 36% compared to a background augmentation baseline. ",

The most prominent example are Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), while normalizing flows (NF) received less attention despite their potential. Building on previous work, architectural modifications are proposed, along with an investigation of different conditional input representations. Despite being a common choice in related works, Mel-spectrograms demonstrate to be inadequate for the given scenario. Alternatively, a novel All-Pole Gammatone filterbank (APG) with high temporal resolution is proposed. Although computational evaluation metric results would suggest that state-of-the-art GAN-based methods perform best, a perceptual evaluation via a listening test indicates that the presented NF approach (based on time domain and APG) performs best, especially at lower SNRs. On average, APG outputs are rated as having good quality, which is unmatched by the other methods, including GAN. ",

    "abstract": "Solving large systems of equations is a challenge for modeling natural phenomena, such as simulating subsurface flow. To avoid systems that are intractable on current computers, it is often necessary to neglect information at small scales, an approach known as coarse-graining. For many practical applications, such as flow in porous, homogenous materials, coarse-graining offers a sufficiently-accurate approximation of the solution. Unfortunately, fractured systems cannot be accurately coarse-grained, as critical network topology exists at the smallest scales, including topology that can push the network across a percolation threshold. Therefore, new techniques are necessary to accurately model important fracture systems. Quantum algorithms for solving linear systems offer a theoretically-exponential improvement over their classical counterparts, and in this work we introduce two quantum algorithms for fractured flow. The first algorithm, designed for future quantum computers which operate without error, has enormous potential, but we demonstrate that current hardware is too noisy for adequate performance. The second algorithm, designed to be noise resilient, already performs well for problems of small to medium size (order 10 to 1000 nodes), which we demonstrate experimentally and explain theoretically. We expect further improvements by leveraging quantum error mitigation and preconditioning. ",

    "abstract": "Traffic speed is central to characterizing the fluidity of the road network. Many transportation applications rely on it, such as real-time navigation, dynamic route planning, and congestion management. Rapid advances in sensing and communication techniques make traffic speed detection easier than ever. However, due to sparse deployment of static sensors or low penetration of mobile sensors, speeds detected are incomplete and far from network-wide use. In addition, sensors are prone to error or missing data due to various kinds of reasons, speeds from these sensors can become highly noisy. These drawbacks call for effective techniques to recover credible estimates from the incomplete data. In this work, we first identify the problem as a spatiotemporal kriging problem and propose a unified graph embedded tensor (SGET) learning framework featuring both low-rankness and multi-dimensional correlations for network-wide traffic speed kriging under limited observations. To be specific, three types of speed correlation including temporal continuity, temporal periodicity, and spatial proximity are carefully chosen. We then design an efficient solution algorithm via several effective numeric techniques to scale up the proposed model to network-wide kriging. By performing experiments on two public million-level traffic speed datasets, we finally draw the conclusion and find our proposed SGET achieves the state-of-the-art kriging performance even under low observation rates, while at the same time saving more than half computing time compared with baseline methods. Some insights into spatiotemporal traffic data kriging at the network level are provided as well. ",

    "abstract": "Understanding the interplay between human behavioral phenomena and infectious disease dynamics has been one of the central challenges of mathematical epidemiology. However, socio-cognitive processes critical for the initiation of desired behavioral responses during an outbreak have often been neglected or oversimplified in earlier models. Combining the microscopic Markov chain approach with the law of total probability, we herein institute a mathematical model describing the dynamic interplay between stage-based progression of awareness diffusion and endemic disease transmission in multiplex networks. We analytically derived the epidemic thresholds for both discrete-time and continuous-time versions of our model, and we numerically demonstrated the accuracy of our analytic arguments in capturing the time course and the steady-state of the coupled disease-awareness dynamics. We found that our model is exact for arbitrary unclustered multiplex networks, outperforming a widely adopted probability-tree-based method, both in the prediction of the time-evolution of a contagion and in the final epidemic size. Our findings show that informing the unaware individuals about the circulating disease will not be sufficient for the prevention of an outbreak unless the distributed information triggers strong awareness of infection risks with adequate protective measures, and that the immunity of highly-aware individuals can elevate the epidemic threshold, but only if the rate of transition from weak to strong awareness is sufficiently high. Our study thus reveals that awareness diffusion and other behavioral parameters can nontrivially interact when producing their effects on epidemiological dynamics of an infectious disease, suggesting that future public health measures should not ignore this complex behavioral interplay and its influence on contagion transmission in multilayered networked systems.

    "abstract": "Discontinuity in the delineation of peripheral bronchioles hinders the potential clinical application of automated airway segmentation models. Moreover, the deployment of such models is limited by the data heterogeneity across different centres, and pathological abnormalities also make achieving accurate robust segmentation in distal small airways difficult. Meanwhile, the diagnosis and prognosis of lung diseases often rely on evaluating structural changes in those anatomical regions. To address this gap, this paper presents a patch-scale adversarial-based refinement network that takes in preliminary segmentation along with original CT images and outputs a refined mask of the airway structure. The method is validated on three different datasets encompassing healthy cases, cases with cystic fibrosis and cases with COVID-19. The results are quantitatively evaluated by seven metrics and achieved more than a 15% rise in detected length ratio and detected branch ratio, showing promising performance compared to previously proposed models. The visual illustration also proves our refinement guided by a patch-scale discriminator and centreline objective functions is effective in detecting discontinuities and missing bronchioles. Furthermore, the generalizability of our refinement pipeline is tested on three previous models and improves their segmentation completeness significantly. ",

Singular-value estimation, in particular, is of critical importance in an array of engineering applications, such as channel estimation in communication systems, electromyography signal analysis, and image compression, to name just a few. Conventional SVD of a data matrix coincides with standard Principal-Component Analysis (PCA). The L2-norm (sum of squared values) formulation of PCA promotes peripheral data points and, thus, makes PCA sensitive against outliers. Naturally, SVD inherits this outlier sensitivity. In this work, we present a novel robust non-parametric method for SVD and singular-value estimation based on a L1-norm (sum of absolute values) formulation, which we name L1-cSVD. Accordingly, the proposed method demonstrates sturdy resistance against outliers and can facilitate more reliable data analysis and processing in a wide range of engineering applications. ",
