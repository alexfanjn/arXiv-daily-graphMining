    "title": "Practical Adversarial Attacks on Spatiotemporal Traffic Forecasting  Models",
    "abstract": "Machine learning based traffic forecasting models leverage sophisticated spatiotemporal auto-correlations to provide accurate predictions of city-wide traffic states. However, existing methods assume a reliable and unbiased forecasting environment, which is not always available in the wild. In this work, we investigate the vulnerability of spatiotemporal traffic forecasting models and propose a practical adversarial spatiotemporal attack framework. Specifically, instead of simultaneously attacking all geo-distributed data sources, an iterative gradient-guided node saliency method is proposed to identify the time-dependent set of victim nodes. Furthermore, we devise a spatiotemporal gradient descent based scheme to generate real-valued adversarial traffic states under a perturbation constraint. Meanwhile, we theoretically demonstrate the worst performance bound of adversarial traffic forecasting attacks. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets show that the proposed two-step framework achieves up to $67.8\\%$ performance degradation on various advanced spatiotemporal forecasting models. Remarkably, we also show that adversarial training with our proposed attacks can significantly improve the robustness of spatiotemporal traffic forecasting models.

    "abstract": "Developing efficient time series anomaly detection techniques is important to maintain service quality and provide early alarms. Generative neural network methods are one class of the unsupervised approaches that are achieving increasing attention in recent years. In this paper, we have proposed an unsupervised Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)-based anomaly detection framework, DEGAN. It relies solely on normal time series data as input to train a well-configured discriminator (D) into a standalone anomaly predictor. In this framework, time series data is processed by the sliding window method. Expected normal patterns in data are leveraged to develop a generator (G) capable of generating normal data patterns. Normal data is also utilized in hyperparameter tuning and D model selection steps. Validated D models are then extracted and applied to evaluate unseen (testing) time series and identify patterns that have anomalous characteristics. Kernel density estimation (KDE) is applied to data points that are likely to be anomalous to generate probability density functions on the testing time series. The segments with the highest relative probabilities are detected as anomalies. To evaluate the performance, we tested on univariate acceleration time series for five miles of a Class I railroad track. We implemented the framework to detect the real anomalous observations identified by operators. The results show that leveraging the framework with a CNN D architecture results in average best recall and precision of 80% and 86%, respectively, which demonstrates that a well-trained standalone D model has the potential to be a reliable anomaly detector. Moreover, the influence of GAN hyperparameters, GAN architectures, sliding window sizes, clustering of time series, and model validation with labeled/unlabeled data were also investigated. ",

Historical Electronic Health Records (EHR) like diagnosis codes, lab results and clinical notes have been analyzed using deep learning and have been used to predict future clinical events. In this paper, we propose an interpretable deep learning approach to analyze historical diagnosis code data from the National COVID Cohort Collective (N3C) to find the risk factors contributing to developing Long COVID. Using our deep learning approach, we are able to predict if a patient is suffering from Long COVID from a temporally ordered list of diagnosis codes up to 45 days post the first COVID positive test or diagnosis for each patient, with an accuracy of 70.48\\%. We are then able to examine the trained model using Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (GradCAM) to give each input diagnoses a score. The highest scored diagnosis were deemed to be the most important for making the correct prediction for a patient. We also propose a way to summarize these top diagnoses for each patient in our cohort and look at their temporal trends to determine which codes contribute towards a positive Long COVID diagnosis. ",

    "abstract": "A key contributor to recent progress in 3D detection from single images is monocular depth estimation. Existing methods focus on how to leverage depth explicitly, by generating pseudo-pointclouds or providing attention cues for image features. More recent works leverage depth prediction as a pretraining task and fine-tune the depth representation while training it for 3D detection. However, the adaptation is insufficient and is limited in scale by manual labels. In this work, we propose to further align depth representation with the target domain in unsupervised fashions. Our methods leverage commonly available LiDAR or RGB videos during training time to fine-tune the depth representation, which leads to improved 3D detectors. Especially when using RGB videos, we show that our two-stage training by first generating pseudo-depth labels is critical because of the inconsistency in loss distribution between the two tasks. With either type of reference data, our multi-task learning approach improves over the state of the art on both KITTI and NuScenes, while matching the test-time complexity of its single task sub-network.

    "abstract": "Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is one of the most commonly applied tests in neurology and neurosurgery. However, the utility of MRI is largely limited by its long acquisition time, which might induce many problems including patient discomfort and motion artifacts. Acquiring fewer k-space sampling is a potential solution to reducing the total scanning time. However, it can lead to severe aliasing reconstruction artifacts and thus affect the clinical diagnosis. Nowadays, deep learning has provided new insights into the sparse reconstruction of MRI. In this paper, we present a new approach to this problem that iteratively fuses the information of k-space and MRI images using novel dual Squeeze-Excitation Networks and Cross-Iteration Residual Connections. This study included 720 clinical multi-coil brain MRI cases adopted from the open-source deidentified fastMRI Dataset. 8-folder downsampling rate was applied to generate the sparse k-space. Results showed that the average reconstruction error over 120 testing cases by our proposed method was 2.28%, which outperformed the existing image-domain prediction (6.03%, p<0.001), k-space synthesis (6.12%, p<0.001), and dual-domain feature fusion (4.05%, p<0.001).

The Huber's contamination model is proposed to be used for defining the attention weights and their parameters. As a result, the attention weights are linearly depend on the learnable attention parameters which are trained by solving the standard linear or quadratic optimization problem.

    "abstract": "Learning physical systems on unstructured meshes by flat Graph neural networks (GNNs) faces the challenge of modeling the long-range interactions due to the scaling complexity w.r.t. the number of nodes, limiting the generalization under mesh refinement. On regular grids, the convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with a U-net structure can resolve this challenge by efficient stride, pooling, and upsampling operations. Nonetheless, these tools are much less developed for graph neural networks (GNNs), especially when GNNs are employed for learning large-scale mesh-based physics. The challenges arise from the highly irregular meshes and the lack of effective ways to construct the multi-level structure without losing connectivity. Inspired by the bipartite graph determination algorithm, we introduce Bi-Stride Multi-Scale Graph Neural Network (BSMS-GNN) by proposing \\textit{bi-stride} as a simple pooling strategy for building the multi-level GNN. \\textit{Bi-stride} pools nodes by striding every other BFS frontier; it 1) works robustly on any challenging mesh in the wild, 2) avoids using a mesh generator at coarser levels, 3) avoids the spatial proximity for building coarser levels, and 4) uses non-parametrized aggregating/returning instead of MLPs during pooling and unpooling.

While this mathematical definition of imperceptibility successfully captures an infinite set of additive image transformations that a model should be robust to, this is only a subset of all transformations which leave the semantic label of an image unchanged. Indeed, previous work also considered robustness to spatial attacks as well as other semantic transformations; however, designing defense methods against the composition of spatial and $\\ell_{\\infty}$ perturbations remains relatively underexplored. In the following, we improve the understanding of this seldom investigated compositional setting. We prove theoretically that no linear classifier can achieve more than trivial accuracy against a composite adversary in a simple statistical setting, illustrating its difficulty. We then investigate how state-of-the-art $\\ell_{\\infty}$ defenses can be adapted to this novel threat model and study their performance against compositional attacks. We find that our newly proposed TRADES$_{\\text{All}}$ strategy performs the strongest of all. Analyzing its logit's Lipschitz constant for RT transformations of different sizes, we find that TRADES$_{\\text{All}}$ remains stable over a wide range of RT transformations with and without $\\ell_\\infty$ perturbations.

Threat reports, published by cybersecurity vendors, contain detailed descriptions of attack Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTP) written in an unstructured text format. Extracting TTP from these reports aids cybersecurity practitioners and researchers learn and adapt to evolving attacks and in planning threat mitigation. Researchers have proposed TTP extraction methods in the literature, however, not all of these proposed methods are compared to one another or to a baseline. \\textit{The goal of this study is to aid cybersecurity researchers and practitioners choose attack technique extraction methods for monitoring and sharing threat intelligence by comparing the underlying methods from the TTP extraction studies in the literature.} In this work, we identify ten existing TTP extraction studies from the literature and implement five methods from the ten studies. We find two methods, based on Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency(TFIDF) and Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI), outperform the other three methods with a F1 score of 84\\% and 83\\%, respectively. We observe the performance of all methods in F1 score drops in the case of increasing the class labels exponentially. We also implement and evaluate an oversampling strategy to mitigate class imbalance issues. Furthermore, oversampling improves the classification performance of TTP extraction. We provide recommendations from our findings for future cybersecurity researchers, such as the construction of a benchmark dataset from a large corpus; and the selection of textual features of TTP. Our work, along with the dataset and implementation source code, can work as a baseline for cybersecurity researchers to test and compare the performance of future TTP extraction methods. ",

Using a multi-tier computing paradigm with servers deployed at the core network, gateways, and base stations to support stateful applications, we aim to optimize long-term resource reservation by jointly minimizing the usage of computing, storage, and communication resources and the cost from reconfiguring resource reservation. The coupling among different resources and the impact of UT mobility create challenges in resource management. To address the challenges, we develop digital twin (DT) empowered network planning with two elements, i.e., multi-resource reservation and resource reservation reconfiguration. First, DTs are designed for collecting UT status data, based on which UTs are grouped according to their mobility patterns. Second, an algorithm is proposed to customize resource reservation for different groups to satisfy their different resource demands. Last, a Meta-learning-based approach is developed to reconfigure resource reservation for balancing the network resource usage and the reconfiguration cost. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed DT-empowered network planning outperforms benchmark frameworks by using less resources and incurring lower reconfiguration costs. ",

Since measuring the latency of a huge set of candidate architectures during NAS is not scalable, approaches are needed for predicting end-to-end inference latency on mobile devices. Such predictions are challenging due to hardware heterogeneity, optimizations applied by ML frameworks, and the diversity of neural architectures. Motivated by these challenges, in this paper, we first quantitatively assess characteristics of neural architectures and mobile devices that have significant effects on inference latency. Based on this assessment, we propose a latency prediction framework which addresses these challenges by developing operation-wise latency predictors, under a variety of settings and a number of hardware devices, with multi-core CPUs and GPUs, achieving high accuracy in end-to-end latency prediction, as shown by our comprehensive evaluations. To illustrate that our approach does not require expensive data collection, we also show that accurate predictions can be achieved on real-world NAs using only small amounts of profiling data. ",

    "abstract": "Recently, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been applied to graph learning tasks and achieved state-of-the-art results. However, many competitive methods employ preprocessing on the target nodes, such as subgraph extraction and customized labeling, to capture some information that is hard to be learned by normal GNNs. Such operations are time-consuming and do not scale to large graphs. In this paper, we propose an efficient GNN framework called Geodesic GNN (GDGNN). It injects conditional relationships between nodes into the model without labeling. Specifically, we view the shortest paths between two nodes as the spatial graph context of the neighborhood around them. The GNN embeddings of nodes on the shortest paths are used to generate geodesic representations. Conditioned on the geodesic representations, GDGNN is able to generate node, link, and graph representations that carry much richer structural information than plain GNNs. We theoretically prove that GDGNN is more powerful than plain GNNs, and present experimental results to show that GDGNN achieves highly competitive performance with state-of-the-art GNN models on link prediction and graph classification tasks while taking significantly less time.

    "abstract": "Weight and activation binarization can efficiently compress deep neural networks and accelerate model inference, but cause severe accuracy degradation. Existing optimization methods for binary neural networks (BNNs) focus on fitting full-precision networks to reduce quantization errors, and suffer from the trade-off between accuracy and computational complexity. In contrast, considering the limited learning ability and information loss caused by the limited representational capability of BNNs, we propose IR$^2$Net to stimulate the potential of BNNs and improve the network accuracy by restricting the input information and recovering the feature information, including: 1) information restriction: for a BNN, by evaluating the learning ability on the input information, discarding some of the information it cannot focus on, and limiting the amount of input information to match its learning ability; 2) information recovery: due to the information loss in forward propagation, the output feature information of the network is not enough to support accurate classification. By selecting some shallow feature maps with richer information, and fusing them with the final feature maps to recover the feature information. In addition, the computational cost is reduced by streamlining the information recovery method to strike a better trade-off between accuracy and efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach still achieves comparable accuracy even with $ \\sim $10x floating-point operations (FLOPs) reduction for ResNet-18.

    "abstract": "Static bug detection tools help developers detect problems in the code, including bad programming practices and potential defects. However, it is known that static bug detectors remain underutilized due to various reasons. Recent advances to incorporate static bug detectors in modern software development workflows, such as in code review and continuous integration, are shown capable of better motivating developers to fix the reported warnings on the fly. Moreover, tracking the static code warnings will benefit many downstream software engineering tasks, such as learning the fix patterns for automated program repair and learning which warnings are of more interest, so they can be prioritized automatically. Hence, precisely tracking the warnings by static bug detectors is critical to improve the utilization of static bug detectors further. In this paper, we study the effectiveness of the state-of-the-art (SOA) solution in tracking the warnings by static bug detectors and propose a better solution based on our analysis of the insufficiencies of the SOA solution. In particular, we examined over 2000 commits in four large-scale open-source systems (i.e., JClouds, Kafka, Spring-boot, and Guava) and crafted a dataset of 3,452 static code warnings by two static bug detectors (i.e., Spotbugs and PMD). We manually uncover the ground-truth evolution status of the static warnings: persistent, resolved, or newly-introduced. Moreover, upon manual analysis, we identified the main reasons behind the insufficiencies of the SOA solution. Finally, we propose a better approach to improving the tracking of static warnings over software development history. Our evaluation shows that our proposed approach provides a significant improvement in terms of the precision of the tracking, i.e., from 66.9% to 90.0%. ",

With the idea of invariant causal mechanism, a lot of efforts have been put into learning robust causal effects which are determined by the object yet insensitive to the domain changes. Despite the invariance of causal effects, they are difficult to be quantified and optimized. Inspired by the ability that humans adapt to new environments by prior knowledge, We develop a novel Contrastive Causal Model (CCM) to transfer unseen images to taught knowledge which are the features of seen images, and quantify the causal effects based on taught knowledge. Considering the transfer is affected by domain shifts in DG, we propose a more inclusive causal graph to describe DG task. Based on this causal graph, CCM controls the domain factor to cut off excess causal paths and uses the remaining part to calculate the causal effects of images to labels via the front-door criterion. Specifically, CCM is composed of three components: (i) domain-conditioned supervised learning which teaches CCM the correlation between images and labels, (ii) causal effect learning which helps CCM measure the true causal effects of images to labels, (iii) contrastive similarity learning which clusters the features of images that belong to the same class and provides the quantification of similarity. Finally, we test the performance of CCM on multiple datasets including PACS, OfficeHome, and TerraIncognita. The extensive experiments demonstrate that CCM surpasses the previous DG methods with clear margins. ",

    "abstract": "Edge caching plays an increasingly important role in boosting user content retrieval performance while reducing redundant network traffic. The effectiveness of caching ultimately hinges on the accuracy of predicting content popularity in the near future. However, at the network edge, content popularity can be extremely dynamic due to diverse user content retrieval behaviors and the low-degree of user multiplexing. It's challenging for the traditional reactive caching systems to keep up with the dynamic content popularity patterns. In this paper, we propose a novel Predictive Edge Caching (PEC) system that predicts the future content popularity using fine-grained learning models that mine sequential patterns in user content retrieval behaviors, and opportunistically prefetches contents predicted to be popular in the near future using idle network bandwidth. Through extensive experiments driven by real content retrieval traces, we demonstrate that PEC can adapt to highly dynamic content popularity, and significantly improve cache hit ratio and reduce user content retrieval latency over the state-of-art caching policies. More broadly, our study demonstrates that edge caching performance can be boosted by deep mining of user content retrieval behaviors. ",

In order to guarantee the enforcement of a consistent policy, moderators are provided with detailed guidelines. In contrast, most state-of-the-art models learn what abuse is from labelled examples and as a result base their predictions on spurious cues, such as the presence of group identifiers, which can be unreliable. In this work we introduce the concept of policy-aware abuse detection, abandoning the unrealistic expectation that systems can reliably learn which phenomena constitute abuse from inspecting the data alone. We propose a machine-friendly representation of the policy that moderators wish to enforce, by breaking it down into a collection of intents and slots. We collect and annotate a dataset of 3,535 English posts with such slots, and show how architectures for intent classification and slot filling can be used for abuse detection, while providing a rationale for model decisions.

    "abstract": "In this paper, a network comprising wireless devices equipped with buffers transmitting deadline-constrained data packets over a slotted-ALOHA random-access channel is studied. Although communication protocols facilitating retransmissions increase reliability, packet transmission from the queue experiences delays and thus, packets with time constraints might be dropped before being successfully transmitted, while at the same time causing the queue size of the buffer to increase. Towards understanding the trade-off between reliability and delays that might lead to packet drops due to the deadline-constrained bursty traffic with retransmissions, a scenario of a wireless network utilizing a slotted-ALOHA random-access channel is investigated. The main focus is to reveal and investigate further the trade-off between the number of retransmissions and the packet deadline as a function of the arrival rate. Hence, we are able to determine numerically the optimal probability of transmissions and number of retransmissions, given the packet arrival rate and the packet deadline. The analysis of the system was done by means of discrete-time Markov chains. Two scenarios are studied: i) the collision channel model (in which a receiver can decode only when a single packet is transmitted), and ii) the case for which receivers have multi-packet reception capabilities. A performance evaluation for a user with different transmit probability and number of retransmissions is conducted, demonstrating their impact on the average drop rate and throughput, while at the same time showing that there exists a set of values, under which improved performance can be acquired.

Intrusion detection plays an important role in the security of information systems or networks devices. The purpose of an intrusion detection system (IDS) is to detect malicious activities and then generate an alarm against these activities. Having a large amount of data is one of the key problems in detecting attacks. Most of the intrusion detection systems use all features of datasets to evaluate the models and result in is, low detection rate, high computational time and uses of many computer resources. For fast attacks detection IDS needs a lightweight data. A feature selection method plays a key role to select best features to achieve maximum accuracy. This research work conduct experiments by considering on two updated attacks datasets, UNSW-NB15 and CICDDoS2019. This work suggests a wrapper based Genetic Algorithm (GA) features selection method with ensemble classifiers. GA select the best feature subsets and achieve high accuracy, detection rate (DR) and low false alarm rate (FAR) compared to existing approaches. This research focuses on multi-class classification. Implements two ensemble methods: stacking and bagging to detect different types of attacks. The results show that GA improve the accuracy significantly with stacking ensemble classifier. ",

However, the former faces generalizability challenges when testing with new robot arms or unseen objects; and the latter assumes that similar objects exist in the databases. We hypothesize that recent 3D modeling methods provides a path towards building digital replica of the evaluation scene that affords physical simulation and supports robust manipulation algorithm learning. We propose to reconstruct high-quality meshes from real-world point clouds using state-of-the-art neural surface reconstruction method (the Real2Sim step). Because most simulators take meshes for fast simulation, the reconstructed meshes enable grasp pose labels generation without human efforts. The generated labels can train grasp network that performs robustly in the real evaluation scene (the Sim2Real step). In synthetic and real experiments, we show that the Real2Sim2Real pipeline performs better than baseline grasp networks trained with a large dataset and a grasp sampling method with retrieval-based reconstruction. The benefit of the Real2Sim2Real pipeline comes from 1) decoupling scene modeling and grasp sampling into sub-problems, and 2) both sub-problems can be solved with sufficiently high quality using recent 3D learning algorithms and mesh-based physical simulation techniques.

    "abstract": "Existing pipelines of semantic correspondence commonly include extracting high-level semantic features for the invariance against intra-class variations and background clutters. This architecture, however, inevitably results in a low-resolution matching field that additionally requires an ad-hoc interpolation process as a post-processing for converting it into a high-resolution one, certainly limiting the overall performance of matching results. To overcome this, inspired by recent success of implicit neural representation, we present a novel method for semantic correspondence, called Neural Matching Field (NeMF). However, complicacy and high-dimensionality of a 4D matching field are the major hindrances, which we propose a cost embedding network to process a coarse cost volume to use as a guidance for establishing high-precision matching field through the following fully-connected network. Nevertheless, learning a high-dimensional matching field remains challenging mainly due to computational complexity, since a naive exhaustive inference would require querying from all pixels in the 4D space to infer pixel-wise correspondences. To overcome this, we propose adequate training and inference procedures, which in the training phase, we randomly sample matching candidates and in the inference phase, we iteratively performs PatchMatch-based inference and coordinate optimization at test time. With these combined, competitive results are attained on several standard benchmarks for semantic correspondence. Code and pre-trained weights are available at https://ku-cvlab.github.io/NeMF/. ",

The set-membership approach is applied to estimate the sets of uncertain parameters online and a designed model predictive control scheme with online model and control parameter adaptation is presented to guarantee safety-related constraints during the tracking process. The proposed controller can drive the wheelchair speed to a desired reference within safety constraints. For the inadmissible reference that violates the constraints, the proposed controller can steer the system to the neighbourhood of the closest admissible reference. The effectiveness of the proposed control scheme is validated based on the high-fidelity speed tracking results of two tasks that involve feasible and infeasible references. ",

Our training strategy leverages automatic differentiation and the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm. During the training, we (i) apply gradient descent to update the DNN coefficients; (ii) update the polynomial coefficients using weighted least-squares solves; and (iii) compute the variance of each cluster according to a closed-form formula derived from the EM algorithm.

We complement this by showing that for any deterministic learner there is an attack which worsens its error to at least $2\\cdot \\mathtt{OPT}$.

An appealing option to meet these requirements is the intelligent reflective surface (IRS), which guarantees a smart propagation environment by adjusting the phase shift and direction of received signals. However, the composite channel of IRS-assisted wireless networks, which is composed of a direct link and cascaded link aided by the IRS, has made it challenging to carry out system design and analysis. This motivates us to find tractable and accurate channel modeling methods to model multiple types of channels. To this end, we adopt mixture Gamma distributions to model the direct link, the cascaded link, and the mixture channel. Moreover, this channel modeling method can be applied to various transmission environments with an arbitrary type of fading as the underlying fading of each link. Additionally, a unified stochastic geometric framework is introduced based on this tractable channel model. First, we derived distributions of the cascaded link and the mixture channel by proving multipliability and quadratic form of mixture Gamma distributed channels. Then, we carried out a stochastic geometric analysis of the system performance of the IRS-assisted wireless network with the proposed channel modeling method. Our simulation shows that the mixture Gamma distributed approximation method guarantees high accuracy and promotes the feasibility of system performance analysis of IRS-assisted networks with complicated propagation environments, especially with a generalized fading model. Furthermore, the proposed analytical framework provides positive insights into the system design regarding reliability and efficiency. ",

    "title": "FedGraph: an Aggregation Method from Graph Perspective",
    "abstract": "With the increasingly strengthened data privacy act and the difficult data centralization, Federated Learning (FL) has become an effective solution to collaboratively train the model while preserving each client's privacy. FedAvg is a standard aggregation algorithm that makes the proportion of dataset size of each client as aggregation weight. However, it can't deal with non-independent and identically distributed (non-i.i.d) data well because of its fixed aggregation weights and the neglect of data distribution. In this paper, we propose an aggregation strategy that can effectively deal with non-i.i.d dataset, namely FedGraph, which can adjust the aggregation weights adaptively according to the training condition of local models in whole training process. The FedGraph takes three factors into account from coarse to fine: the proportion of each local dataset size, the topology factor of model graphs, and the model weights. We calculate the gravitational force between local models by transforming the local models into topology graphs. The FedGraph can explore the internal correlation between local models better through the weighted combination of the proportion each local dataset, topology structure, and model weights. The proposed FedGraph has been applied to the MICCAI Federated Tumor Segmentation Challenge 2021 (FeTS) datasets, and the validation results show that our method surpasses the previous state-of-the-art by 2.76 mean Dice Similarity Score.

    "abstract": "As an important part of intelligent transportation systems, traffic forecasting has attracted tremendous attention from academia and industry. Despite a lot of methods being proposed for traffic forecasting, it is still difficult to model complex spatial-temporal dependency. Temporal dependency includes short-term dependency and long-term dependency, and the latter is often overlooked. Spatial dependency can be divided into two parts: distance-based spatial dependency and hidden spatial dependency. To model complex spatial-temporal dependency, we propose a novel framework for traffic forecasting, named Spatial-Temporal Graph Convolutional Gated Recurrent Network (STGCGRN). We design an attention module to capture long-term dependency by mining periodic information in traffic data. We propose a Double Graph Convolution Gated Recurrent Unit (DGCGRU) to capture spatial dependency, which integrates graph convolutional network and GRU. The graph convolution part models distance-based spatial dependency with the distance-based predefined adjacency matrix and hidden spatial dependency with the self-adaptive adjacency matrix, respectively. Specially, we employ the multi-head mechanism to capture multiple hidden dependencies. In addition, the periodic pattern of each prediction node may be different, which is often ignored, resulting in mutual interference of periodic information among nodes when modeling spatial dependency. For this, we explore the architecture of model and improve the performance. Experiments on four datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our model. ",

    "abstract": "In this article, we aim to analyse the nature and epistemic consequences of what figures in network science as patterns of nodes and edges called 'communities'. Tracing these as multi-faceted and ambivalent, we propose to describe the concept of community as a 'vague operator' related to Susan Leigh Star's notion of the boundary object but more loose, like a collection of hints, and propose that the ability to construct different modes of faceting that are both vague and hyper-precise, in semiotic, technical and social terms is core both to digital politics and the analysis of 'communities'. Engaging with these formations in terms drawn from mathematics and software studies enables a wider mapping of their formation. Disentangling different lineages in network science then allows us to contextualise the founding account of 'community' popularised by Michelle Girvan and Mark Newman in 2002. After studying one particular community detection algorithm, the so called 'Louvain algorithm', we comment on controversies arising with some of their more ambiguous applications. We argue that 'community' can act as a real abstraction with the power to reshape social relations such as producing echo chambers in social networking sites. To rework the epistemological terms of community detection, we draw on debates and propositions in the literature of network science to imagine a 'critical heuristics' that embraces partiality, epistemic humbleness, reflexivity and artificiality.

    "abstract": "Most of the smart applications, such as smart energy metering devices, demand strong privacy preservation to strengthen data privacy. However, it is difficult to protect the privacy of the smart device data, especially on the client side. It is mainly because payment for billing is computed by the server deployed at the client's side, and it is highly challenging to prevent the leakage of client's information to unauthorised users. Various researchers have discussed this problem and have proposed different privacy preservation techniques. Conventional techniques suffer from the problem of high computational and communication overload on the client side. In addition, the performance of these techniques deteriorates due to computational complexity and their inability to handle the security of large-scale data. Due to these limitations, it becomes easy for the attackers to introduce malicious attacks on the server, posing a significant threat to data security. In this context, this proposal intends to design novel privacy preservation and secure billing framework using deep learning techniques to ensure data security in smart energy metering devices. This research aims to overcome the limitations of the existing techniques to achieve robust privacy preservation in smart devices and increase the cyber resilience of these devices. ",

This paper proposes AutoQC, an approach to automatically synthesizing quantum circuits using the neural network from input and output pairs.

    "abstract": "Despite the impressive progress of self-supervised learning (SSL), its applicability to low-compute networks has received limited attention. Reported performance has trailed behind standard supervised pre-training by a large margin, barring self-supervised learning from making an impact on models that are deployed on device. Most prior works attribute this poor performance to the capacity bottleneck of the low-compute networks and opt to bypass the problem through the use of knowledge distillation (KD). In this work, we revisit SSL for efficient neural networks, taking a closer at what are the detrimental factors causing the practical limitations, and whether they are intrinsic to the self-supervised low-compute setting. We find that, contrary to accepted knowledge, there is no intrinsic architectural bottleneck, we diagnose that the performance bottleneck is related to the model complexity vs regularization strength trade-off. In particular, we start by empirically observing that the use of local views can have a dramatic impact on the effectiveness of the SSL methods. This hints at view sampling being one of the performance bottlenecks for SSL on low-capacity networks. We hypothesize that the view sampling strategy for large neural networks, which requires matching views in very diverse spatial scales and contexts, is too demanding for low-capacity architectures. We systematize the design of the view sampling mechanism, leading to a new training methodology that consistently improves the performance across different SSL methods (e.g. MoCo-v2, SwAV, DINO), different low-size networks (e.g. MobileNetV2, ResNet18, ResNet34, ViT-Ti), and different tasks (linear probe, object detection, instance segmentation and semi-supervised learning). Our best models establish a new state-of-the-art for SSL methods on low-compute networks despite not using a KD loss term. ",

Panoptic segmentation provides an interpretation of the scene by computing a pixel-wise semantic label together with instance IDs. In this paper, we address panoptic segmentation using RGB-D data of indoor scenes. We propose a novel encoder-decoder neural network that processes RGB and depth separately through two encoders. The features of the individual encoders are progressively merged at different resolutions, such that the RGB features are enhanced using complementary depth information. We propose a novel merging approach called ResidualExcite, which reweighs each entry of the feature map according to its importance. With our double-encoder architecture, we are robust to missing cues. In particular, the same model can train and infer on RGB-D, RGB-only, and depth-only input data, without the need to train specialized models. We evaluate our method on publicly available datasets and show that our approach achieves superior results compared to other common approaches for panoptic segmentation. ",

Several research works employ adversarial training with samples generated from generative adversarial nets (GANs) to make the botnet detectors adept at recognising adversarial evasions. However, the synthetic evasions may not follow the original semantics of the input samples. This paper proposes a novel GAN model leveraged with deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to explore semantic aware samples and simultaneously harden its detection. A DRL agent is used to attack the discriminator of the GAN that acts as a botnet detector. The discriminator is trained on the crafted perturbations by the agent during the GAN training, which helps the GAN generator converge earlier than the case without DRL. We name this model RELEVAGAN, i.e. [\"relive a GAN\" or deep REinforcement Learning-based Evasion Generative Adversarial Network] because, with the help of DRL, it minimises the GAN's job by letting its generator explore the evasion samples within the semantic limits. During the GAN training, the attacks are conducted to adjust the discriminator weights for learning crafted perturbations by the agent. RELEVAGAN does not require adversarial training for the ML classifiers since it can act as an adversarial semantic-aware botnet detection model.

For the cross-modality refinement, we insert a refinement middleware structure between the encoder and the decoder, in which the RGB, depth, and RGB-D encoder features are further refined by successively using a self-modality attention refinement unit and a cross-modality weighting refinement unit. At last, with the gradually refined features, we predict the saliency map in the decoder stage.

It is challenging as statically computing precise alias information is undecidable in theory. The problem aggravates at the binary level due to the presence of compiler optimizations and the absence of symbols and types. Existing approaches either produce significant spurious dependencies due to conservative analysis or scale poorly to complex binaries. We present a new machine-learning-based approach to predict memory dependencies by exploiting the model's learned knowledge about how binary programs execute. Our approach features (i) a self-supervised procedure that pretrains a neural net to reason over binary code and its dynamic value flows through memory addresses, followed by (ii) supervised finetuning to infer the memory dependencies statically. To facilitate efficient learning, we develop dedicated neural architectures to encode the heterogeneous inputs (i.e., code, data values, and memory addresses from traces) with specific modules and fuse them with a composition learning strategy. We implement our approach in NeuDep and evaluate it on 41 popular software projects compiled by 2 compilers, 4 optimizations, and 4 obfuscation passes. We demonstrate that NeuDep is more precise (1.5x) and faster (3.5x) than the current state-of-the-art. Extensive probing studies on security-critical reverse engineering tasks suggest that NeuDep understands memory access patterns, learns function signatures, and is able to match indirect calls. All these tasks either assist or benefit from inferring memory dependencies. Notably, NeuDep also outperforms the current state-of-the-art on these tasks. ",

Therefore, we propose Causal-Enhance Module (CEM) by establishing the causal graph of MHCH based on these two variables, which is a simple yet effective module and can be easy to plug into the existing MHCH methods. For the impact of users, we use the user state to correct the prediction bias according to the causal relationship of multi-task.

However, this generation pattern lacks deterministic constraints for both appearance and motion, leading to uncontrollable and undesirable outcomes. To this end, we propose a new task called Text-driven Video Prediction (TVP). Taking the first frame and text caption as inputs, this task aims to synthesize the following frames. Specifically, appearance and motion components are provided by the image and caption separately. The key to addressing the TVP task depends on fully exploring the underlying motion information in text descriptions, thus facilitating plausible video generation. In fact, this task is intrinsically a cause-and-effect problem, as the text content directly influences the motion changes of frames. To investigate the capability of text in causal inference for progressive motion information, our TVP framework contains a Text Inference Module (TIM), producing step-wise embeddings to regulate motion inference for subsequent frames. In particular, a refinement mechanism incorporating global motion semantics guarantees coherent generation. Extensive experiments are conducted on Something-Something V2 and Single Moving MNIST datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves better results over other baselines, verifying the effectiveness of the proposed framework. ",

To achieve decentralized federated learning, blockchain-based FL was proposed as a distributed FL architecture. In decentralized FL, the chief is eliminated from the learning process as workers collaborate between each other to train the global model. Decentralized FL applications need to account for the additional delay incurred by blockchain-based FL deployments. Particularly in this setting, to detect targeted/untargeted poisoning attacks, we investigate the end-to-end learning completion latency of a realistic decentralized FL process protected against poisoning attacks. We propose a technique which consists in decoupling the monitoring phase from the detection phase in defenses against poisoning attacks in a decentralized federated learning deployment that aim at monitoring the behavior of the workers. We demonstrate that our proposed blockchain-based monitoring improved network scalability, robustness and time efficiency. The parallelization of operations results in minimized latency over the end-to-end communication, computation, and consensus delays incurred during the FL and blockchain operations. ",

    "abstract": "As a core performance metric for green communications, the conventional energy efficiency definition has successfully resolved many issues in the energy efficient wireless network design. In the past several generations of wireless communication networks, the traditional energy efficiency measure plays an important role to guide many energy saving techniques for slow varying traffic profiles. However, for the next generation wireless networks, the traditional energy efficiency fails to capture the traffic and capacity variations of wireless networks in temporal or spatial domains, which is shown to be quite popular, especially with ultra-scale multiple antennas and space-air-ground integrated network. In this paper, we present a novel energy efficiency metric named integrated relative energy efficiency (IREE), which is able to jointly measure the traffic profiles and the network capacities from the energy efficiency perspective. On top of that, the IREE based green trade-offs have been investigated and compared with the conventional energy efficient design. Moreover, we apply the IREE based green trade-offs to evaluate several candidate technologies for 6G networks, including reconfigurable intelligent surfaces and space-air-ground integrated network. Through some analytical and numerical results, we show that the proposed IREE metric is able to capture the wireless traffic and capacity mismatch property, which is significantly different from the conventional energy efficiency metric. Since the IREE oriented design or deployment strategy is able to consider the network capacity improvement and the wireless traffic matching simultaneously, it can be regarded as a useful guidance for future energy efficient network design.

    "abstract": "Joint-Embedding Self Supervised Learning (JE-SSL) has seen a rapid development, with the emergence of many method variations and few principled guidelines that would help practitioners to successfully deploy those methods. The main reason for that pitfall actually comes from JE-SSL's core principle of not employing any input reconstruction. Without any visual clue, it becomes extremely cryptic to judge the quality of a learned representation without having access to a labelled dataset. We hope to correct those limitations by providing a single -- theoretically motivated -- criterion that reflects the quality of learned JE-SSL representations: their effective rank. Albeit simple and computationally friendly, this method -- coined RankMe -- allows one to assess the performance of JE-SSL representations, even on different downstream datasets, without requiring any labels, training or parameters to tune. Through thorough empirical experiments involving hundreds of repeated training episodes, we demonstrate how RankMe can be used for hyperparameter selection with nearly no loss in final performance compared to the current selection method that involve dataset labels. We hope that RankMe will facilitate the use of JE-SSL in domains with little or no labeled data. ",

Most of the solutions are based on labeled data, created in a controlled manner and processed with supervised learning approaches. Labeling spectral data is a laborious and expensive process, being one of the main drawbacks of using supervised approaches. In this paper, we introduce self-supervised learning for exploring spectral activities using real-world, unlabeled data. We show that the proposed model achieves superior performance regarding the quality of extracted features and clustering performance. We achieve reduction of the feature vectors size by 2 orders of magnitude (from 3601 to 20), while improving performance by 2 to 2.5 times across the evaluation metrics, supported by visual assessment. Using 15 days of continuous narrowband spectrum sensing data, we found that 17% of the spectrogram slices contain no or very weak transmissions, 36% contain mostly IEEE 802.15.4, 26% contain coexisting IEEE 802.15.4 with LoRA and proprietary activity, 12% contain LoRA with variable background noise and 9% contain only dotted activity, representing LoRA and proprietary transmissions.

While deep learning models typically achieve the best results in a centralized non-secure setting, different models can excel when privacy and communication constraints are imposed. Instead, tree-based approaches such as XGBoost have attracted much attention for their high performance and ease of use; in particular, they often achieve state-of-the-art results on tabular data. Consequently, several recent works have focused on translating Gradient Boosted Decision Tree (GBDT) models like XGBoost into federated settings, via cryptographic mechanisms such as Homomorphic Encryption (HE) and Secure Multi-Party Computation (MPC). However, these do not always provide formal privacy guarantees, or consider the full range of hyperparameters and implementation settings. In this work, we implement the GBDT model under Differential Privacy (DP). We propose a general framework that captures and extends existing approaches for differentially private decision trees. Our framework of methods is tailored to the federated setting, and we show that with a careful choice of techniques it is possible to achieve very high utility while maintaining strong levels of privacy.

However, model updates can be subject to attacks and leak private information. Differential Privacy (DP) is a leading mitigation strategy which involves adding noise to clipped model updates, trading off performance for strong theoretical privacy guarantees. Previous work has shown that the threat model of DP is conservative and that the obtained guarantees may be vacuous or may not directly translate to information leakage in practice. In this paper, we aim to achieve a tighter measurement of the model exposure by considering a realistic threat model. We propose a novel method, CANIFE, that uses canaries - carefully crafted samples by a strong adversary to evaluate the empirical privacy of a training round. We apply this attack to vision models trained on CIFAR-10 and CelebA and to language models trained on Sent140 and Shakespeare. In particular, in realistic FL scenarios, we demonstrate that the empirical epsilon obtained with CANIFE is 2-7x lower than the theoretical bound. ",

In light of this, we propose a novel knowledge Graph enhanced passage reader, namely Grape, to improve the reader performance for open-domain QA. Specifically, for each pair of question and retrieved passage, we first construct a localized bipartite graph, attributed to entity embeddings extracted from the intermediate layer of the reader model. Then, a graph neural network learns relational knowledge while fusing graph and contextual representations into the hidden states of the reader model. Experiments on three open-domain QA benchmarks show Grape can improve the state-of-the-art performance by up to 2.2 exact match score with a negligible overhead increase, with the same retriever and retrieved passages.

However, we note that the pre-trained language model is good at finding low-quality instances provided that it has been fine-tuned on the target dataset. To alleviate the feature space shift and performance degeneration in existing text augmentation methods, we propose BOOSTAUG, which reconsiders the role of the language model in text augmentation and emphasizes the augmentation instance filtering rather than generation. We evaluate BOOSTAUG on both sentence-level text classification and aspect-based sentiment classification. The experimental results on seven commonly used text classification datasets show that our augmentation method obtains state-of-the-art performance. Moreover, BOOSTAUG is a flexible framework; we release the code which can help improve existing augmentation methods. ",

In this context, Neural Architecture Search (NAS) represents the most effective technique whose results rival the state of the art hand-crafted architectures. However, this approach requires a lot of computational capabilities as well as research time, which makes prohibitive its usage in many real-world scenarios. With its sequential model-based optimization strategy, Progressive Neural Architecture Search (PNAS) represents a possible step forward to face this resources issue. Despite the quality of the found network architectures, this technique is still limited in research time. A significant step in this direction has been done by Pareto-Optimal Progressive Neural Architecture Search (POPNAS), which expands PNAS with a time predictor to enable a trade-off between search time and accuracy, considering a multi-objective optimization problem. This paper proposes a new version of the Pareto-Optimal Progressive Neural Architecture Search, called POPNASv2. Our approach enhances its first version and improves its performance. We expanded the search space by adding new operators and improved the quality of both predictors to build more accurate Pareto fronts. Moreover, we introduced cell equivalence checks and enriched the search strategy with an adaptive greedy exploration step. Our efforts allow POPNASv2 to achieve PNAS-like performance with an average 4x factor search time speed-up. ",

While an ideal solution is an efficient neural surrogate that at the same time is personalized to an individual subject, the state-of-the-art is either concerned with personalizing an expensive simulation model, or learning an efficient yet generic surrogate. This paper presents a completely new concept to achieve personalized neural surrogates in a single coherent framework of meta-learning (metaPNS). Instead of learning a single neural surrogate, we pursue the process of learning a personalized neural surrogate using a small amount of context data from a subject, in a novel formulation of few-shot generative modeling underpinned by: 1) a set-conditioned neural surrogate for cardiac simulation that, conditioned on subject-specific context data, learns to generate query simulations not included in the context set, and 2) a meta-model of amortized variational inference that learns to condition the neural surrogate via simple feed-forward embedding of context data. As test time, metaPNS delivers a personalized neural surrogate by fast feed-forward embedding of a small and flexible number of data available from an individual, achieving -- for the first time -- personalization and surrogate construction for expensive simulations in one end-to-end learning framework. Synthetic and real-data experiments demonstrated that metaPNS was able to improve personalization and predictive accuracy in comparison to conventionally-optimized cardiac simulation models, at a fraction of computation.

The longitudinal speeds are then passed to a lateral MPC for lane keeping. Due to the dependence of the lateral dynamics on the longitudinal speed, they are represented in a linear parameter-varying (LPV) form, where its scheduling parameter is the longitudinal speed of the vehicle. In order to deal with the imprecise information of the future longitudinal speed (the scheduling parameter), a bound of uncertainty is considered around the nominal trajectory of the future longitudinal velocities. Then, a tube-based LPV- MPC is adopted to control the lateral dynamics for attaining the lane keeping goal.

GNN architectures that navigate this space need to avoid pathological behaviours, such as bottlenecks and oversquashing, while ideally having linear time and space complexity requirements. In this work, we propose an elegant approach based on propagating information over expander graphs. We provide an efficient method for constructing expander graphs of a given size, and use this insight to propose the EGP model. We show that EGP is able to address all of the above concerns, while requiring minimal effort to set up, and provide evidence of its empirical utility on relevant datasets and baselines in the Open Graph Benchmark. Importantly, using expander graphs as a template for message passing necessarily gives rise to negative curvature. While this appears to be counterintuitive in light of recent related work on oversquashing, we theoretically demonstrate that negatively curved edges are likely to be required to obtain scalable message passing without bottlenecks. To the best of our knowledge, this is a previously unstudied result in the context of graph representation learning, and we believe our analysis paves the way to a novel class of scalable methods to counter oversquashing in GNNs.

However, few works focus on employing it for programming language-related tasks. In this paper, we propose a Mixup-based data augmentation approach, MixCode, to enhance the source code classification task. First, we utilize multiple code refactoring methods to generate label-consistent code data. Second, the Mixup technique is employed to mix the original code and transformed code to form the new training data to train the model. We evaluate MixCode on two programming languages (JAVA and Python), two code tasks (problem classification and bug detection), four datasets (JAVA250, Python800, CodRep1, and Refactory), and 5 model architectures. Experimental results demonstrate that MixCode outperforms the standard data augmentation baseline by up to 6.24\\% accuracy improvement and 26.06\\% robustness improvement. ",

Neural operators have gained significant attention in recent years for their ability to approximate the parameter-to-solution maps defined by PDEs using as training data solutions of PDEs at a limited number of parameter samples. The computational cost of BIPs can be drastically reduced if the large number of PDE solves required for posterior characterization are replaced with evaluations of trained neural operators. However, reducing error in the resulting BIP solutions via reducing the approximation error of the neural operators in training can be challenging and unreliable. We provide an a priori error bound result that implies certain BIPs can be ill-conditioned to the approximation error of neural operators, thus leading to inaccessible accuracy requirements in training. To reliably deploy neural operators in BIPs, we consider a strategy for enhancing the performance of neural operators, which is to correct the prediction of a trained neural operator by solving a linear variational problem based on the PDE residual. We show that a trained neural operator with error correction can achieve a quadratic reduction of its approximation error, all while retaining substantial computational speedups of posterior sampling when models are governed by highly nonlinear PDEs. The strategy is applied to two numerical examples of BIPs based on a nonlinear reaction--diffusion problem and deformation of hyperelastic materials. We demonstrate that posterior representations of the two BIPs produced using trained neural operators are greatly and consistently enhanced by error correction. ",

    "abstract": "Recent studies show that graph convolutional network (GCN) often performs worse for low-degree nodes, exhibiting the so-called structural unfairness for graphs with long-tailed degree distributions prevalent in the real world. Graph contrastive learning (GCL), which marries the power of GCN and contrastive learning, has emerged as a promising self-supervised approach for learning node representations. How does GCL behave in terms of structural fairness? Surprisingly, we find that representations obtained by GCL methods are already fairer to degree bias than those learned by GCN. We theoretically show that this fairness stems from intra-community concentration and inter-community scatter properties of GCL, resulting in a much clear community structure to drive low-degree nodes away from the community boundary. Based on our theoretical analysis, we further devise a novel graph augmentation method, called GRAph contrastive learning for DEgree bias (GRADE), which applies different strategies to low- and high-degree nodes. Extensive experiments on various benchmarks and evaluation protocols validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. ",

    "abstract": "Parameter estimation and uncertainty quantification are crucial in computational cardiology, as they enable the construction of digital twins that faithfully replicate the behavior of physical patients. Robust and efficient mathematical methods must be designed to fit many model parameters starting from a few, possibly non-invasive, noisy observations. Moreover, the effective clinical translation requires short execution times and a small amount of computational resources. In the framework of Bayesian statistics, we combine Maximum a Posteriori estimation and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo to find an approximation of model parameters and their posterior distributions. To reduce the computational effort, we employ an accurate Artificial Neural Network surrogate of 3D cardiac electromechanics model coupled with a 0D cardiocirculatory model. Fast simulations and minimal memory requirements are achieved by using matrix-free methods, automatic differentiation and automatic vectorization. Furthermore, we account for the surrogate modeling error and measurement error. We perform three different in silico test cases, ranging from the ventricular function to the entire cardiovascular system, involving whole-heart mechanics, arterial and venous circulation. The proposed method is robust when high levels of signal-to-noise ratio are present in the quantities of interest in combination with a random initialization of the model parameters in suitable intervals. As a matter of fact, by employing a single central processing unit on a standard laptop and a few hours of computations, we attain small relative errors for all model parameters and we estimate posterior distributions that contain the true values inside the 90% credibility regions. With these benefits, our approach meets the requirements for clinical exploitation, while being compliant with Green Computing practices. ",

In this work, we introduce a novel, more sensitive method of characterizing semantic equivalence that leverages Abstract Meaning Representation graph structures. We develop an approach, which can be used with either gold or automatic AMR annotations, and demonstrate that our solution is in fact finer-grained than existing corpus filtering methods and more accurate at predicting strictly equivalent sentences than existing semantic similarity metrics. We suggest that our finer-grained measure of semantic equivalence could limit the workload in the task of human post-edited machine translation and in human evaluation of sentence similarity. ",

We propose to automatically induce a predicate-oriented latent graph (POLar) with a predicate-centered Gaussian mechanism, by which the nearer and informative words to the predicate will be allocated with more attention. The POLar structure is then dynamically pruned and refined so as to best fit the task need. We additionally introduce an effective dialogue-level pre-trained language model, CoDiaBERT, for better supporting multiple utterance sentences and handling the speaker coreference issue in CSRL.

We hypothesize that the large action space is a main obstacle to RL's effectiveness in MT, and conduct two sets of experiments that lend support to our hypothesis. First, we find that reducing the size of the vocabulary improves RL's effectiveness. Second, we find that effectively reducing the dimension of the action space without changing the vocabulary also yields notable improvement as evaluated by BLEU, semantic similarity, and human evaluation. Indeed, by initializing the network's final fully connected layer (that maps the network's internal dimension to the vocabulary dimension), with a layer that generalizes over similar actions, we obtain a substantial improvement in RL performance: 1.5 BLEU points on average.

Dealing with these dense and/or non-uniform distributions can be intractable, since fog's attenuation and airlight (or veiling effect) significantly weaken the background scene information in the input image. To address this problem, we introduce a structure-representation network with uncertainty feedback learning. Specifically, we extract the feature representations from a pre-trained Vision Transformer (DINO-ViT) module to recover the background information. To guide our network to focus on non-uniform fog areas, and then remove the fog accordingly, we introduce the uncertainty feedback learning, which produces the uncertainty maps, that have higher uncertainty in denser fog regions, and can be regarded as an attention map that represents fog's density and uneven distribution. Based on the uncertainty map, our feedback network refines our defogged output iteratively. Moreover, to handle the intractability of estimating the atmospheric light colors, we exploit the grayscale version of our input image, since it is less affected by varying light colors that are possibly present in the input image. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method both quantitatively and qualitatively compared to the state-of-the-art methods in handling dense and non-uniform fog or smoke. ",

We train two transformer models on InferES (8,055 gold examples) in a variety of scenarios. Our best model obtains 72.8% accuracy, leaving a lot of room for improvement. The \"hypothesis-only\" baseline performs only 2%-5% higher than majority, indicating much fewer annotation artifacts than prior work.

The optimization objective driving weight decay is a sum of losses plus a term proportional to the sum of squared weights. This paper argues that stochastic gradient descent (SGD) may be an inefficient algorithm for this objective. For neural networks with ReLU activations, solutions to the weight decay objective are equivalent to those of a different objective in which the regularization term is instead a sum of products of $\\ell_2$ (not squared) norms of the input and output weights associated each ReLU. This alternative (and effectively equivalent) regularization suggests a novel proximal gradient algorithm for network training. Theory and experiments support the new training approach, showing that it can converge much faster to the sparse solutions it shares with standard weight decay training. ",

Only few works on automated text-based deception detection have exploited the potential of deep learning approaches.

However, recent advancements have made it possible to explain some aspects of such models. This paper proposes and evaluates six deep-learning models, including combinations of BERT (and RoBERTa), MultiHead Attention, co-attentions, and transformers. To understand how the models reach their decisions, we then examine the model's predictions with LIME. We then zoom in on vocabulary uniqueness and the correlation of LIWC categories with the outcome class (truthful vs deceptive). The findings suggest that our transformer-based models can enhance automated deception detection performances (+2.11% in accuracy) and show significant differences pertinent to the usage of LIWC features in truthful and deceptive statements.

To this end, a fully-connected supra-graph connecting any two variables at any two timestamps is adaptively learned to capture the high-resolution variable dependencies via an efficient graph convolutional network. Specifically, we construct the Edge-Varying Fourier Graph Networks (EV-FGN) equipped with Fourier Graph Shift Operator (FGSO) which efficiently performs graph convolution in the frequency domain. As a result, a high-efficiency scale-free parameter learning scheme is derived for MTS analysis and forecasting according to the convolution theorem.

All images are annotated with ground truth values and a test set is annotated with human uncertainty judgments. We use this dataset to characterize human uncertainty in vision tasks and evaluate existing visual event classification models. Experimental results suggest that existing vision models are not sufficiently equipped to provide meaningful outputs for ambiguous images and that datasets of this nature can be used to assess and improve such models through model training and direct evaluation of model calibration.

    "abstract": "Localizing anatomical landmarks are important tasks in medical image analysis. However, the landmarks to be localized often lack prominent visual features. Their locations are elusive and easily confused with the background, and thus precise localization highly depends on the context formed by their surrounding areas. In addition, the required precision is usually higher than segmentation and object detection tasks. Therefore, localization has its unique challenges different from segmentation or detection. In this paper, we propose a zoom-in attentive network (ZIAN) for anatomical landmark localization in ocular images. First, a coarse-to-fine, or \"zoom-in\" strategy is utilized to learn the contextualized features in different scales. Then, an attentive fusion module is adopted to aggregate multi-scale features, which consists of 1) a co-attention network with a multiple regions-of-interest (ROIs) scheme that learns complementary features from the multiple ROIs, 2) an attention-based fusion module which integrates the multi-ROIs features and non-ROI features. We evaluated ZIAN on two open challenge tasks, i.e., the fovea localization in fundus images and scleral spur localization in AS-OCT images. Experiments show that ZIAN achieves promising performances and outperforms state-of-the-art localization methods.

Moreover, these methods are so complicated that one cannot formally verify their results without resource-demanding simulations. Thus, we use support vector machines to train a model which can predict the convergence of a swarm based on the data of previous coordination of that swarm. Given a fixed parity, i.e., the rotation direction of the outer arm of an astrobot, corresponding to a swarm, our algorithm reaches a better predictive performance compared to the state of the art. Additionally, we revise our algorithm to solve a more generalized convergence prediction problem according to which the parities of astrobots may differ.

In this paper, we investigate the algebraic, geometric, and topological properties of grid cells using recurrent network models. Algebraically, we study the Lie group and Lie algebra of the recurrent transformation as a representation of self-motion. Geometrically, we study the conformal isometry of the Lie group representation of the recurrent network where the local displacement of the vector in the neural space is proportional to the local displacement of the agent in the 2D physical space. We then focus on a simple non-linear recurrent model that underlies the continuous attractor neural networks of grid cells.

Deep learning methods have emerged as a promising way to learn antibody property predictors, but predicting antibody properties and target-specific activities depends critically on the choice of antibody representations and data linking sequences to properties is often limited. Existing works have not yet investigated the value, limitations and opportunities of these methods in application to antibody-based drug discovery. In this paper, we present results on a novel SARS-CoV-2 antibody binding dataset and an additional benchmark dataset. We compare three classes of models: conventional statistical sequence models, supervised learning on each dataset independently, and fine-tuning an antibody specific pre-trained language model. Experimental results suggest that self-supervised pretraining of feature representation consistently offers significant improvement in over previous approaches. We also investigate the impact of data size on the model performance, and discuss challenges and opportunities that the machine learning community can address to advance in silico engineering and design of therapeutic antibodies.

    "abstract": "Purpose The main purpose in this study is to propose a pipeline for COVID-19 detection from a big and challenging database of Computed Tomography (CT) images. The proposed pipeline includes a segmentation part, a region of interest extraction part, and a classifier part. Methods The methodology used in the segmentation part is traditional segmentation methods as well as UNet based segmentation. In the classification part a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) was used to take the final diagnosis decisions. Results In the segmentation part, the proposed segmentation methods show high dice scores on a publicly vailable dataset. In the classification part, the results show high accuracy on the validation partition of COV19-CT-DB dataset as well as higher precision, recall, and macro F1 score. The classification results were compared to our previous works other studies as well as on the same dataset. Conclusions The improved work in this paper proposes efficient pipeline with a potential of having clinical usage for COVID-19 detection and diagnosis via CT images.

    "title": "Synergistic information supports modality integration and flexible  learning in neural networks solving multiple tasks",
    "abstract": "Striking progress has recently been made in understanding human cognition by analyzing how its neuronal underpinnings are engaged in different modes of information processing. Specifically, neural information can be decomposed into synergistic, redundant, and unique features, with synergistic components being particularly aligned with complex cognition. However, two fundamental questions remain unanswered: (a) precisely how and why a cognitive system can become highly synergistic; and (b) how these informational states map onto artificial neural networks in various learning modes. To address these questions, here we employ an information-decomposition framework to investigate the information processing strategies adopted by simple artificial neural networks performing a variety of cognitive tasks in both supervised and reinforcement learning settings. Our results show that synergy increases as neural networks learn multiple diverse tasks. Furthermore, performance in tasks requiring integration of multiple information sources critically relies on synergistic neurons. Finally, randomly turning off neurons during training through dropout increases network redundancy, corresponding to an increase in robustness. Overall, our results suggest that while redundant information is required for robustness to perturbations in the learning process, synergistic information is used to combine information from multiple modalities -- and more generally for flexible and efficient learning. These findings open the door to new ways of investigating how and why learning systems employ specific information-processing strategies, and support the principle that the capacity for general-purpose learning critically relies in the system's information dynamics.

    "abstract": "Conventional frequentist learning is known to yield poorly calibrated models that fail to reliably quantify the uncertainty of their decisions. Bayesian learning can improve calibration, but formal guarantees apply only under restrictive assumptions about correct model specification. Conformal prediction (CP) offers a general framework for the design of set predictors with calibration guarantees that hold regardless of the underlying data generation mechanism. However, when training data are limited, CP tends to produce large, and hence uninformative, predicted sets. This paper introduces a novel meta-learning solution that aims at reducing the set prediction size. Unlike prior work, the proposed meta-learning scheme, referred to as meta-XB, (i) builds on cross-validation-based CP, rather than the less efficient validation-based CP; and (ii) preserves formal per-task calibration guarantees, rather than less stringent task-marginal guarantees. Finally, meta-XB is extended to adaptive non-conformal scores, which are shown empirically to further enhance marginal per-input calibration. ",
