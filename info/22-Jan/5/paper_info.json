    "title": "Multivariate Time Series Regression with Graph Neural Networks",
    "abstract": "Machine learning, with its advances in Deep Learning has shown great potential in analysing time series in the past. However, in many scenarios, additional information is available that can potentially improve predictions, by incorporating it into the learning methods. This is crucial for data that arises from e.g., sensor networks that contain information about sensor locations. Then, such spatial information can be exploited by modeling it via graph structures, along with the sequential (time) information. Recent advances in adapting Deep Learning to graphs have shown promising potential in various graph-related tasks. However, these methods have not been adapted for time series related tasks to a great extent. Specifically, most attempts have essentially consolidated around Spatial-Temporal Graph Neural Networks for time series forecasting with small sequence lengths. Generally, these architectures are not suited for regression or classification tasks that contain large sequences of data. Therefore, in this work, we propose an architecture capable of processing these long sequences in a multivariate time series regression task, using the benefits of Graph Neural Networks to improve predictions. Our model is tested on two seismic datasets that contain earthquake waveforms, where the goal is to predict intensity measurements of ground shaking at a set of stations. Our findings demonstrate promising results of our approach, which are discussed in depth with an additional ablation study. ",

    "abstract": "We address the problem of monitoring a set of binary stochastic processes and generating an alert when the number of anomalies among them exceeds a threshold. For this, the decision-maker selects and probes a subset of the processes to obtain noisy estimates of their states (normal or anomalous). Based on the received observations, the decisionmaker first determines whether to declare that the number of anomalies has exceeded the threshold or to continue taking observations. When the decision is to continue, it then decides whether to collect observations at the next time instant or defer it to a later time. If it chooses to collect observations, it further determines the subset of processes to be probed. To devise this three-step sequential decision-making process, we use a Bayesian formulation wherein we learn the posterior probability on the states of the processes. Using the posterior probability, we construct a Markov decision process and solve it using deep actor-critic reinforcement learning. Via numerical experiments, we demonstrate the superior performance of our algorithm compared to the traditional model-based algorithms. ",

    "abstract": "In this research, an attention-based depthwise separable neural network with Bayesian optimization (ADSNN-BO) is proposed to detect and classify rice disease from rice leaf images. Rice diseases frequently result in 20 to 40 \\% corp production loss in yield and is highly related to the global economy. Rapid disease identification is critical to plan treatment promptly and reduce the corp losses. Rice disease diagnosis is still mainly performed manually. To achieve AI assisted rapid and accurate disease detection, we proposed the ADSNN-BO model based on MobileNet structure and augmented attention mechanism. Moreover, Bayesian optimization method is applied to tune hyper-parameters of the model. Cross-validated classification experiments are conducted based on a public rice disease dataset with four categories in total. The experimental results demonstrate that our mobile compatible ADSNN-BO model achieves a test accuracy of 94.65\\%, which outperforms all of the state-of-the-art models tested. To check the interpretability of our proposed model, feature analysis including activation map and filters visualization approach are also conducted. Results show that our proposed attention-based mechanism can more effectively guide the ADSNN-BO model to learn informative features. The outcome of this research will promote the implementation of artificial intelligence for fast plant disease diagnosis and control in the agricultural field. ",

    "abstract": "This paper deals with the following important research question. Traditionally, the neural network employs non-linear activation functions concatenated with linear operators to approximate a given physical phenomenon. They \"fill the space\" with the concatenations of the activation functions and linear operators and adjust their coefficients to approximate the physical phenomena. We claim that it is better to \"fill the space\" with linear combinations of smooth higher-order B-splines base functions as employed by isogeometric analysis and utilize the neural networks to adjust the coefficients of linear combinations. In other words, the possibilities of using neural networks for approximating the B-spline base functions' coefficients and by approximating the solution directly are evaluated. Solving differential equations with neural networks has been proposed by Maziar Raissi et al. in 2017 by introducing Physics-informed Neural Networks (PINN), which naturally encode underlying physical laws as prior information. Approximation of coefficients using a function as an input leverages the well-known capability of neural networks being universal function approximators. In essence, in the PINN approach the network approximates the value of the given field at a given point. We present an alternative approach, where the physcial quantity is approximated as a linear combination of smooth B-spline basis functions, and the neural network approximates the coefficients of B-splines. This research compares results from the DNN approximating the coefficients of the linear combination of B-spline basis functions, with the DNN approximating the solution directly. We show that our approach is cheaper and more accurate when approximating smooth physical fields. ",

The multifaceted nature of hate speech and its real-world impact have already piqued the interest of the data mining and machine learning communities. Despite our best efforts, hate speech remains an evasive issue for researchers and practitioners alike.

In client devices, a large number of texts containing personal information are produced by users every day. As the direct application of information from users is likely to invade personal privacy, many methods have been proposed in Federated Learning to block the center model from the raw information in client devices. In this paper, we try to do this more linguistically via distorting the text while preserving the semantics. In practice, we leverage a recently proposed metric, Neighboring Distribution Divergence, to evaluate the semantic preservation during the distortion. Based on the metric, we propose two frameworks for semantics-preserved distortion, a generative one and a substitutive one. Due to the lack of privacy-related tasks in the current Natural Language Processing field, we conduct experiments on named entity recognition and constituency parsing. Results from our experiments show the plausibility and efficiency of our distortion as a method for personal privacy protection. ",

We show that SubMix limits the leakage of information that is unique to any individual user in the private corpus via a relaxation of group differentially private prediction. Importantly, SubMix admits a tight, data-dependent privacy accounting mechanism, which allows it to thwart existing data-extraction attacks while maintaining the utility of the language model.

    "abstract": "While describing Spatio-temporal events in natural language, video captioning models mostly rely on the encoder's latent visual representation. Recent progress on the encoder-decoder model attends encoder features mainly in linear interaction with the decoder. However, growing model complexity for visual data encourages more explicit feature interaction for fine-grained information, which is currently absent in the video captioning domain. Moreover, feature aggregations methods have been used to unveil richer visual representation, either by the concatenation or using a linear layer. Though feature sets for a video semantically overlap to some extent, these approaches result in objective mismatch and feature redundancy. In addition, diversity in captions is a fundamental component of expressing one event from several meaningful perspectives, currently missing in the temporal, i.e., video captioning domain. To this end, we propose Variational Stacked Local Attention Network (VSLAN), which exploits low-rank bilinear pooling for self-attentive feature interaction and stacking multiple video feature streams in a discount fashion. Each feature stack's learned attributes contribute to our proposed diversity encoding module, followed by the decoding query stage to facilitate end-to-end diverse and natural captions without any explicit supervision on attributes. We evaluate VSLAN on MSVD and MSR-VTT datasets in terms of syntax and diversity. The CIDEr score of VSLAN outperforms current off-the-shelf methods by $7.8\\%$ on MSVD and $4.5\\%$ on MSR-VTT, respectively. On the same datasets, VSLAN achieves competitive results in caption diversity metrics. ",

Most existing approaches focus on single-domain fake news detection (SFND), which leads to unsatisfying performance when these methods are applied to multi-domain fake news detection. As an emerging field, multi-domain fake news detection (MFND) is increasingly attracting attention. However, data distributions, such as word frequency and propagation patterns, vary from domain to domain, namely domain shift. Facing the challenge of serious domain shift, existing fake news detection techniques perform poorly for multi-domain scenarios. Therefore, it is demanding to design a specialized model for MFND. In this paper, we first design a benchmark of fake news dataset for MFND with domain label annotated, namely Weibo21, which consists of 4,488 fake news and 4,640 real news from 9 different domains. We further propose an effective Multi-domain Fake News Detection Model (MDFEND) by utilizing a domain gate to aggregate multiple representations extracted by a mixture of experts. The experiments show that MDFEND can significantly improve the performance of multi-domain fake news detection. Our dataset and code are available at https://github.com/kennqiang/MDFEND-Weibo21. ",

To resolve their limitations, we design a novel local-global interactive graph, which marries their advantages by stitching the two graphs via interactive edges. To model this local-global interactive graph, we propose a novel neural network termed DigNet, whose core module is the stacked local-global interactive (LGI) layers performing two processes: intra-graph message passing and cross-graph message passing. In this way, the local syntactic and global relational information can be reconciled as a whole in understanding the aspect-level sentiment.

Along this line, we propose Multi-Representation Adaptation which can dramatically improve the classification accuracy for cross-domain image classification and specially aims to align the distributions of multiple representations extracted by a hybrid structure named Inception Adaptation Module (IAM). Based on this, we present Multi-Representation Adaptation Network (MRAN) to accomplish the cross-domain image classification task via multi-representation alignment which can capture the information from different aspects. In addition, we extend Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) to compute the adaptation loss. Our approach can be easily implemented by extending most feed-forward models with IAM, and the network can be trained efficiently via back-propagation.

    "abstract": "With the explosive growth of the e-commerce industry, detecting online transaction fraud in real-world applications has become increasingly important to the development of e-commerce platforms. The sequential behavior history of users provides useful information in differentiating fraudulent payments from regular ones. Recently, some approaches have been proposed to solve this sequence-based fraud detection problem. However, these methods usually suffer from two problems: the prediction results are difficult to explain and the exploitation of the internal information of behaviors is insufficient. To tackle the above two problems, we propose a Hierarchical Explainable Network (HEN) to model users' behavior sequences, which could not only improve the performance of fraud detection but also make the inference process interpretable. Meanwhile, as e-commerce business expands to new domains, e.g., new countries or new markets, one major problem for modeling user behavior in fraud detection systems is the limitation of data collection, e.g., very few data/labels available. Thus, in this paper, we further propose a transfer framework to tackle the cross-domain fraud detection problem, which aims to transfer knowledge from existing domains (source domains) with enough and mature data to improve the performance in the new domain (target domain). Our proposed method is a general transfer framework that could not only be applied upon HEN but also various existing models in the Embedding & MLP paradigm. Based on 90 transfer task experiments, we also demonstrate that our transfer framework could not only contribute to the cross-domain fraud detection task with HEN, but also be universal and expandable for various existing models.

However, the sampling model in current Spike camera is so susceptible to quantization and noise that it cannot capture the texture details of objects effectively. In this work, a robust visual sampling model inspired by receptive field (RVSM) is proposed where wavelet filter generated by difference of Gaussian (DoG) and Gaussian filter are used to simulate receptive field. Using corresponding method similar to inverse wavelet transform, spike data from RVSM can be converted into images. To test the performance, we also propose a high-speed motion spike dataset (HMD) including a variety of motion scenes. By comparing reconstructed images in HMD, we find RVSM can improve the ability of capturing information of Spike camera greatly. More importantly, due to mimicking receptive field mechanism to collect regional information, RVSM can filter high intensity noise effectively and improves the problem that Spike camera is sensitive to noise largely. Besides, due to the strong generalization of sampling structure, RVSM is also suitable for other neuromorphic vision sensor. Above experiments are finished in a Spike camera simulator. ",

In this light, this work aims to combine Multiple SSL tasks (Multi-SSL) that generalizes well for all downstream tasks. Specifically, for this study, we investigate binaural sounds and image data in isolation. For binaural sounds, we propose three SSL tasks namely, spatial alignment, temporal synchronization of foreground objects and binaural audio and temporal gap prediction. We investigate several approaches of Multi-SSL and give insights into the downstream task performance on video retrieval, spatial sound super resolution, and semantic prediction on the OmniAudio dataset. Our experiments on binaural sound representations demonstrate that Multi-SSL via incremental learning (IL) of SSL tasks outperforms single SSL task models and fully supervised models in the downstream task performance. As a check of applicability on other modality, we also formulate our Multi-SSL models for image representation learning and we use the recently proposed SSL tasks, MoCov2 and DenseCL. Here, Multi-SSL surpasses recent methods such as MoCov2, DenseCL and DetCo by 2.06%, 3.27% and 1.19% on VOC07 classification and +2.83, +1.56 and +1.61 AP on COCO detection.

Adversarial detection is a fundamental work for robust DNNs-based service, which distinguishes adversarial images from benign images. Image transformation is one of the most effective approaches to detect adversarial examples. During the last few years, a variety of image transformations have been studied and discussed to design reliable adversarial detectors. In this paper, we systematically review the recent progress on adversarial detection via image transformations with a novel taxonomy. Then we conduct an extensive set of experiments to test the detection performance of image transformations towards the state-of-the-art adversarial attacks. Furthermore, we reveal that the single transformation is not capable of detecting robust adversarial examples, and propose an improved approach by combining multiple image transformations. The results show that the joint approach achieves significant improvement in detection accuracy and recall. We suggest that the joint detector is a more effective tool to detect adversarial examples.

    "abstract": "Off-the-shelf single-stage multi-person pose regression methods generally leverage the instance score (i.e., confidence of the instance localization) to indicate the pose quality for selecting the pose candidates. We consider that there are two gaps involved in existing paradigm:~1) The instance score is not well interrelated with the pose regression quality.~2) The instance feature representation, which is used for predicting the instance score, does not explicitly encode the structural pose information to predict the reasonable score that represents pose regression quality. To address the aforementioned issues, we propose to learn the pose regression quality-aware representation. Concretely, for the first gap, instead of using the previous instance confidence label (e.g., discrete {1,0} or Gaussian representation) to denote the position and confidence for person instance, we firstly introduce the Consistent Instance Representation (CIR) that unifies the pose regression quality score of instance and the confidence of background into a pixel-wise score map to calibrates the inconsistency between instance score and pose regression quality. To fill the second gap, we further present the Query Encoding Module (QEM) including the Keypoint Query Encoding (KQE) to encode the positional and semantic information for each keypoint and the Pose Query Encoding (PQE) which explicitly encodes the predicted structural pose information to better fit the Consistent Instance Representation (CIR). By using the proposed components, we significantly alleviate the above gaps. Our method outperforms previous single-stage regression-based even bottom-up methods and achieves the state-of-the-art result of 71.7 AP on MS COCO test-dev set. ",

Analog In-Memory Computing (IMC) using non-volatile memory (NVM) promises major efficiency improvements in deep neural network (DNN) inference and serves as on-chip memory storage for DNN weights. However, IMC's functional flexibility limitations and their impact on performance, energy, and area efficiency are not yet fully understood at the system level. To target practical end-to-end IoT applications, IMC arrays must be enclosed in heterogeneous programmable systems, introducing new system-level challenges which we aim at addressing in this work. We present a heterogeneous tightly-coupled clustered architecture integrating 8 RISC-V cores, an in-memory computing accelerator (IMA), and digital accelerators. We benchmark the system on a highly heterogeneous workload such as the Bottleneck layer from a MobileNetV2, showing 11.5x performance and 9.5x energy efficiency improvements, compared to highly optimized parallel execution on the cores. Furthermore, we explore the requirements for end-to-end inference of a full mobile-grade DNN (MobileNetV2) in terms of IMC array resources, by scaling up our heterogeneous architecture to a multi-array accelerator. Our results show that our solution, on the end-to-end inference of the MobileNetV2, is one order of magnitude better in terms of execution latency than existing programmable architectures and two orders of magnitude better than state-of-the-art heterogeneous solutions integrating in-memory computing analog cores.

    "abstract": "Capturing and simulating intelligent adaptive behaviours within spatially explicit individual-based models remains an ongoing challenge for researchers. While an ever-increasing abundance of real-world behavioural data are collected, few approaches exist that can quantify and formalise key individual behaviours and how they change over space and time. Consequently, commonly used agent decision-making frameworks, such as event-condition-action rules, are often required to focus only on a narrow range of behaviours. We argue that these behavioural frameworks often do not reflect real-world scenarios and fail to capture how behaviours can develop in response to stimuli. There has been an increased interest in Machine Learning methods and their potential to simulate intelligent adaptive behaviours in recent years. One method that is beginning to gain traction in this area is Reinforcement Learning (RL). This paper explores how RL can be applied to create emergent agent behaviours using a simple predator-prey Agent-Based Model (ABM). Running a series of simulations, we demonstrate that agents trained using the novel Proximal Policy Optimisation (PPO) algorithm behave in ways that exhibit properties of real-world intelligent adaptive behaviours, such as hiding, evading and foraging.

    "abstract": "Transfer-based adversarial example is one of the most important classes of black-box attacks. However, there is a trade-off between transferability and imperceptibility of the adversarial perturbation. Prior work in this direction often requires a fixed but large $\\ell_p$-norm perturbation budget to reach a good transfer success rate, leading to perceptible adversarial perturbations. On the other hand, most of the current unrestricted adversarial attacks that aim to generate semantic-preserving perturbations suffer from weaker transferability to the target model. In this work, we propose a geometry-aware framework to generate transferable adversarial examples with minimum changes. Analogous to model selection in statistical machine learning, we leverage a validation model to select the optimal perturbation budget for each image under both the $\\ell_{\\infty}$-norm and unrestricted threat models. Extensive experiments verify the effectiveness of our framework on balancing imperceptibility and transferability of the crafted adversarial examples. The methodology is the foundation of our entry to the CVPR'21 Security AI Challenger: Unrestricted Adversarial Attacks on ImageNet, in which we ranked 1st place out of 1,559 teams and surpassed the runner-up submissions by 4.59% and 23.91% in terms of final score and average image quality level, respectively.

Gait analysis provides a non-contact, low-cost, and efficient early screening method for depression. However, the early screening of depression based on gait analysis lacks sufficient effective sample data. In this paper, we propose a skeleton data augmentation method for assessing the risk of depression. First, we propose five techniques to augment skeleton data and apply them to depression and emotion datasets. Then, we divide augmentation methods into two types (non-noise augmentation and noise augmentation) based on the mutual information and the classification accuracy. Finally, we explore which augmentation strategies can capture the characteristics of human skeleton data more effectively. Experimental results show that the augmented training data set that retains more of the raw skeleton data properties determines the performance of the detection model. Specifically, rotation augmentation and channel mask augmentation make the depression detection accuracy reach 92.15% and 91.34%, respectively. ",

However, the offshoring of Integrated Circuit (IC) fabrication has negative sides, including threats such as Hardware Trojans (HTs) - a type of malicious logic that is not trivial to detect. One aspect of IC design that is not affected by globalization is the need for thorough verification. Verification engineers devise complex assets to make sure designs are bug-free, including assertions. This knowledge is typically not reused once verification is over. The premise of this paper is that verification assets that already exist can be turned into effective security checkers for HT detection. For this purpose, we show how assertions can be used as online monitors. To this end, we propose a security metric and an assertion selection flow that leverages Cadence JasperGold Security Path Verification (SPV). The experimental results show that our approach scales for industry-size circuits by analyzing more than 100 assertions for different Intellectual Properties (IPs) of the OpenTitan System-on-Chip (SoC).

    "abstract": "This paper focuses on inferring network structure and community structure from the dynamics of the nonlinear and complex dynamical systems, which is prominent in many fields. Many methods have been proposed to solely address these two problems, but none of them consider explicit shareable knowledge across these two tasks. Inspired by the fact that a more precise network structure may promote the accuracy of community discovery and the better communities may promote the performance of network reconstruction (NR), this paper develops an evolutionary multitasking framework to make full use of explicit shareable knowledge among these two tasks to improve their performance; we refer to this framework as EMTNRCD. In EMTNRCD, we first establish these two tasks as a multitasking NR and community detection (CD) problem where one mission is to reconstruct network structure from dynamics and the other is to discover communities from dynamics. In the process of EMTNRCD, the NR task explicitly transfers several better network structures for the CD task and the CD task explicitly transfers a better community structure to assist the NR task, which improves the reconstruction accuracy of the NR task and the community division quality of the CD task. Moreover, to transfer knowledge from the study of the NR task to the CD task, EMTNRCD models the study of CD from dynamics as the problem of finding communities in the dynamic network and then decides whether to conduct knowledge transfer across tasks. This paper also designs a test suite for multitasking NR and CD problems (MTNRCDPs) to verify the performance of EMTNRCD. The experimental results have demonstrated that joint NR with CD has a synergistic effect. ",

These data have important applications ranging from transportation planning to epidemic modeling. However, issues must be overcome to best serve these use cases: The data often represent a limited sample of the population and use of the data jeopardizes privacy. To address these issues, we present and evaluate a system for generating synthetic mobility data using a deep recurrent neural network (RNN) which is trained on real location data. The system takes a population distribution as input and generates mobility traces for a corresponding synthetic population. Related generative approaches have not solved the challenges of capturing both the patterns and variability in individuals' mobility behaviors over longer time periods, while also balancing the generation of realistic data with privacy. Our system leverages RNNs' ability to generate complex and novel sequences while retaining patterns from training data. Also, the model introduces randomness used to calibrate the variation between the synthetic and real data at the individual level. This is to both capture variability in human mobility, and protect user privacy. Location based services (LBS) data from more than 22,700 mobile devices were used in an experimental evaluation across utility and privacy metrics. We show the generated mobility data retain the characteristics of the real data, while varying from the real data at the individual level, and where this amount of variation matches the variation within the real data.

    "abstract": "Learning to optimize the area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC) performance for imbalanced data has attracted much attention in recent years. Although there have been several methods of AUC optimization, scaling up AUC optimization is still an open issue due to its pairwise learning style. Maximizing AUC in the large-scale dataset can be considered as a non-convex and expensive problem. Inspired by the characteristic of pairwise learning, the cheap AUC optimization task with a small-scale dataset sampled from the large-scale dataset is constructed to promote the AUC accuracy of the original, large-scale, and expensive AUC optimization task. This paper develops an evolutionary multitasking framework (termed EMTAUC) to make full use of information among the constructed cheap and expensive tasks to obtain higher performance. In EMTAUC, one mission is to optimize AUC from the sampled dataset, and the other is to maximize AUC from the original dataset. Moreover, due to the cheap task containing limited knowledge, a strategy for dynamically adjusting the data structure of inexpensive tasks is proposed to introduce more knowledge into the multitasking AUC optimization environment. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated on a series of binary classification datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that EMTAUC is highly competitive to single task methods and online methods.

The spatio-temporal causality demonstrates how the gradient-descent algorithm and various training data sampling techniques can influence and reshape the layout of learnt input representation and the classification boundaries in consecutive epochs. Such causality allows us to observe and analyze the whole learning process in the visible low dimensional space. Technically, we propose four spatial and temporal properties and design our visualization solution to satisfy them. These properties preserve the most important information when inverse-)projecting input samples between the visible low-dimensional and the invisible high-dimensional space, for causal analyses. Our extensive experiments show that, comparing to baseline approaches, we achieve the best visualization performance regarding the spatial/temporal properties and visualization efficiency.

    "abstract": "The phenomenon of architecture erosion can negatively impact the maintenance and evolution of software systems, and manifest in a variety of symptoms during software development. While erosion is often considered rather late, its symptoms can act as early warnings to software developers, if detected in time. In addition to static source code analysis, code reviews can be a source of detecting erosion symptoms and subsequently taking action. In this study, we investigate the erosion symptoms discussed in code reviews, as well as their trends, and the actions taken by developers. Specifically, we conducted an empirical study with the two most active Open Source Software (OSS) projects in the OpenStack community (i.e., Nova and Neutron). We manually checked 21,274 code review comments retrieved by keyword search and random selection, and identified 502 code review comments (from 472 discussion threads) that discuss erosion. Our findings show that (1) the proportion of erosion symptoms is rather low, yet notable in code reviews and the most frequently identified erosion symptoms are architectural violation, duplicate functionality, and cyclic dependency; (2) the declining trend of the identified erosion symptoms in the two OSS projects indicates that the architecture tends to stabilize over time; and (3) most code reviews that identify erosion symptoms have a positive impact on removing erosion symptoms, but a few symptoms still remain and are ignored by developers. The results suggest that (1) code review provides a practical way to reduce erosion symptoms; and (2) analyzing the trend of erosion symptoms can help get an insight about the erosion status of software systems, and subsequently avoid the potential risk of architecture erosion.

    "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are recently proposed neural network structures for the processing of graph-structured data. Due to their employed neighbor aggregation strategy, existing GNNs focus on capturing node-level information and neglect high-level information. Existing GNNs therefore suffer from representational limitations caused by the Local Permutation Invariance (LPI) problem. To overcome these limitations and enrich the features captured by GNNs, we propose a novel GNN framework, referred to as the Two-level GNN (TL-GNN). This merges subgraph-level information with node-level information. Moreover, we provide a mathematical analysis of the LPI problem which demonstrates that subgraph-level information is beneficial to overcoming the problems associated with LPI. A subgraph counting method based on the dynamic programming algorithm is also proposed, and this has time complexity is O(n^3), n is the number of nodes of a graph. Experiments show that TL-GNN outperforms existing GNNs and achieves state-of-the-art performance. ",

To achieve such skills, it is important to develop good representations of chemical reactions, or good deep learning architectures that can learn such representations automatically from the data. There is currently no universal and widely adopted method for robustly representing chemical reactions. Most existing methods suffer from one or more drawbacks, such as: (1) lacking universality; (2) lacking robustness; (3) lacking interpretability; or (4) requiring excessive manual pre-processing. Here we exploit graph-based representations of molecular structures to develop and test a hypergraph attention neural network approach to solve at once the reaction representation and property-prediction problems, alleviating the aforementioned drawbacks. We evaluate this hypergraph representation in three experiments using three independent data sets of chemical reactions. In all experiments, the hypergraph-based approach matches or outperforms other representations and their corresponding models of chemical reactions while yielding interpretable multi-level representations.

    "abstract": "Air access networks have been recognized as a significant driver of various Internet of Things (IoT) services and applications. In particular, the aerial computing network infrastructure centered on the Internet of Drones has set off a new revolution in automatic image recognition. This emerging technology relies on sharing ground truth labeled data between Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) swarms to train a high-quality automatic image recognition model. However, such an approach will bring data privacy and data availability challenges. To address these issues, we first present a Semi-supervised Federated Learning (SSFL) framework for privacy-preserving UAV image recognition. Specifically, we propose model parameters mixing strategy to improve the naive combination of FL and semi-supervised learning methods under two realistic scenarios (labels-at-client and labels-at-server), which is referred to as Federated Mixing (FedMix). Furthermore, there are significant differences in the number, features, and distribution of local data collected by UAVs using different camera modules in different environments, i.e., statistical heterogeneity. To alleviate the statistical heterogeneity problem, we propose an aggregation rule based on the frequency of the client's participation in training, namely the FedFreq aggregation rule, which can adjust the weight of the corresponding local model according to its frequency. Numerical results demonstrate that the performance of our proposed method is significantly better than those of the current baseline and is robust to different non-IID levels of client data. ",

    "abstract": "Recent work has shown the potential of the use of audio data in screening for COVID-19. However, very little exploration has been done of monitoring disease progression, especially recovery in COVID-19 through audio. Tracking disease progression characteristics and patterns of recovery could lead to tremendous insights and more timely treatment or treatment adjustment, as well as better resources management in health care systems. The primary objective of this study is to explore the potential of longitudinal audio dynamics for COVID-19 monitoring using sequential deep learning techniques, focusing on prediction of disease progression and, especially, recovery trend prediction. We analysed crowdsourced respiratory audio data from 212 individuals over 5 days to 385 days, alongside their self-reported COVID-19 test results. We first explore the benefits of capturing longitudinal dynamics of audio biomarkers for COVID-19 detection. The strong performance, yielding an AUC-ROC of 0.79, sensitivity of 0.75 and specificity of 0.70, supports the effectiveness of the approach compared to methods that do not leverage longitudinal dynamics. We further examine the predicted disease progression trajectory, which displays high consistency with the longitudinal test results with a correlation of 0.76 in the test cohort, and 0.86 in a subset of the test cohort with 12 participants who report disease recovery. Our findings suggest that monitoring COVID-19 progression via longitudinal audio data has enormous potential in the tracking of individuals' disease progression and recovery. ",

    "abstract": "Although Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have shown incredible performance in perceptive and control tasks, several trustworthy issues are still open. One of the most discussed topics is the existence of adversarial perturbations, which has opened an interesting research line on provable techniques capable of quantifying the robustness of a given input. In this regard, the Euclidean distance of the input from the classification boundary denotes a well-proved robustness assessment as the minimal affordable adversarial perturbation. Unfortunately, computing such a distance is highly complex due the non-convex nature of NNs. Despite several methods have been proposed to address this issue, to the best of our knowledge, no provable results have been presented to estimate and bound the error committed. This paper addresses this issue by proposing two lightweight strategies to find the minimal adversarial perturbation. Differently from the state-of-the-art, the proposed approach allows formulating an error estimation theory of the approximate distance with respect to the theoretical one. Finally, a substantial set of experiments is reported to evaluate the performance of the algorithms and support the theoretical findings. The obtained results show that the proposed strategies approximate the theoretical distance for samples close to the classification boundary, leading to provable robustness guarantees against any adversarial attacks.

Exploiting such issues, we implement an algebraic attack using Grobner bases, SAT solvers and Binary Decision Diagrams. Testing activities suggest that the version based on Grobner bases is the best one and it is able to attack E0 in about 2^79 seconds on an Intel i9 CPU. To the best of our knowledge, this work improves any previous attack based on a short keystream, hence fitting with Bluetooth specifications. ",

Constructing such datasets, however, is often very costly -- due to the complex nature of annotation tasks and the high level of expertise required for the interpretation of medical images (e.g., expert radiologists). To counter this limitation, we propose a method for self-supervised learning of rich image features based on contrastive learning and online feature clustering. For this purpose we leverage large training datasets of over 100,000,000 medical images of various modalities, including radiography, computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and ultrasonography. We propose to use these features to guide model training in supervised and hybrid self-supervised/supervised regime on various downstream tasks. We highlight a number of advantages of this strategy on challenging image assessment problems in radiography, CT and MR: 1) Significant increase in accuracy compared to the state-of-the-art (e.g., AUC boost of 3-7% for detection of abnormalities from chest radiography scans and hemorrhage detection on brain CT); 2) Acceleration of model convergence during training by up to 85% compared to using no pretraining (e.g., 83% when training a model for detection of brain metastases in MR scans); 3) Increase in robustness to various image augmentations, such as intensity variations, rotations or scaling reflective of data variation seen in the field.

In this paper, we extensively discuss automated graph machine approaches, covering hyper-parameter optimization (HPO) and neural architecture search (NAS) for graph machine learning.

The networks created by these connections through the thalamus, which effects neural signals in an inhibitory manner, has not been significantly studied in the literature and as such it is of interest to investigate the role of the thalamus in selective inhibition of these networks. Using a linear-threshold model for individual brain subnetworks, in this work we study both hierarchical and star-connected thalamocortical networks. Using tools from singular perturbation and switched system theory we show that selective inhibition can be achieved in such networks through a combination of feedback and feedforward control.

    "abstract": "Diagnosis and treatment management for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is guided by routine diagnostic head and neck computed tomography (CT) scans to identify tumor and lymph node features. Extracapsular extension (ECE) is a strong predictor of patients' survival outcomes with HNSCC. It is essential to detect the occurrence of ECE as it changes staging and management for the patients. Current clinical ECE detection relies on visual identification and pathologic confirmation conducted by radiologists. Machine learning (ML)-based ECE diagnosis has shown high potential in the recent years. However, manual annotation of lymph node region is a required data preprocessing step in most of the current ML-based ECE diagnosis studies. In addition, this manual annotation process is time-consuming, labor-intensive, and error-prone. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a Gradient Mapping Guided Explainable Network (GMGENet) framework to perform ECE identification automatically without requiring annotated lymph node region information. The gradient-weighted class activation mapping (Grad-CAM) technique is proposed to guide the deep learning algorithm to focus on the regions that are highly related to ECE. Informative volumes of interest (VOIs) are extracted without labeled lymph node region information. In evaluation, the proposed method is well-trained and tested using cross validation, achieving test accuracy and AUC of 90.2% and 91.1%, respectively. The presence or absence of ECE has been analyzed and correlated with gold standard histopathological findings. ",

We specify the mathematical model to high voltage electric grids where each node corresponds to a voltage phase angle associated with a bus and edges correspond to transmission lines. Edge weights are determined by the susceptance values along the transmission lines. In this application, frequency synchronization is increasingly challenged by the integration of renewable energy, yet is imperative to the grid's health and functionality. Our framework helps to alleviate this challenge by optimizing the placement of renewable generation and the susceptance values along the transmission lines. ",

Recent advances have shown that the convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures, a well-established deep learning paradigm, can be used to design a Computer Aided Diagnostic (CAD) System for breast cancer detection. However, the challenges due to stain variability and the effect of stain normalization with such deep learning frameworks are yet to be well explored. Moreover, performance analysis with arguably more efficient network models, which may be important for high throughput screening, is also not well explored.To address this challenge, we consider some contemporary CNN models for binary classification of breast histopathology images that involves (1) the data preprocessing with stain normalized images using an adaptive colour deconvolution (ACD) based color normalization algorithm to handle the stain variabilities; and (2) applying transfer learning based training of some arguably more efficient CNN models, namely Visual Geometry Group Network (VGG16), MobileNet and EfficientNet. We have validated the trained CNN networks on a publicly available BreaKHis dataset, for 200x and 400x magnified histopathology images. The experimental analysis shows that pretrained networks in most cases yield better quality results on data augmented breast histopathology images with stain normalization, than the case without stain normalization. Further, we evaluated the performance and efficiency of popular lightweight networks using stain normalized images and found that EfficientNet outperforms VGG16 and MobileNet in terms of test accuracy and F1 Score. We observed that efficiency in terms of test time is better in EfficientNet than other networks; VGG Net, MobileNet, without much drop in the classification accuracy. ",

Predicting the hosts of prokaryotic viruses helps decipher the dynamic relationship between microbes.

Despite some promising results, computational host prediction remains a challenge because of the limited known interactions and the sheer amount of sequenced phages by high-throughput sequencing technologies. The state-of-the-art methods can only achieve 43% accuracy at the species level. This work presents CHERRY, a tool formulating host prediction as link prediction in a knowledge graph.

We demonstrated the utility of CHERRY for both applications and compared its performance with the state-of-the-art methods in different scenarios. To our best knowledge, CHERRY has the highest accuracy in identifying virus-prokaryote interactions. It outperforms all the existing methods at the species level with an accuracy increase of 37%.

In general, to create extended molecular trajectories can be a computationally expensive process, for example, when running $ab-initio$ simulations. Hence, repeating such calculations to either obtain more accurate thermodynamics or to get a higher resolution in the dynamics generated by a fine-grained quantum interaction can be time- and computationally-consuming. In this work, we explore different machine learning (ML) methodologies to increase the resolution of molecular dynamics trajectories on-demand within a post-processing step. As a proof of concept, we analyse the performance of bi-directional neural networks such as neural ODEs, Hamiltonian networks, recurrent neural networks and LSTMs, as well as the uni-directional variants as a reference, for molecular dynamics simulations (here: the MD17 dataset). We have found that Bi-LSTMs are the best performing models; by utilizing the local time-symmetry of thermostated trajectories they can even learn long-range correlations and display high robustness to noisy dynamics across molecular complexity. Our models can reach accuracies of up to 10$^{-4}$ angstroms in trajectory interpolation, while faithfully reconstructing several full cycles of unseen intricate high-frequency molecular vibrations, rendering the comparison between the learned and reference trajectories indistinguishable. The results reported in this work can serve (1) as a baseline for larger systems, as well as (2) for the construction of better MD integrators. ",

    "title": "Restoring the structure: A modular analysis of ego-driven organizational  networks",
    "abstract": "Organizational network analysis (ONA) is a method for studying interactions within formal organizations. The utility of ONA has grown substantially over the years as means to analyze the relationships developed within and between teams, departments, and other organizational units. The mapping and quantifying of these relationships have been shown to provide insight into the exchange of information and resources, the building of social capital, and the spread of culture within and between organizations. However, the ethical concerns regarding personally identifiable information (PII) that exist for traditional social science research are made more pertinent in ONA, as the relational nature of the network may leave participants open to identification by organization management. To address this, we propose a method of generating a network of organizational groups (e.g. units, departments, teams) through the projection of ego-networks absent of PII. We validate this method through modular analysis of the resulting networks and compare the identified structure to a known structure of the organization. The methodology lays a foundation for performing ONA that needs only anonymous ego-centric data to identify large-scale aspects of organizational structures. ",
