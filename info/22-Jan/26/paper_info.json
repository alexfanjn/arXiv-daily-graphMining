    "abstract": "Several applications have a community structure where the nodes of the same community share similar attributes. Anomaly or outlier detection in networks is a relevant and widely studied research topic with applications in various domains. Despite a significant amount of anomaly detection frameworks, there is a dearth on the literature of methods that consider both attributed graphs and the community structure of the networks. This paper proposes a community-based anomaly detection algorithm using a spectral graph-based filter that includes the network community structure into the Laplacian matrix adopted as the basis for the Fourier transform. In addition, the choice of the cutoff frequency of the filter considers the number of communities found. In computational experiments, the proposed strategy, called SpecF, showed an outstanding performance in successfully identifying even discrete anomalies. SpecF is better than a baseline disregarding the community structure, especially for networks with a higher community overlapping. Additionally, we present a case study to validate the proposed method to study the dissemination of COVID-19 in the different districts of S\\~ao Jos\\'e dos Campos, Brazil. ",

    "abstract": "Efficiency is essential to support responsiveness w.r.t. ever-growing datasets, especially for Deep Learning (DL) systems. DL frameworks have traditionally embraced deferred execution-style DL code that supports symbolic, graph-based Deep Neural Network (DNN) computation. While scalable, such development tends to produce DL code that is error-prone, non-intuitive, and difficult to debug. Consequently, more natural, less error-prone imperative DL frameworks encouraging eager execution have emerged but at the expense of run-time performance. While hybrid approaches aim for the \"best of both worlds,\" the challenges in applying them in the real world are largely unknown. We conduct a data-driven analysis of challenges -- and resultant bugs -- involved in writing reliable yet performant imperative DL code by studying 250 open-source projects, consisting of 19.7 MLOC, along with 470 and 446 manually examined code patches and bug reports, respectively. The results indicate that hybridization: (i) is prone to API misuse, (ii) can result in performance degradation -- the opposite of its intention, and (iii) has limited application due to execution mode incompatibility. We put forth several recommendations, best practices, and anti-patterns for effectively hybridizing imperative DL code, potentially benefiting DL practitioners, API designers, tool developers, and educators.

The news is full of our life. Therefore, news headlines classification is a crucial task to connect users with the right news. The news headline classification is a kind of text classification, which can be generally divided into three mainly parts: feature extraction, classifier selection, and evaluations. In this article, we use the dataset, containing news over a period of eighteen years provided by Kaggle platform to classify news headlines. We choose TF-IDF to extract features and neural network as the classifier, while the evaluation metrics is accuracy. From the experiment result, it is obvious that our NN model has the best performance among these models in the metrics of accuracy. The higher the accuracy is, the better performance the model will gain. Our NN model owns the accuracy 0.8622, which is highest accuracy among these four models.

    "abstract": "Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are increasingly adopted by the industry to synthesize realistic images. Due to data not being centrally available, Multi-Discriminator (MD)-GANs training framework employs multiple discriminators that have direct access to the real data. Distributedly training a joint GAN model entails the risk of free-riders, i.e., participants that aim to benefit from the common model while only pretending to participate in the training process. In this paper, we conduct the first characterization study of the impact of free-riders on MD-GAN. Based on two production prototypes of MD-GAN, we find that free-riders drastically reduce the ability of MD-GANs to produce images that are indistinguishable from real data, i.e., they increase the FID score -- the standard measure to assess the quality of generated images. To mitigate the model degradation, we propose a defense strategy against free-riders in MD-GAN, termed DFG. DFG distinguishes free-riders and benign participants through periodic probing and clustering of discriminators' responses based on a reference response of free-riders, which then allows the generator to exclude the detected free-riders from the training. Furthermore, we extend our defense, termed DFG+, to enable discriminators to filter out free-riders at the variant of MD-GAN that allows peer exchanges of discriminators networks. Extensive evaluation on various scenarios of free-riders, MD-GAN architecture, and three datasets show that our defenses effectively detect free-riders. With 1 to 5 free-riders, DFG and DFG+ averagely decreases FID by 5.22% to 11.53% for CIFAR10 and 5.79% to 13.22% for CIFAR100 in comparison to an attack without defense. In a shell, the proposed DFG(+) can effectively defend against free-riders without affecting benign clients at a negligible computation overhead. ",

With the vigorous development of computer technology and the emergence of convolution depth neural network, the accuracy of prediction results has been improved.

The main innovation of this paper is the combination of RESNET network and efficient net network, which not only greatly increases the network depth, but also comprehensively changes the choice of network width and image resolution, so as to make the model performance better, but also save computing resources as much as possible. The experimental results also show that our proposed model obtains the optimal prediction results.

This strategy requires programmers to spend time reading search results that are irrelevant to their development needs. In contrast, when programmers seek information from other humans, they typically refine queries by asking and answering clarifying questions. Clarifying questions have been shown to benefit general-purpose search engines, but have not been examined in the context of code search. We present a method for generating natural-sounding clarifying questions using information extracted from function names and comments.

Recent approaches fuse Photoplethysmograph (PPG) and electrocardiographic (ECG) signals using different machine and deep learning approaches to non-invasively estimate BP; however, they fail to reconstruct the complete signal, leading to less accurate models. In this paper, we propose a cycle generative adversarial network (CycleGAN) based approach to extract a BP signal known as ambulatory blood pressure (ABP) from a clean PPG signal.

The influence of mesh parameterization upon the stiffener layout is discussed to reveal the matching issue of the combined parameterization. 3D complex surfaces represented by the triangular mesh can be dealt with even though analytical parametric equations are not available.

    "abstract": "We present a method for solving linear and nonlinear PDEs based on the variable projection (VarPro) framework and artificial neural networks (ANN). For linear PDEs, enforcing the boundary/initial value problem on the collocation points leads to a separable nonlinear least squares problem about the network coefficients. We reformulate this problem by the VarPro approach to eliminate the linear output-layer coefficients, leading to a reduced problem about the hidden-layer coefficients only. The reduced problem is solved first by the nonlinear least squares method to determine the hidden-layer coefficients, and then the output-layer coefficients are computed by the linear least squares method. For nonlinear PDEs, enforcing the boundary/initial value problem on the collocation points leads to a nonlinear least squares problem that is not separable, which precludes the VarPro strategy for such problems. To enable the VarPro approach for nonlinear PDEs, we first linearize the problem with a Newton iteration, using a particular form of linearization. The linearized system is solved by the VarPro framework together with ANNs. Upon convergence of the Newton iteration, the network coefficients provide the representation of the solution field to the original nonlinear problem. We present ample numerical examples with linear and nonlinear PDEs to demonstrate the performance of the method herein. For smooth field solutions, the errors of the current method decrease exponentially as the number of collocation points or the number of output-layer coefficients increases. We compare the current method with the ELM method from a previous work. Under identical conditions and network configurations, the current method exhibits an accuracy significantly superior to the ELM method. ",

    "abstract": "Given a union of non-linear manifolds, non-linear subspace clustering or manifold clustering aims to cluster data points based on manifold structures and also learn to parameterize each manifold as a linear subspace in a feature space. Deep neural networks have the potential to achieve this goal under highly non-linear settings given their large capacity and flexibility. We argue that achieving manifold clustering with neural networks requires two essential ingredients: a domain-specific constraint that ensures the identification of the manifolds, and a learning algorithm for embedding each manifold to a linear subspace in the feature space. This work shows that many constraints can be implemented by data augmentation. For subspace feature learning, Maximum Coding Rate Reduction (MCR$^2$) objective can be used. Putting them together yields {\\em Neural Manifold Clustering and Embedding} (NMCE), a novel method for general purpose manifold clustering, which significantly outperforms autoencoder-based deep subspace clustering. Further, on more challenging natural image datasets, NMCE can also outperform other algorithms specifically designed for clustering. Qualitatively, we demonstrate that NMCE learns a meaningful and interpretable feature space. As the formulation of NMCE is closely related to several important Self-supervised learning (SSL) methods, we believe this work can help us build a deeper understanding on SSL representation learning.

When the optimization algorithm iteratively evaluates different loading cases, the traditional numerical simulation methods used usually lead to a substantial computational cost. To effectively reduce the computational effort, data-driven approaches are used to train a surrogate model as a mapping between the prescribed external loads and various geometry. However, the existing model are trained by data-driven methods which requires intensive training samples that from numerical simulations and not really effectively solve the problem. Choosing the steady heat conduction problems as examples, this paper proposes a Physics-driven Convolutional Neural Networks (PD-CNN) method to infer the physical field solutions for random varied loading cases. After that, the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm is used to optimize the sizes and the positions of the hole masks in the prescribed design domain, and the average temperature value of the entire heat conduction field is minimized, and the goal of minimizing heat transfer is achieved.

However, guaranteeing ultra-reliable and low-latency MEC (URLL MEC) is very challenging due to uncertainties of wireless links, limited communications and computing resources, as well as dynamic network traffic. Enabling URLL MEC mandates taking into account the statistics of the end-to-end (E2E) latency and reliability across the wireless and edge computing systems. In this paper, a novel framework is proposed to optimize the reliability of MEC networks by considering the distribution of E2E service delay, encompassing over-the-air transmission and edge computing latency. The proposed framework builds on correlated variational autoencoders (VAEs) to estimate the full distribution of the E2E service delay. Using this result, a new optimization problem based on risk theory is formulated to maximize the network reliability by minimizing the Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) as a risk measure of the E2E service delay. To solve this problem, a new algorithm is developed to efficiently allocate users' processing tasks to edge computing servers across the MEC network, while considering the statistics of the E2E service delay learned by VAEs. The simulation results show that the proposed scheme outperforms several baselines that do not account for the risk analyses or statistics of the E2E service delay. ",

More specifically, our approach is to first permute the original linear system to obtain a symmetric one, and subsequently develop a desired preconditioner based on the spectral symbol of the modified matrix. Then, we show that the eigenvalues of the preconditioned matrix sequences are clustered around $\\pm 1$, which entails rapid convergence, when the minimal residual method is devised. Alternatively, when the conjugate gradient method on normal equations is used, we show that our preconditioner is effective in the sense that the eigenvalues of the preconditioned matrix sequence are clustered around the unity. An extension of our proposed preconditioned method is given for high-order backward difference time discretization schemes, which applies on a wide range of time-dependent equations. Numerical examples are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed preconditioner, which consistently outperforms an existing block circulant preconditioner discussed in the relevant literature.

    "abstract": "Link prediction aims to infer the existence of a link between two nodes in a network. Despite their wide application, the success of traditional link prediction algorithms is hindered by three major challenges -- link sparsity, node attribute noise and network dynamics -- that are faced by real-world networks. To overcome these challenges, we propose a Contextualized Self-Supervised Learning (CSSL) framework that fully exploits structural context prediction for link prediction. The proposed CSSL framework forms edge embeddings through aggregating pairs of node embeddings constructed via a transformation on node attributes, which are used to predict the link existence probability. To generate node embeddings tailored for link prediction, structural context prediction is leveraged as a self-supervised learning task to boost link prediction. Two types of structural contexts are investigated, i.e., context nodes collected from random walks vs. context subgraphs. The CSSL framework can be trained in an end-to-end manner, with the learning of node and edge embeddings supervised by link prediction and the self-supervised learning task. The proposed CSSL is a generic and flexible framework in the sense that it can handle both transductive and inductive link prediction settings, and both attributed and non-attributed networks. Extensive experiments and ablation studies on seven real-world benchmark graph datasets demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed self-supervision based link prediction algorithm over state-of-the-art baselines on different types of networks under both transductive and inductive settings. The proposed CSSL also yields competitive performance in terms of its robustness to node attribute noise and scalability over large-scale networks. ",

    "abstract": "Automatic detection of polyps is challenging because different polyps vary greatly, while the changes between polyps and their analogues are small. The state-of-the-art methods are based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs). However, they may fail due to lack of training data, resulting in high rates of missed detection and false positives (FPs). In order to solve these problems, our method combines the two-dimensional (2-D) CNN-based real-time object detector network with spatiotemporal information. Firstly, we use a 2-D detector network to detect static images and frames, and based on the detector network, we propose two feature enhancement modules-the FP Relearning Module (FPRM) to make the detector network learning more about the features of FPs for higher precision, and the Image Style Transfer Module (ISTM) to enhance the features of polyps for sensitivity improvement. In video detection, we integrate spatiotemporal information, which uses Structural Similarity (SSIM) to measure the similarity between video frames. Finally, we propose the Inter-frame Similarity Correlation Unit (ISCU) to combine the results obtained by the detector network and frame similarity to make the final decision. We verify our method on both private databases and publicly available databases. Experimental results show that these modules and units provide a performance improvement compared with the baseline method. Comparison with the state-of-the-art methods shows that the proposed method outperforms the existing ones which can meet real-time constraints. It's demonstrated that our method provides a performance improvement in sensitivity, precision and specificity, and has great potential to be applied in clinical colonoscopy. ",

Recent work has shown that neural networks can learn such symmetries directly from data using Hamiltonian Neural Networks (HNNs). But HNNs struggle when trained on datasets where energy is not conserved. In this paper, we ask whether it is possible to identify and decompose conservative and dissipative dynamics simultaneously. We propose Dissipative Hamiltonian Neural Networks (D-HNNs), which parameterize both a Hamiltonian and a Rayleigh dissipation function. Taken together, they represent an implicit Helmholtz decomposition which can separate dissipative effects such as friction from symmetries such as conservation of energy. We train our model to decompose a damped mass-spring system into its friction and inertial terms and then show that this decomposition can be used to predict dynamics for unseen friction coefficients. Then we apply our model to real world data including a large, noisy ocean current dataset where decomposing the velocity field yields useful scientific insights. ",

One of the main difficulties comes from not only how to represent such a general tree with multiple block branches (or sub-chains) related to the multiple mining pools, but also how to analyze a multi-dimensional stochastic system due to the mining competition among the multiple mining pools. In this paper, we first set up a mathematical representation for the tree with multiple block branches. Then we provide a block classification of Ethereum: Regular blocks (in the main chain), orphan blocks, uncle blocks, stale blocks, and nephew blocks, and give some key probabilities of generating the different types of blocks by applying the law of large numbers. Based on this, we further discuss the growth rate of blockchain, and the reward allocation among the multiple mining pools through applying the renewal reward theorem. Finally, we use some simulation experiments to verify our theoretical results, and show that the approximate computation approaches developed, such as the key probabilities, the long-term growth rate of blockchain, and the long-term reward allocation (rate) among the multiple mining pools, can have a faster convergence. Therefore, we provide a powerful tool for observing and understanding the influence of the selfish mining attacks on the performance of Ethereum with multiple mining pools. We believe that the methodology and results developed in this paper will shed light on the study of Ethereum with multiple mining pools, such that a series of promising research can be inspired potentially.

    "abstract": "Federated learning (FL) has attracted much attention as a privacy-preserving distributed machine learning framework, where many clients collaboratively train a machine learning model by exchanging model updates with a parameter server instead of sharing their raw data. Nevertheless, FL training suffers from slow convergence and unstable performance due to stragglers caused by the heterogeneous computational resources of clients and fluctuating communication rates. This paper proposes a coded FL framework, namely *stochastic coded federated learning* (SCFL) to mitigate the straggler issue. In the proposed framework, each client generates a privacy-preserving coded dataset by adding additive noise to the random linear combination of its local data. The server collects the coded datasets from all the clients to construct a composite dataset, which helps to compensate for the straggling effect. In the training process, the server as well as clients perform mini-batch stochastic gradient descent (SGD), and the server adds a make-up term in model aggregation to obtain unbiased gradient estimates. We characterize the privacy guarantee by the mutual information differential privacy (MI-DP) and analyze the convergence performance in federated learning. Besides, we demonstrate a privacy-performance tradeoff of the proposed SCFL method by analyzing the influence of the privacy constraint on the convergence rate. Finally, numerical experiments corroborate our analysis and show the benefits of SCFL in achieving fast convergence while preserving data privacy. ",

EMBs exhibit distinct memory characteristics, providing performance optimization opportunities for intelligent EMB partitioning and placement across a tiered memory hierarchy. Second, in modern DLRMs, EMBs function as hash tables. As a result, EMBs display interesting phenomena, such as the birthday paradox, leaving EMBs severely under-utilized. RecShard determines an optimal EMB sharding strategy for a set of EMBs based on training data distributions and model characteristics, along with the bandwidth characteristics of the underlying tiered memory hierarchy. In doing so, RecShard achieves over 6 times higher EMB training throughput on average for capacity constrained DLRMs. The throughput increase comes from improved EMB load balance by over 12 times and from the reduced access to the slower memory by over 87 times.

Attributed graph alignment is a variant of graph alignment, in which publicly available side information or attributes are exploited to assist graph alignment.

This motivates us to investigate efficient algorithms with theoretical performance guarantee. In this paper, we propose two polynomial-time algorithms that exactly recover the vertex correspondence with high probability. The feasible region of the proposed algorithms is near optimal compared to the information-theoretic limits.

    "abstract": "People detection in top-view, fish-eye images is challenging as people in fish-eye images often appear in arbitrary directions and are distorted differently. Due to this unique radial geometry, axis-aligned people detectors often work poorly on fish-eye frames. Recent works account for this variability by modifying existing anchor-based detectors or relying on complex pre/post-processing. Anchor-based methods spread a set of pre-defined bounding boxes on the input image, most of which are invalid. In addition to being inefficient, this approach could lead to a significant imbalance between the positive and negative anchor boxes. In this work, we propose ARPD, a single-stage anchor-free fully convolutional network to detect arbitrarily rotated people in fish-eye images. Our network uses keypoint estimation to find the center point of each object and regress the object's other properties directly. To capture the various orientation of people in fish-eye cameras, in addition to the center and size, ARPD also predicts the angle of each bounding box. We also propose a periodic loss function that accounts for angle periodicity and relieves the difficulty of learning small-angle oscillations. Experimental results show that our method competes favorably with state-of-the-art algorithms while running significantly faster. ",

    "abstract": "With the rapid information explosion on online social network sites (SNSs), it becomes difficult for users to seek new friends or broaden their social networks in an efficient way. Link prediction, which can effectively conquer this problem, has thus attracted wide attention. Previous methods on link prediction fail to comprehensively capture the factors leading to new link formation: 1) few models have considered the varied impacts of users' short-term and long-term interests on link prediction. Besides, they fail to jointly model the influence from social influence and \"weak links\"; 2) considering that different factors should be derived from information sources of different modalities, there is a lack of effective multi-modal framework for link prediction. In this view, we propose a novel multi-modal framework for link prediction (referred as LP-UIT) which fuses a comprehensive set of features (i.e., user information and topological features) extracted from multi-modal information (i.e., textual information, graph information, and numerical information). Specifically, we adopt graph convolutional network to process the network information to capture topological features, employ natural language processing techniques (i.e., TF-IDF and word2Vec) to model users' short-term and long-term interests, and identify social influence and \"weak links\" from numerical features. We further use an attention mechanism to model the relationship between textual and topological features. Finally, a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) is designed to combine the representations from three modalities for link prediction. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of LP-UIT over the state-of-the-art methods. ",

Many computer vision systems rely on random sampling heuristics to solve robust fitting, which do not provide optimality guarantees and error bounds. It is therefore critical to develop novel approaches that can bridge the gap between exact solutions that are costly, and fast heuristics that offer no quality assurances. In this paper, we propose a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm for robust fitting. Our core contribution is a novel robust fitting formulation that solves a sequence of integer programs and terminates with a global solution or an error bound. The combinatorial subproblems are amenable to a quantum annealer, which helps to tighten the bound efficiently. While our usage of quantum computing does not surmount the fundamental intractability of robust fitting, by providing error bounds our algorithm is a practical improvement over randomised heuristics. Moreover, our work represents a concrete application of quantum computing in computer vision. We present results obtained using an actual quantum computer (D-Wave Advantage) and via simulation.

With the development of emerging technologies (e.g., cloud computing), many wide-range time-sensitive network services emerge, such as factory automation, connected vehicles, and smart grids. Nevertheless, TAS is a Layer 2 technique for local networks, and cannot provide large-scale deterministic transmission. To tackle this problem, this paper proposes a hierarchical network containing access networks and a core network. Access networks perform TAS to aggregate time-sensitive traffic. In the core network, we exploit DIP (a well-known deterministic networking mechanism for backbone networks) to achieve long-distance deterministic transmission. Due to the differences between TAS and DIP, we design cross-domain transmission mechanisms at the edge of access networks and the core network to achieve seamless deterministic transmission. We also formulate the end-to-end scheduling to maximize the amount of accepted time-sensitive traffic. Experimental simulations show that the proposed network can achieve end-to-end deterministic transmission even in high-loaded scenarios. ",

PowerGear comprises two main components: a graph construction flow and a customized graph neural network (GNN) model. Specifically, in the graph construction flow, we introduce buffer insertion, datapath merging, graph trimming and feature annotation techniques to transform HLS designs into graph-structured data, which encode both intra-operation micro-architectures and inter-operation interconnects annotated with switching activities. Furthermore, we propose a novel power-aware heterogeneous edge-centric GNN model which effectively learns heterogeneous edge semantics and structural properties of the constructed graphs via edge-centric neighborhood aggregation, and fits the formulation of dynamic power. Compared with on-board measurement, PowerGear estimates total and dynamic power for new HLS designs with errors of 3.60% and 8.81%, respectively, which outperforms the prior arts in research and the commercial product Vivado. In addition, PowerGear demonstrates a speedup of 4x over Vivado power estimator. Finally, we present a case study in which PowerGear is exploited to facilitate design space exploration for FPGA HLS, leading to a performance gain of up to 11.2%, compared with methods using state-of-the-art predictive models.

    "abstract": "This work studies a fundamental trade-off between privacy and welfare in aggregation of privatized preferences of individuals. It presents the precise rate at which welfare decreases with increasing levels of privacy. Trade-offs in achieving privacy while maintaining accuracy or more recently in maintaining fairness have been studied so far in prior works. Social choice functions help aggregate individual preferences while differentially private mechanisms provide formal privacy guarantees to release answers of queries operating on data. However, once differential privacy inducing noise is introduced into a voting system, the deterministic social choice function used to release an aggregated choice may not be ideal anymore. It might change the power balances between the voters. It could be the case that an alternate social choice function becomes more ideal to aggregate the preferences. There could be a constraint to operate the voting system at a specific level of either privacy or influence or welfare, and one would like to know the effects on rest of the unconstrained choices. In this paper, we introduce notions of welfare and probabilistic influence of privatization mechanisms to help precisely answer such questions through the proposed results. Throughout the paper, we restrict our work to social choice functions where several voters vote for either of two candidates. We present two different ways of proving each of our results that connects privacy with welfare & probabilistic influence: i.) by using first principles from combinatorics/probability, ii.) by using Fourier analysis of Boolean functions. Finally, we analyze the accuracy of the private mechanism on various social choice functions. The results in this paper thereby help bridge two prominent fields of social choice theory and differential privacy. ",

In order to significantly reduce the requirements on data (especially time-dependent data), as well as decrease generalization error, our approach utilizes a data-driven neural network only to capture quasistatic information (instead of dynamic or time-dependent information). Subsequently, we augment our quasistatic neural network (QNN) inference with a (real-time) dynamic simulation layer. Our key insight is that the dynamic modes lost when using a QNN approximation can be captured with a quite simple (and decoupled) zero-restlength spring model, which can be integrated analytically (as opposed to numerically) and thus has no time-step stability restrictions. Additionally, we demonstrate that the spring constitutive parameters can be robustly learned from a surprisingly small amount of dynamic simulation data. Although we illustrate the efficacy of our approach by considering soft-tissue dynamics on animated human bodies, the paradigm is extensible to many different simulation frameworks. ",

We first prove the stability of linear layers for general $k$-IGN (of order $k$) based on a novel interpretation of linear equivariant layers. Building upon this result, we prove the convergence of $k$-IGN under the model of \\citet{ruiz2020graphon}, where we access the edge weight but the convergence error is measured for graphon inputs. Under the more natural (and more challenging) setting of \\citet{keriven2020convergence} where one can only access 0-1 adjacency matrix sampled according to edge probability, we first show a negative result that the convergence of any IGN is not possible. We then obtain the convergence of a subset of IGNs, denoted as IGN-small, after the edge probability estimation. We show that IGN-small still contains function class rich enough that can approximate spectral GNNs arbitrarily well.

It affects the smoothness and continuity of harmonics, hence degrades the conversion quality seriously. This paper proposes to feed harmonic signals to the SVC model in advance to enhance audio generation. We extract the sine excitation from the pitch, and filter it with a linear time-varying (LTV) filter estimated by a neural network. Both these two harmonic signals are adopted as the inputs to generate the singing waveform. In our experiments, two mainstream models, MelGAN and ParallelWaveGAN, are investigated to validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. We conduct a MOS test on clean and noisy test sets. The result shows that both signals significantly improve SVC in fidelity and timbre similarity. Besides, the case analysis further validates that this method enhances the smoothness and continuity of harmonics in the generated audio, and the filtered excitation better matches the target audio.

A graph is one of the most commonly used representations for understanding relational data.

In this study, we propose a methodology to utilize the relational properties of source code in the form of a graph to identify Just-in-Time (JIT) bug prediction in software systems during different revisions of software evolution and maintenance. We presented a method to convert the source codes of commit patches to equivalent graph representations and named it Source Code Graph (SCG). To understand and compare multiple source code graphs, we extracted several structural properties of these graphs, such as the density, number of cycles, nodes, edges, etc. We then utilized the attribute values of those SCGs to visualize and detect buggy software commits. We process more than 246K software commits from 12 subject systems in this investigation. Our investigation on these 12 open-source software projects written in C++ and Java programming languages shows that if we combine the features from SCG with conventional features used in similar studies, we will get the increased performance of Machine Learning (ML) based buggy commit detection models. We also find the increase of F1~Scores in predicting buggy and non-buggy commits statistically significant using the Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test. Since SCG-based feature values represent the style or structural properties of source code updates or changes in the software system, it suggests the importance of careful maintenance of source code style or structure for keeping a software system bug-free.

    "title": "SURDS: Self-Supervised Attention-guided Reconstruction and Dual Triplet  Loss for Writer Independent Offline Signature Verification",
    "abstract": "Offline Signature Verification (OSV) is a fundamental biometric task across various forensic, commercial and legal applications. The underlying task at hand is to carefully model fine-grained features of the signatures to distinguish between genuine and forged ones, which differ only in minute deformities. This makes OSV more challenging compared to other verification problems. In this work, we propose a two-stage deep learning framework that leverages self-supervised representation learning as well as metric learning for writer-independent OSV. First, we train an image reconstruction network using an encoder-decoder architecture that is augmented by a 2D spatial attention mechanism using signature image patches. Next, the trained encoder backbone is fine-tuned with a projector head using a supervised metric learning framework, whose objective is to optimize a novel dual triplet loss by sampling negative samples from both within the same writer class as well as from other writers. The intuition behind this is to ensure that a signature sample lies closer to its positive counterpart compared to negative samples from both intra-writer and cross-writer sets. This results in robust discriminative learning of the embedding space. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work of using self-supervised learning frameworks for OSV. The proposed two-stage framework has been evaluated on two publicly available offline signature datasets and compared with various state-of-the-art methods. It is noted that the proposed method provided promising results outperforming several existing pieces of work. ",

    "abstract": "The Symmetric Positive Definite (SPD) matrix has received wide attention as a tool for visual data representation in computer vision. Although there are many different attempts to develop effective deep architectures for data processing on the Riemannian manifold of SPD matrices, a very few solutions explicitly mine the local geometrical information in deep SPD feature representations. While CNNs have demonstrated the potential of hierarchical local pattern extraction even for SPD represented data, we argue that it is of utmost importance to ensure the preservation of local geometric information in the SPD networks. Accordingly, in this work we propose an SPD network designed with this objective in mind. In particular, we propose an architecture, referred to as MSNet, which fuses geometrical multi-scale information. We first analyse the convolution operator commonly used for mapping the local information in Euclidean deep networks from the perspective of a higher level of abstraction afforded by the Category Theory. Based on this analysis, we postulate a submanifold selection principle to guide the design of our MSNet. In particular, we use it to design a submanifold fusion block to take advantage of the rich local geometry encoded in the network layers. The experiments involving multiple visual tasks show that our algorithm outperforms most Riemannian SOTA competitors. ",

However, long-range dependencies are directly neglected in existing CNN fusion approaches, impeding balancing the entire image-level perception for complex scenario fusion. In this paper, therefore, we propose an infrared and visible image fusion algorithm based on a lightweight transformer module and adversarial learning. Inspired by the global interaction power, we use the transformer technique to learn the effective global fusion relations. In particular, shallow features extracted by CNN are interacted in the proposed transformer fusion module to refine the fusion relationship within the spatial scope and across channels simultaneously. Besides, adversarial learning is designed in the training process to improve the output discrimination via imposing competitive consistency from the inputs, reflecting the specific characteristics in infrared and visible images. The experimental performance demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed modules, with superior improvement against the state-of-the-art, generalising a novel paradigm via transformer and adversarial learning in the fusion task.

    "abstract": "The classic studies of causal emergence have revealed that in some Markovian dynamical systems, far stronger causal connections can be found on the higher-level descriptions than the lower-level of the same systems if we coarse-grain the system states in an appropriate way. However, identifying this emergent causality from the data is still a hard problem that has not been solved because the correct coarse-graining strategy can not be found easily. This paper proposes a general machine learning framework called Neural Information Squeezer to automatically extract the effective coarse-graining strategy and the macro-state dynamics, as well as identify causal emergence directly from the time series data. By decomposing a coarse-graining operation into two processes: information conversion and information dropping out, we can not only exactly control the width of the information channel, but also can derive some important properties analytically including the exact expression of the effective information of a macro-dynamics. We also show how our framework can extract the dynamics on different levels and identify causal emergence from the data on several exampled systems. ",

The substantial domain gap between image and sketch features needs to be bridged, while at the same time the side information has to be chosen tactfully. Existing literature has shown that varying the semantic side information greatly affects the performance of ZS-SBIR. To this end, we propose a novel graph transformer based zero-shot sketch-based image retrieval (GTZSR) framework for solving ZS-SBIR tasks which uses a novel graph transformer to preserve the topology of the classes in the semantic space and propagates the context-graph of the classes within the embedding features of the visual space. To bridge the domain gap between the visual features, we propose minimizing the Wasserstein distance between images and sketches in a learned domain-shared space. We also propose a novel compatibility loss that further aligns the two visual domains by bridging the domain gap of one class with respect to the domain gap of all other classes in the training set. Experimental results obtained on the extended Sketchy, TU-Berlin, and QuickDraw datasets exhibit sharp improvements over the existing state-of-the-art methods in both ZS-SBIR and generalized ZS-SBIR.

    "abstract": "This report proposes state-of-the-art research in the field of Computer Assisted Language Learning (CALL). Mispronunciation detection is one of the core components of Computer Assisted Pronunciation Training (CAPT) systems which is a subset of CALL. Studies on automated pronunciation error detection began in the 1990s, but the development of fullfledged CAPTs has only accelerated in the last decade due to an increase in computing power and availability of mobile devices for recording speech required for pronunciation analysis. Detecting Pronunciation errors is a hard problem to solve as there is no formal definition of correct and incorrect pronunciation. As a result, typically prosodic and phoneme errors such as phoneme substitution, insertion, and deletion are detected. Also, it has been agreed upon that learning pronunciation should focus on speaker intelligibility rather than sounding like an L1 English speaker. Initially, methods were developed on posterior likelihood called Good of Pronunciation using Gaussian Mixture Model-Hidden Markov Model and Deep Neural Network-Hidden Markov Model approaches. These are complex systems to implement when compared with the recently proposed ASR based End-to-End mispronunciations detection systems. The purpose of this research is to create End-to-End (E2E) models using Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) and Attention-based sequence decoder. Recently, E2E models have shown considerable improvement in mispronunciation detection accuracy. This research will draw comparison amongst baseline models CNN-RNN-CTC, CNN-RNN-CTC with character sequence-based attention decoder, and CNN-RNN-CTC with phoneme-based decoder systems. This study will help us in deciding a better approach towards developing an efficient mispronunciation detection system. ",

    "abstract": "Deep learning-based reduced order models (DL-ROMs) have been recently proposed to overcome common limitations shared by conventional ROMs - built, e.g., exclusively through proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) - when applied to nonlinear time-dependent parametrized PDEs. In particular, POD-DL-ROMs can achieve extreme efficiency in the training stage and faster than real-time performances at testing, thanks to a prior dimensionality reduction through POD and a DL-based prediction framework. Nonetheless, they share with conventional ROMs poor performances regarding time extrapolation tasks. This work aims at taking a further step towards the use of DL algorithms for the efficient numerical approximation of parametrized PDEs by introducing the $\\mu t$-POD-LSTM-ROM framework. This novel technique extends the POD-DL-ROM framework by adding a two-fold architecture taking advantage of long short-term memory (LSTM) cells, ultimately allowing long-term prediction of complex systems' evolution, with respect to the training window, for unseen input parameter values. Numerical results show that this recurrent architecture enables the extrapolation for time windows up to 15 times larger than the training time domain, and achieves better testing time performances with respect to the already lightning-fast POD-DL-ROMs. ",

    "abstract": "We introduce Explanatory Learning (EL), a framework to let machines use existing knowledge buried in symbolic sequences -- e.g. explanations written in hieroglyphic -- by autonomously learning to interpret them. In EL, the burden of interpreting symbols is not left to humans or rigid human-coded compilers, as done in Program Synthesis. Rather, EL calls for a learned interpreter, built upon a limited collection of symbolic sequences paired with observations of several phenomena. This interpreter can be used to make predictions on a novel phenomenon given its explanation, and even to find that explanation using only a handful of observations, like human scientists do. We formulate the EL problem as a simple binary classification task, so that common end-to-end approaches aligned with the dominant empiricist view of machine learning could, in principle, solve it. To these models, we oppose Critical Rationalist Networks (CRNs), which instead embrace a rationalist view on the acquisition of knowledge. CRNs express several desired properties by construction, they are truly explainable, can adjust their processing at test-time for harder inferences, and can offer strong confidence guarantees on their predictions. As a final contribution, we introduce Odeen, a basic EL environment that simulates a small flatland-style universe full of phenomena to explain. Using Odeen as a testbed, we show how CRNs outperform empiricist end-to-end approaches of similar size and architecture (Transformers) in discovering explanations for novel phenomena. ",

    "abstract": "In this work, we investigate how to make use of model reduction techniques to identify the vulnerability of a closed-loop system, consisting of a plant and a supervisor, that might invite attacks. Here, the system vulnerability refers to the existence of key observation sequences that could be exploited by a specific smart sensor attack to cause damage infliction. We consider a nondeterministic smart attack, i.e., there might exist more than one attack choice over each received observation, and adopt our previously proposed modeling framework, where such an attack is captured by a standard finite-state automaton. For a given supervisor S and a smart sensor attack model A, another smart attack model A' is called attack equivalent to A with respect to S, if the resulting compromised supervisor, defined as the composition of the supervisor S and attack model A', is control equivalent to the original compromised supervisor, defined as the composition of S and A. Following the spirit of supervisor reduction that relies on the concept of control congruence, we will show that, this problem of synthesizing a reduced smart attack model A' that is attack equivalent to A with respect to S, can be transformed to a classical supervisor reduction problem, making all existing synthesis tools available for supervisor reduction directly applicable to our problem. A simplified and ideally minimum-state attack model can reveal all necessary observation sequences for the attacker to be successful, thus, reminds system designers to take necessary precautions in advance, which may improve system resilience significantly. An example is presented to show the effectiveness of our proposed attack model reduction technique to identify the system vulnerability. ",

Hexagonal elements provide nonsingular connectivity between two juxtaposed elements and, thus, subdue checkerboard patterns and point connections inherently in a topology optimization setting. A novel approach to generate honeycomb tessellation is proposed. The element connectivity matrix and corresponding nodal coordinates array are determined in 5 (7) and 4 (6) lines, respectively. Two additional lines for meshgrid generation are required for an even number of elements in the vertical direction. The code takes a fraction of a second to generate meshgrid information for the millions of hexagonal elements. Wachspress shape functions are employed for the finite element analysis, and compliance minimization is performed using the optimality criteria method. The Matlab code is explained in detail. Options to run the optimization with and without filtering techniques are provided. Steps to include different boundary conditions, multiple load cases, active and passive regions, and a Heaviside projection filter are discussed. ",

In particular, the work studies the $K$-user cache-aided broadcast channel with a limited number of cache states, and explores the effect of cache state association strategies in the presence of arbitrary user activity levels; a combination that strikes at the very core of the coded caching problem and its crippling subpacketization bottleneck. We first present a statistical analysis of the average worst-case delay performance of such subpacketization-constrained (state-constrained) coded caching networks, and provide computationally efficient performance bounds as well as scaling laws for any arbitrary probability distribution of the user-activity levels. The achieved performance is a result of a novel user-to-cache state association algorithm that leverages the knowledge of probabilistic user-activity levels. We then follow a data-driven approach that exploits the prior history on user-activity levels and correlations, in order to predict interference patterns, and thus better design the caching algorithm. This optimized strategy is based on the principle that users that overlap more, interfere more, and thus have higher priority to secure complementary cache states. This strategy is proven here to be within a small constant factor from the optimal. Finally, the above analysis is validated numerically using synthetic data following the Pareto principle. To the best of our understanding, this is the first work that seeks to exploit user-activity levels and correlations, in order to map future interference and design optimized coded caching algorithms that better handle this interference.

Given a data set containing historical decisions and delivery locations, the goal is to capture the implicit preferences of the decision-makers. We consider two ways to use the historical data: one is through a probability estimation method that learns transition probabilities between stops (or zones). This is a fast and accurate method, recently studied in a VRP setting. Furthermore, we explore the use of machine learning to infer how to best balance multiple objectives such as distance, probability and penalties. Specifically, we cast the learning problem as a structured output prediction problem, where training is done by repeatedly calling the TSP solver. Another important aspect we consider is that for last-mile delivery, every address is a potential client and hence the data is very sparse. Hence, we propose a two-stage approach that first learns preferences at the zone level in order to compute a zone routing; after which a penalty-based TSP computes the stop routing. Results show that the zone transition probability estimation performs well, and that the structured output prediction learning can improve the results further. We hence showcase a successful combination of both probability estimation and machine learning, all the while using standard TSP solvers, both during learning and to compute the final solution; this means the methodology is applicable to other, real-life, TSP variants, or proprietary solvers.

We replace the quadratic attention with linear attention mechanisms, such as Performer, Nystr\\\"omformer, and Linear Transformer, to reduce its GPU usage.

This paper proposes a Multi-channel Attentive Graph Convolutional Network (MAGCN), consisting of two main components: cross-modality interactive learning and sentimental feature fusion. For cross-modality interactive learning, we exploit the self-attention mechanism combined with densely connected graph convolutional networks to learn inter-modality dynamics. For sentimental feature fusion, we utilize multi-head self-attention to merge sentimental knowledge into inter-modality feature representations.

    "abstract": "Several studies have shown the ability of natural gradient descent to minimize the objective function more efficiently than ordinary gradient descent based methods. However, the bottleneck of this approach for training deep neural networks lies in the prohibitive cost of solving a large dense linear system corresponding to the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) at each iteration. This has motivated various approximations of either the exact FIM or the empirical one. The most sophisticated of these is KFAC, which involves a Kronecker-factored block diagonal approximation of the FIM. With only a slight additional cost, a few improvements of KFAC from the standpoint of accuracy are proposed. The common feature of the four novel methods is that they rely on a direct minimization problem, the solution of which can be computed via the Kronecker product singular value decomposition technique. Experimental results on the three standard deep auto-encoder benchmarks showed that they provide more accurate approximations to the FIM. Furthermore, they outperform KFAC and state-of-the-art first-order methods in terms of optimization speed. ",

In a recursion from the leaves to the root, the integrator updates bases and then evolves connection tensors by a Galerkin method in the augmented subspace spanned by the new and old bases. This is followed by rank truncation within a specified error tolerance. The memory requirements are linear in the order of the tensor and linear in the maximal mode dimension. The integrator is robust to small singular values of matricizations of the connection tensors. Up to the rank truncation error, which is controlled by the given error tolerance, the integrator preserves norm and energy for Schr\u007fodinger equations, and it dissipates the energy in gradient systems. Numerical experiments with a basic quantum spin system illustrate the behavior of the proposed algorithm. ",

    "abstract": "Existing and planned legislation stipulates various obligations to provide information about machine learning algorithms and their functioning, often interpreted as obligations to \"explain\". Many researchers suggest using post-hoc explanation algorithms for this purpose. In this paper, we combine legal, philosophical and technical arguments to show that post-hoc explanation algorithms are unsuitable to achieve the law's objectives. Indeed, most situations where explanations are requested are adversarial, meaning that the explanation provider and receiver have opposing interests and incentives, so that the provider might manipulate the explanation for her own ends. We show that this fundamental conflict cannot be resolved because of the high degree of ambiguity of post-hoc explanations in realistic application scenarios. As a consequence, post-hoc explanation algorithms are unsuitable to achieve the transparency objectives inherent to the legal norms. Instead, there is a need to more explicitly discuss the objectives underlying \"explainability\" obligations as these can often be better achieved through other mechanisms. There is an urgent need for a more open and honest discussion regarding the potential and limitations of post-hoc explanations in adversarial contexts, in particular in light of the current negotiations about the European Union's draft Artificial Intelligence Act.

    "abstract": "Predicting the supply and demand of transport systems is vital for efficient traffic management, control, optimization, and planning. For example, predicting where from/to and when people intend to travel by taxi can support fleet managers to distribute resources; better predicting traffic speeds/congestion allows for pro-active control measures or for users to better choose their paths. Making spatio-temporal predictions is known to be a hard task, but recently Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been widely applied on non-euclidean spatial data. However, most GNN models require a predefined graph, and so far, researchers rely on heuristics to generate this graph for the model to use. In this paper, we use Neural Relational Inference to learn the optimal graph for the model. Our approach has several advantages: 1) a Variational Auto Encoder structure allows for the graph to be dynamically determined by the data, potentially changing through time; 2) the encoder structure allows the use of external data in the generation of the graph; 3) it is possible to place Bayesian priors on the generated graphs to encode domain knowledge. We conduct experiments on two datasets, namely the NYC Yellow Taxi and the PEMS road traffic datasets. In both datasets, we outperform benchmarks and show performance comparable to state-of-the-art. Furthermore, we do an in-depth analysis of the learned graphs, providing insights on what kinds of connections GNNs use for spatio-temporal predictions in the transport domain. ",

To this end, we introduce a 2-stage approach where a simple niching memetic algorithm (NMA), derived from a state-of-the-art for multi-solution TSP, is combined with a baseline diversifying algorithm. The most notable feature of the proposed NMA is the use of randomized improvement-first local search instead of 2-opt. Our experiment on TSPLIB instances shows that while the populations evolved by our NMA tend to contain clusters at tight quality constraints, they frequently occupy distant basins of attraction rather than close-by regions, improving on the baseline diversification in terms of sum-sum diversity. Compared to the original NMA, ours, despite its simplicity, finds more distant solutions of higher quality within less running time, by a large margin. ",

    "abstract": "Key Performance Indicators (KPI), which are essentially time series data, have been widely used to indicate the performance of telecom networks. Based on the given KPIs, a large set of anomaly detection algorithms have been deployed for detecting the unexpected network incidents. Generally, unsupervised anomaly detection algorithms gain more popularity than the supervised ones, due to the fact that labeling KPIs is extremely time- and resource-consuming, and error-prone. However, those unsupervised anomaly detection algorithms often suffer from excessive false alarms, especially in the presence of concept drifts resulting from network re-configurations or maintenance. To tackle this challenge and improve the overall performance of unsupervised anomaly detection algorithms, we propose to use active learning to introduce and benefit from the feedback of operators, who can verify the alarms (both false and true ones) and label the corresponding KPIs with reasonable effort. Specifically, we develop three query strategies to select the most informative and representative samples to label. We also develop an efficient method to update the weights of Isolation Forest and optimally adjust the decision threshold, so as to eventually improve the performance of detection model. The experiments with one public dataset and one proprietary dataset demonstrate that our active learning empowered anomaly detection pipeline could achieve performance gain, in terms of F1-score, more than 50% over the baseline algorithm. It also outperforms the existing active learning based methods by approximately 6%-10%, with significantly reduced budget (the ratio of samples to be labeled). ",

    "abstract": "Morphological attributes from histopathological images and molecular profiles from genomic data are important information to drive diagnosis, prognosis, and therapy of cancers. By integrating these heterogeneous but complementary data, many multi-modal methods are proposed to study the complex mechanisms of cancers, and most of them achieve comparable or better results from previous single-modal methods. However, these multi-modal methods are restricted to a single task (e.g., survival analysis or grade classification), and thus neglect the correlation between different tasks. In this study, we present a multi-modal fusion framework based on multi-task correlation learning (MultiCoFusion) for survival analysis and cancer grade classification, which combines the power of multiple modalities and multiple tasks. Specifically, a pre-trained ResNet-152 and a sparse graph convolutional network (SGCN) are used to learn the representations of histopathological images and mRNA expression data respectively. Then these representations are fused by a fully connected neural network (FCNN), which is also a multi-task shared network. Finally, the results of survival analysis and cancer grade classification output simultaneously. The framework is trained by an alternate scheme. We systematically evaluate our framework using glioma datasets from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Results demonstrate that MultiCoFusion learns better representations than traditional feature extraction methods. With the help of multi-task alternating learning, even simple multi-modal concatenation can achieve better performance than other deep learning and traditional methods. Multi-task learning can improve the performance of multiple tasks not just one of them, and it is effective in both single-modal and multi-modal data. ",

To address this, in this paper, we introduce a novel Neural Architecture Search (NAS) approach for finding better SNN architectures. Inspired by recent NAS approaches that find the optimal architecture from activation patterns at initialization, we select the architecture that can represent diverse spike activation patterns across different data samples without training. Furthermore, to leverage the temporal correlation among the spikes, we search for feed forward connections as well as backward connections (i.e., temporal feedback connections) between layers. Interestingly, SNASNet found by our search algorithm achieves higher performance with backward connections, demonstrating the importance of designing SNN architecture for suitably using temporal information. We conduct extensive experiments on three image recognition benchmarks where we show that SNASNet achieves state-of-the-art performance with significantly lower timesteps (5 timesteps). ",

The described method embeds convexity of the moment to entropy map in the neural network approximation to preserve the structure of the minimal entropy closure. Two techniques are used to implement the methods. The first approach approximates the map between moments and the minimal entropy of the moment system and is convex by design. The second approach approximates the map between moments and Lagrange multipliers of the dual of the minimal entropy optimization problem, which present the gradients of the entropy with respect to the moments, and is enforced to be monotonic by introduction of a penalty function. We derive an error bound for the generalization gap of convex neural networks which are trained in Sobolev norm and use the results to construct data sampling methods for neural network training. Numerical experiments are conducted, which show that neural network-based entropy closures provide a significant speedup for kinetic solvers while maintaining a sufficient level of accuracy.

Pairing sUAS with onboard artificial intelligence (AI) substantially extends their utility in covering larger areas with fewer support personnel. A variety of missions, such as search and rescue, assessing structural damage, and monitoring forest fires, floods, and chemical spills, can be supported simply by deploying the appropriate AI models. However, adoption by resource-constrained groups, such as local municipalities, regulatory agencies, and researchers, has been hampered by the lack of a cost-effective, readily-accessible baseline platform that can be adapted to their unique missions. To fill this gap, we have developed the free and open-source ADAPT multi-mission payload for deploying real-time AI and computer vision onboard a sUAS during local and beyond-line-of-site missions. We have emphasized a modular design with low-cost, readily-available components, open-source software, and thorough documentation (https://kitware.github.io/adapt/). The system integrates an inertial navigation system, high-resolution color camera, computer, and wireless downlink to process imagery and broadcast georegistered analytics back to a ground station. Our goal is to make it easy for the HADR community to build their own copies of the ADAPT payload and leverage the thousands of hours of engineering we have devoted to developing and testing. In this paper, we detail the development and testing of the ADAPT payload. We demonstrate the example mission of real-time, in-flight ice segmentation to monitor river ice state and provide timely predictions of catastrophic flooding events.

CNNs require large amounts of computing resources because ofcomputationally intensive convolution layers. Fast convolution algorithms such as Winograd convolution can greatly reduce the computational cost of these layers at a cost of poor numeric properties, such that greater savings in computation exponentially increase floating point errors. A defining feature of each Winograd convolution algorithm is a set of real-value points where polynomials are sampled. The choice of points impacts the numeric accuracy of the algorithm, but the optimal set of points for small convolutions remains unknown. Existing work considers only small integers and simple fractions as candidate points. In this work, we propose a novel approach to point selection using points of the form {-1/c , -c, c, 1/c } using the full range of real-valued numbers for c. We show that groups of this form cause cancellations in the Winograd transform matrices that reduce numeric error. We find empirically that the error for different values of c forms a rough curve across the range of real-value numbers helping to localize the values of c that reduce error and that lower errors can be achieved with non-obvious real-valued evaluation points instead of integers or simple fractions. We study a range of sizes for small convolutions and achieve reduction in error ranging from 2% to around 59% for both 1D and 2D convolution. Furthermore, we identify patterns in cases when we select a subset of our proposed points which will always lead to a lower error. Finally we implement a complete Winograd convolution layer and use it to run deep convolution neural networks on real datasets and show that our proposed points reduce error, ranging from 22% to 63%.

Resolving fine scale features in the numerical model drastically increases the number of degrees of freedom, thus making full fine-scale simulations infeasible, especially in cases where the model needs to be evaluated many times. In this paper, a methodology for fine scale modeling of large scale structures is proposed, which combines the variational multiscale method, domain decomposition and model order reduction. Addressing applications where the assumption of scale separation does not hold, the influence of the fine scale on the coarse scale is modelled directly by the use of an additive split of the displacement field. Possible coarse and fine scale solutions are exploited for a representative volume element (RVE) to construct local approximation spaces. The local spaces are designed such that local contributions of RVE subdomains can be coupled in a conforming way. Therefore, the resulting global system of equations takes the effect of the fine scale on the coarse scale into account, is sparse and reduced in size compared to the full order model. Several numerical experiments show the accuracy and efficiency of the method. ",

Sentence-level informational bias detection is a very challenging task in a way that such bias can only be revealed together with the context, examples include collecting information from various sources or analyzing the entire article in combination with the background. In this paper, we integrate three levels of context to detect the sentence-level informational bias in English news articles: adjacent sentences, whole article, and articles from other news outlets describing the same event. Our model, MultiCTX (Multi-level ConTeXt), uses contrastive learning and sentence graphs together with Graph Attention Network (GAT) to encode these three degrees of context at different stages by tactically composing contrastive triplets and constructing sentence graphs within events. Our experiments proved that contrastive learning together with sentence graphs effectively incorporates context in varying degrees and significantly outperforms the current SOTA model sentence-wise in informational bias detection.

    "abstract": "The peculiarity of adversarial team games resides in the asymmetric information available to the team members during the play, which makes the equilibrium computation problem hard even with zero-sum payoffs. The algorithms available in the literature work with implicit representations of the strategy space and mainly resort to Linear Programming and column generation techniques to enlarge incrementally the strategy space. Such representations prevent the adoption of standard tools such as abstraction generation, game solving, and subgame solving, which demonstrated to be crucial when solving huge, real-world two-player zero-sum games. Differently from these works, we answer the question of whether there is any suitable game representation enabling the adoption of those tools. In particular, our algorithms convert a sequential team game with adversaries to a classical two-player zero-sum game. In this converted game, the team is transformed into a single coordinator player who only knows information common to the whole team and prescribes to the players an action for any possible private state. Interestingly, we show that our game is more expressive than the original extensive-form game as any state/action abstraction of the extensive-form game can be captured by our representation, while the reverse does not hold. Due to the NP-hard nature of the problem, the resulting Public Team game may be exponentially larger than the original one. To limit this explosion, we provide three algorithms, each returning an information-lossless abstraction that dramatically reduces the size of the tree. These abstractions can be produced without generating the original game tree. Finally, we show the effectiveness of the proposed approach by presenting experimental results on Kuhn and Leduc Poker games, obtained by applying state-of-art algorithms for two-player zero-sum games on the converted games ",

    "abstract": "Data heterogeneity is an intrinsic property of recommender systems, making models trained over the global data on the cloud, which is the mainstream in industry, non-optimal to each individual user's local data distribution. To deal with data heterogeneity, model personalization with on-device learning is a potential solution. However, on-device training using a user's small size of local samples will incur severe overfitting and undermine the model's generalization ability. In this work, we propose a new device-cloud collaborative learning framework, called CoDA, to break the dilemmas of purely cloud-based learning and on-device learning. The key principle of CoDA is to retrieve similar samples from the cloud's global pool to augment each user's local dataset to train the recommendation model. Specifically, after a coarse-grained sample matching on the cloud, a personalized sample classifier is further trained on each device for a fine-grained sample filtering, which can learn the boundary between the local data distribution and the outside data distribution. We also build an end-to-end pipeline to support the flows of data, model, computation, and control between the cloud and each device. We have deployed CoDA in a recommendation scenario of Mobile Taobao. Online A/B testing results show the remarkable performance improvement of CoDA over both cloud-based learning without model personalization and on-device training without data augmentation. Overhead testing on a real device demonstrates the computation, storage, and communication efficiency of the on-device tasks in CoDA. ",

Vandalism detection is a critical task to support trust and maintain OSM transparency. This task is remarkably challenging due to the large scale of the dataset, the sheer number of contributors, various vandalism forms, and the lack of annotated data. This paper presents Ovid - a novel attention-based method for vandalism detection in OSM. Ovid relies on a novel neural architecture that adopts a multi-head attention mechanism to summarize information indicating vandalism from OSM changesets effectively. To facilitate automated vandalism detection, we introduce a set of original features that capture changeset, user, and edit information. Furthermore, we extract a dataset of real-world vandalism incidents from the OSM edit history for the first time and provide this dataset as open data.

    "abstract": "Notions of fair machine learning that seek to control various kinds of error across protected groups generally are cast as constrained optimization problems over a fixed model class. For such problems, tradeoffs arise: asking for various kinds of technical fairness requires compromising on overall error, and adding more protected groups increases error rates across all groups. Our goal is to break though such accuracy-fairness tradeoffs. We develop a simple algorithmic framework that allows us to deploy models and then revise them dynamically when groups are discovered on which the error rate is suboptimal. Protected groups don't need to be pre-specified: At any point, if it is discovered that there is some group on which our current model performs substantially worse than optimally, then there is a simple update operation that improves the error on that group without increasing either overall error or the error on previously identified groups. We do not restrict the complexity of the groups that can be identified, and they can intersect in arbitrary ways. The key insight that allows us to break through the tradeoff barrier is to dynamically expand the model class as new groups are identified. The result is provably fast convergence to a model that can't be distinguished from the Bayes optimal predictor, at least by those tasked with finding high error groups. We explore two instantiations of this framework: as a \"bias bug bounty\" design in which external auditors are invited to discover groups on which our current model's error is suboptimal, and as an algorithmic paradigm in which the discovery of groups on which the error is suboptimal is posed as an optimization problem. In the bias bounty case, when we say that a model cannot be distinguished from Bayes optimal, we mean by any participant in the bounty program. We provide both theoretical analysis and experimental validation. ",

In this work, we extended the public ACDC dataset with additional labels of the right ventricular insertion points and compare different variants of a heatmap-based landmark detection pipeline. In this comparison, we demonstrate very likely pitfalls of apparently simple detection and localisation metrics which highlights the importance of a clear detection strategy and the definition of an upper limit for localisation-based metrics. Our preliminary results indicate that a combination of different metrics is necessary, as they yield different winners for method comparison.

In particular, reachability from a cube to another cube is a PSPACE-complete problem. To prove the upper bound for this parameterized analysis, we prove some structural properties about the reachability sets and the symbolic graph abstraction of RBN, which might be of independent interest. We justify this claim by providing two applications of these results. First, we show that the almost-sure coverability problem is PSPACE-complete for RBN, thereby closing a complexity gap from a previous paper.

In this paper, we propose a framework based on the conditional entropy minimization principle to filter out the spurious invariant features leading to a new algorithm with a better generalization capability.

    "abstract": "In recent years, with the rapid development of artificial intelligence, image generation based on deep learning has dramatically advanced. Image generation based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) is a promising study. However, since convolutions are limited by spatial-agnostic and channel-specific, features extracted by traditional GANs based on convolution are constrained. Therefore, GANs are unable to capture any more details per image. On the other hand, straightforwardly stacking of convolutions causes too many parameters and layers in GANs, which will lead to a high risk of overfitting. To overcome the aforementioned limitations, in this paper, we propose a new GANs called Involution Generative Adversarial Networks (GIU-GANs). GIU-GANs leverages a brand new module called the Global Information Utilization (GIU) module, which integrates Squeeze-and-Excitation Networks (SENet) and involution to focus on global information by channel attention mechanism, leading to a higher quality of generated images. Meanwhile, Batch Normalization(BN) inevitably ignores the representation differences among noise sampled by the generator, and thus degrade the generated image quality. Thus we introduce Representative Batch Normalization(RBN) to the GANs architecture for this issue. The CIFAR-10 and CelebA datasets are employed to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model. A large number of experiments prove that our model achieves state-of-the-art competitive performance. ",

Recently, multi-scale encoding schemes (such as Space2Vec) were proposed to directly encode any point in 2D space as a high-dimensional vector, and has been successfully applied to various (geo)spatial prediction tasks. However, a map projection distortion problem rises when applying location encoding models to large-scale real-world GPS coordinate datasets (e.g., species images taken all over the world) - all current location encoding models are designed for encoding points in a 2D (Euclidean) space but not on a spherical surface, e.g., earth surface. To solve this problem, we propose a multi-scale location encoding model called Sphere2V ec which directly encodes point coordinates on a spherical surface while avoiding the mapprojection distortion problem. We provide theoretical proof that the Sphere2Vec encoding preserves the spherical surface distance between any two points. We also developed a unified view of distance-reserving encoding on spheres based on the Double Fourier Sphere (DFS). We apply Sphere2V ec to the geo-aware image classification task. Our analysis shows that Sphere2V ec outperforms other 2D space location encoder models especially on the polar regions and data-sparse areas for image classification tasks because of its nature for spherical surface distance preservation.

However, the background noise distorts these structures in a nonuniform way. The existing deep acoustic signal enhancement (ASE) architectures ignore this kind of local and global effect. To address this problem, we propose to integrate a novel temporal attentive-pooling (TAP) mechanism into a conventional convolutional recurrent neural network, termed as TAP-CRNN. The proposed approach considers both global and local attention for ASE tasks. Specifically, we first utilize a convolutional layer to extract local information of the acoustic signals and then a recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture is used to characterize temporal contextual information. Second, we exploit a novelattention mechanism to contextually process salient regions of the noisy signals. The proposed ASE system is evaluated using a benchmark infant cry dataset and compared with several well-known methods. It is shown that the TAPCRNN can more effectively reduce noise components from infant cry signals in unseen background noises at challenging signal-to-noise levels. ",

We show that in firing-rate networks in the balanced state, external control of recurrent dynamics, i.e., the suppression of internally-generated chaotic variability, strongly depends on correlations in the input. A unique feature of balanced networks is that, because common external input is dynamically canceled by recurrent feedback, it is far easier to suppress chaos with independent inputs into each neuron than through common input. To study this phenomenon we develop a non-stationary dynamic mean-field theory that determines how the activity statistics and largest Lyapunov exponent depend on frequency and amplitude of the input, recurrent coupling strength, and network size, for both common and independent input. We also show that uncorrelated inputs facilitate learning in balanced networks. ",

In the acoustic domain, signal cross-correlation is a natural choice to quantify the usefulness of microphone signals, i. e., microphone utility, for array processing, but its estimation requires that the uncoded signals are synchronized and transmitted between nodes. In resource-constrained environments like acoustic sensor networks, low data transmission rates often make transmission of all observed signals to the centralized location infeasible, thus discouraging direct estimation of signal cross-correlation. Instead, we employ characteristic features of the recorded signals to estimate the usefulness of individual microphone signals. In this contribution, we provide a comprehensive analysis of model-based microphone utility estimation approaches that use signal features and, as an alternative, also propose machine learning-based estimation methods that identify optimal sensor signal utility features. The performance of both approaches is validated experimentally using both simulated and recorded acoustic data, comprising a variety of realistic and practically relevant acoustic scenarios including moving and static sources.

    "abstract": "The COVID-19 (coronavirus) is an ongoing pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The virus was first identified in mid-December 2019 in the Hubei province of Wuhan, China and by now has spread throughout the planet with more than 75.5 million confirmed cases and more than 1.67 million deaths. With limited number of COVID-19 test kits available in medical facilities, it is important to develop and implement an automatic detection system as an alternative diagnosis option for COVID-19 detection that can used on a commercial scale. Chest X-ray is the first imaging technique that plays an important role in the diagnosis of COVID-19 disease. Computer vision and deep learning techniques can help in determining COVID-19 virus with Chest X-ray Images. Due to the high availability of large-scale annotated image datasets, great success has been achieved using convolutional neural network for image analysis and classification. In this research, we have proposed a deep convolutional neural network trained on five open access datasets with binary output: Normal and Covid. The performance of the model is compared with four pre-trained convolutional neural network-based models (COVID-Net, ResNet18, ResNet and MobileNet-V2) and it has been seen that the proposed model provides better accuracy on the validation set as compared to the other four pre-trained models. This research work provides promising results which can be further improvise and implement on a commercial scale. ",

Previously, we proposed the Streaming Unmixing and Recognition Transducer (SURT) model based on recurrent neural network transducer (RNN-T) for this problem and presented promising results. However, for real applications, the speech recognition system is also required to determine the timestamp when a speaker finishes speaking for prompt system response. This problem, known as endpoint (EP) detection, has not been studied previously for multi-talker end-to-end models. In this work, we address the EP detection problem in the SURT framework by introducing an end-of-sentence token as an output unit, following the practice of single-talker end-to-end models. Furthermore, we also present a latency penalty approach that can significantly cut down the EP detection latency. Our experimental results based on the 2-speaker LibrispeechMix dataset show that the SURT model can achieve promising EP detection without significantly degradation of the recognition accuracy. ",

These recordings were pre-processed to remove noisy segments and obtain high-quality heart and lung sounds. The random undersampling boosting (RUSBoost) classifier was then trained on a variety of features, such as power and vital sign features extracted from the heart and lung sounds. The RUSBoost algorithm produced specificity, sensitivity, and accuracy results of 85.0%, 66.7% and 81.8%, respectively. ",

We compare the performance of U-Net trained with dense and sparse labels to segment A-lines, B-lines, and Pleural lines on a custom dataset of lung ultrasound scans from 4 patients. Our experiments show that dense labels help reduce false positive detection. We study the classification capability of the dense and sparse trained U-Net and contrast it with a non-pretrained U-Net, to detect and differentiate COVID-19 and Pneumonia on a large ultrasound dataset of about 40k curvilinear and linear probe images. Our segmentation-based models perform better classification when using pretrained segmentation weights, with the dense-label pretrained U-Net performing the best. ",

    "abstract": "We introduce a new approach for speech pre-training named SPIRAL which works by learning denoising representation of perturbed data in a teacher-student framework. Specifically, given a speech utterance, we first feed the utterance to a teacher network to obtain corresponding representation. Then the same utterance is perturbed and fed to a student network. The student network is trained to output representation resembling that of the teacher. At the same time, the teacher network is updated as moving average of student's weights over training steps. In order to prevent representation collapse, we apply an in-utterance contrastive loss as pre-training objective and impose position randomization on the input to the teacher. SPIRAL achieves competitive or better results compared to state-of-the-art speech pre-training method wav2vec 2.0, with significant reduction of training cost (80% for Base model, 65% for Large model). Furthermore, we address the problem of noise-robustness that is critical to real-world speech applications. We propose multi-condition pre-training by perturbing the student's input with various types of additive noise. We demonstrate that multi-condition pre-trained SPIRAL models are more robust to noisy speech (9.0% - 13.3% relative word error rate reduction on real noisy test data), compared to applying multi-condition training solely in the fine-tuning stage. The code will be released after publication. ",

    "abstract": "Photon counting spectral CT (PCCT) can produce reconstructed attenuation maps in different energy channels, reflecting energy properties of the scanned object. Due to the limited photon numbers and the non-ideal detector response of each energy channel, the reconstructed images usually contain much noise. With the development of Deep Learning (DL) technique, different kinds of DL-based models have been proposed for noise reduction. However, most of the models require clean data set as the training labels, which are not always available in medical imaging field. Inspiring by the similarities of each channel's reconstructed image, we proposed a self-supervised learning based PCCT image enhancement framework via multi-spectral channels (S2MS). In S2MS framework, both the input and output labels are noisy images. Specifically, one single channel image was used as output while images of other single channels and channel-sum image were used as input to train the network, which can fully use the spectral data information without extra cost. The simulation results based on the AAPM Low-dose CT Challenge database showed that the proposed S2MS model can suppress the noise and preserve details more effectively in comparison with the traditional DL models, which has potential to improve the image quality of PCCT in clinical applications.

Recently proposed unsupervised deep learning-based registration methods have demonstrated superior performance compared to iterative methods in just a fraction of the time. Most of the learning-based methods have focused on mono-modal image registration. The extension to multi-modal registration depends on the use of an appropriate similarity function, such as the mutual information (MI). We propose guiding the training of a deep learning-based registration method with MI estimation between an image-pair in an end-to-end trainable network. Our results show that a small, 2-layer network produces competitive results in both mono- and multimodal registration, with sub-second run-times. Comparisons to both iterative and deep learning-based methods show that our MI-based method produces topologically and qualitatively superior results with an extremely low rate of non-diffeomorphic transformations. Real-time clinical application will benefit from a better visual matching of anatomical structures and less registration failures/outliers. ",

    "abstract": "Radar sensors are crucial for environment perception of driver assistance systems as well as autonomous vehicles. With a rising number of radar sensors and the so far unregulated automotive radar frequency band, mutual interference is inevitable and must be dealt with. Algorithms and models operating on radar data are required to run the early processing steps on specialized radar sensor hardware. This specialized hardware typically has strict resource-constraints, i.e. a low memory capacity and low computational power. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based approaches for denoising and interference mitigation yield promising results for radar processing in terms of performance. Regarding resource-constraints, however, CNNs typically exceed the hardware's capacities by far. In this paper we investigate quantization techniques for CNN-based denoising and interference mitigation of radar signals. We analyze the quantization of (i) weights and (ii) activations of different CNN-based model architectures. This quantization results in reduced memory requirements for model storage and during inference. We compare models with fixed and learned bit-widths and contrast two different methodologies for training quantized CNNs, i.e. the straight-through gradient estimator and training distributions over discrete weights. We illustrate the importance of structurally small real-valued base models for quantization and show that learned bit-widths yield the smallest models. We achieve a memory reduction of around 80\\% compared to the real-valued baseline. Due to practical reasons, however, we recommend the use of 8 bits for weights and activations, which results in models that require only 0.2 megabytes of memory. ",

Specifically, the population's agents recurrently revise their choices out of a set of strategies that impact to varying levels the transmission rate. A payoff vector quantifying the incentives provided by a planner for each strategy, after deducting the strategies' intrinsic costs, influences the revision process. An evolutionary dynamics model captures the population's preferences in the revision process by specifying as a function of the payoff vector the rates at which the agents' choices flow toward strategies with higher payoffs. Our main result is a dynamic payoff mechanism that is guaranteed to steer the epidemic variables (via incentives to the population) to the endemic equilibrium with the smallest infectious fraction, subject to cost constraints. We use a Lyapunov function not only to establish convergence but also to obtain an (anytime) upper bound for the peak size of the population's infectious portion. ",

However, as the number of available observation sites increases, so too does the opportunity for data quality issues to emerge, particularly given that many of these sensors do not have the benefit of official maintenance teams. To realise the value of crowd sourced 'Internet of Things' type observations for environmental modelling, we require approaches that can automate the detection of outliers during the data modelling process so that they do not contaminate the true distribution of the phenomena of interest. To this end, here we present a Bayesian deep learning approach for spatio-temporal modelling of environmental variables with automatic outlier detection. Our approach implements a Gaussian-uniform mixture density network whose dual purposes - modelling the phenomenon of interest, and learning to classify and ignore outliers - are achieved simultaneously, each by specifically designed branches of our neural network. For our example application, we use the Met Office's Weather Observation Website data, an archive of observations from around 1900 privately run and unofficial weather stations across the British Isles. Using data on surface air temperature, we demonstrate how our deep mixture model approach enables the modelling of a highly skilled spatio-temporal temperature distribution without contamination from spurious observations. We hope that adoption of our approach will help unlock the potential of incorporating a wider range of observation sources, including from crowd sourcing, into future environmental models. ",
