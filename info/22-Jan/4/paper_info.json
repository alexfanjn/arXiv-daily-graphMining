    "abstract": "The transport of traffic flow can be modeled by the advection equation. Finite difference and finite volumes methods have been used to numerically solve this hyperbolic equation on a mesh. Advection has also been modeled discretely on directed graphs using the graph advection operator [4, 18]. In this paper, we first show that we can reformulate this graph advection operator as a finite difference scheme. We then propose the Directed Graph Advection Mat\\'ern Gaussian Process (DGAMGP) model that incorporates the dynamics of this graph advection operator into the kernel of a trainable Mat\\'ern Gaussian Process to effectively model traffic flow and its uncertainty as an advective process on a directed graph.

    "abstract": "Hospital length of stay (LOS) is one of the most essential healthcare metrics that reflects the hospital quality of service and helps improve hospital scheduling and management. LOS prediction helps in cost management because patients who remain in hospitals usually do so in hospital units where resources are severely limited. In this study, we reviewed papers on LOS prediction using machine learning and statistical approaches. Our literature review considers research studies that focus on LOS prediction for stroke patients. Some of the surveyed studies revealed that authors reached contradicting conclusions. For example, the age of the patient was considered an important predictor of LOS for stroke patients in some studies, while other studies concluded that age was not a significant factor. Therefore, additional research is required in this domain to further understand the predictors of LOS for stroke patients. ",

    "abstract": "Device activity detection and channel estimation for massive grant-free access under frequency-selective fading have unfortunately been an outstanding problem. This paper aims to address the challenge. Specifically, we present an orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM)-based massive grant-free access scheme for a wideband system with one M-antenna base station (BS), N single-antenna Internet of Things (IoT) devices, and P channel taps. We obtain two different but equivalent models for the received pilot signals under frequency-selective Rayleigh fading. Based on each model, we formulate device activity detection as a non-convex maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) problem and propose an iterative algorithm to obtain a stationary point using optimal techniques. The two proposed MLE-based methods have the identical computational complexity order O(NPL^2), irrespective of M, and degrade to the existing MLE-based device activity detection method when P=1. Conventional channel estimation methods can be readily applied for channel estimation of detected active devices under frequency-selective Rayleigh fading, based on one of the derived models for the received pilot signals. Numerical results show that the two proposed methods have different preferable system parameters and complement each other to offer promising device activity detection design for grant-free massive access under frequency-selective Rayleigh fading.

Considering log data of variant domains, retraining the whole network for unknown domains is inefficient in real industrial scenarios especially for low-resource domains. However, previous deep models merely focused on extracting the semantics of log sequence in the same domain, leading to poor generalization on multi-domain logs. Therefore, we propose a unified Transformer-based framework for log anomaly detection (\\ourmethod{}), which is comprised of the pretraining and adapter-based tuning stage. Our model is first pretrained on the source domain to obtain shared semantic knowledge of log data. Then, we transfer the pretrained model to the target domain via the adapter-based tuning. The proposed method is evaluated on three public datasets including one source domain and two target domains. The experimental results demonstrate that our simple yet efficient approach, with fewer trainable parameters and lower training costs in the target domain, achieves state-of-the-art performance on three benchmarks.

We focus on designing a homogeneous, objective framework for evaluating samples of algorithmically generated music. Any engineered measures to evaluate generated music typically attempt to define the samples' musicality, but do not capture qualities of music such as theme or mood. We do not seek to assess the musical merit of generated music, but instead explore whether generated samples contain meaningful information pertaining to emotion or mood/theme. We achieve this by measuring the change in predictive performance of a music mood/theme classifier after augmenting its training data with generated samples. We analyse music samples generated by three models -- SampleRNN, Jukebox, and DDSP -- and employ a homogeneous framework across all methods to allow for objective comparison. This is the first attempt at augmenting a music genre classification dataset with conditionally generated music. We investigate the classification performance improvement using deep music generation and the ability of the generators to make emotional music by using an additional, emotion annotation of the dataset. Finally, we use a classifier trained on real data to evaluate the label validity of class-conditionally generated samples. ",

The attack construction is formulated as the design of a multivariate Gaussian distribution that aims to minimize the mutual information while limiting the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the distribution of the observations under attack and the distribution of the observations without attack. The sparsity constraint is incorporated as a support constraint of the attack distribution. Two heuristic greedy algorithms for the attack construction are proposed. The first algorithm assumes that the attack vector consists of independent entries, and therefore, requires no communication between different attacked locations. The second algorithm considers correlation between the attack vector entries and achieves a better disruption to stealth tradeoff at the cost of requiring communication between different locations. We numerically evaluate the performance of the proposed attack constructions on IEEE test systems and show that it is feasible to construct stealth attacks that generate significant disruption with a low number of compromised sensors.

Such group information may be expensive to obtain; thus, recent works in robustness and fairness have proposed ways to improve worst-group performance even when group labels are unavailable for the training data. However, these methods generally underperform methods that utilize group information at training time. In this work, we assume access to a small number of group labels alongside a larger dataset without group labels. We propose BARACK, a simple two-step framework to utilize this partial group information to improve worst-group performance: train a model to predict the missing group labels for the training data, and then use these predicted group labels in a robust optimization objective. Theoretically, we provide generalization bounds for our approach in terms of the worst-group performance, showing how the generalization error scales with respect to both the total number of training points and the number of training points with group labels. Empirically, our method outperforms the baselines that do not use group information, even when only 1-33% of points have group labels. We provide ablation studies to support the robustness and extensibility of our framework. ",

Inspired by natural human behavior, we present an approach that automates the detection of fake news. Natural human behavior is to cross-check new information with reliable sources. We use Natural Language Processing (NLP) and build a machine learning (ML) model that automates the process of cross-checking new information with a set of predefined reliable sources. We implement this for Twitter and build a model that flags fake tweets. Specifically, for a given tweet, we use its text to find relevant news from reliable news agencies. We then train a Random Forest model that checks if the textual content of the tweet is aligned with the trusted news. If it is not, the tweet is classified as fake. This approach can be generally applied to any kind of information and is not limited to a specific news story or a category of information. Our implementation of this approach gives a $70\\%$ accuracy which outperforms other generic fake-news classification models. These results pave the way towards a more sensible and natural approach to fake news detection. ",

In addition, an auxiliary network is employed to generate probable viewport center fixation points through the SoftArgMax function. The latter allows to derive fixation points from feature maps. To take advantage of the scanpath prediction, an adaptive joint probability distribution model is then applied to construct the final unbiased saliency map by leveraging the encoder decoder-based saliency map and the scanpath-based saliency heatmap. The proposed framework was evaluated in terms of saliency and scanpath prediction, and the results were compared to state-of-the-art methods on Salient360! dataset.

To this end, this paper proposes to improve the transferability of adversarial examples, and applies dual-stage feature-level perturbations to an existing model to implicitly create a set of diverse models. Then these models are fused by the longitudinal ensemble during the iterations. The proposed method is termed Dual-Stage Network Erosion (DSNE). We conduct comprehensive experiments both on non-residual and residual networks, and obtain more transferable adversarial examples with the computational cost similar to the state-of-the-art method. In particular, for the residual networks, the transferability of the adversarial examples can be significantly improved by biasing the residual block information to the skip connections. Our work provides new insights into the architectural vulnerability of neural networks and presents new challenges to the robustness of neural networks. ",

In this study, we reveal the core challenges in this research area: how to synthesize robust region features (for unseen objects) that are as intra-class diverse and inter-class separable as the real samples, so that strong unseen object detectors can be trained upon them. To address these challenges, we build a novel zero-shot object detection framework that contains an Intra-class Semantic Diverging component and an Inter-class Structure Preserving component. The former is used to realize the one-to-more mapping to obtain diverse visual features from each class semantic vector, preventing miss-classifying the real unseen objects as image backgrounds. While the latter is used to avoid the synthesized features too scattered to mix up the inter-class and foreground-background relationship. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, comprehensive experiments on PASCAL VOC, COCO, and DIOR datasets are conducted. Notably, our approach achieves the new state-of-the-art performance on PASCAL VOC and COCO and it is the first study to carry out zero-shot object detection in remote sensing imagery. ",

    "abstract": "Deep neural networks are parametrized by several thousands or millions of parameters, and have shown tremendous success in many classification problems. However, the large number of parameters makes it difficult to integrate these models into edge devices such as smartphones and wearable devices. To address this problem, knowledge distillation (KD) has been widely employed, that uses a pre-trained high capacity network to train a much smaller network, suitable for edge devices. In this paper, for the first time, we study the applicability and challenges of using KD for time-series data for wearable devices. Successful application of KD requires specific choices of data augmentation methods during training. However, it is not yet known if there exists a coherent strategy for choosing an augmentation approach during KD. In this paper, we report the results of a detailed study that compares and contrasts various common choices and some hybrid data augmentation strategies in KD based human activity analysis. Research in this area is often limited as there are not many comprehensive databases available in the public domain from wearable devices. Our study considers databases from small scale publicly available to one derived from a large scale interventional study into human activity and sedentary behavior. We find that the choice of data augmentation techniques during KD have a variable level of impact on end performance, and find that the optimal network choice as well as data augmentation strategies are specific to a dataset at hand. However, we also conclude with a general set of recommendations that can provide a strong baseline performance across databases. ",

In this work, we design a new relaxed energy function based neural network (RNFNN) for target localization in distributed MIMO radar. We start with the maximum likelihood (ML) target localization with a complicated objective function, which can be transformed to a tractable one with equality constraints by introducing some auxiliary variables. Different from the existing Lagrangian programming neural network (LPNN) methods, we further relax the optimization problem formulated for target localization, so that the Lagrangian multiplier terms are no longer needed, leading to a relaxed energy function with better convexity. Based on the relaxed energy function, a RNFNN is implemented with much simpler structure and faster convergence speed. Furthermore, the RNFNN method is extended to localization in the presence of transmitter and receiver location errors. It is shown that the performance of the proposed localization approach achieves the Cram\\'er-Rao lower bound (CRLB) within a wider range of signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). Extensive comparisons with the state-of-the-art approaches are provided, which demonstrate the advantages of the proposed approach in terms of performance improvement and computational complexity (or convergence speed).

Besides, choosing a proper acoustic feature from audio recording for bird species classification is another problem. In this paper, a hybrid method is represented comprising both traditional signal processing and a deep learning-based approach to classify bird species from audio recordings of diverse sources and types. Besides, a detailed study with 34 different features helps to select the proper feature set for classification and analysis in real-time applications. Moreover, the proposed deep neural network uses both acoustic and temporal feature learning. The proposed method starts with detecting voice activity from the raw signal, followed by extracting short-term features from the processed recording using 50 ms (with 25ms overlapping) time windows. Later, the short-term features are reshaped using second stage (non-overlapping) windowing to be trained through a distributed 2D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that forwards the output features to a Long and Short Term Memory (LSTM) Network. Then a final dense layer classifies the bird species. For the 10 class classifier, the highest accuracy achieved was 90.45\\% for a feature set consisting of 13 Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) and 12 Chroma Vectors.

In this work, we propose Surrogate-assisted Controller (SC), a novel and efficient module that can be integrated into existing frameworks to alleviate the computational burden of EAs by partially replacing the expensive policy evaluation. The key challenge in applying this module is to prevent the optimization process from being misled by the possible false minima introduced by the surrogate. To address this issue, we present two strategies for SC to control the workflow of hybrid frameworks. Experiments on six continuous control tasks from the OpenAI Gym platform show that SC can not only significantly reduce the cost of fitness evaluations, but also boost the performance of the original hybrid frameworks with collaborative learning and evolutionary processes.

    "title": "High-dimensional Bayesian Optimization Algorithm with Recurrent Neural  Network for Disease Control Models in Time Series",
    "abstract": "Bayesian Optimization algorithm has become a promising approach for nonlinear global optimization problems and many machine learning applications. Over the past few years, improvements and enhancements have been brought forward and they have shown some promising results in solving the complex dynamic problems, systems of ordinary differential equations where the objective functions are computationally expensive to evaluate. Besides, the straightforward implementation of the Bayesian Optimization algorithm performs well merely for optimization problems with 10-20 dimensions. The study presented in this paper proposes a new high dimensional Bayesian Optimization algorithm combining Recurrent neural networks, which is expected to predict the optimal solution for the global optimization problems with high dimensional or time series decision models. The proposed RNN-BO algorithm can solve the optimal control problems in the lower dimension space and then learn from the historical data using the recurrent neural network to learn the historical optimal solution data and predict the optimal control strategy for any new initial system value setting. In addition, accurately and quickly providing the optimal control strategy is essential to effectively and efficiently control the epidemic spread while minimizing the associated financial costs. Therefore, to verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, computational experiments are carried out on a deterministic SEIR epidemic model and a stochastic SIS optimal control model. Finally, we also discuss the impacts of different numbers of the RNN layers and training epochs on the trade-off between solution quality and related computational efforts. ",

    "abstract": "It is well-known that deep neural networks (DNNs) have shown remarkable success in many fields. However, when adding an imperceptible magnitude perturbation on the model input, the model performance might get rapid decrease. To address this issue, a randomness technique has been proposed recently, named Stochastic Neural Networks (SNNs). Specifically, SNNs inject randomness into the model to defend against unseen attacks and improve the adversarial robustness. However, existed studies on SNNs mainly focus on injecting fixed or learnable noises to model weights/activations. In this paper, we find that the existed SNNs performances are largely bottlenecked by the feature representation ability. Surprisingly, simply maximizing the variance per dimension of the feature distribution leads to a considerable boost beyond all previous methods, which we named maximize feature distribution variance stochastic neural network (MFDV-SNN). Extensive experiments on well-known white- and black-box attacks show that MFDV-SNN achieves a significant improvement over existing methods, which indicates that it is a simple but effective method to improve model robustness.

Despite their success, they rely on the availability of large amounts of parallel data to fine-tune the semantic mappings between queries and code. This restricts their practicality in domain-specific languages with relatively scarce and expensive data. In this paper, we propose CDCS, a novel approach for domain-specific code search. CDCS employs a transfer learning framework where an initial program representation model is pre-trained on a large corpus of common programming languages (such as Java and Python), and is further adapted to domain-specific languages such as SQL and Solidity. Unlike cross-language CodeBERT, which is directly fine-tuned in the target language, CDCS adapts a few-shot meta-learning algorithm called MAML to learn the good initialization of model parameters, which can be best reused in a domain-specific language. We evaluate the proposed approach on two domain-specific languages, namely, SQL and Solidity, with model transferred from two widely used languages (Python and Java). Experimental results show that CDCS significantly outperforms conventional pre-trained code models that are directly fine-tuned in domain-specific languages, and it is particularly effective for scarce data.

To enhance the wake word detection system's robustness against confusing words, we propose several methods to generate the adversarial confusing samples for simulating real confusing words scenarios in which we usually do not have any real confusing samples in the training set. The generated samples include concatenated audio, synthesized data, and partially masked keywords. Moreover, we use a domain embedding concatenated system to improve the performance. Experimental results show that the adversarial samples generated in our approach help improve the system's robustness in both the common scenario and the confusing words scenario.

    "abstract": "Deep neural networks (DNN) have been widely applied in modern life, including critical domains like autonomous driving, making it essential to ensure the reliability and robustness of DNN-powered systems. As an analogy to code coverage metrics for testing conventional software, researchers have proposed neuron coverage metrics and coverage-driven methods to generate DNN test cases. However, Yan et al. doubt the usefulness of existing coverage criteria in DNN testing. They show that a coverage-driven method is less effective than a gradient-based method in terms of both uncovering defects and improving model robustness. In this paper, we conduct a replication study of the work by Yan et al. and extend the experiments for deeper analysis. A larger model and a dataset of higher resolution images are included to examine the generalizability of the results. We also extend the experiments with more test case generation techniques and adjust the process of improving model robustness to be closer to the practical life cycle of DNN development. Our experiment results confirm the conclusion from Yan et al. that coverage-driven methods are less effective than gradient-based methods. Yan et al. find that using gradient-based methods to retrain cannot repair defects uncovered by coverage-driven methods. They attribute this to the fact that the two types of methods use different perturbation strategies: gradient-based methods perform differentiable transformations while coverage-driven methods can perform additional non-differentiable transformations. We test several hypotheses and further show that even coverage-driven methods are constrained only to perform differentiable transformations, the uncovered defects still cannot be repaired by adversarial training with gradient-based methods. Thus, defensive strategies for coverage-driven methods should be further studied. ",

However, real-world graphs usually contain structure noises and have limited labeled nodes. The performance of GNNs would drop significantly when trained on such graphs, which hinders the adoption of GNNs on many applications. Thus, it is important to develop noise-resistant GNNs with limited labeled nodes. However, the work on this is rather limited. Therefore, we study a novel problem of developing robust GNNs on noisy graphs with limited labeled nodes. Our analysis shows that both the noisy edges and limited labeled nodes could harm the message-passing mechanism of GNNs. To mitigate these issues, we propose a novel framework which adopts the noisy edges as supervision to learn a denoised and dense graph, which can down-weight or eliminate noisy edges and facilitate message passing of GNNs to alleviate the issue of limited labeled nodes. The generated edges are further used to regularize the predictions of unlabeled nodes with label smoothness to better train GNNs. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate the robustness of the proposed framework on noisy graphs with limited labeled nodes. ",

Recently, the drug has been suggested to treat COVID-19, but that has not been supported by scientific evidence. The information regarding the drug efficacy has flooded social networks, posting potential threats to the community by perverting their perceptions of the drug efficacy. This paper studies the reactions of social network users on the recommendation of using HCQ for COVID-19 treatment by analyzing the reaction patterns and sentiment of the tweets. We collected 164,016 tweets from February to December 2020 and used a text mining approach to identify social reaction patterns and opinion change over time. Our descriptive analysis identified an irregularity of the users' reaction patterns associated tightly with the social and news feeds on the development of HCQ and COVID-19 treatment. The study linked the tweets and Google search frequencies to reveal the viewpoints of local communities on the use of HCQ for COVID-19 treatment across different states. Further, our tweet sentiment analysis reveals that public opinion changed significantly over time regarding the recommendation of using HCQ for COVID-19 treatment. The data showed that high support in the early dates but it significantly declined in October. Finally, using the manual classification of 4,850 tweets by humans as our benchmark, our sentiment analysis showed that the Google Cloud Natural Language algorithm outperformed the Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner in classifying tweets, especially in the sarcastic tweet group.

    "abstract": "Community Search (CS) is one of the fundamental graph analysis tasks, which is a building block of various real applications. Given any query nodes, CS aims to find cohesive subgraphs that query nodes belong to. Recently, a large number of CS algorithms are designed. These algorithms adopt pre-defined subgraph patterns to model the communities, which cannot find communities that do not have such pre-defined patterns in real-world graphs. Thereby, machine learning based approaches are proposed to capture flexible community structures by learning from community ground-truth in a data-driven fashion. However, existing approaches rely on sufficient training data to provide enough generalization for machine learning models. In this paper, we study ML-based approaches for community search, under the circumstance that the training data is scarce. To learn from small data, we extract prior knowledge which is shared across different graphs as CS tasks in advance. Subsequent small training data from a new CS task are combined with the learned prior knowledge to help the model well adapt to that specific task. A novel meta-learning based framework, called CGNP, is designed and implemented to fulfill this learning procedure. A meta CGNP model is a task-common node embedding function for clustering by nature, learned by metric-based learning. To the best of our knowledge, CGNP is the first meta model solution for CS. We compare CGNP with traditional CS algorithms, e.g., CTC, ATC, ACQ, and ML baselines on real graph datasets with ground-truth. Our experiments show that CGNP outperforms the native graph algorithms and ML baselines 147% and 113% on F1-score by average. ",

Existing average consensus algorithms require individual agents to exchange explicit state values with their neighbors, which leads to the undesirable disclosure of sensitive information in the state. In this paper, we propose a novel average consensus algorithm for time-varying directed graphs that can protect the confidentiality of a participating agent against other participating agents. The algorithm injects randomness in interaction to obfuscate information on the algorithm-level and can ensure information-theoretic privacy without the assistance of any trusted third party or data aggregator. By leveraging the inherent robustness of consensus dynamics against random variations in interaction, our proposed algorithm can also guarantee the accuracy of average consensus. The algorithm is distinctly different from differential-privacy based average consensus approaches which enable confidentiality through compromising accuracy in obtained consensus value. Numerical simulations confirm the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed approach. ",

While prior works often seek to explicitly regularize internal representations and predictors of the model to be domain invariant, we instead aim to regularize the whole function without restricting the model's internal representations. This leads to a simple mixup-based technique which learns invariant functions via selective augmentation called LISA. LISA selectively interpolates samples either with the same labels but different domains or with the same domain but different labels. We analyze a linear setting and theoretically show how LISA leads to a smaller worst-group error. Empirically, we study the effectiveness of LISA on nine benchmarks ranging from subpopulation shifts to domain shifts, and we find that LISA consistently outperforms other state-of-the-art methods.

To address these limitations, we propose the V-LinkNet cross-space learning strategy network. To improve learning on contextualised features, we design a loss model that employs both encoders. In addition, we propose a recursive residual transition layer (RSTL). The RSTL extracts high-level semantic information and propagates it down layers. Finally, we compare inpainting performance on the same face with different masks and on different faces with the same masks. To improve image inpainting reproducibility, we propose a standard protocol to overcome biases with various masks and images. We investigate the V-LinkNet components using experimental methods.

Recently, event graphs have been explored to model event datasets and their complex relationships, where events are vertices connected to other vertices representing locations, people's names, dates, and various other event metadata. Graph representation learning methods are promising for extracting latent features from event graphs to enable the use of different classification algorithms. However, existing methods fail to meet essential requirements for event graphs, such as (i) dealing with semi-supervised graph embedding to take advantage of some labeled events, (ii) automatically determining the importance of the relationships between event vertices and their metadata vertices, as well as (iii) dealing with the graph heterogeneity. This paper presents GNEE (GAT Neural Event Embeddings), a method that combines Graph Attention Networks and Graph Regularization. First, an event graph regularization is proposed to ensure that all graph vertices receive event features, thereby mitigating the graph heterogeneity drawback. Second, semi-supervised graph embedding with self-attention mechanism considers existing labeled events, as well as learns the importance of relationships in the event graph during the representation learning process. A statistical analysis of experimental results with five real-world event graphs and six graph embedding methods shows that our GNEE outperforms state-of-the-art semi-supervised graph embedding methods.

Existing unsupervised approaches often suffer from high computational cost, complex hyperparameter tuning, and limited interpretability, especially when working with large, high-dimensional datasets. To address these issues, we present a simple yet effective algorithm called ECOD (Empirical-Cumulative-distribution-based Outlier Detection), which is inspired by the fact that outliers are often the \"rare events\" that appear in the tails of a distribution. In a nutshell, ECOD first estimates the underlying distribution of the input data in a nonparametric fashion by computing the empirical cumulative distribution per dimension of the data. ECOD then uses these empirical distributions to estimate tail probabilities per dimension for each data point. Finally, ECOD computes an outlier score of each data point by aggregating estimated tail probabilities across dimensions. Our contributions are as follows: (1) we propose a novel outlier detection method called ECOD, which is both parameter-free and easy to interpret; (2) we perform extensive experiments on 30 benchmark datasets, where we find that ECOD outperforms 11 state-of-the-art baselines in terms of accuracy, efficiency, and scalability; and (3) we release an easy-to-use and scalable (with distributed support) Python implementation for accessibility and reproducibility.

Our method can provide different levels of security against GPS spoofing attacks, depending on the detection interval required; for example, it can provide a high level of security to a drone flying at an altitude of 50-100 meters over an urban area at an average speed of 4 km/h in conditions of low ambient light; in this scenario, the method can provide a level of security that detects any GPS spoofing attack in which the spoofed location is a distance of 1-4 meters (an average of 2.5 meters) from the real location.

    "abstract": "The effortless detection of salient objects by humans has been the subject of research in several fields, including computer vision as it has many applications. However, salient object detection remains a challenge for many computer models dealing with color and textured images. Herein, we propose a novel and efficient strategy, through a simple model, almost without internal parameters, which generates a robust saliency map for a natural image. This strategy consists of integrating color information into local textural patterns to characterize a color micro-texture. Most models in the literature that use the color and texture features treat them separately. In our case, it is the simple, yet powerful LTP (Local Ternary Patterns) texture descriptor applied to opposing color pairs of a color space that allows us to achieve this end. Each color micro-texture is represented by vector whose components are from a superpixel obtained by SLICO (Simple Linear Iterative Clustering with zero parameter) algorithm which is simple, fast and exhibits state-of-the-art boundary adherence. The degree of dissimilarity between each pair of color micro-texture is computed by the FastMap method, a fast version of MDS (Multi-dimensional Scaling), that considers the color micro-textures non-linearity while preserving their distances. These degrees of dissimilarity give us an intermediate saliency map for each RGB, HSL, LUV and CMY color spaces. The final saliency map is their combination to take advantage of the strength of each of them. The MAE (Mean Absolute Error) and F$_{\\beta}$ measures of our saliency maps, on the complex ECSSD dataset show that our model is both simple and efficient, outperforming several state-of-the-art models.

Although the existing methods train well-designed deep networks with a large amount of data, we find that they can easily forget the rarely appeared cases in the training stage due to the off-balance data distribution, which influences the model generalization and leads to undesirable performance. To tackle this issue, we propose a memory-augmented network, called Memory-Guided Semantic Learning Network (MGSL-Net), that learns and memorizes the rarely appeared content in TSG tasks. Specifically, MGSL-Net consists of three main parts: a cross-modal inter-action module, a memory augmentation module, and a heterogeneous attention module. We first align the given video-query pair by a cross-modal graph convolutional network, and then utilize a memory module to record the cross-modal shared semantic features in the domain-specific persistent memory. During training, the memory slots are dynamically associated with both common and rare cases, alleviating the forgetting issue. In testing, the rare cases can thus be enhanced by retrieving the stored memories, resulting in better generalization. At last, the heterogeneous attention module is utilized to integrate the enhanced multi-modal features in both video and query domains. Experimental results on three benchmarks show the superiority of our method on both effectiveness and efficiency, which substantially improves the accuracy not only on the entire dataset but also on rare cases.

Although previous reconstruction-based methods have made fruitful progress, their generalization ability is limited due to two critical challenges. First, the training dataset only contains normal patterns, which limits the model generalization ability. Second, the feature representations learned by existing models often lack representativeness which hampers the ability to preserve the diversity of normal patterns. In this paper, we propose a novel approach called Adaptive Memory Network with Self-supervised Learning (AMSL) to address these challenges and enhance the generalization ability in unsupervised anomaly detection. Based on the convolutional autoencoder structure, AMSL incorporates a self-supervised learning module to learn general normal patterns and an adaptive memory fusion module to learn rich feature representations. Experiments on four public multivariate time series datasets demonstrate that AMSL significantly improves the performance compared to other state-of-the-art methods. Specifically, on the largest CAP sleep stage detection dataset with 900 million samples, AMSL outperforms the second-best baseline by \\textbf{4}\\%+ in both accuracy and F1 score. Apart from the enhanced generalization ability, AMSL is also more robust against input noise. ",

Furthermore, we introduce a novel and effective OWOD framework containing an auxiliary Proposal ADvisor (PAD) and a Class-specific Expelling Classifier (CEC). The non-parametric PAD could assist the RPN in identifying accurate unknown proposals without supervision, while CEC calibrates the over-confident activation boundary and filters out confusing predictions through a class-specific expelling function.

In recent years, graph neural networks (GNNs) have become the state-of-the-art method in downstream graph-related tasks due to their superior performance. Most GNNs are based on Message Passing Neural Network (MPNN) frameworks. However, recent studies show that MPNNs can not exceed the power of the Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) algorithm in graph isomorphism test. To address the limitations of existing graph kernel and GNN methods, in this paper, we propose a novel GNN framework, termed \\textit{Kernel Graph Neural Networks} (KerGNNs), which integrates graph kernels into the message passing process of GNNs. Inspired by convolution filters in convolutional neural networks (CNNs), KerGNNs adopt trainable hidden graphs as graph filters which are combined with subgraphs to update node embeddings using graph kernels. In addition, we show that MPNNs can be viewed as special cases of KerGNNs. We apply KerGNNs to multiple graph-related tasks and use cross-validation to make fair comparisons with benchmarks. We show that our method achieves competitive performance compared with existing state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating the potential to increase the representation ability of GNNs.

Recently, infinite-dimensional Bayesian analysis methods are introduced to give a rigorous characterization and construct dimension-independent algorithms. However, there are three major challenges for infinite-dimensional Bayesian methods: prior measures usually only behaves like regularizers (can hardly incorporate prior information efficiently); complex noises (e.g., more practical non-identically distributed noises) are rarely considered; many computationally expensive forward PDEs need to be solved in order to estimate posterior statistical quantities. To address these issues, we propose a general infinite-dimensional inference framework based on a detailed analysis on the infinite-dimensional variational inference method and the ideas of deep generative models that are popular in the machine learning community. Specifically, by introducing some measure equivalence assumptions, we derive the evidence lower bound in the infinite-dimensional setting and provide possible parametric strategies that yield a general inference framework named variational inverting network (VINet). This inference framework has the ability to encode prior and noise information from learning examples. In addition, relying on the power of deep neural networks, the posterior mean and variance can be efficiently generated in the inference stage in an explicit manner. In numerical experiments, we design specific network structures that yield a computable VINet from the general inference framework.Numerical examples of linear inverse problems governed by an elliptic equation and the Helmholtz equation are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed inference framework.

One noteworthy application is the perception system for autonomous driving that relies on the predictions from CNNs. Practitioners evaluate the generalization ability of such CNNs by calculating various metrics on an independent test dataset. A test dataset is often chosen based on only one precondition, i.e., its elements are not a part of the training data. Such a dataset may contain objects that are both similar and novel w.r.t. the training dataset. Nevertheless, existing works do not reckon the novelty of the test samples and treat them all equally for evaluating generalization. Such novelty-based evaluations are of significance to validate the fitness of a CNN in autonomous driving applications. Hence, we propose a CNN generalization scoring framework that considers novelty of objects in the test dataset. We begin with the representation learning technique to reduce the image data into a low-dimensional space. It is on this space we estimate the novelty of the test samples. Finally, we calculate the generalization score as a combination of the test data prediction performance and novelty. We perform an experimental study of the same for our traffic light detection application. In addition, we systematically visualize the results for an interpretable notion of novelty. ",

    "abstract": "One major drawback of deep neural networks (DNNs) for use in sensitive application domains is their black-box nature. This makes it hard to verify or monitor complex, symbolic requirements. In this work, we present a simple, yet effective, approach to verify whether a trained convolutional neural network (CNN) respects specified symbolic background knowledge. The knowledge may consist of any fuzzy predicate logic rules. For this, we utilize methods from explainable artificial intelligence (XAI): First, using concept embedding analysis, the output of a computer vision CNN is post-hoc enriched by concept outputs; second, logical rules from prior knowledge are fuzzified to serve as continuous-valued functions on the concept outputs. These can be evaluated with little computational overhead. We demonstrate three diverse use-cases of our method on stateof-the-art object detectors: Finding corner cases, utilizing the rules for detecting and localizing DNN misbehavior during runtime, and comparing the logical consistency of DNNs. The latter is used to find related differences between EfficientDet D1 and Mask R-CNN object detectors. We show that this approach benefits from fuzziness and calibrating the concept outputs. ",

    "abstract": "Preventing and detecting intrusions and attacks on wireless networks has become an important and serious challenge. On the other hand, due to the limited resources of wireless nodes, the use of monitoring nodes for permanent monitoring in wireless sensor networks in order to prevent and detect intrusion and attacks in this type of network is practically non-existent. Therefore, the solution to overcome this problem today is the discussion of remote-control systems and has become one of the topics of interest in various fields. Remote monitoring of node performance and behavior in wireless sensor networks, in addition to detecting malicious nodes within the network, can also predict malicious node behavior in future. In present research, a network intrusion detection system using feature selection based on a combination of Whale optimization algorithm (WOA) and genetic algorithm (GA) and sample-based classification is proposed. In this research, the standard data set KDDCUP1999 has been used in which the characteristics related to healthy nodes and types of malicious nodes are stored based on the type of attacks in the network. The proposed method is based on the combination of feature selection based on Whale optimization algorithm and genetic algorithm with KNN classification in terms of accuracy criteria, has better results than other previous methods. Based on this, it can be said that the Whale optimization algorithm and the genetic algorithm have extracted the features related to the class label well, and the KNN method has been able to well detect the misconduct nodes in the intrusion detection data set in wireless networks.

This is performed in a tightly coupled fashion using a Dynamic Network approach that results in an optimally compensated trajectory through modeling of errors at the sensor, rather than the trajectory, level. The 3D correspondences are formulated as static conditions within this network and the registered point cloud is generated with higher accuracy utilizing the corrected trajectory and possibly other parameters determined within the adjustment. We first describe the method for selecting correspondences and how they are inserted into the Dynamic Network as new observation models. We then describe the experiments conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed framework in practical airborne laser scanning scenarios with low-cost MEMS inertial sensors. In the conducted experiments, the method proposed to establish 3D correspondences is effective in determining point--to--point matches across a wide range of geometries such as trees, buildings and cars. Our results demonstrate that the method improves the point cloud registration accuracy, that is otherwise strongly affected by errors in the determined platform attitude or position (in nominal and emulated GNSS outage conditions), and possibly determine unknown boresight angles using only a fraction of the total number of 3D correspondences that are established.

    "abstract": "Toxic content is one of the most critical issues for social media platforms today. India alone had 518 million social media users in 2020. In order to provide a good experience to content creators and their audience, it is crucial to flag toxic comments and the users who post that. But the big challenge is identifying toxicity in low resource Indic languages because of the presence of multiple representations of the same text. Moreover, the posts/comments on social media do not adhere to a particular format, grammar or sentence structure; this makes the task of abuse detection even more challenging for multilingual social media platforms. This paper describes the system proposed by team 'Moj Masti' using the data provided by ShareChat/Moj in \\emph{IIIT-D Multilingual Abusive Comment Identification} challenge. We focus on how we can leverage multilingual transformer based pre-trained and fine-tuned models to approach code-mixed/code-switched classification tasks. Our best performing system was an ensemble of XLM-RoBERTa and MuRIL which achieved a Mean F-1 score of 0.9 on the test data/leaderboard. We also observed an increase in the performance by adding transliterated data. Furthermore, using weak metadata, ensembling and some post-processing techniques boosted the performance of our system, thereby placing us 1st on the leaderboard. ",

Today's best neural stance detectors need large volumes of training data, which is difficult to curate given the fast-changing landscape of social media text and issues on which users opine. Homophily properties over the social network provide strong signal of coarse-grained user-level stance. But semi-supervised approaches for tweet-level stance detection fail to properly leverage homophily. In light of this, We present SANDS, a new semi-supervised stance detector. SANDS starts from very few labeled tweets. It builds multiple deep feature views of tweets. It also uses a distant supervision signal from the social network to provide a surrogate loss signal to the component learners. We prepare two new tweet datasets comprising over 236,000 politically tinted tweets from two demographics (US and India) posted by over 87,000 users, their follower-followee graph, and over 8,000 tweets annotated by linguists. SANDS achieves a macro-F1 score of 0.55 (0.49) on US (India)-based datasets, outperforming 17 baselines (including variants of SANDS) substantially, particularly for minority stance labels and noisy text. Numerous ablation experiments on SANDS disentangle the dynamics of textual and network-propagated stance signals. ",

Different from raster images, CAD drawings are vector graphics consisting of geometric primitives such as segments, arcs, and circles. By treating each CAD drawing as a graph, we propose a novel graph attention network GAT-CADNet to solve the panoptic symbol spotting problem: vertex features derived from the GAT branch are mapped to semantic labels, while their attention scores are cascaded and mapped to instance prediction. Our key contributions are three-fold: 1) the instance symbol spotting task is formulated as a subgraph detection problem and solved by predicting the adjacency matrix; 2) a relative spatial encoding (RSE) module explicitly encodes the relative positional and geometric relation among vertices to enhance the vertex attention; 3) a cascaded edge encoding (CEE) module extracts vertex attentions from multiple stages of GAT and treats them as edge encoding to predict the adjacency matrix. The proposed GAT-CADNet is intuitive yet effective and manages to solve the panoptic symbol spotting problem in one consolidated network. Extensive experiments and ablation studies on the public benchmark show that our graph-based approach surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods by a large margin. ",

This type of training problems has recently gained popularity since semidefinite constraints can be used to verify interesting properties for NNs that include, e.g., the estimation of an upper bound on the Lipschitz constant, which relates to the robustness of an NN, or the stability of dynamic systems with NN controllers. The utilized semidefinite constraints are based on sector constraints satisfied by the underlying activation functions. Unfortunately, one of the biggest bottlenecks of these new results is the required computational effort for incorporating the semidefinite constraints into the training of NNs which is limiting their scalability to large NNs. We address this challenge by developing interior point methods for NN training that we implement using barrier functions for semidefinite constraints. In order to efficiently compute the gradients of the barrier terms, we exploit the structure of the semidefinite constraints. In experiments, we demonstrate the superior efficiency of our training method over previous approaches, which allows us, e.g., to use semidefinite constraints in the training of Wasserstein generative adversarial networks, where the discriminator must satisfy a Lipschitz condition.

In this paper, we analyze how and whether recent neural architectures can be applied to graph problems of practical importance. We thus set out to systematically \"transfer\" these architectures to the Power and Channel Allocation Problem (PCAP), which has practical relevance for, e.g., radio resource allocation in wireless networks. Our experimental results suggest that existing architectures (i) are still incapable of capturing graph structural features and (ii) are not suitable for problems where the actions on the graph change the graph attributes. On a positive note, we show that augmenting the structural representation of problems with Distance Encoding is a promising step towards the still-ambitious goal of learning multi-purpose autonomous solvers.

    "abstract": "In recent years, many backdoor attacks based on training data poisoning have been proposed. However, in practice, those backdoor attacks are vulnerable to image compressions. When backdoor instances are compressed, the feature of specific backdoor trigger will be destroyed, which could result in the backdoor attack performance deteriorating. In this paper, we propose a compression-resistant backdoor attack based on feature consistency training. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first backdoor attack that is robust to image compressions. First, both backdoor images and their compressed versions are input into the deep neural network (DNN) for training. Then, the feature of each image is extracted by internal layers of the DNN. Next, the feature difference between backdoor images and their compressed versions are minimized. As a result, the DNN treats the feature of compressed images as the feature of backdoor images in feature space. After training, the backdoor attack against DNN is robust to image compression. Furthermore, we consider three different image compressions (i.e., JPEG, JPEG2000, WEBP) in feature consistency training, so that the backdoor attack is robust to multiple image compression algorithms. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed backdoor attack. When the backdoor instances are compressed, the attack success rate of common backdoor attack is lower than 10%, while the attack success rate of our compression-resistant backdoor is greater than 97%. The compression-resistant attack is still robust even when the backdoor images are compressed with low compression quality. In addition, extensive experiments have demonstrated that, our compression-resistant backdoor attack has the generalization ability to resist image compression which is not used in the training process.

Existing methods first train a model to predict the conversion probability of the advertisement journeys with historical data and calculate the attribution of each touchpoint using counterfactual predictions. An assumption of these works is the conversion prediction model is unbiased, i.e., it can give accurate predictions on any randomly assigned journey, including both the factual and counterfactual ones. Nevertheless, this assumption does not always hold as the exposed advertisements are recommended according to user preferences. This confounding bias of users would lead to an out-of-distribution (OOD) problem in the counterfactual prediction and cause concept drift in attribution. In this paper, we define the causal MTA task and propose CausalMTA to eliminate the influence of user preferences. It systemically eliminates the confounding bias from both static and dynamic preferences to learn the conversion prediction model using historical data. We also provide a theoretical analysis to prove CausalMTA can learn an unbiased prediction model with sufficient data. Extensive experiments on both public datasets and the impression data in an e-commerce company show that CausalMTA not only achieves better prediction performance than the state-of-the-art method but also generates meaningful attribution credits across different advertising channels.

Characterizing the content of the messages becomes vital for different tasks, like breaking news detection, personalized message recommendation, fake users detection, information flow characterization and others. However, Twitter posts are short and often less coherent than other text documents, which makes it challenging to apply text mining algorithms to these datasets efficiently. Tweet-pooling (aggregating tweets into longer documents) has been shown to improve automatic topic decomposition, but the performance achieved in this task varies depending on the pooling method. In this paper, we propose a new pooling scheme for topic modeling in Twitter, which groups tweets whose authors belong to the same community (group of users who mainly interact with each other but not with other groups) on a user interaction graph. We present a complete evaluation of this methodology, state of the art schemes and previous pooling models in terms of the cluster quality, document retrieval tasks performance and supervised machine learning classification score. Results show that our Community polling method outperformed other methods on the majority of metrics in two heterogeneous datasets, while also reducing the running time. This is useful when dealing with big amounts of noisy and short user-generated social media texts. Overall, our findings contribute to an improved methodology for identifying the latent topics in a Twitter dataset, without the need of modifying the basic machinery of a topic decomposition model.

    "abstract": "Large-scale or high-resolution geologic models usually comprise a huge number of grid blocks, which can be computationally demanding and time-consuming to solve with numerical simulators. Therefore, it is advantageous to upscale geologic models (e.g., hydraulic conductivity) from fine-scale (high-resolution grids) to coarse-scale systems. Numerical upscaling methods have been proven to be effective and robust for coarsening geologic models, but their efficiency remains to be improved. In this work, a deep-learning-based method is proposed to upscale the fine-scale geologic models, which can assist to improve upscaling efficiency significantly. In the deep learning method, a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) is trained to approximate the relationship between the coarse grid of hydraulic conductivity fields and the hydraulic heads, which can then be utilized to replace the numerical solvers while solving the flow equations for each coarse block. In addition, physical laws (e.g., governing equations and periodic boundary conditions) can also be incorporated into the training process of the deep CNN model, which is termed the theory-guided convolutional neural network (TgCNN). With the physical information considered, dependence on the data volume of training the deep learning models can be reduced greatly. Several subsurface flow cases are introduced to test the performance of the proposed deep-learning-based upscaling method, including 2D and 3D cases, and isotropic and anisotropic cases. The results show that the deep learning method can provide equivalent upscaling accuracy to the numerical method, and efficiency can be improved significantly compared to numerical upscaling. ",

Ensuring the proper functioning of a BSS is crucial given that these systems are committed to eradicating many of the current global concerns, by promoting environmental and economic sustainability and contributing to improving the life quality of the population. Good knowledge of users' transition patterns is a decisive contribution to the quality and operability of the service. The analogous and unbalanced users' transition patterns cause these systems to suffer from bicycle imbalance, leading to a drastic customer loss in the long term. Strategies for bicycle rebalancing become important to tackle this problem and for this, bicycle traffic prediction is essential, as it allows to operate more efficiently and to react in advance. In this work, we propose a bicycle trips predictor based on Graph Neural Network embeddings, taking into consideration station groupings, meteorology conditions, geographical distances, and trip patterns. We evaluated our approach in the New York City BSS (CitiBike) data and compared it with four baselines, including the non-clustered approach. To address our problem's specificities, we developed the Adaptive Transition Constraint Clustering Plus (AdaTC+) algorithm, eliminating shortcomings of previous work. Our experiments evidence the clustering pertinence (88% accuracy compared with 83% without clustering) and which clustering technique best suits this problem. Accuracy on the Link Prediction task is always higher for AdaTC+ than benchmark clustering methods when the stations are the same, while not degrading performance when the network is upgraded, in a mismatch with the trained model.

ANNs require a large amount of data to have strong out of sample performance, and many algorithms for training ANN parameters are based on stochastic gradient descent (SGD). However, the SGD ANNs that tend to perform best on prediction tasks are trained in an end to end manner that requires a large number of model parameters and random initialization. This means training ANNs is very time consuming and the resulting models take a lot of memory to deploy. In order to train more parsimonious ANN models, we propose the use of alternative methods from the constrained optimization literature for ANN training and pretraining. In particular, we propose novel mixed integer programming (MIP) formulations for training fully-connected ANNs. Our formulations can account for both binary activation and rectified linear unit (ReLU) activation ANNs, and for the use of a log likelihood loss. We also develop a layer-wise greedy approach, a technique adapted for reducing the number of layers in the ANN, for model pretraining using our MIP formulations. We then present numerical experiments comparing our MIP based methods against existing SGD based approaches and show that we are able to achieve models with competitive out of sample performance that are significantly more parsimonious.

    "abstract": "Federated Learning (FL) allows multiple clients to collaboratively train a Neural Network (NN) model on their private data without revealing the data. Recently, several targeted poisoning attacks against FL have been introduced. These attacks inject a backdoor into the resulting model that allows adversary-controlled inputs to be misclassified. Existing countermeasures against backdoor attacks are inefficient and often merely aim to exclude deviating models from the aggregation. However, this approach also removes benign models of clients with deviating data distributions, causing the aggregated model to perform poorly for such clients. To address this problem, we propose DeepSight, a novel model filtering approach for mitigating backdoor attacks. It is based on three novel techniques that allow to characterize the distribution of data used to train model updates and seek to measure fine-grained differences in the internal structure and outputs of NNs. Using these techniques, DeepSight can identify suspicious model updates. We also develop a scheme that can accurately cluster model updates. Combining the results of both components, DeepSight is able to identify and eliminate model clusters containing poisoned models with high attack impact. We also show that the backdoor contributions of possibly undetected poisoned models can be effectively mitigated with existing weight clipping-based defenses. We evaluate the performance and effectiveness of DeepSight and show that it can mitigate state-of-the-art backdoor attacks with a negligible impact on the model's performance on benign data. ",

    "abstract": "Recent natural language processing (NLP) techniques have accomplished high performance on benchmark datasets, primarily due to the significant improvement in the performance of deep learning. The advances in the research community have led to great enhancements in state-of-the-art production systems for NLP tasks, such as virtual assistants, speech recognition, and sentiment analysis. However, such NLP systems still often fail when tested with adversarial attacks. The initial lack of robustness exposed troubling gaps in current models' language understanding capabilities, creating problems when NLP systems are deployed in real life. In this paper, we present a structured overview of NLP robustness research by summarizing the literature in a systemic way across various dimensions. We then take a deep-dive into the various dimensions of robustness, across techniques, metrics, embeddings, and benchmarks. Finally, we argue that robustness should be multi-dimensional, provide insights into current research, identify gaps in the literature to suggest directions worth pursuing to address these gaps. ",

Several types of beyond-planar graphs have been investigated, such as k-planar if every edge is crossed at most k times and RAC if edges can cross only at a right angle in a straight-line drawing. A graph is optimal if the number of edges coincides with the density for its type. Optimal graphs are special and are known only for some types of beyond-planar graphs, including 1-planar, 2-planar, and RAC graphs. For all types of beyond-planar graphs for which optimal graphs are known, we compute the range for optimal graphs, establish combinatorial properties, and show that every graph is a topological minor of an optimal graph. Note that the minor property is well-known for general beyond-planar graphs. ",

    "abstract": "Many 3D representations (e.g., point clouds) are discrete samples of the underlying continuous 3D surface. This process inevitably introduces sampling variations on the underlying 3D shapes. In learning 3D representation, the variations should be disregarded while transferable knowledge of the underlying 3D shape should be captured. This becomes a grand challenge in existing representation learning paradigms. This paper studies autoencoding on point clouds. The standard autoencoding paradigm forces the encoder to capture such sampling variations as the decoder has to reconstruct the original point cloud that has sampling variations. We introduce Implicit Autoencoder(IAE), a simple yet effective method that addresses this challenge by replacing the point cloud decoder with an implicit decoder. The implicit decoder outputs a continuous representation that is shared among different point cloud sampling of the same model. Reconstructing under the implicit representation can prioritize that the encoder discards sampling variations, introducing more space to learn useful features. We theoretically justify this claim under a simple linear autoencoder. Moreover, the implicit decoder offers a rich space to design suitable implicit representations for different tasks. We demonstrate the usefulness of IAE across various self-supervised learning tasks for both 3D objects and 3D scenes. Experimental results show that IAE consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art in each task. ",

With given audio, the key to tackling this task is synchronizing lip movement and simultaneously generating personalized attributes like head movement and eye blink. In this work, we observe that the input audio is highly correlated to lip motion while less correlated to other personalized attributes (e.g., head movements). Inspired by this, we propose a novel framework based on neural radiance field to pursue high-fidelity and personalized talking head generation. Specifically, neural radiance field takes lip movements features and personalized attributes as two disentangled conditions, where lip movements are directly predicted from the audio inputs to achieve lip-synchronized generation. In the meanwhile, personalized attributes are sampled from a probabilistic model, where we design a Transformer-based variational autoencoder sampled from Gaussian Process to learn plausible and natural-looking head pose and eye blink. Experiments on several benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves significantly better results than state-of-the-art methods. ",

    "abstract": "Training deep models for RGB-D salient object detection (SOD) often requires a large number of labeled RGB-D images. However, RGB-D data is not easily acquired, which limits the development of RGB-D SOD techniques. To alleviate this issue, we present a Dual-Semi RGB-D Salient Object Detection Network (DS-Net) to leverage unlabeled RGB images for boosting RGB-D saliency detection. We first devise a depth decoupling convolutional neural network (DDCNN), which contains a depth estimation branch and a saliency detection branch. The depth estimation branch is trained with RGB-D images and then used to estimate the pseudo depth maps for all unlabeled RGB images to form the paired data. The saliency detection branch is used to fuse the RGB feature and depth feature to predict the RGB-D saliency. Then, the whole DDCNN is assigned as the backbone in a teacher-student framework for semi-supervised learning. Moreover, we also introduce a consistency loss on the intermediate attention and saliency maps for the unlabeled data, as well as a supervised depth and saliency loss for labeled data. Experimental results on seven widely-used benchmark datasets demonstrate that our DDCNN outperforms state-of-the-art methods both quantitatively and qualitatively. We also demonstrate that our semi-supervised DS-Net can further improve the performance, even when using an RGB image with the pseudo depth map. ",

Specifically, prosody vector is first extracted from pre-trained VQ-Wav2Vec model, where rich prosody information is embedded while most speaker and environment information are removed effectively by quantization. To further filter out the redundant information except prosody, such as content and partial speaker information, we propose two kinds of prosody filters to sample prosody from the prosody vector.

    "abstract": "As machine learning powered decision making is playing an increasingly important role in our daily lives, it is imperative to strive for fairness of the underlying data processing and algorithms. We propose a pre-processing algorithm for fair data representation via which L2- objective supervised learning algorithms result in an estimation of the Pareto frontier between prediction error and statistical disparity. In particular, the present work applies the optimal positive definite affine transport maps to approach the post-processing Wasserstein barycenter characterization of the optimal fair L2-objective supervised learning via a pre-processing data deformation. We call the resulting data Wasserstein pseudo-barycenter. Furthermore, we show that the Wasserstein geodesics from the learning outcome marginals to the barycenter characterizes the Pareto frontier between L2-loss and total Wasserstein distance among learning outcome marginals. Thereby, an application of McCann interpolation generalizes the pseudo-barycenter to a family of data representations via which L2-objective supervised learning algorithms result in the Pareto frontier. Numerical simulations underscore the advantages of the proposed data representation: (1) the pre-processing step is compositive with arbitrary L2-objective supervised learning methods and unseen data; (2) the fair representation protects data privacy by preventing the training machine from direct or indirect access to the sensitive information of the data; (3) the optimal affine map results in efficient computation of fair supervised learning on high-dimensional data; (4) experimental results shed light on the fairness of L2-objective unsupervised learning via the proposed fair data representation.

    "abstract": "For a hereditary family of graphs $\\FF$, let $\\FF_n$ denote the set of all members of $\\FF$ on $n$ vertices. The speed of $\\FF$ is the function $f(n)=|\\FF_n|$. An implicit representation of size $\\ell(n)$ for $\\FF_n$ is a function assigning a label of $\\ell(n)$ bits to each vertex of any given graph $G \\in \\FF_n$, so that the adjacency between any pair of vertices can be determined by their labels. Bonamy, Esperet, Groenland and Scott proved that the minimum possible size of an implicit representation of $\\FF_n$ for any hereditary family $\\FF$ with speed $2^{\\Omega(n^2)}$ is $(1+o(1)) \\log_2 |\\FF_n|/n~(=\\Theta(n))$. A recent result of Hatami and Hatami shows that the situation is very different for very sparse hereditary families. They showed that for every $\\delta>0$ there are hereditary families of graphs with speed $2^{O(n \\log n)}$ that do not admit implicit representations of size smaller than $n^{1/2-\\delta}$. In this note we show that even a mild speed bound ensures an implicit representation of size $O(n^c)$ for some $c<1$. Specifically we prove that for every $\\eps>0$ there is an integer $d \\geq 1$ so that if $\\FF$ is a hereditary family with speed $f(n) \\leq 2^{(1/4-\\eps)n^2}$ then $\\FF_n$ admits an implicit representation of size $O(n^{1-1/d} \\log n)$.

To predict the stocks of different companies, we use Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and LSTM, because these stocks change in time series. We carry on empirical experiments and perform on the stock indices dataset to evaluate the prediction performance in terms of several common error metrics such as Mean Square Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE).

Recent advances in the field of graph signal processing have made it possible to describe and analyze air pollution monitoring networks using graphs. One of the main applications is the reconstruction of the measured signal in a graph using a subset of sensors. Reconstructing the signal using information from sensor neighbors can help improve the quality of network data, examples are filling in missing data with correlated neighboring nodes, or correcting a drifting sensor with neighboring sensors that are more accurate. This paper compares the use of various types of graph signal reconstruction methods applied to real data sets of Spanish air pollution reference stations. The methods considered are Laplacian interpolation, graph signal processing low-pass based graph signal reconstruction, and kernel-based graph signal reconstruction, and are compared on actual air pollution data sets measuring O3, NO2, and PM10. The ability of the methods to reconstruct the signal of a pollutant is shown, as well as the computational cost of this reconstruction. The results indicate the superiority of methods based on kernel-based graph signal reconstruction, as well as the difficulties of the methods to scale in an air pollution monitoring network with a large number of low-cost sensors. However, we show that scalability can be overcome with simple methods, such as partitioning the network using a clustering algorithm. ",

As witnessed in recent literature, these deep networks are capable of overfitting their training distributions, causing inaccurate hallucinations to be added to the output and generalizing poorly to varying data. For better control and interpretability over a deep denoiser, we propose a novel framework exploiting a denoising network. We call it controllable confidence-based image denoising (CCID). In this framework, we exploit the outputs of a deep denoising network alongside an image convolved with a reliable filter. Such a filter can be a simple convolution kernel which does not risk adding hallucinated information. We propose to fuse the two components with a frequency-domain approach that takes into account the reliability of the deep network outputs. With our framework, the user can control the fusion of the two components in the frequency domain. We also provide a user-friendly map estimating spatially the confidence in the output that potentially contains network hallucination. Results show that our CCID not only provides more interpretability and control, but can even outperform both the quantitative performance of the deep denoiser and that of the reliable filter, especially when the test data diverge from the training data.

However, different equipments and ophthalmologists pose large variations to the quality of fundus images. Low-quality (LQ) degraded fundus images easily lead to uncertainty in clinical screening and generally increase the risk of misdiagnosis. Thus, real fundus image restoration is worth studying. Unfortunately, real clinical benchmark has not been explored for this task so far. In this paper, we investigate the real clinical fundus image restoration problem. Firstly, We establish a clinical dataset, Real Fundus (RF), including 120 low- and high-quality (HQ) image pairs. Then we propose a novel Transformer-based Generative Adversarial Network (RFormer) to restore the real degradation of clinical fundus images. The key component in our network is the Window-based Self-Attention Block (WSAB) which captures non-local self-similarity and long-range dependencies. To produce more visually pleasant results, a Transformer-based discriminator is introduced. Extensive experiments on our clinical benchmark show that the proposed RFormer significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. In addition, experiments of downstream tasks such as vessel segmentation and optic disc/cup detection demonstrate that our proposed RFormer benefits clinical fundus image analysis and applications. The dataset, code, and models will be released. ",

    "abstract": "Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is a notoriously noisy measurement of brain activity because of the large variations between individuals, signals marred by environmental differences during collection, and spatiotemporal averaging required by the measurement resolution. In addition, the data is extremely high dimensional, with the space of the activity typically having much lower intrinsic dimension. In order to understand the connection between stimuli of interest and brain activity, and analyze differences and commonalities between subjects, it becomes important to learn a meaningful embedding of the data that denoises, and reveals its intrinsic structure. Specifically, we assume that while noise varies significantly between individuals, true responses to stimuli will share common, low-dimensional features between subjects which are jointly discoverable. Similar approaches have been exploited previously but they have mainly used linear methods such as PCA and shared response modeling (SRM). In contrast, we propose a neural network called MRMD-AE (manifold-regularized multiple decoder, autoencoder), that learns a common embedding from multiple subjects in an experiment while retaining the ability to decode to individual raw fMRI signals. We show that our learned common space represents an extensible manifold (where new points not seen during training can be mapped), improves the classification accuracy of stimulus features of unseen timepoints, as well as improves cross-subject translation of fMRI signals. We believe this framework can be used for many downstream applications such as guided brain-computer interface (BCI) training in the future. ",

    "abstract": "To meet the growing mobility needs in intra-city transportation, the concept of urban air mobility (UAM) has been proposed in which vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) aircraft are used to provide a ride-hailing service. In UAM, aircraft can operate in designated air spaces known as corridors, that link the aerodromes. A reliable communication network between GBSs and aircraft enables UAM to adequately utilize the airspace and create a fast, efficient, and safe transportation system. In this paper, to characterize the wireless connectivity performance for UAM, a spatial model is proposed. For this setup, the distribution of the distance between an arbitrarily selected GBS and its associated aircraft and the Laplace transform of the interference experienced by the GBS are derived. Using these results, the signal-to-interference ratio (SIR)-based connectivity probability is determined to capture the connectivity performance of the UAM aircraft-to-ground communication network. Then, leveraging these connectivity results, a wireless-enabled asynchronous federated learning (AFL) framework that uses a Fourier neural network is proposed to tackle the challenging problem of turbulence prediction during UAM operations. For this AFL scheme, a staleness-aware global aggregation scheme is introduced to expedite the convergence to the optimal turbulence prediction model used by UAM aircraft. Simulation results validate the theoretical derivations for the UAM wireless connectivity. The results also demonstrate that the proposed AFL framework converges to the optimal turbulence prediction model faster than the synchronous federated learning baselines and a staleness-free AFL approach. Furthermore, the results characterize the performance of wireless connectivity and convergence of the aircraft's turbulence model under different parameter settings, offering useful UAM design guidelines.

Automatically detecting and quantifying such decoding uncertainty is important for BCI motor imagery applications such as robotic arm control etc. In this work, we proposed an uncertainty estimation model (UE-EEG) to explore the uncertainty during the EEG decoding process, which considers both the uncertainty in the input signal and the uncertainty in the model. The model utilized dropout oriented method for model uncertainty estimation, and Bayesian neural network is adopted for modeling the uncertainty of input data. The model can be integrated into current widely used deep learning classifiers without change of architecture. We performed extensive experiments for uncertainty estimation in both intra-subject EEG decoding and cross-subject EEG decoding on two public motor imagery datasets, where the proposed model achieves significant improvement on the quality of estimated uncertainty and demonstrates the proposed UE-EEG is a useful tool for BCI applications.

    "abstract": "As the second most common neurodegenerative disease, Parkinson's disease has caused serious problems worldwide. However, the cause and mechanism of PD are not clear, and no systematic early diagnosis and treatment of PD have been established, many patients with PD have not been diagnosed or misdiagnosed. In this paper, we proposed an EEG-based approach to diagnosing Parkinson's disease, it mapping the frequency band energy of EEG signals to 2-dimensional images using the interpolation method and identifying classification using CapsNet, achieved 89.34% classification accuracy for short-time EEG sections, which exceeds the conventional SVM model.A comparison of separate classification accuracy across different EEG bands revealed the highest accuracy in the gamma bands, suggesting that we need pay more attention to the changes in gamma band changes in the early stages of PD.

    "title": "PowerGraph: Using neural networks and principal components to  multivariate statistical power trade-offs",
    "abstract": "It is increasingly acknowledged that a priori statistical power estimation for planned studies with multiple model parameters is inherently a multivariate problem. Power for individual parameters of interest cannot be reliably estimated univariately because sampling variably in, correlation with, and variance explained relative to one parameter will impact the power for another parameter, all usual univariate considerations being equal. Explicit solutions in such cases, especially for models with many parameters, are either impractical or impossible to solve, leaving researchers with the prevailing method of simulating power. However, point estimates for a vector of model parameters are uncertain, and the impact of inaccuracy is unknown. In such cases, sensitivity analysis is recommended such that multiple combinations of possible observable parameter vectors are simulated to understand power trade-offs. A limitation to this approach is that it is computationally expensive to generate sufficient sensitivity combinations to accurately map the power trade-off function in increasingly high dimensional spaces for the models that social scientists estimate. This paper explores the efficient estimation and graphing of statistical power for a study over varying model parameter combinations. Optimally powering a study is crucial to ensure a minimum probability of finding the hypothesized effect. We first demonstrate the impact of varying parameter values on power for specific hypotheses of interest and quantify the computational intensity of computing such a graph for a given level of precision. Finally, we propose a simple and generalizable machine learning inspired solution to cut the computational cost to less than 7\\% of what could be called a brute force approach. [abridged] ",

    "abstract": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common fatal cancer in the world. Polypectomy can effectively interrupt the progression of adenoma to adenocarcinoma, thus reducing the risk of CRC development. Colonoscopy is the primary method to find colonic polyps. However, due to the different sizes of polyps and the unclear boundary between polyps and their surrounding mucosa, it is challenging to segment polyps accurately. To address this problem, we design a Boundary Distribution Guided Network (BDG-Net) for accurate polyp segmentation. Specifically, under the supervision of the ideal Boundary Distribution Map (BDM), we use Boundary Distribution Generate Module (BDGM) to aggregate high-level features and generate BDM. Then, BDM is sent to the Boundary Distribution Guided Decoder (BDGD) as complementary spatial information to guide the polyp segmentation. Moreover, a multi-scale feature interaction strategy is adopted in BDGD to improve the segmentation accuracy of polyps with different sizes. Extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of our model, which outperforms state-of-the-art models remarkably on five public polyp datasets while maintaining low computational complexity.

    "title": "Revisiting PGD Attacks for Stability Analysis of Large-Scale Nonlinear  Systems and Perception-Based Control",
    "abstract": "Many existing region-of-attraction (ROA) analysis tools find difficulty in addressing feedback systems with large-scale neural network (NN) policies and/or high-dimensional sensing modalities such as cameras. In this paper, we tailor the projected gradient descent (PGD) attack method developed in the adversarial learning community as a general-purpose ROA analysis tool for large-scale nonlinear systems and end-to-end perception-based control. We show that the ROA analysis can be approximated as a constrained maximization problem whose goal is to find the worst-case initial condition which shifts the terminal state the most. Then we present two PGD-based iterative methods which can be used to solve the resultant constrained maximization problem. Our analysis is not based on Lyapunov theory, and hence requires minimum information of the problem structures. In the model-based setting, we show that the PGD updates can be efficiently performed using back-propagation. In the model-free setting (which is more relevant to ROA analysis of perception-based control), we propose a finite-difference PGD estimate which is general and only requires a black-box simulator for generating the trajectories of the closed-loop system given any initial state. We demonstrate the scalability and generality of our analysis tool on several numerical examples with large-scale NN policies and high-dimensional image observations. We believe that our proposed analysis serves as a meaningful initial step toward further understanding of closed-loop stability of large-scale nonlinear systems and perception-based control. ",
