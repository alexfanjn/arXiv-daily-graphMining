    "abstract": "In the current connected world - Websites, Mobile Apps, IoT Devices collect a large volume of users' personally identifiable activity data. These collected data is used for varied purposes of analytics, marketing, personalization of services, etc. Data is assimilated through site cookies, tracking device IDs, embedded JavaScript, Pixels, etc. to name a few. Many of these tracking and usage of collected data happens behind the scenes and is not apparent to an average user. Consequently, many Countries and Regions have formulated legislations (e.g., GDPR, EU) - that allow users to be able to control their personal data, be informed and consent to its processing in a comprehensible and user-friendly manner. This paper proposes a protocol and a platform based on Blockchain Technology that enables the transparent processing of personal data throughout its lifecycle from capture, lineage to redaction. The solution intends to help service multiple stakeholders from individual end-users to Data Controllers and Privacy Officers. It intends to offer a holistic and unambiguous view of how and when the data points are captured, accessed, and processed. The framework also envisages how different access control policies might be created and enforced through a public blockchain including real time alerts for privacy data breach. ",

To design low-latency network topologies for high-performance computing clusters, we optimize the diameters, mean path lengths, and bisection widths of circulant topologies. We obtain a series of optimal circulant topologies of size $2^5$ through $2^{10}$ and compare them with torus and hypercube of the same sizes and degrees. We further benchmark on a broad variety of applications including effective bandwidth, FFTE, Graph 500 and NAS parallel benchmarks to compare the optimal circulant topologies and Cartesian products of optimal circulant topologies and fully connected topologies with corresponding torus and hypercube. Simulation results demonstrate superior potentials of the optimal circulant topologies for communication-intensive applications. We also find the strengths of the Cartesian products in exploiting global communication with data traffic patterns of specific applications or internal algorithms. ",

    "abstract": "It has been argued by Thom and Palm that sparsely-connected neural networks (SCNs) show improved performance over fully-connected networks (FCNs). Super-regular networks (SRNs) are neural networks composed of a set of stacked sparse layers of (epsilon, delta)-super-regular pairs, and randomly permuted node order. Using the Blow-up Lemma, we prove that as a result of the individual super-regularity of each pair of layers, SRNs guarantee a number of properties that make them suitable replacements for FCNs for many tasks. These guarantees include edge uniformity across all large-enough subsets, minimum node in- and out-degree, input-output sensitivity, and the ability to embed pre-trained constructs. Indeed, SRNs have the capacity to act like FCNs, and eliminate the need for costly regularization schemes like Dropout. We show that SRNs perform similarly to X-Nets via readily reproducible experiments, and offer far greater guarantees and control over network structure. ",

The success of graph neural networks is linked to the message-passing mechanism on the graph, however, the message-aggregating behavior is still not entirely clear in most algorithms. To improve functionality, we propose a new transparent network called Graph Decipher to investigate the message-passing mechanism by prioritizing in two main components: the graph structure and node attributes, at the graph, feature, and global levels on a graph under the node classification task. However, the computation burden now becomes the most significant issue because the relevance of both graph structure and node attributes are computed on a graph. In order to solve this issue, only relevant representative node attributes are extracted by graph feature filters, allowing calculations to be performed in a category-oriented manner. Experiments on seven datasets show that Graph Decipher achieves state-of-the-art performance while imposing a substantially lower computation burden under the node classification task. Additionally, since our algorithm has the ability to explore the representative node attributes by category, it is utilized to alleviate the imbalanced node classification problem on multi-class graph datasets.

    "abstract": "Static graph neural networks have been widely used in modeling and representation learning of graph structure data. However, many real-world problems, such as social networks, financial transactions, recommendation systems, etc., are dynamic, that is, nodes and edges are added or deleted over time. Therefore, in recent years, dynamic graph neural networks have received more and more attention from researchers. In this work, we propose a novel dynamic graph neural network, Efficient-Dyn. It adaptively encodes temporal information into a sequence of patches with an equal amount of temporal-topological structure. Therefore, while avoiding the use of snapshots to cause information loss, it also achieves a finer time granularity, which is close to what continuous networks could provide. In addition, we also designed a lightweight module, Sparse Temporal Transformer, to compute node representations through both structural neighborhoods and temporal dynamics. Since the fully-connected attention conjunction is simplified, the computation cost is far lower than the current state-of-the-arts. Link prediction experiments are conducted on both continuous and discrete graph datasets. Through comparing with several state-of-the-art graph embedding baselines, the experimental results demonstrate that Efficient-Dyn has a faster inference speed while having competitive performance.

In this study, we explored the performance of a Siamese neural network using contrastive loss by learning to push apart embeddings of bumblebee species pair that are dissimilar, and pull together similar embeddings.

In order to integrate a large number of neurons, neurons need to be designed to occupy a small area, but as technology scales down, analog neurons are difficult to scale, and they suffer from reduced voltage headroom/dynamic range and circuit nonlinearities. In light of this, this paper first models the nonlinear behavior of existing current-mirror-based voltage-domain neurons designed in a 28nm process, and show SNN inference accuracy can be severely degraded by the effect of neuron's nonlinearity. Then, to mitigate this problem, we propose a novel neuron, which processes incoming spikes in the time domain and greatly improves the linearity, thereby improving the inference accuracy compared to the existing voltage-domain neuron. Tested on the MNIST dataset, the inference error rate of the proposed neuron differs by less than 0.1% from that of the ideal neuron. ",

    "abstract": "Adverse drug reactions / events (ADR/ADE) have a major impact on patient health and health care costs. Detecting ADR's as early as possible and sharing them with regulators, pharma companies, and healthcare providers can prevent morbidity and save many lives. While most ADR's are not reported via formal channels, they are often documented in a variety of unstructured conversations such as social media posts by patients, customer support call transcripts, or CRM notes of meetings between healthcare providers and pharma sales reps. In this paper, we propose a natural language processing (NLP) solution that detects ADR's in such unstructured free-text conversations, which improves on previous work in three ways. First, a new Named Entity Recognition (NER) model obtains new state-of-the-art accuracy for ADR and Drug entity extraction on the ADE, CADEC, and SMM4H benchmark datasets (91.75%, 78.76%, and 83.41% F1 scores respectively). Second, two new Relation Extraction (RE) models are introduced - one based on BioBERT while the other utilizing crafted features over a Fully Connected Neural Network (FCNN) - are shown to perform on par with existing state-of-the-art models, and outperform them when trained with a supplementary clinician-annotated RE dataset. Third, a new text classification model, for deciding if a conversation includes an ADR, obtains new state-of-the-art accuracy on the CADEC dataset (86.69% F1 score). The complete solution is implemented as a unified NLP pipeline in a production-grade library built on top of Apache Spark, making it natively scalable and able to process millions of batch or streaming records on commodity clusters.

The camera is localized using a single or few observed images and training images with 6-degree-of-freedom pose labels. A Siamese network structure is adopted to train an image descriptor network, and the visually similar candidate image in the training set is retrieved to localize the testing image geometrically. Meanwhile, a probabilistic motion model predicts the pose based on a constant velocity assumption. The two estimated poses are finally fused using their uncertainties to yield an accurate pose prediction. This method leverages the geometric uncertainty and is applicable in indoor scenarios predominated by diffuse illumination. Experiments on simulation and real data sets demonstrate the efficiency of our proposed method. The results further show that combining the CNN-based framework with geometric constraint achieves better accuracy when compared with CNN-only methods, especially when the training data size is small.

    "abstract": "Federated learning (FL) is a widely adopted distributed learning paradigm in practice, which intends to preserve users' data privacy while leveraging the entire dataset of all participants for training. In FL, multiple models are trained independently on the users and aggregated centrally to update a global model in an iterative process. Although this approach is excellent at preserving privacy by design, FL still tends to suffer from quality issues such as attacks or byzantine faults. Some recent attempts have been made to address such quality challenges on the robust aggregation techniques for FL. However, the effectiveness of state-of-the-art (SOTA) robust FL techniques is still unclear and lacks a comprehensive study. Therefore, to better understand the current quality status and challenges of these SOTA FL techniques in the presence of attacks and faults, in this paper, we perform a large-scale empirical study to investigate the SOTA FL's quality from multiple angles of attacks, simulated faults (via mutation operators), and aggregation (defense) methods. In particular, we perform our study on two generic image datasets and one real-world federated medical image dataset. We also systematically investigate the effect of the distribution of attacks/faults over users and the independent and identically distributed (IID) factors, per dataset, on the robustness results. After a large-scale analysis with 496 configurations, we find that most mutators on each individual user have a negligible effect on the final model. Moreover, choosing the most robust FL aggregator depends on the attacks and datasets. Finally, we illustrate that it is possible to achieve a generic solution that works almost as well or even better than any single aggregator on all attacks and configurations with a simple ensemble model of aggregators.

    "abstract": "This paper introduces a new neural network-based estimation approach that is inspired by the biological phenomenon whereby humans and animals vary the levels of attention and effort that they dedicate to a problem depending upon its difficulty. The proposed approach leverages alternate models' internal levels of confidence in their own projections. If the least costly model is confident in its classification, then that is the classification used; if not, the model with the next lowest cost of implementation is run, and so on. This use of successively more complex models -- together with the models' internal propensity scores to evaluate their likelihood of being correct -- makes it possible to substantially reduce resource use while maintaining high standards for classification accuracy. The approach is applied to the digit recognition problem from Google's Street View House Numbers dataset, using Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) neural networks trained on high- and low-resolution versions of the digit images. The algorithm examines the low-resolution images first, only moving to higher resolution images if the classification from the initial low-resolution pass does not have a high degree of confidence. For the MLPs considered here, this sequential approach enables a reduction in resource usage of more than 50\\% without any sacrifice in classification accuracy. ",

As the task of classifying anomalies becomes more important in the real world, various methods exist for classifying using deep learning with data collected in the real world. As the task of classifying anomalies becomes more important in the real world, there are various methods for classifying using deep learning with data collected in the real world. Among the various methods, the representative approach is a method of extracting and learning the main features based on a transition model from pre-trained models, and a method of learning an autoencoderbased structure only with normal data and classifying it as abnormal through a threshold value. However, if the dataset is imbalanced, even the state-of-the-arts models do not achieve good performance. This can be addressed by augmenting normal and abnormal features in imbalanced data as features with strong distinction. We use the features of the autoencoder to train latent vectors from low to high dimensionality. We train normal and abnormal data as a feature that has a strong distinction among the features of imbalanced data. We propose a latent vector expansion autoencoder model that improves classification performance at imbalanced data.

The approximation performance of our algorithm is better than that of a PTAS.

Under the proposed decision-making framework, in this work, a representative urban driving scenario, i.e. the unsignalized intersection, is investigated. Once the vehicle enters the focused zone, it will interact with other CAVs and make collaborative decisions. To evaluate the safety risk of surrounding vehicles and reduce the complexity of the decision-making algorithm, the driving risk assessment algorithm is designed with a Gaussian potential field approach. The decision-making cost function is constructed by considering the driving safety and passing efficiency of CAVs. Additionally, decision-making constraints are designed and include safety, comfort, efficiency, control and stability. Based on the cost function and constraints, the fuzzy coalitional game approach is applied to the decision-making issue of CAVs at unsignalized intersections. Two types of fuzzy coalitions are constructed that reflect both individual and social benefits. The benefit allocation in the two types of fuzzy coalitions is associated with the driving aggressiveness of CAVs. Finally, the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed decision-making framework are verified with three test cases. ",

Finally, exploratory analysis can be conducted on the stable LON from both qualitative and quantitative perspectives. In experiments, we choose four widely used real-world configurable software systems to develop benchmark platforms under 42 different running environments. From our empirical study, we find that LONViZ enables both qualitative and quantitative analysis and disclose various interesting hidden patterns and properties of different software systems. ",

Our results show that the degree of correlation is different for each set and measure, indicating that there is no overall \"better\" measure.

To overcome this barrier, one can build a model based on machine learning. A model can be trained to recognize different gestures of sign language and translate them into English. This will help a lot of people in communicating and conversing with deaf and dumb people. The existing Indian Sing Language Recognition systems are designed using machine learning algorithms with single and double-handed gestures but they are not real-time. In this paper, we propose a method to create an Indian Sign Language dataset using a webcam and then using transfer learning, train a TensorFlow model to create a real-time Sign Language Recognition system. The system achieves a good level of accuracy even with a limited size dataset. ",

    "abstract": "Depth estimation is solved as a regression or classification problem in existing learning-based multi-view stereo methods. Although these two representations have recently demonstrated their excellent performance, they still have apparent shortcomings, e.g., regression methods tend to overfit due to the indirect learning cost volume, and classification methods cannot directly infer the exact depth due to its discrete prediction. In this paper, we propose a novel representation, termed Unification, to unify the advantages of regression and classification. It can directly constrain the cost volume like classification methods, but also realize the sub-pixel depth prediction like regression methods. To excavate the potential of unification, we design a new loss function named Unified Focal Loss, which is more uniform and reasonable to combat the challenge of sample imbalance. Combining these two unburdened modules, we present a coarse-to-fine framework, that we call UniMVSNet. The results of ranking first on both DTU and Tanks and Temples benchmarks verify that our model not only performs the best but also has the best generalization ability. ",

A novel model of multiagent systems is proposed where the information transmissions between agents are disturbed by irregular distortions or interferences (named transmission constraint functions), and this model is universal which can be applied in many cases, such as interval consensus and discarded consensus. In the transmission-constrained consensus problem, we obtain the necessary and sufficient condition that agents can converge to state consensus. Furthermore, a more general case is studied in which the system reaches an equilibrium. Based on some techniques of algebraic topology and stability theory, the existence, uniqueness and stability of the system equilibrium point can be proven, which means the system can reach an asymptotically stable equilibrium. Moreover, the state values of the equilibrium are only decided by the network structure and transmission constraint functions, but not the agents' initial states. Finally, numerical simulations are presented to illustrate the proposed theorems and corollaries. ",

    "abstract": "Learning to solve combinatorial optimization problems, such as the vehicle routing problem, offers great computational advantages over classical operations research solvers and heuristics. The recently developed deep reinforcement learning approaches either improve an initially given solution iteratively or sequentially construct a set of individual tours. However, most of the existing learning-based approaches are not able to work for a fixed number of vehicles and thus bypass the complex assignment problem of the customers onto an apriori given number of available vehicles. On the other hand, this makes them less suitable for real applications, as many logistic service providers rely on solutions provided for a specific bounded fleet size and cannot accommodate short term changes to the number of vehicles. In contrast we propose a powerful supervised deep learning framework that constructs a complete tour plan from scratch while respecting an apriori fixed number of available vehicles. In combination with an efficient post-processing scheme, our supervised approach is not only much faster and easier to train but also achieves competitive results that incorporate the practical aspect of vehicle costs. In thorough controlled experiments we compare our method to multiple state-of-the-art approaches where we demonstrate stable performance, while utilizing less vehicles and shed some light on existent inconsistencies in the experimentation protocols of the related work.

    "abstract": "Recent years have seen the successful application of large pre-trained models to code representation learning, resulting in substantial improvements on many code-related downstream tasks. But there are issues surrounding their application to SE tasks. First, the majority of the pre-trained models focus on pre-training only the encoder of the Transformer. For generation tasks that are addressed using models with the encoder-decoder architecture, however, there is no reason why the decoder should be left out during pre-training. Second, many existing pre-trained models, including state-of-the-art models such as T5-learning, simply reuse the pre-training tasks designed for natural languages. Moreover, to learn the natural language description of source code needed eventually for code-related tasks such as code summarization, existing pre-training tasks require a bilingual corpus composed of source code and the associated natural language description, which severely limits the amount of data for pre-training. To this end, we propose SPT-Code, a sequence-to-sequence pre-trained model for source code. In order to pre-train SPT-Code in a sequence-to-sequence manner and address the aforementioned weaknesses associated with existing pre-training tasks, we introduce three pre-training tasks that are specifically designed to enable SPT-Code to learn knowledge of source code, the corresponding code structure, as well as a natural language description of the code without relying on any bilingual corpus, and eventually exploit these three sources of information when it is applied to downstream tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that SPT-Code achieves state-of-the-art performance on five code-related downstream tasks after fine-tuning. ",

In this paper, we propose an adaptive scheduling approach for network packet processing applications, that supports any heterogeneous and asymmetric architectures that can be found in a commodity high-end hardware setup. Our scheduler not only distributes the workloads to the appropriate devices in the system to achieve the desired performance results, but also enables the multiplexing of diverse network packet processing applications that execute concurrently, eliminating the interference effects introduced at runtime. The evaluation results show that our scheduler is able to tackle interferences in the shared hardware resources as well to respond quickly to dynamic fluctuations (e.g., application overloads, traffic bursts, infrastructural changes, etc.) that may occur at real time.

A few types of radiation like Total Ionizing Dose (TID) effects often cause permanent damages on such nanoscale electronic devices, and current state-of-the-art technologies to tackle TID make use of expensive radiation-hardened devices. This paper focuses on a novel and different approach: using machine learning algorithms on consumer electronic level Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) to tackle TID effects and monitor them to replace before they stop working. This condition has a research challenge to anticipate when the board results in a total failure due to TID effects. We observed internal measurements of the FPGA boards under gamma radiation and used three different anomaly detection machine learning (ML) algorithms to detect anomalies in the sensor measurements in a gamma-radiated environment. The statistical results show a highly significant relationship between the gamma radiation exposure levels and the board measurements. Moreover, our anomaly detection results have shown that a One-Class Support Vector Machine with Radial Basis Function Kernel has an average Recall score of 0.95. Also, all anomalies can be detected before the boards stop working. ",

Biphasic face photo-sketch synthesis could be applied in wide-ranging fields such as digital entertainment and law enforcement. However, generating realistic photos and distinct sketches suffers from great challenges due to the low quality of sketches and complex photo variations in the real scenes. To this end, we propose a novel Semantic-Driven Generative Adversarial Network to address the above issues, cooperating with the Graph Representation Learning. Specifically, we inject class-wise semantic layouts into the generator to provide style-based spatial supervision for synthesized face photos and sketches. In addition, to improve the fidelity of the generated results, we leverage the semantic layouts to construct two types of Representational Graphs which indicate the intra-class semantic features and inter-class structural features of the synthesized images. Furthermore, we design two types of constraints based on the proposed Representational Graphs which facilitate the preservation of the details in generated face photos and sketches. Moreover, to further enhance the perceptual quality of synthesized images, we propose a novel biphasic training strategy which is dedicated to refine the generated results through Iterative Cycle Training. Extensive experiments are conducted on CUFS and CUFSF datasets to demonstrate the prominent ability of our proposed method which achieves the state-of-the-art performance. ",

CB-graphs and CB-groups generalize systolic (alias bridged) and weakly systolic graphs and groups, which play an important role in geometric group theory. We present metric and local-to-global characterizations of CB-graphs. Namely, we characterize CB-graphs $G$ as graphs whose triangle-pentagonal complexes $X(G)$ are simply connected and balls of radius at most $3$ are convex. Similarly to systolic and weakly systolic graphs, we prove a dismantlability result for CB-graphs $G$: we show that their squares $G^2$ are dismantlable. This implies that the Rips complexes of CB-graphs are contractible. Finally, we adapt and extend the approach of Januszkiewicz and Swiatkowski (2006) for systolic groups and of Chalopin et al.

Unlike centralized training that is usually based on carefully-organized data, FL deals with on-device data that are often unfiltered and imbalanced. As a result, conventional FL training protocol that treats all data equally leads to a waste of local computational resources and slows down the global learning process. To this end, we propose FedBalancer, a systematic FL framework that actively selects clients' training samples. Our sample selection strategy prioritizes more \"informative\" data while respecting privacy and computational capabilities of clients. To better utilize the sample selection to speed up global training, we further introduce an adaptive deadline control scheme that predicts the optimal deadline for each round with varying client train data. Compared with existing FL algorithms with deadline configuration methods, our evaluation on five datasets from three different domains shows that FedBalancer improves the time-to-accuracy performance by 1.22~4.62x while improving the model accuracy by 1.0~3.3%. We also show that FedBalancer is readily applicable to other FL approaches by demonstrating that FedBalancer improves the convergence speed and accuracy when operating jointly with three different FL algorithms.

In this paper we propose a deep learning-based graph matching framework that works for the original QAP without compromising on the matching constraints. In particular, we design an affinity-assignment prediction network to jointly learn the pairwise affinity and estimate the node assignments, and we then develop a differentiable solver inspired by the probabilistic perspective of the pairwise affinities. Aiming to obtain better matching results, the probabilistic solver refines the estimated assignments in an iterative manner to impose both discrete and one-to-one matching constraints.

    "abstract": "Advances in deep learning have enabled a wide range of promising applications. However, these systems are vulnerable to Adversarial Machine Learning (AML) attacks; adversarially crafted perturbations to their inputs could cause them to misclassify. Several state-of-the-art adversarial attacks have demonstrated that they can reliably fool classifiers making these attacks a significant threat. Adversarial attack generation algorithms focus primarily on creating successful examples while controlling the noise magnitude and distribution to make detection more difficult. The underlying assumption of these attacks is that the adversarial noise is generated offline, making their execution time a secondary consideration. However, recently, just-in-time adversarial attacks where an attacker opportunistically generates adversarial examples on the fly have been shown to be possible. This paper introduces a new problem: how do we generate adversarial noise under real-time constraints to support such real-time adversarial attacks? Understanding this problem improves our understanding of the threat these attacks pose to real-time systems and provides security evaluation benchmarks for future defenses. Therefore, we first conduct a run-time analysis of adversarial generation algorithms. Universal attacks produce a general attack offline, with no online overhead, and can be applied to any input; however, their success rate is limited because of their generality. In contrast, online algorithms, which work on a specific input, are computationally expensive, making them inappropriate for operation under time constraints. Thus, we propose ROOM, a novel Real-time Online-Offline attack construction Model where an offline component serves to warm up the online algorithm, making it possible to generate highly successful attacks under time constraints.

    "abstract": "Self-supervision is recently surging at its new frontier of graph learning. It facilitates graph representations beneficial to downstream tasks; but its success could hinge on domain knowledge for handcraft or the often expensive trials and errors. Even its state-of-the-art representative, graph contrastive learning (GraphCL), is not completely free of those needs as GraphCL uses a prefabricated prior reflected by the ad-hoc manual selection of graph data augmentations. Our work aims at advancing GraphCL by answering the following questions: How to represent the space of graph augmented views? What principle can be relied upon to learn a prior in that space? And what framework can be constructed to learn the prior in tandem with contrastive learning? Accordingly, we have extended the prefabricated discrete prior in the augmentation set, to a learnable continuous prior in the parameter space of graph generators, assuming that graph priors per se, similar to the concept of image manifolds, can be learned by data generation. Furthermore, to form contrastive views without collapsing to trivial solutions due to the prior learnability, we have leveraged both principles of information minimization (InfoMin) and information bottleneck (InfoBN) to regularize the learned priors. Eventually, contrastive learning, InfoMin, and InfoBN are incorporated organically into one framework of bi-level optimization. Our principled and automated approach has proven to be competitive against the state-of-the-art graph self-supervision methods, including GraphCL, on benchmarks of small graphs; and shown even better generalizability on large-scale graphs, without resorting to human expertise or downstream validation. Our code is publicly released at https://github.com/Shen-Lab/GraphCL_Automated. ",

    "abstract": "Multi-robot systems such as swarms of aerial robots are naturally suited to offer additional flexibility, resilience, and robustness in several tasks compared to a single robot by enabling cooperation among the agents. To enhance the autonomous robot decision-making process and situational awareness, multi-robot systems have to coordinate their perception capabilities to collect, share, and fuse environment information among the agents in an efficient and meaningful way such to accurately obtain context-appropriate information or gain resilience to sensor noise or failures. In this paper, we propose a general-purpose Graph Neural Network (GNN) with the main goal to increase, in multi-robot perception tasks, single robots' inference perception accuracy as well as resilience to sensor failures and disturbances. We show that the proposed framework can address multi-view visual perception problems such as monocular depth estimation and semantic segmentation. Several experiments both using photo-realistic and real data gathered from multiple aerial robots' viewpoints show the effectiveness of the proposed approach in challenging inference conditions including images corrupted by heavy noise and camera occlusions or failures.

Audio-visual speech recognition (AVSR) systems improve robustness by complementing the audio stream with the visual information that is invariant to noise and helps the model focus on the desired speaker. However, previous AVSR work focused solely on the supervised learning setup; hence the progress was hindered by the amount of labeled data available. In this work, we present a self-supervised AVSR framework built upon Audio-Visual HuBERT (AV-HuBERT), a state-of-the-art audio-visual speech representation learning model. On the largest available AVSR benchmark dataset LRS3, our approach outperforms prior state-of-the-art by ~50% (28.0% vs. 14.1%) using less than 10% of labeled data (433hr vs. 30hr) in the presence of babble noise, while reducing the WER of an audio-based model by over 75% (25.8% vs. 5.8%) on average.

Here we review some of the many contributions to the field, focusing both on idealized models of opinion dynamics, and attempts at validating them with observational data and controlled sociological experiments. By further closing the gap between models and data, these efforts may help us understand how to face current challenges that require the agreement of large groups of people in complex scenarios, such as economic inequality, climate change, and the ongoing fracture of the sociopolitical landscape.

    "abstract": "When there are significant service disruptions in public transit systems, passengers usually need guidance to find alternative paths. This paper proposes a path recommendation model to mitigate the congestion during public transit disruptions. Passengers with different origin-destination and departure times are recommended with different paths such that the system travel time is minimized. We model the path recommendation as an optimal flow problem with uncertain demand information. To tackle the non-analytical formulation of travel times due to left behind, we propose a simulation-based first-order approximation to transform the original problem into linear programming. Uncertainties in demand are modeled with robust optimization to protect the path recommendation strategies against inaccurate estimates. A real-world rail disruption scenario in the Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) system is used as a case study. Results show that even without considering uncertainty, the nominal model can reduce the system travel time by 9.1% (compared to the status quo), and outperforms the benchmark capacity-based path recommendation. The average travel time of passengers in the incident line (i.e., passengers receiving recommendations) is reduced more (-20.6% compared to the status quo). After incorporating the demand uncertainty, the robust model can further reduce the system travel time. The best robust model can decrease the average travel time of incident-line passengers by 2.91% compared to the nominal model. ",

    "abstract": "Image reconstruction of low-count positron emission tomography (PET) data is challenging. Kernel methods address the challenge by incorporating image prior information in the forward model of iterative PET image reconstruction. The kernelized expectation-maximization (KEM) algorithm has been developed and demonstrated to be effective and easy to implement. A common approach for a further improvement of the kernel method would be adding an explicit regularization, which however leads to a complex optimization problem. In this paper, we propose an implicit regularization for the kernel method by using a deep coefficient prior, which represents the kernel coefficient image in the PET forward model using a convolutional neural-network. To solve the maximum-likelihood neural network-based reconstruction problem, we apply the principle of optimization transfer to derive a neural KEM algorithm. Each iteration of the algorithm consists of two separate steps: a KEM step for image update from the projection data and a deep-learning step in the image domain for updating the kernel coefficient image using the neural network. This optimization algorithm is guaranteed to monotonically increase the data likelihood. The results from computer simulations and real patient data have demonstrated that the neural KEM can outperform existing KEM and deep image prior methods. ",

Besides, redefining the optimization target as pixel-wise classification provides a sharp advantage in producing confident and accurate depth estimation when compared with existing research.

Existing deep learning works almost neglect the inherent structural information of images, which acts as an important role for visual perception of SR results. In this paper, we design a hierarchical feature exploitation network to probe and preserve structural information in a multi-scale feature fusion manner. First, we propose a cross convolution upon traditional edge detectors to localize and represent edge features. Then, cross convolution blocks (CCBs) are designed with feature normalization and channel attention to consider the inherent correlations of features. Finally, we leverage multi-scale feature fusion group (MFFG) to embed the cross convolution blocks and develop the relations of structural features in different scales hierarchically, invoking a lightweight structure-preserving network named as Cross-SRN. Experimental results demonstrate the Cross-SRN achieves competitive or superior restoration performances against the state-of-the-art methods with accurate and clear structural details. Moreover, we set a criterion to select images with rich structural textures. The proposed Cross-SRN outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on the selected benchmark, which demonstrates that our network has a significant advantage in preserving edges. ",

    "abstract": "Video quality assessment (VQA) remains an important and challenging problem that affects many applications at the widest scales. Recent advances in mobile devices and cloud computing techniques have made it possible to capture, process, and share high resolution, high frame rate (HFR) videos across the Internet nearly instantaneously. Being able to monitor and control the quality of these streamed videos can enable the delivery of more enjoyable content and perceptually optimized rate control. Accordingly, there is a pressing need to develop VQA models that can be deployed at enormous scales. While some recent effects have been applied to full-reference (FR) analysis of variable frame rate and HFR video quality, the development of no-reference (NR) VQA algorithms targeting frame rate variations has been little studied. Here, we propose a first-of-a-kind blind VQA model for evaluating HFR videos, which we dub the Framerate-Aware Video Evaluator w/o Reference (FAVER). FAVER uses extended models of spatial natural scene statistics that encompass space-time wavelet-decomposed video signals, to conduct efficient frame rate sensitive quality prediction. Our extensive experiments on several HFR video quality datasets show that FAVER outperforms other blind VQA algorithms at a reasonable computational cost. To facilitate reproducible research and public evaluation, an implementation of FAVER is being made freely available online: \\url{https://github.com/uniqzheng/HFR-BVQA}. ",

The existing IAR protocols do not consider node cooperation while establishing the routes because motivating the nodes to cooperate and modeling that cooperation is not a trivial task. In addition, the information about the cooperative behavior of a node is not directly visible to neighboring nodes. Therefore, in this paper, we develop a new routing method in which the nodes' cooperation information is utilized to improve the performance of edge computing-enabled 5G networks. The proposed metric is a function of created and received interference in the network. The received interference term ensures that the Signal to Interference plus Noise Ratio (SINR) at the route remains above the threshold value, while the created interference term ensures that those nodes are selected to forward the packet that creates low interference for other nodes. The results show that the proposed solution improves ad hoc networks' performance compared to conventional routing protocols in terms of high network throughput and low outage probability. ",

QCP-FB gave the best performance in the comparison. Therefore, a novel formant tracking approach, which combines benefits of deep learning and signal processing based on QCP-FB, was proposed. In this approach, the formants predicted by a DNN-based tracker from a speech frame are refined using the peaks of the all-pole spectrum computed by QCP-FB from the same frame. Results show that the proposed DNN-based tracker performed better both in detection rate and estimation error for the lowest three formants compared to reference formant trackers.

    "abstract": "Compact stellar systems such as Ultra-compact dwarfs (UCDs) and Globular Clusters (GCs) around galaxies are known to be the tracers of the merger events that have been forming these galaxies. Therefore, identifying such systems allows to study galaxies mass assembly, formation and evolution. However, in the lack of spectroscopic information detecting UCDs/GCs using imaging data is very uncertain. Here, we aim to train a machine learning model to separate these objects from the foreground stars and background galaxies using the multi-wavelength imaging data of the Fornax galaxy cluster in 6 filters, namely u, g, r, i, J and Ks. The classes of objects are highly imbalanced which is problematic for many automatic classification techniques. Hence, we employ Synthetic Minority Over-sampling to handle the imbalance of the training data. Then, we compare two classifiers, namely Localized Generalized Matrix Learning Vector Quantization (LGMLVQ) and Random Forest (RF). Both methods are able to identify UCDs/GCs with a precision and a recall of >93 percent and provide relevances that reflect the importance of each feature dimension %(colors and angular sizes) for the classification. Both methods detect angular sizes as important markers for this classification problem. While it is astronomical expectation that color indices of u-i and i-Ks are the most important colors, our analysis shows that colors such as g-r are more informative, potentially because of higher signal-to-noise ratio. Besides the excellent performance the LGMLVQ method allows further interpretability by providing the feature importance for each individual class, class-wise representative samples and the possibility for non-linear visualization of the data as demonstrated in this contribution. We conclude that employing machine learning techniques to identify UCDs/GCs can lead to promising results. ",

In this paper we study the effects of this regularization and prove that, under exchangeability assumptions on the graph, it asymptotically leads to learning a nuclear-norm-type penalized graphon. In particular, the exact form of the penalty depends on the choice of subsampling method used within stochastic gradient descent to learn the embeddings. We also illustrate empirically that concatenating node covariates to $\\ell_2$ regularized node2vec embeddings leads to comparable, if not superior, performance to methods which incorporate node covariates and the network structure in a non-linear manner.

One consequence of this result is that exploiting the hierarchical structure of social graphs yields a substantial gain in sample complexity relative to the one that simply identifies different groups without resorting to the relational structure across them.
