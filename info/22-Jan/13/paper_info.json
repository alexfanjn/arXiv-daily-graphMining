    "title": "Learning Robust Policies for Generalized Debris Capture with an  Automated Tether-Net System",
    "abstract": "Tether-net launched from a chaser spacecraft provides a promising method to capture and dispose of large space debris in orbit. This tether-net system is subject to several sources of uncertainty in sensing and actuation that affect the performance of its net launch and closing control. Earlier reliability-based optimization approaches to design control actions however remain challenging and computationally prohibitive to generalize over varying launch scenarios and target (debris) state relative to the chaser. To search for a general and reliable control policy, this paper presents a reinforcement learning framework that integrates a proximal policy optimization (PPO2) approach with net dynamics simulations. The latter allows evaluating the episodes of net-based target capture, and estimate the capture quality index that serves as the reward feedback to PPO2. Here, the learned policy is designed to model the timing of the net closing action based on the state of the moving net and the target, under any given launch scenario. A stochastic state transition model is considered in order to incorporate synthetic uncertainties in state estimation and launch actuation. Along with notable reward improvement during training, the trained policy demonstrates capture performance (over a wide range of launch/target scenarios) that is close to that obtained with reliability-based optimization run over an individual scenario.

    "abstract": "Measurement-rich power distribution networks may enable distribution system operators (DSOs) to adopt model-less and measurement-based monitoring and control of distributed energy resources (DERs) for mitigating grid issues such as over/under voltages and lines congestions. However, measurement-based monitoring and control applications may lead to inaccurate control decisions due to measurement errors. In particular, estimation models relying on regression-based schemes result in significant errors in the estimates (e.g., nodal voltages) especially for measurement devices with high Instrument Transformer (IT) classes. The consequences are detrimental to control performance since this may lead to infeasible decisions. This work proposes a model-less robust voltage control accounting for the uncertainties of measurement-based estimated voltage sensitivity coefficients. The coefficients and their uncertainties are obtained using a recursive least squares (RLS)-based online estimation, updated whenever new measurements are available. This formulation is applied to control distributed controllable photovoltaic (PV) generation in a distribution network to restrict the voltage within prescribed limits. The proposed scheme is validated by simulating a CIGRE low-voltage system interfacing multiple controllable PV plants. ",

    "title": "Neural Capacitance: A New Perspective of Neural Network Selection via  Edge Dynamics",
    "abstract": "Efficient model selection for identifying a suitable pre-trained neural network to a downstream task is a fundamental yet challenging task in deep learning. Current practice requires expensive computational costs in model training for performance prediction. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for neural network selection by analyzing the governing dynamics over synaptic connections (edges) during training. Our framework is built on the fact that back-propagation during neural network training is equivalent to the dynamical evolution of synaptic connections. Therefore, a converged neural network is associated with an equilibrium state of a networked system composed of those edges. To this end, we construct a network mapping $\\phi$, converting a neural network $G_A$ to a directed line graph $G_B$ that is defined on those edges in $G_A$. Next, we derive a neural capacitance metric $\\beta_{\\rm eff}$ as a predictive measure universally capturing the generalization capability of $G_A$ on the downstream task using only a handful of early training results. We carried out extensive experiments using 17 popular pre-trained ImageNet models and five benchmark datasets, including CIFAR10, CIFAR100, SVHN, Fashion MNIST and Birds, to evaluate the fine-tuning performance of our framework. Our neural capacitance metric is shown to be a powerful indicator for model selection based only on early training results and is more efficient than state-of-the-art methods. ",

    "abstract": "With the advent of the Internet of Things (IoT) and 5G networks, edge computing is offering new opportunities for business model and use cases innovations. Service providers can now virtualize the cloud beyond the data center to meet the latency, data sovereignty, reliability, and interoperability requirements. Yet, many new applications (e.g., augmented reality, virtual reality, artificial intelligence) are computation-intensive and delay-sensitivity. These applications are invoked heavily with similar inputs that could lead to the same output. Compute-less networks aim to implement a network with a minimum amount of computation and communication. This can be realized by offloading prevalent services to the edge and thus minimizing communication in the core network and eliminating redundant computations using the computation reuse concept. In this paper, we present matching-based services offloading schemes for compute-less IoT networks. We adopt the matching theory to match service offloading to the appropriate edge server(s). Specifically, we design, WHISTLE, a vertical many-to-many offloading scheme that aims to offload the most invoked and highly reusable services to the appropriate edge servers. We further extend WHISTLE to provide horizontal one-to-many computation reuse sharing among edge servers which leads to bouncing less computation back to the cloud. We evaluate the efficiency and effectiveness of WHISTLE with a real-world dataset. The obtained findings show that WHISTLE is able to accelerate the tasks completion time by 20%, reduce the computation up to 77%, and decrease the communication up to 71%. Theoretical analyses also prove the stability of the designed schemes. ",

We propose a new Gaussian scheme combining with another data protection technique, called random orthogonal matrix masking, to achieve $(\\varepsilon, \\delta)$-differential privacy (DP) more efficiently. We prove that the additional matrix masking significantly reduces the rate of noise variance required in the Gaussian scheme to achieve $(\\varepsilon, \\delta)-$DP in big data setting. Specifically, when $\\varepsilon \\to 0$, $\\delta \\to 0$, and the sample size $n$ exceeds the number $p$ of attributes by $\\frac{n}{p}=O(ln(1/\\delta))$, the required additive noise variance to achieve $(\\varepsilon, \\delta)$-DP is reduced from $O(ln(1/\\delta)/\\varepsilon^2)$ to $O(1/\\varepsilon)$. With much less noise added, the resulting differential privacy protected pseudo data sets allow much more accurate inferences, thus can significantly improve the scope of application for differential privacy.

    "abstract": "This paper proposes an online voltage control strategy of distributed energy resources (DERs), based on the projected Newton method (PNM), for unbalanced distribution networks. The optimal Volt/VAr control (VVC) problem is formulated as an optimization program, with the goal of maintaining the voltage profile across the network by coordinating the VAr outputs of DERs. To overcome the slow convergence rate of conventional gradient-based methods, a PNM-based solution algorithm is developed to solve this VVC problem. It utilizes a non-diagonal symmetric positive definite matrix, developed from the Hessian matrix of the objective, to scale the gradient, and thus a fast convergence performance can be expected in this Newton-like algorithm. Moreover, taking advantage of the instantaneous feedback of voltage measurements, the online implementation of the PNM-based VVC is further designed to deal with fast system variations. In this online PNM-based VVC scheme, each bus agent communicates the instantaneous voltage measurements to the central agent, and the central agent communicates the VAr output commands of DERs back to each bus agent. The fast convergence performance of PNM results in a stronger capability to track the system variations in real time. Finally, numerical case studies are performed to validate the effectiveness, superiority, and scalability of the proposed method. ",

    "abstract": "Mobile devices increasingly rely on object detection (OD) through deep neural networks (DNNs) to perform critical tasks. Due to their high complexity, the execution of these DNNs requires excessive time and energy. Low-complexity object tracking (OT) can be used with OD, where the latter is periodically applied to generate \"fresh\" references for tracking. However, the frames processed with OD incur large delays, which may make the reference outdated and degrade tracking quality. Herein, we propose to use edge computing in this context, and establish parallel OT (at the mobile device) and OD (at the edge server) processes that are resilient to large OD latency. We propose Katch-Up, a novel tracking mechanism that improves the system resilience to excessive OD delay. However, while Katch-Up significantly improves performance, it also increases the computing load of the mobile device. Hence, we design SmartDet, a low-complexity controller based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL) that learns controlling the trade-off between resource utilization and OD performance. SmartDet takes as input context-related information related to the current video content and the current network conditions to optimize frequency and type of OD offloading, as well as Katch-Up utilization. We extensively evaluate SmartDet on a real-world testbed composed of a JetSon Nano as mobile device and a GTX 980 Ti as edge server, connected through a Wi-Fi link. Experimental results show that SmartDet achieves an optimal balance between tracking performance - mean Average Recall (mAR) and resource usage. With respect to a baseline with full Katch-Upusage and maximum channel usage, we still increase mAR by 4% while using 50% less of the channel and 30% power resources associated with Katch-Up. With respect to a fixed strategy using minimal resources, we increase mAR by 20% while using Katch-Up on 1/3 of the frames. ",

Given that the reduction of TDs can have long-term positive impact in the software engineering life-cycle (SDLC), TDs are studied extensively in the literature. However, very few of the existing research focused on the technical debts of R programming language despite its popularity and usage. Recent research by Codabux et al. [21] finds that R packages can have 10 diverse TD types analyzing peer-review documentation. However, the findings are based on the manual analysis of a small sample of R package review comments. In this paper, we develop a suite of Machine Learning (ML) classifiers to detect the 10 TDs automatically. The best performing classifier is based on the deep ML model BERT, which achieves F1-scores of 0.71 - 0.91. We then apply the trained BERT models on all available peer-review issue comments from two platforms, rOpenSci and BioConductor (13.5K review comments coming from a total of 1297 R packages). We conduct an empirical study on the prevalence and evolution of 10 TDs in the two R platforms. We discovered documentation debt is the most prevalent among all types of TD, and it is also expanding rapidly. We also find that R packages of generic platform (i.e. rOpenSci) are more prone to TD compared to domain-specific platform (i.e. BioConductor). Our empirical study findings can guide future improvements opportunities in R package documentation. Our ML models can be used to automatically monitor the prevalence and evolution of TDs in R package documentation. ",

    "abstract": "Smart grids integrate communication systems with power networks to enable power grids operation and command through real-time data collection and control signals. Designing, analyzing, and simulating smart grid infrastructures as well as predicting the impact of power network failures strongly depend on the topologies of the underlying power network and communication system. Despite the substantial impact that the communication systems bring to smart grid operation, the topology of communication systems employed in smart grids was less studied. The power community lacks realistic generative communication system models that can be calibrated to match real-world data. To address this issue, this paper proposes a framework to generate the underlying topological graphs for the communication systems deployed in smart grids by mimicking the topology of real-world smart grids. In this regard, we have updated the Chung-Lu algorithm to guarantee the communication network connectivity and to match the degree distribution of a real-world smart grid rather than following an expected degree distribution. In addition, key characteristics of communication systems such as diameter, average shortest paths, clustering coefficients, assortativity, and spectral gap were taken into consideration to generate the most similar real-world communication network for smart grid studies. We believe that the proposed algorithm to generate realistic cyber graphs for smart grid studies will benefit the power community. ",

Toward the end of better understanding and mitigating these attacks, we present a set of machine learning models that learn from localized news data in order to predict whether a terrorist attack will occur on a given calendar date and in a given state. The best model--a Random Forest that learns from a novel variable-length moving average representation of the feature space--achieves area under the receiver operating characteristic scores $> .667$ on four of the five states that were impacted most by terrorism between 2015 and 2018. Our key findings include that modeling terrorism as a set of independent events, rather than as a continuous process, is a fruitful approach--especially when the events are sparse and dissimilar. Additionally, our results highlight the need for localized models that account for differences between locations. From a machine learning perspective, we found that the Random Forest model outperformed several deep models on our multimodal, noisy, and imbalanced data set, thus demonstrating the efficacy of our novel feature representation method in such a context. We also show that its predictions are relatively robust to time gaps between attacks and observed characteristics of the attacks. Finally, we analyze factors that limit model performance, which include a noisy feature space and small amount of available data. These contributions provide an important foundation for the use of machine learning in efforts against terrorism in the United States and beyond. ",

In this work, we propose a new contrastive loss function that is robust against noisy views. We provide rigorous theoretical justifications by showing connections to robust symmetric losses for noisy binary classification and by establishing a new contrastive bound for mutual information maximization based on the Wasserstein distance measure. The proposed loss is completely modality-agnostic and a simple drop-in replacement for the InfoNCE loss, which makes it easy to apply to existing contrastive frameworks. We show that our approach provides consistent improvements over the state-of-the-art on image, video, and graph contrastive learning benchmarks that exhibit a variety of real-world noise patterns. ",

In this paper, we suggest a novel INR approach to representing and compressing videos by explicitly removing data redundancy. Instead of storing raw RGB colors, we propose Neural Residual Flow Fields (NRFF), using motion information across video frames and residuals that are necessary to reconstruct a video. Maintaining the motion information, which is usually smoother and less complex than the raw signals, requires far fewer parameters. Furthermore, reusing redundant pixel values further improves the network parameter efficiency.

We make several main contributions: (1) the equivalent JDE channel and the posterior probability density function are derived based on the priori statistical characteristic of the noise, target scattering and joint target parameter; (2) the performance of the JDE system is measured by the joint entropy deviation and the joint information that is defined as the mutual information between received signal and the joint target parameter; (3) the sampling a posterior probability and cascaded JDEers are proposed, and their performance is measured by the empirical joint entropy deviation the empirical joint information; (4) the joint theorem is proved that the joint information is the available limit of the overall performance, that is, the joint information is available, and the empirical joint information of any JDEer is no greater than the joint information; (5) the cascaded theorem is proved that the sum of empirical detection information and empirical estimation information can approximate the joint information, i.e., the performance limit of cascaded JDEer is available. Simulation results verify the correctness of the joint and the cascaded theorems, and show that the performance of the sampling a posterior probability JDEer is asymptotically optimal. Moreover, the performance of cascaded JDEer can approximate the system performance of JDE system. ",

In this paper, we formulate and study the theoretical algorithmic foundations of such approaches, and focus on how to deploy and use constrained in-network computing capabilities within the data center. We focus our attention on reducing the network congestion, i.e., the most congested link in the network, while supporting the given workload(s). We present an efficient optimal algorithm for tree-like network topologies and show that our solution provides as much as an x13 improvement over common alternative approaches. In particular, our results show that having merely a small fraction of network devices that support in-network aggregation can significantly reduce the network congestion, both for single and multiple workloads.

    "abstract": "Graph transformation formalisms have proven to be suitable tools for the modelling of chemical reactions. They are well established in theoretical studies and increasingly also in practical applications in chemistry. The latter is made feasible via the development of programming frameworks which makes the formalisms executable. The application of such frameworks to large networks of chemical reactions, however, poses unique computational challenges. One such characteristic is the inherent combinatorial nature of the graphs involved. The graphs consist of many connected components, representing individual molecules. While the existing methods for implementing graph transformations can be applied to such graphs, the combinatorics of constructing graph matches quickly becomes a computational bottleneck as the size of the chemical reaction network grows. In this contribution, we develop a new method of enumerating graph transformation rule applications, designed to improve performance in these scenarios. The method is based on constructing graph matches component-wise, in an iterative fashion, allowing redundant applications to be detected early and pruned. We further extend the algorithm with an efficient heuristic, based on local symmetries of the graphs, which allow us to detect and discard isomorphic applications early. Finally, we conduct chemical network generation experiments on real-life as well as synthetic data and compare against state-of-the-art in the field. ",

However, the existing problem formulation to solve this resource allocation problem is unsuitable as it defines the capacity utility of resource in an inappropriate way and tends to cause much delay. Moreover, the existing problem has only been attempted to be solved based on greedy search, which is not ideal as it could get stuck into local optima. Considering those, a new formulation that better describes the problem is proposed. In addition, as a well-known global search meta heuristic approach, an evolutionary algorithm (EA) is designed tailored for solving the new problem formulation, to find a resource allocation scheme to proactively and dynamically deploy the computing resource for processing upcoming traffic data. Experimental studies carried out on several real-world datasets and newly generated artificial datasets with more properties beyond the real-world datasets have demonstrated the significant superiority over a baseline greedy algorithm under different parameter settings. Moreover, experimental studies are taken to compare the proposed EA and two variants, to indicate the impact of different algorithm choices. ",

However, the inherent thermal image properties such as weak contrast, blurry edges, and noise hinder to generate effective self-supervision from thermal images.

In this paper, we conduct an in-depth analysis of thermal image characteristics that degenerates self-supervision from thermal images. Based on the analysis, we propose an effective thermal image mapping method that significantly increases image information, such as overall structure, contrast, and details, while preserving temporal consistency.

We design six basic SSL tasks that are inspired by various modality features including structures, semantics, and attributes in biomedical heterogeneous networks. In addition, fifteen combinations of multiple tasks are evaluated by a graph attention-based adversarial multi-task learning framework in two drug discovery scenarios. The results suggest two important findings. (1) The combinations of multimodal tasks achieve the best performance compared to other multi-task joint strategies.

Combining a massive HAD-MIMO with direction of arrinal (DOA) will provide a high-precision even ultra-high-precision DOA measurement performance approaching the fully-digital (FD) MIMO. However, phase ambiguity is a challenge issue for a massive HAD-MIMO DOA estimation. In this paper, we review three aspects: detection, estimation, and Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) with low-resolution ADCs at receiver. First, a multi-layer-neural-network (MLNN) detector is proposed to infer the existence of passive emitters. Then, a two-layer HAD (TLHAD) MIMO structure is proposed to eliminate phase ambiguity using only one-snapshot. Simulation results show that the proposed MLNN detector is much better than both the existing generalized likelihood ratio test (GRLT) and the ratio of maximum eigen-value (Max-EV) to minimum eigen-value (R-MaxEV-MinEV) in terms of detection probability. Additionally, the proposed TLHAD structure can achieve the corresponding CRLB using single snapshot. ",

A well defined and compact representation of a catalytic process is becoming exceedingly valuable in face of the growth in computer assisted development strategies. A step-wise partition of a catalytic process is traditional in organic chemistry. We argue, however, that such a description remains incomplete, especially in face of automation and formal methods. In this contribution-based on enzymatic reaction mechanisms-we fully formalize the step-wise notion of a catalytic process within the mathematical framework of graph transformation, and propose a concise representation as an overlay graph (OG). We formally define this concept in a dual form as an OG itself and an overlay rule. The former representing a static summary of the process, and the latter being an executable in the graph transformation formalism. We demonstrate that OGs readily expose the underlying chemistry and facilitate the interpretation of catalytic processes. The emergence of electron flow patterns, for instance, provides an excellent stage for classification efforts. We further show how the executable overlay rules can be employed to automatically assign a fully specified mechanism to a reaction with only an overall description, i.e. educt and product molecules.

Two types of solutions based on digital and analog schemes are used typically. The digital-based solution takes quantization and entropy coding for compression, whereas transmissions via wireless channels may cause catastrophic errors owing to the all-or-nothing behavior in entropy coding. The analog-based solutions such as AirNet and AirComp use analog modulation for the parameter transmissions. However, such an analog scheme often causes significant distortion due to the source signal's large power without compression gain. This paper proposes a novel hybrid digital-analog transmission-Federated AirNet--for the model parameter transmissions in federated learning. The Federated AirNet integrates low-rate digital coding and energy-compact analog modulation. The digital coding offers the baseline of the model parameters and compacts the source signal power. In addition, the residual parameters, which are obtained from the original and encoded model parameters, are analog-modulated to enhance the baseline according to the instantaneous wireless channel quality. We show that the proposed Federated AirNet yields better image classification accuracy compared with the digital-based and analog-based solutions over a wide range of wireless channel signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs).

The existing studies consider adding noise to the raw IoMT data or model parameters which not only reduces the overall performance concerning medical inferences but also is ineffective to the likes of deep leakage from gradients method. In this work, we propose proximal gradient split learning (PSGL) method for defense against the model inversion attacks. The proposed method intentionally attacks the IoMT data when undergoing the deep neural network training process at client side. We propose the use of proximal gradient method to recover gradient maps and a decision-level fusion strategy to improve the recognition performance.

At both schemes, to achieve better spectral efficiency, users transmit signals in the non-orthogonal mode in both mini-slots. In C-RSMA, we also apply the rate-splitting method in which the message of each user is divided into two streams. In the proposed detection schemes for C-NOMA and C-RSMA, we apply a combination of maximum-ratio-combining (MRC) and successive-interference-cancellation (SIC). Then, we derive the achievable rates for C-NOMA and C-RSMA, and formulate two optimization problems to maximize the minimum rate of two users by considering the proportional fairness coefficient. We propose two power allocation algorithms based on successive-convex-approximation (SCA) and geometric-programming (GP) to solve these non-convex problems. Next, we derive the asymptotic outage probability of the proposed C-NOMA and C-RSMA schemes, and prove that they achieve diversity order of two.

However, the performance of these methods is still subject to two limitations, namely the multiple views fusion pattern and the connection between the fusion process and clustering tasks. To address these problems, we propose a novel multi-view subspace clustering framework via fine-grained graph learning, which can tell the consistency of local structures between different views and integrate all views more delicately than previous weight regularizations. Different from other models in the literature, the point-level graph regularization and the reformulation of spectral clustering are introduced to perform graphs fusion and learn the shared cluster structure together. Extensive experiments on five real-world datasets show that the proposed framework has comparable performance to the SOTA algorithms. ",

    "title": "Too Afraid to Drive: Systematic Discovery of Semantic DoS Vulnerability  in Autonomous Driving Planning under Physical-World Attacks",
    "abstract": "In high-level Autonomous Driving (AD) systems, behavioral planning is in charge of making high-level driving decisions such as cruising and stopping, and thus highly securitycritical. In this work, we perform the first systematic study of semantic security vulnerabilities specific to overly-conservative AD behavioral planning behaviors, i.e., those that can cause failed or significantly-degraded mission performance, which can be critical for AD services such as robo-taxi/delivery. We call them semantic Denial-of-Service (DoS) vulnerabilities, which we envision to be most generally exposed in practical AD systems due to the tendency for conservativeness to avoid safety incidents. To achieve high practicality and realism, we assume that the attacker can only introduce seemingly-benign external physical objects to the driving environment, e.g., off-road dumped cardboard boxes. To systematically discover such vulnerabilities, we design PlanFuzz, a novel dynamic testing approach that addresses various problem-specific design challenges. Specifically, we propose and identify planning invariants as novel testing oracles, and design new input generation to systematically enforce problemspecific constraints for attacker-introduced physical objects. We also design a novel behavioral planning vulnerability distance metric to effectively guide the discovery. We evaluate PlanFuzz on 3 planning implementations from practical open-source AD systems, and find that it can effectively discover 9 previouslyunknown semantic DoS vulnerabilities without false positives. We find all our new designs necessary, as without each design, statistically significant performance drops are generally observed. We further perform exploitation case studies using simulation and real-vehicle traces. We discuss root causes and potential fixes. ",

    "abstract": "This paper presents an overview of the second edition of the HEad and neCK TumOR (HECKTOR) challenge, organized as a satellite event of the 24th International Conference on Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Intervention (MICCAI) 2021. The challenge is composed of three tasks related to the automatic analysis of PET/CT images for patients with Head and Neck cancer (H&N), focusing on the oropharynx region. Task 1 is the automatic segmentation of H&N primary Gross Tumor Volume (GTVt) in FDG-PET/CT images. Task 2 is the automatic prediction of Progression Free Survival (PFS) from the same FDG-PET/CT. Finally, Task 3 is the same as Task 2 with ground truth GTVt annotations provided to the participants. The data were collected from six centers for a total of 325 images, split into 224 training and 101 testing cases. The interest in the challenge was highlighted by the important participation with 103 registered teams and 448 result submissions. The best methods obtained a Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) of 0.7591 in the first task, and a Concordance index (C-index) of 0.7196 and 0.6978 in Tasks 2 and 3, respectively. In all tasks, simplicity of the approach was found to be key to ensure generalization performance. The comparison of the PFS prediction performance in Tasks 2 and 3 suggests that providing the GTVt contour was not crucial to achieve best results, which indicates that fully automatic methods can be used. This potentially obviates the need for GTVt contouring, opening avenues for reproducible and large scale radiomics studies including thousands potential subjects. ",

    "abstract": "Knee osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common osteoarthritis and a leading cause of disability. Cartilage defects are regarded as major manifestations of knee OA, which are visible by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Thus early detection and assessment for knee cartilage defects are important for protecting patients from knee OA. In this way, many attempts have been made on knee cartilage defect assessment by applying convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to knee MRI. However, the physiologic characteristics of the cartilage may hinder such efforts: the cartilage is a thin curved layer, implying that only a small portion of voxels in knee MRI can contribute to the cartilage defect assessment; heterogeneous scanning protocols further challenge the feasibility of the CNNs in clinical practice; the CNN-based knee cartilage evaluation results lack interpretability. To address these challenges, we model the cartilages structure and appearance from knee MRI into a graph representation, which is capable of handling highly diverse clinical data. Then, guided by the cartilage graph representation, we design a non-Euclidean deep learning network with the self-attention mechanism, to extract cartilage features in the local and global, and to derive the final assessment with a visualized result. Our comprehensive experiments show that the proposed method yields superior performance in knee cartilage defect assessment, plus its convenient 3D visualization for interpretability. ",

    "abstract": "This work systematically investigates the adversarial robustness of deep image denoisers (DIDs), i.e, how well DIDs can recover the ground truth from noisy observations degraded by adversarial perturbations. Firstly, to evaluate DIDs' robustness, we propose a novel adversarial attack, namely Observation-based Zero-mean Attack ({\\sc ObsAtk}), to craft adversarial zero-mean perturbations on given noisy images. We find that existing DIDs are vulnerable to the adversarial noise generated by {\\sc ObsAtk}. Secondly, to robustify DIDs, we propose an adversarial training strategy, hybrid adversarial training ({\\sc HAT}), that jointly trains DIDs with adversarial and non-adversarial noisy data to ensure that the reconstruction quality is high and the denoisers around non-adversarial data are locally smooth. The resultant DIDs can effectively remove various types of synthetic and adversarial noise. We also uncover that the robustness of DIDs benefits their generalization capability on unseen real-world noise. Indeed, {\\sc HAT}-trained DIDs can recover high-quality clean images from real-world noise even without training on real noisy data. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, including Set68, PolyU, and SIDD, corroborate the effectiveness of {\\sc ObsAtk} and {\\sc HAT}. ",

    "abstract": "Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM) is a malignant brain cancer forming around 48% of al brain and Central Nervous System (CNS) cancers. It is estimated that annually over 13,000 deaths occur in the US due to GBM, making it crucial to have early diagnosis systems that can lead to predictable and effective treatment. The most common treatment after GBM diagnosis is chemotherapy, which works by sending rapidly dividing cells to apoptosis. However, this form of treatment is not effective when the MGMT promoter sequence is methylated, and instead leads to severe side effects decreasing patient survivability. Therefore, it is important to be able to identify the MGMT promoter methylation status through non-invasive magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) based machine learning (ML) models. This is accomplished using the Brain Tumor Segmentation (BraTS) 2021 dataset, which was recently used for an international Kaggle competition. We developed four primary models - two radiomic models and two CNN models - each solving the binary classification task with progressive improvements. We built a novel ML model termed as the Intermediate State Generator which was used to normalize the slice thicknesses of all MRI scans. With further improvements, our best model was able to achieve performance significantly ($p < 0.05$) better than the best performing Kaggle model with a 6% increase in average cross-validation accuracy. This improvement could potentially lead to a more informed choice of chemotherapy as a treatment option, prolonging lives of thousands of patients with GBM each year. ",

The Jacobian is the product of random matrices where the independent rectangular weight matrices alternate with diagonal matrices whose entries depend on the corresponding column of the nearest neighbor weight matrix. The problem was considered in \\cite{Pe-Co:18} for the Gaussian weights and biases and also for the weights that are Haar distributed orthogonal matrices and Gaussian biases. Basing on a free probability argument, it was claimed that in these cases the singular value distribution of the Jacobian in the limit of infinite width (matrix size) coincides with that of the analog of the Jacobian with special random but weight independent diagonal matrices, the case well known in random matrix theory. The claim was rigorously proved in \\cite{Pa-Sl:21} for a quite general class of weights and biases with i.i.d. (including Gaussian) entries by using a version of the techniques of random matrix theory. In this paper we use another version of the techniques to justify the claim for random Haar distributed weight matrices and Gaussian biases. ",

    "abstract": "The classical statistical learning theory says that fitting too many parameters leads to overfitting and poor performance. That modern deep neural networks generalize well despite a large number of parameters contradicts this finding and constitutes a major unsolved problem towards explaining the success of deep learning. The implicit regularization induced by stochastic gradient descent (SGD) has been regarded to be important, but its specific principle is still unknown. In this work, we study how the local geometry of the energy landscape around local minima affects the statistical properties of SGD with Gaussian gradient noise. We argue that under reasonable assumptions, the local geometry forces SGD to stay close to a low dimensional subspace and that this induces implicit regularization and results in tighter bounds on the generalization error for deep neural networks. To derive generalization error bounds for neural networks, we first introduce a notion of stagnation sets around the local minima and impose a local essential convexity property of the population risk. Under these conditions, lower bounds for SGD to remain in these stagnation sets are derived. If stagnation occurs, we derive a bound on the generalization error of deep neural networks involving the spectral norms of the weight matrices but not the number of network parameters. Technically, our proofs are based on controlling the change of parameter values in the SGD iterates and local uniform convergence of the empirical loss functions based on the entropy of suitable neighborhoods around local minima. Our work attempts to better connect non-convex optimization and generalization analysis with uniform convergence. ",

Lattice spring model (LSM), a coarse-grained particle spring network, has gained attention in recent years for predicting the mechanical properties and giving insights into the fracture mechanism with high reproducibility and generalizability. However, to simulate the materials in sufficient detail for guaranteed numerical stability and convergence, most of the time a large number of particles are needed, greatly diminishing the potential for high-throughput computation and therewith data generation for machine learning frameworks. Here, we implement CuLSM, a GPU-accelerated CUDA C++ code realizing parallelism over the spring list instead of the commonly used spatial decomposition, which requires intermittent updates on the particle neighbor list. Along with the image-to-particle conversion tool Img2Particle, our toolkit offers a fast and flexible platform to characterize the elastic and fracture behaviors of materials, expediting the design process between additive manufacturing and computer-aided design. With the growing demand for new lightweight, adaptable, and multi-functional materials and structures, such tailored and optimized modeling platform has profound impacts, enabling faster exploration in design spaces, better quality control for 3D printing by digital twin techniques, and larger data generation pipelines for image-based generative machine learning models.

Annotations mandate expert knowledge and are time-intensive to obtain through fully manual segmentation methods. Additionally, lung lesions have large inter-patient variations, with some pathologies having similar visual appearance as healthy lung tissues. This poses a challenge when applying existing semi-automatic interactive segmentation techniques for data labelling. To address these challenges, we propose an efficient convolutional neural networks (CNNs) that can be learned online while the annotator provides scribble-based interaction. To accelerate learning from only the samples labelled through user-interactions, a patch-based approach is used for training the network. Moreover, we use weighted cross-entropy loss to address the class imbalance that may result from user-interactions. During online inference, the learned network is applied to the whole input volume using a fully convolutional approach. We compare our proposed method with state-of-the-art and show that it outperforms existing methods on the task of annotating lung lesions associated with COVID-19, achieving 16% higher Dice score while reducing execution time by 3$\\times$ and requiring 9000 lesser scribbles-based labelled voxels. Due to the online learning aspect, our approach adapts quickly to user input, resulting in high quality segmentation labels. Source code will be made available upon acceptance. ",

Recently, an unsupervised machine learning technique called VAMPNet was introduced to learn the low dimensional representation and linear dynamical model in an end-to-end manner. VAMPNet is based on variational approach to Markov processes (VAMP) and relies on neural networks to learn the coarse-grained dynamics. In this contribution, we combine VAMPNet and graph neural networks to generate an end-to-end framework to efficiently learn high-level dynamics and metastable states from the long-timescale molecular dynamics trajectories. This method bears the advantages of graph representation learning and uses graph message passing operations to generate an embedding for each datapoint which is used in the VAMPNet to generate a coarse-grained representation. This type of molecular representation results in a higher resolution and more interpretable Markov model than the standard VAMPNet enabling a more detailed kinetic study of the biomolecular processes. Our GraphVAMPNet approach is also enhanced with an attention mechanism to find the important residues for classification into different metastable states. ",
