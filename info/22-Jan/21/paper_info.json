    "abstract": "Although deep neural networks (DNN) have achieved state-of-the-art performance in various fields, some unexpected errors are often found in the neural network, which is very dangerous for some tasks requiring high reliability and high security.The non-transparency and unexplainably of CNN still limit its application in many fields, such as medical care and finance. Despite current studies that have been committed to visualizing the decision process of DNN, most of these methods focus on the low level and do not take into account the prior knowledge of medicine.In this work, we propose an interpretable framework based on key medical concepts, enabling CNN to explain from the perspective of doctors' cognition.We propose an interpretable automatic recognition framework for the ultrasonic standard plane, which uses a concept-based graph convolutional neural network to construct the relationships between key medical concepts, to obtain an interpretation consistent with a doctor's cognition.

    "abstract": "Accurate pressure drop estimation in forced boiling phenomena is important during the thermal analysis and the geometric design of cryogenic heat exchangers. However, current methods to predict the pressure drop have one of two problems: lack of accuracy or generalization to different situations. In this work, we present the correlated-informed neural networks (CoINN), a new paradigm in applying the artificial neural network (ANN) technique combined with a successful pressure drop correlation as a mapping tool to predict the pressure drop of zeotropic mixtures in micro-channels. The proposed approach is inspired by Transfer Learning, highly used in deep learning problems with reduced datasets. Our method improves the ANN performance by transferring the knowledge of the Sun & Mishima correlation for the pressure drop to the ANN. The correlation having physical and phenomenological implications for the pressure drop in micro-channels considerably improves the performance and generalization capabilities of the ANN. The final architecture consists of three inputs: the mixture vapor quality, the micro-channel inner diameter, and the available pressure drop correlation. The results show the benefits gained using the correlated-informed approach predicting experimental data used for training and a posterior test with a mean relative error (mre) of 6%, lower than the Sun & Mishima correlation of 13%. Additionally, this approach can be extended to other mixtures and experimental settings, a missing feature in other approaches for mapping correlations using ANNs for heat transfer applications. ",

    "abstract": "This paper explores list decoding of convolutional and polar codes for short messages such as those found in the 5G physical broadcast channel. A cyclic redundancy check (CRC) is used to select a codeword from a list of likely codewords. One example in the 5G standard encodes a 32-bit message with a 24-bit CRC and a 512-bit polar code with additional bits added by repetition to achieve a very low rate of 32/864. This paper shows that optimizing the CRC length improves the $E_b/N_0$ performance of this polar code, where $E_b/N_0$ is the ratio of the energy per data bit to the noise power spectral density. Furthermore, even better $E_b/N_0$ performance is achieved by replacing the polar code with a tail-biting convolutional code (TBCC) with a distance-spectrum-optimal (DSO) CRC. This paper identifies the optimal CRC length to minimize the frame error rate (FER) of a rate-1/5 TBCC at a specific value of $E_b/N_0$. We also show that this optimized TBCC/CRC can attain the same excellent $E_b/N_0$ performance with the very low rate of 32/864 of the 5G polar code, where the low rate is achieved through repetition. We show that the proposed TBCC/CRC concatenated code outperforms the PBCH polar code described in the 5G standard both in terms of FER and decoding run time. We also explore the tradeoff between undetected error rate and erasure rate as the CRC size varies. ",

    "abstract": "State-of-the-art Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have limited scalability with respect to the graph and model sizes. On large graphs, increasing the model depth often means exponential expansion of the scope (i.e., receptive field). Beyond just a few layers, two fundamental challenges emerge: 1. degraded expressivity due to oversmoothing, and 2. expensive computation due to neighborhood explosion. We propose a design principle to decouple the depth and scope of GNNs -- to generate representation of a target entity (i.e., a node or an edge), we first extract a localized subgraph as the bounded-size scope, and then apply a GNN of arbitrary depth on top of the subgraph. A properly extracted subgraph consists of a small number of critical neighbors, while excluding irrelevant ones. The GNN, no matter how deep it is, smooths the local neighborhood into informative representation rather than oversmoothing the global graph into \"white noise\". Theoretically, decoupling improves the GNN expressive power from the perspectives of graph signal processing (GCN), function approximation (GraphSAGE) and topological learning (GIN). Empirically, on seven graphs (with up to 110M nodes) and six backbone GNN architectures, our design achieves significant accuracy improvement with orders of magnitude reduction in computation and hardware cost.

    "abstract": "There exists a distribution discrepancy between training and testing, in the way images are fed to modern CNNs. Recent work tried to bridge this gap either by fine-tuning or re-training the network at different resolutions. However re-training a network is rarely cheap and not always viable. To this end, we propose a simple solution to address the train-test distributional shift and enhance the performance of pre-trained models -- which commonly ship as a package with deep learning platforms \\eg, PyTorch. Specifically, we demonstrate that running inference on the center crop of an image is not always the best as important discriminatory information may be cropped-off. Instead we propose to combine results for multiple random crops for a test image. This not only matches the train time augmentation but also provides the full coverage of the input image. We explore combining representation of random crops through averaging at different levels \\ie, deep feature level, logit level, and softmax level. We demonstrate that, for various families of modern deep networks, such averaging results in better validation accuracy compared to using a single central crop per image. The softmax averaging results in the best performance for various pre-trained networks without requiring any re-training or fine-tuning whatsoever. On modern GPUs with batch processing, the paper's approach to inference of pre-trained networks, is essentially free as all images in a batch can all be processed at once. ",

The OED problem seeks to find sensor locations that maximize the expected information gain (EIG) in the solution of the underlying Bayesian inverse problem. Computation of the EIG is usually prohibitive for PDE-based OED problems. To make the evaluation of the EIG tractable, we approximate the (PDE-based) parameter-to-observable map with a derivative-informed projected neural network (DIPNet) surrogate, which exploits the geometry, smoothness, and intrinsic low-dimensionality of the map using a small and dimension-independent number of PDE solves. The surrogate is then deployed within a greedy algorithm-based solution of the OED problem such that no further PDE solves are required. We analyze the EIG approximation error in terms of the generalization error of the DIPNet, and demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of the method via numerical experiments involving inverse scattering and inverse reactive transport.

    "abstract": "Constraining contacts to remain fixed on an object during manipulation limits the potential workspace size, as motion is subject to the hand's kinematic topology. Finger gaiting is one way to alleviate such restraints. It allows contacts to be freely broken and remade so as to operate on different manipulation manifolds. This capability, however, has traditionally been difficult or impossible to practically realize. A finger gaiting system must simultaneously plan for and control forces on the object while maintaining stability during contact switching. This work alleviates the traditional requirement by taking advantage of system compliance, allowing the hand to more easily switch contacts while maintaining a stable grasp. Our method achieves complete SO(3) finger gaiting control of grasped objects against gravity by developing a manipulation planner that operates via orthogonal safe modes of a compliant, underactuated hand absent of tactile sensors or joint encoders. During manipulation, a low-latency 6D pose object tracker provides feedback via vision, allowing the planner to update its plan online so as to adaptively recover from trajectory deviations. The efficacy of this method is showcased by manipulating both convex and non-convex objects on a real robot. Its robustness is evaluated via perturbation rejection and long trajectory goals. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first work that has autonomously achieved full SO(3) control of objects within-hand via finger gaiting and without a support surface, elucidating a valuable step towards realizing true robot in-hand manipulation capabilities.

    "abstract": "An antithetical concept, adaptive symmetry, to conservative symmetry in physics is proposed to understand the deep neural networks (DNNs). It characterizes the invariance of variance, where a biotic system explores different pathways of evolution with equal probability in absence of feedback signals, and complex functional structure emerges from quantitative accumulation of adaptive-symmetries breaking in response to feedback signals. Theoretically and experimentally, we characterize the optimization process of a DNN system as an extended adaptive-symmetry-breaking process. One particular finding is that a hierarchically large DNN would have a large reservoir of adaptive symmetries, and when the information capacity of the reservoir exceeds the complexity of the dataset, the system could absorb all perturbations of the examples and self-organize into a functional structure of zero training errors measured by a certain surrogate risk. More specifically, this process is characterized by a statistical-mechanical model that could be appreciated as a generalization of statistics physics to the DNN organized complex system, and characterizes regularities in higher dimensionality. The model consists of three constitutes that could be appreciated as the counterparts of Boltzmann distribution, Ising model, and conservative symmetry, respectively: (1) a stochastic definition/interpretation of DNNs that is a multilayer probabilistic graphical model, (2) a formalism of circuits that perform biological computation, (3) a circuit symmetry from which self-similarity between the microscopic and the macroscopic adaptability manifests. The model is analyzed with a method referred as the statistical assembly method that analyzes the coarse-grained behaviors (over a symmetry group) of the heterogeneous hierarchical many-body interaction in DNNs.

There are many existing methods for digital privacy protection, including network security, cryptography, and access control. However, there is still a gap in the digital privacy protection levels available for users. This paper studies the digital privacy divide (DPD) problem in ICT systems. First, we introduce an online DPD study for understanding the DPD problem by collecting responses from 776 ICT users using crowdsourcing task assignments. Second, we propose a factor analysis-based statistical method for generating the DPD index from a set of observable DPD question variables. In particular, the DPD index provides one scaled measure for the DPD gap by exploring the dimensionality of the eight questions in the DPD survey. Third, we introduce a DPD proportional odds model for analyzing the relationship between the DPD status and the socio-demographic patterns of the users. Our results show that the DPD survey meets the internal consistency reliability with rigorous statistical measures, e.g., Cronbach's $\\alpha=0.92$. Furthermore, the DPD index is shown to capture the underlying communality of all DPD variables. Finally, the DPD proportional odds model indicates a strong statistical correlation between the DPD status and the age groups of the ICT users. For example, we find that young users (15-32 years) are generally more concerned about their digital privacy than senior ones (33 years and over). ",

Specifically, IGS aims to categorize an object from a given category hierarchy via several rounds of interactive queries. In each round of query, the search algorithm picks a category and receives a boolean answer on whether the object is under the chosen category. The main efficiency goal asks for the minimum number of queries to identify the correct hierarchical category for the object. In this paper, we study the average-case interactive graph search (AIGS) problem that aims to minimize the expected number of queries when the objects follow a probability distribution. We propose a greedy search policy that splits the candidate categories as evenly as possible with respect to the probability weights, which offers an approximation guarantee of $O(\\log n)$ for AIGS given the category hierarchy is a directed acyclic graph (DAG), where $n$ is the total number of categories. Meanwhile, if the input hierarchy is a tree, we show that a constant approximation factor of $(1+\\sqrt{5})/2$ can be achieved. Furthermore, we present efficient implementations of the greedy policy, namely GreedyTree and GreedyDAG, that can quickly categorize the object in practice.

    "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved state-of-the-art results for semi-supervised node classification on graphs. Nevertheless, the challenge of how to effectively learn GNNs with very few labels is still under-explored. As one of the prevalent semi-supervised methods, pseudo-labeling has been proposed to explicitly address the label scarcity problem. It aims to augment the training set with pseudo-labeled unlabeled nodes with high confidence so as to re-train a supervised model in a self-training cycle. However, the existing pseudo-labeling approaches often suffer from two major drawbacks. First, they tend to conservatively expand the label set by selecting only high-confidence unlabeled nodes without assessing their informativeness. Unfortunately, those high-confidence nodes often convey overlapping information with given labels, leading to minor improvements for model re-training. Second, these methods incorporate pseudo-labels to the same loss function with genuine labels, ignoring their distinct contributions to the classification task. In this paper, we propose a novel informative pseudo-labeling framework, called InfoGNN, to facilitate learning of GNNs with extremely few labels. Our key idea is to pseudo label the most informative nodes that can maximally represent the local neighborhoods via mutual information maximization. To mitigate the potential label noise and class-imbalance problem arising from pseudo labeling, we also carefully devise a generalized cross entropy loss with a class-balanced regularization to incorporate generated pseudo labels into model re-training. Extensive experiments on six real-world graph datasets demonstrate that our proposed approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and strong self-supervised methods on graphs. ",

In a smart home, various anomalies (such as fire or flooding) could happen, due to cyber attacks, device malfunctions, or human mistakes. These concerns motivate researchers to propose various anomaly detection approaches. Existing works on smart home anomaly detection focus on checking the sequence of IoT devices' events but leave out the temporal information of events. This limitation prevents them to detect anomalies that cause delay rather than missing/injecting events. To fill this gap, in this paper, we propose a novel anomaly detection method that takes the inter-event intervals into consideration. We propose an innovative metric to quantify the temporal similarity between two event sequences. We design a mechanism to learn the temporal patterns of event sequences of common daily activities. Delay-caused anomalies are detected by comparing the sequence with the learned patterns. We collect device events from a real-world testbed for training and testing. The experiment results show that our proposed method achieves accuracies of 93%, 88%, 89% for three daily activities. ",

We show that the network heavily favours linking nodes of high degree, indicating that new scientific connections are primarily made between popular concepts, which constitutes the main feature of our model. Besides this notion of popularity, we use a measure of similarity between nodes quantified by a normalized count of their common neighbours to improve the model. Finally, we show that the model can be further improved by considering a time-weighted adjacency matrix with both older and newer links having higher impact in the predictions, representing rooted concepts and state of the art research, respectively.

However, there are several challenges when it comes to applying these language models to solve programming language (PL) related problems directly, the significant one of which is the lack of domain knowledge issue that substantially deteriorates the model's performance. To this end, we propose the AstBERT model, a pre-trained language model aiming to better understand the PL using the abstract syntax tree (AST). Specifically, we collect a colossal amount of source codes (both java and python) from GitHub and incorporate the contextual code knowledge into our model through the help of code parsers, in which AST information of the source codes can be interpreted and integrated. We verify the performance of the proposed model on code information extraction and code search tasks, respectively. Experiment results show that our AstBERT model achieves state-of-the-art performance on both downstream tasks (with 96.4% for code information extraction task, and 57.12% for code search task). ",

    "abstract": "Graph contrastive learning is the state-of-the-art unsupervised graph representation learning framework and has shown comparable performance with supervised approaches. However, evaluating whether the graph contrastive learning is robust to adversarial attacks is still an open problem because most existing graph adversarial attacks are supervised models, which means they heavily rely on labels and can only be used to evaluate the graph contrastive learning in a specific scenario. For unsupervised graph representation methods such as graph contrastive learning, it is difficult to acquire labels in real-world scenarios, making traditional supervised graph attack methods difficult to be applied to test their robustness. In this paper, we propose a novel unsupervised gradient-based adversarial attack that does not rely on labels for graph contrastive learning. We compute the gradients of the adjacency matrices of the two views and flip the edges with gradient ascent to maximize the contrastive loss. In this way, we can fully use multiple views generated by the graph contrastive learning models and pick the most informative edges without knowing their labels, and therefore can promisingly support our model adapted to more kinds of downstream tasks. Extensive experiments show that our attack outperforms unsupervised baseline attacks and has comparable performance with supervised attacks in multiple downstream tasks including node classification and link prediction. We further show that our attack can be transferred to other graph representation models as well. ",

Influence maximization is one of the main problems in critical nodes mining and is usually handled with heuristics. In this paper, a deep graph learning framework IMGNN is proposed and the corresponding training sample generation scheme is designed. The framework takes centralities of nodes in a network as input and the probability that nodes in the optimal initial spreaders as output. By training on a large number of small synthetic networks, IMGNN is more efficient than human-based heuristics in minimizing the size of initial spreaders under the fixed infection scale. The experimental results on one synthetic and five real networks show that, compared with traditional non-iterative node ranking algorithms, IMGNN has the smallest proportion of initial spreaders under different infection probabilities when the final infection scale is fixed.

We explore the effects of possible CPR configurations in ablations including the number of mining stages, the top similar example selection ratio in each stage, and progressive training with an incremental number of the final Top-k selection. The overall mining quality is measured to reflect the recall across training set classes. CPR reaches a median class mining recall of 83.3%, outperforming previous work by 5.5%. Implementation-wise, CPR is complementary to pretext tasks and can be easily applied to previous work. In the evaluation of pretraining on UCF101, CPR consistently improves existing work and even achieves state-of-the-art R@1 of 56.7% and 24.4% in video retrieval as well as 83.8% and 54.8% in action recognition on UCF101 and HMDB51.

Detecting cloned co-change candidates is essential for clone-tracking, and studies have shown that we can use clone detection tools to find cloned co-change candidates. However, although several studies evaluate clone detection tools for their accuracy in detecting cloned fragments, we found no study that evaluates clone detection tools for detecting cloned co-change candidates. In this study, we explore the dimension of code clone research for detecting cloned co-change candidates. We compare the performance of 12 different configurations of nine promising clone detection tools in identifying cloned co-change candidates from eight open-source C and Java-based subject systems of various sizes and application domains.

Recent developments in this field rely label-dependent supervised learning techniques which is antithetical to the 35 petabytes of unlabelled satellite imagery in NASA GIBS. To solve this problem, we establish CELESTIAL-a self-supervised learning pipeline for effectively leveraging sparsely-labeled satellite imagery. This pipeline successfully adapts SimCLR, an algorithm that first learns image representations on unlabelled data and then fine-tunes this knowledge on the provided labels. Our results show CELESTIAL requires only a third of the labels that the supervised method needs to attain the same accuracy on an experimental dataset. The first unsupervised tier can enable applications such as reverse image search for NASA Worldview (i.e. searching similar atmospheric phenomenon over years of unlabelled data with minimal samples) and the second supervised tier can lower the necessity of expensive data annotation significantly. In the future, we hope we can generalize the CELESTIAL pipeline to other data types, algorithms, and applications. ",

In this paper, we introduce simplicial patterns -- that we call simplets -- and generalize the task of frequent pattern mining from the realm of graphs to that of simplicial complexes. Our task is particularly challenging due to the enormous search space and the need for higher-order isomorphism. We show that finding the occurrences of simplets in a complex can be reduced to a bipartite graph isomorphism problem, in linear time and at most quadratic space. We then propose an anti-monotonic frequency measure that allows us to start the exploration from small simplets and stop expanding a simplet as soon as its frequency falls below the minimum frequency threshold. Equipped with these ideas and a clever data structure, we develop a memory-conscious algorithm that, by carefully exploiting the relationships among the simplices in the complex and among the simplets, achieves efficiency and scalability for our complex mining task. Our algorithm, FreSCo, comes in two flavors: it can compute the exact frequency of the simplets or, more quickly, it can determine whether a simplet is frequent, without having to compute the exact frequency. Experimental results prove the ability of FreSCo to mine frequent simplets in complexes of various size and dimension, and the significance of the simplets with respect to the traditional graph patterns.

Diverse solutions have been proposed to cope with the challenge of latency and power consumption, including light-weight neural networks and efficient hardware accelerators. Moreover, research on quantization reduces the cost of computation and shows the error resiliency of DNNs. To improve the latency and power efficiency of hardware accelerators by exploiting the error resiliency, we propose an application-specific optimization method for the automatic design of approximate multipliers for DNNs. The proposed method optimizes an approximate multiplier by minimizing the error according to the probability distributions extracted from DNNs. By applying the optimized approximate multiplier to a DNN, we obtain 1.60%, 15.32%, and 20.19% higher accuracies than the best reproduced approximate multiplier on the widely used MNIST, FashionMNIST, and CIFAR-10 datasets, respectively, with 12.17% smaller area, 23.38% less power consumption, and 16.53% lower latency. Compared with an exact multiplier, the optimized multiplier reduces the area, power consumption, and latency by 36.88%, 52.45%, and 26.63%, respectively. Applied to FPGA-based and ASIC-based DNN accelerator modules, our approximate multiplier obtains low LUT utilization and small area respectively with competitive max frequency and power consumption, which shows the effectiveness of the proposed method in reducing the hardware cost of DNN accelerators.

However, traditional change detection algorithms have not deeply explored the relevance of spatial and spectral changed features, which leads to low detection accuracy. To better excavate both spectral and spatial information of changed features, a joint morphology and patch-tensor change detection (JMPT) method is proposed. Initially, a patch-based tensor strategy is adopted to exploit similar property of spatial structure, where the non-overlapping local patch image is reshaped into a new tensor cube, and then three-order Tucker decompositon and image reconstruction strategies are adopted to obtain more robust multi-temporal hyperspectral datasets. Meanwhile, multiple morphological profiles including max-tree and min-tree are applied to extract different attributes of multi-temporal images. Finally, these results are fused to general a final change detection map.

It has the potential for negative impacts on individuals and society. Therefore, detecting fake news on social media is important and also a technically challenging problem these days.

However, previous methods focus mainly on improving the detection accuracy while neglecting the cost in memory and computation, which may hinder their real-world applications. In this paper, we propose a novel lightweight ORSI-SOD solution, named CorrNet, to address these issues. In CorrNet, we first lighten the backbone (VGG-16) and build a lightweight subnet for feature extraction. Then, following the coarse-to-fine strategy, we generate an initial coarse saliency map from high-level semantic features in a Correlation Module (CorrM). The coarse saliency map serves as the location guidance for low-level features. In CorrM, we mine the object location information between high-level semantic features through the cross-layer correlation operation. Finally, based on low-level detailed features, we refine the coarse saliency map in the refinement subnet equipped with Dense Lightweight Refinement Blocks, and produce the final fine saliency map. By reducing the parameters and computations of each component, CorrNet ends up having only 4.09M parameters and running with 21.09G FLOPs. Experimental results on two public datasets demonstrate that our lightweight CorrNet achieves competitive or even better performance compared with 26 state-of-the-art methods (including 16 large CNN-based methods and 2 lightweight methods), and meanwhile enjoys the clear memory and run time efficiency.

Thus, we present the first method (AirPose) to estimate human pose and shape using images captured by multiple extrinsically uncalibrated flying cameras. AirPose itself calibrates the cameras relative to the person instead of relying on any pre-calibration. It uses distributed neural networks running on each UAV that communicate viewpoint-independent information with each other about the person (i.e., their 3D shape and articulated pose). The person's shape and pose are parameterized using the SMPL-X body model, resulting in a compact representation, that minimizes communication between the UAVs.

    "abstract": "Legged robots that can operate autonomously in remote and hazardous environments will greatly increase opportunities for exploration into under-explored areas. Exteroceptive perception is crucial for fast and energy-efficient locomotion: perceiving the terrain before making contact with it enables planning and adaptation of the gait ahead of time to maintain speed and stability. However, utilizing exteroceptive perception robustly for locomotion has remained a grand challenge in robotics. Snow, vegetation, and water visually appear as obstacles on which the robot cannot step~-- or are missing altogether due to high reflectance. Additionally, depth perception can degrade due to difficult lighting, dust, fog, reflective or transparent surfaces, sensor occlusion, and more. For this reason, the most robust and general solutions to legged locomotion to date rely solely on proprioception. This severely limits locomotion speed, because the robot has to physically feel out the terrain before adapting its gait accordingly. Here we present a robust and general solution to integrating exteroceptive and proprioceptive perception for legged locomotion. We leverage an attention-based recurrent encoder that integrates proprioceptive and exteroceptive input. The encoder is trained end-to-end and learns to seamlessly combine the different perception modalities without resorting to heuristics. The result is a legged locomotion controller with high robustness and speed. The controller was tested in a variety of challenging natural and urban environments over multiple seasons and completed an hour-long hike in the Alps in the time recommended for human hikers. ",

As machine learning, federated learning is threatened by adversarial attacks against the integrity of the learning model and the privacy of data via a distributed approach to tackle local and global learning. This weak point is exacerbated by the inaccessibility of data in federated learning, which makes harder the protection against adversarial attacks and evidences the need to furtherance the research on defence methods to make federated learning a real solution for safeguarding data privacy. In this paper, we present an extensive review of the threats of federated learning, as well as as their corresponding countermeasures, attacks versus defences. This survey provides a taxonomy of adversarial attacks and a taxonomy of defence methods that depict a general picture of this vulnerability of federated learning and how to overcome it. Likewise, we expound guidelines for selecting the most adequate defence method according to the category of the adversarial attack. Besides, we carry out an extensive experimental study from which we draw further conclusions about the behaviour of attacks and defences and the guidelines for selecting the most adequate defence method according to the category of the adversarial attack.

However, this work assumes that all time varying covariates are confounding and thus attempts to balance the full state representation. Given that the actual subset of covariates that may in fact be confounding is in general unknown, recent work on counterfactual evaluation in the static, non-temporal setting has suggested that disentangling the covariate representation into separate factors, where each either influence treatment selection, patient outcome or both can help isolate selection bias and restrict balancing efforts to factors that influence outcome, allowing the remaining factors which predict treatment without needlessly being balanced.

However, existing textual adversarial attacks usually utilize the gradient or prediction confidence to generate adversarial examples, making it hard to be deployed in real-world applications. To this end, we consider a rarely investigated but more rigorous setting, namely hard-label attack, in which the attacker could only access the prediction label. In particular, we find that the changes on prediction label caused by word substitutions on the adversarial example could precisely reflect the importance of different words. Based on this observation, we propose a novel hard-label attack, called Learning-based Hybrid Local Search (LHLS) algorithm, which effectively estimates word importance with the prediction label from the attack history and integrate such information into hybrid local search algorithm to optimize the adversarial perturbation. Extensive evaluations for text classification and textual entailment using various datasets and models show that our LHLS significantly outperforms existing hard-label attacks regarding the attack performance as well as adversary quality.

In most cases, upgrading used TPLs is a complex and error-prone activity that must be carefully carried out to limit the ripple effects on the software project that depends on the libraries being upgraded. In this paper, we propose EvoPlan as a novel approach to the recommendation of different upgrade plans given a pair of library-version as input. In particular, among the different paths that can be possibly followed to upgrade the current library version to the desired updated one, EvoPlan is able to suggest the plan that can potentially minimize the efforts being needed to migrate the code of the clients from the library's current release to the target one. The approach has been evaluated on a curated dataset using conventional metrics used in Information Retrieval, i.e., precision, recall, and F-measure. The experimental results show that EvoPlan obtains an encouraging prediction performance considering two different criteria in the plan specification, i.e., the popularity of migration paths and the number of open and closed issues in GitHub for those projects that have already followed the recommended migration paths.

In this paper we introduce active connectivity for mobile application scenarios, such as mobile robots. This is a feature that enables the option to regulate physical characteristics such as the speed of a node as it moves, in order to keep being connected to the TSCH network. We model the active connectivity approach through a basic example where two nodes are moving towards the same direction to infer the main principles of the introduced approach. We evaluate the active connectivity feature through simulations and quantify trade-off between connectivity and application-layer performance. ",

    "abstract": "Self-supervised learning has not been fully explored for point cloud analysis. Current frameworks are mainly based on point cloud reconstruction. Given only 3D coordinates, such approaches tend to learn local geometric structures and contours, while failing in understanding high level semantic content. Consequently, they achieve unsatisfactory performance in downstream tasks such as classification, segmentation, etc. To fill this gap, we propose a generic Contour-Perturbed Reconstruction Network (CP-Net), which can effectively guide self-supervised reconstruction to learn semantic content in the point cloud, and thus promote discriminative power of point cloud representation. First, we introduce a concise contour-perturbed augmentation module for point cloud reconstruction. With guidance of geometry disentangling, we divide point cloud into contour and content components. Subsequently, we perturb the contour components and preserve the content components on the point cloud. As a result, self supervisor can effectively focus on semantic content, by reconstructing the original point cloud from such perturbed one. Second, we use this perturbed reconstruction as an assistant branch, to guide the learning of basic reconstruction branch via a distinct dual-branch consistency loss. In this case, our CP-Net not only captures structural contour but also learn semantic content for discriminative downstream tasks. Finally, we perform extensive experiments on a number of point cloud benchmarks. Part segmentation results demonstrate that our CP-Net (81.5% of mIoU) outperforms the previous self-supervised models, and narrows the gap with the fully-supervised methods. For classification, we get a competitive result with the fully-supervised methods on ModelNet40 (92.5% accuracy) and ScanObjectNN (87.9% accuracy). The codes and models will be released afterwards.

    "abstract": "Covering option discovery has been developed to improve the exploration of reinforcement learning in single-agent scenarios with sparse reward signals, through connecting the most distant states in the embedding space provided by the Fiedler vector of the state transition graph. However, these option discovery methods cannot be directly extended to multi-agent scenarios, since the joint state space grows exponentially with the number of agents in the system. Thus, existing researches on adopting options in multi-agent scenarios still rely on single-agent option discovery and fail to directly discover the joint options that can improve the connectivity of the joint state space of agents. In this paper, we show that it is indeed possible to directly compute multi-agent options with collaborative exploratory behaviors among the agents, while still enjoying the ease of decomposition. Our key idea is to approximate the joint state space as a Kronecker graph -- the Kronecker product of individual agents' state transition graphs, based on which we can directly estimate the Fiedler vector of the joint state space using the Laplacian spectrum of individual agents' transition graphs. This decomposition enables us to efficiently construct multi-agent joint options by encouraging agents to connect the sub-goal joint states which are corresponding to the minimum or maximum values of the estimated joint Fiedler vector. The evaluation based on multi-agent collaborative tasks shows that the proposed algorithm can successfully identify multi-agent options, and significantly outperforms prior works using single-agent options or no options, in terms of both faster exploration and higher cumulative rewards.

With this temporal information, TKGC methods can learn the dynamic evolution of the knowledge graph that KGC methods fail to capture. In this paper, for the first time, we summarize the recent advances in TKGC research.

In its original formulation, only codes with rate $1/4$ are considered, and a theoretical analysis requiring computationally demanding formulas is provided. This makes ASBK difficult to optimize in situations of practical interest. In this paper, we introduce a much simpler model for such a protocol, which additionally supports the use of codes with arbitrary rate. This makes blockchains implementing ASBK much easier to design and optimize. Furthermore, disposing of a clearer view of the protocol, some general features and considerations can be derived (e.g., nodes behaviour in largely participated networks). As a concrete application of our analysis, we consider relevant blockchain parameters and find network settings that minimize the amount of data downloaded by light nodes. Our results show that the protocol benefits from the use of codes defined over large finite fields, with code rates that may be even significantly different from the originally proposed ones. ",

    "abstract": "Assessing the effects of a policy based on observational data from a different policy is a common problem across several high-stake decision-making domains, and several off-policy evaluation (OPE) techniques have been proposed. However, these methods largely formulate OPE as a problem disassociated from the process used to generate the data (i.e. structural assumptions in the form of a causal graph). We argue that explicitly highlighting this association has important implications on our understanding of the fundamental limits of OPE. First, this implies that current formulation of OPE corresponds to a narrow set of tasks, i.e. a specific causal estimand which is focused on prospective evaluation of policies over populations or sub-populations. Second, we demonstrate how this association motivates natural desiderata to consider a general set of causal estimands, particularly extending the role of OPE for counterfactual off-policy evaluation at the level of individuals of the population. A precise description of the causal estimand highlights which OPE estimands are identifiable from observational data under the stated generative assumptions. For those OPE estimands that are not identifiable, the causal perspective further highlights where more experimental data is necessary, and highlights situations where human expertise can aid identification and estimation. Furthermore, many formalisms of OPE overlook the role of uncertainty entirely in the estimation process.We demonstrate how specifically characterising the causal estimand highlights the different sources of uncertainty and when human expertise can naturally manage this uncertainty. We discuss each of these aspects as actionable desiderata for future OPE research at scale and in-line with practical utility. ",

File behavior is measured by way of a standardized set of Boolean \"messages\" produced as the files are read. By thresholding the posterior probability that a file exhibiting a particular set of messages is from a particular dialect, our model yields a practical classification algorithm for two dialects. We demonstrate that this thresholding algorithm for two dialects can be bootstrapped from a training set consisting primarily of one dialect. Both the (parametric) theoretical and the (non-parametric) empirical distributions of file behaviors for one dialect yield good classification performance, and outperform classification based on simply counting messages. Our theoretical framework relies on statistical independence of messages within each dialect. Violations of this assumption are detectable and allow a format analyst to identify \"boundaries\" between dialects. A format analyst can therefore greatly reduce the number of files they need to consider when crafting new criteria for dialect detection, since they need only consider the files that exhibit ambiguous message patterns.

Conventionally, IoT/edge devices need to transmit the data directly to the base station for training the model using machine learning techniques. The data transmission introduces privacy issues that might lead to security concerns and monetary losses. Recently, Federated learning was proposed to partially solve privacy issues via model-sharing with base station. However, the centralized nature of federated learning only allow the devices within the vicinity of base stations to share the trained models. Furthermore, the long-range communication compels the devices to increase transmission power, which raises the energy efficiency concerns. In this work, we propose distributed federated learning (DBFL) framework that overcomes the connectivity and energy efficiency issues for distant devices. The DBFL framework is compatible with mobile edge computing architecture that connects the devices in a distributed manner using clustering protocols. Experimental results show that the framework increases the classification performance by 7.4\\% in comparison to conventional federated learning while reducing the energy consumption. ",

However, it requires to extract accurate models of arteries from low resolution medical images, which remains challenging. Centerline-based representation is widely used to model large vascular networks with small vessels, as it enables manual editing and encodes the topological information. In this work, we propose an automatic method to generate an hexahedral mesh suitable for CFD directly from centerlines. The proposed method is an improvement of the state-of-the-art in terms of robustness, mesh quality and reproductibility. Both the modeling and meshing tasks are addressed. A new vessel model based on penalized splines is proposed to overcome the limitations inherent to the centerline representation, such as noise and sparsity. Bifurcations are reconstructed using a physiologically accurate parametric model that we extended to planar n-furcations. Finally, a volume mesh with structured, hexahedral and flow oriented cells is produced from the proposed vascular network model. The proposed method offers a better robustness and mesh quality than the state-of-the-art methods. As it combines both modeling and meshing techniques, it can be applied to edit the geometry and topology of vascular models effortlessly to study the impact on hemodynamics. We demonstrate the efficiency of our method by entirely meshing a dataset of 60 cerebral vascular networks. 92\\% of the vessels and 83\\% of the bifurcations where mesh without defects needing manual intervention, despite the challenging aspect of the input data.

The combination of such formulation leads SyMos to be constrained towards preserving important geometric structures such as momentum and a symplectic form and learn from limited data. Furthermore, it allows to learn dynamics only from the poses as training data. We extend SyMos to include variational integrators within the learning framework by developing an implicit root-find layer which leads to End-to-End Symplectic Momentum Neural Networks (E2E-SyMo). Through experimental results, using the pendulum and cartpole we show that such combination not only allows these models tol earn from limited data but also provides the models with the capability of preserving the symplectic form and show better long-term behaviour.

It will be proved that the model, called Network Evolution Chain, is a stationary and ergodic stochastic process. Therefore, the Asymptotic Equipartition Property can be applied to it. The model's entropy rate and typical sequences are also explored. Extracting particular information from the network and methods to simulate network evolution in the continuous time domain are discussed. Additionally, the Erdos-Renyi Network Evolution Chain is introduced as a subset of our model with the additional property of its stationary distribution matching the Erdos-Renyi random graph model. The stationary distributions of nodes and graphs are calculated for this subset alongside its entropy rate. The simulation results at the end of the paper back up the proved theorems and calculated values. ",

    "abstract": "Automatic grading models are valued for the time and effort saved during the instruction of large student bodies. Especially with the increasing digitization of education and interest in large-scale standardized testing, the popularity of automatic grading has risen to the point where commercial solutions are widely available and used. However, for short answer formats, automatic grading is challenging due to natural language ambiguity and versatility. While automatic short answer grading models are beginning to compare to human performance on some datasets, their robustness, especially to adversarially manipulated data, is questionable. Exploitable vulnerabilities in grading models can have far-reaching consequences ranging from cheating students receiving undeserved credit to undermining automatic grading altogether - even when most predictions are valid. In this paper, we devise a black-box adversarial attack tailored to the educational short answer grading scenario to investigate the grading models' robustness. In our attack, we insert adjectives and adverbs into natural places of incorrect student answers, fooling the model into predicting them as correct. We observed a loss of prediction accuracy between 10 and 22 percentage points using the state-of-the-art models BERT and T5. While our attack made answers appear less natural to humans in our experiments, it did not significantly increase the graders' suspicions of cheating. Based on our experiments, we provide recommendations for utilizing automatic grading systems more safely in practice. ",

We also describe how our method handles a neural network containing historical information, which does not follow a general form of dynamics. The proposed method is evaluated by its performance in classical control benchmarks with external disturbances. We also extend our control framework to be applied in an aggressive autonomous driving task with unknown friction. In all experiments, our method outperformed the compared methods by a large margin.

    "abstract": "Background: Vaccination programs are effective only when a significant percentage of people are vaccinated. However, vaccine acceptance varies among communities around the world. Social media usage is arguably one of the factors affecting public attitudes towards vaccines. Objective: This study aims to identify if the social media usages factors can be used to predict attitudes and behavior towards the COVID-19 vaccines among the people in the Arab world. Methods: An online survey was conducted in the Arab countries and 217 Arab people participated in this study. Logistic regression was applied to identify what demographics and social media usage factors predict public attitudes and behavior towards the COVID-19 vaccines. Results: Of the 217 participants, 56.22% of them were willing to accept the vaccine and 41.47% of them were hesitant. This study shows that none of the social media usages factors were significant enough to predict the actual vaccine acceptance behavior. Whereas the analysis showed few of the social media usage factors can predict public attitudes towards the COVID-19 vaccines. For example, frequent social media users were 2.85 times more likely to agree that the risk of COVID-19 is being exaggerated (OR=2.85, 95% CI=0.86-9.45, p=0.046) than infrequent social media users. Whereas participants having more trust in vaccine information shared by their contacts are less likely to agree that decision-makers have verified that vaccines are safe (OR=0.528, 95% CI= 0.276-1.012, p=0.05). Conclusion: The use of social media and information shared on it may affect public attitudes towards COVID-19 vaccines. Therefore, disseminating correct and validated information about COVID-19 and other vaccines on social media is important for increasing public trust and countering the impact of incorrect and misinformation.

    "abstract": "Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation, a computationally intensive method that provides invaluable insights into the behavior of biomolecules, typically requires large-scale parallelization. Implementation of fast parallel MD simulation demands both high bandwidth and low latency for inter-node communication, but in current semiconductor technology, neither of these properties is scaling as quickly as intra-node computational capacity. This disparity in scaling necessitates architectural innovations to maximize the utilization of computational units. For Anton 3, the latest in a family of highly successful special-purpose supercomputers designed for MD simulations, we thus designed and built a completely new specialized network as part of our ASIC. Tightly integrating this network with specialized computation pipelines enables Anton 3 to perform simulations orders of magnitude faster than any general-purpose supercomputer, and to outperform its predecessor, Anton 2 (the state of the art prior to Anton 3), by an order of magnitude. In this paper, we present the three key features of the network that contribute to the high performance of Anton 3. First, through architectural optimizations, the network achieves very low end-to-end inter-node communication latency for fine-grained messages, allowing for better overlap of computation and communication. Second, novel application-specific compression techniques reduce the size of most messages sent between nodes, thereby increasing effective inter-node bandwidth. Lastly, a new hardware synchronization primitive, called a network fence, supports fast fine-grained synchronization tailored to the data flow within a parallel MD application. These application-driven specializations to the network are critical for Anton 3's MD simulation performance advantage over all other machines. ",

Towards this objective, we create a first-of-its-kind dataset linking Twitter and OpenSea (the largest NFT marketplace) to capture social media profiles and linked NFT assets. Our dataset contains 245,159 tweets posted by 17,155 unique users, directly linking 62,997 NFT assets on OpenSea worth 19 Million USD. We have made the dataset public. We analyze the growth of NFTs, characterize the Twitter users promoting NFT assets, and gauge the impact of Twitter features on the virality of an NFT. Further, we investigate the effectiveness of different social media and NFT platform features by experimenting with multiple machine learning and deep learning models to predict an asset's value. Our results show that social media features improve the accuracy by 6% over baseline models that use only NFT platform features. Among social media features, count of user membership lists, number of likes and retweets are important features. ",

Does it use too much energy, is it bad for the environment? Finally we extend our analysis to the long term: is mining economically feasible forever? What will the global hash rate be in 40 years? How is mining impacted by the limits of computation and energy? Is it physically sustainable in the long run?

    "abstract": "Performance forecasting is an age-old problem in economics and finance. Recently, developments in machine learning and neural networks have given rise to non-linear time series models that provide modern and promising alternatives to traditional methods of analysis. In this paper, we present an ensemble of independent and parallel long short-term memory (LSTM) neural networks for the prediction of stock price movement. LSTMs have been shown to be especially suited for time series data due to their ability to incorporate past information, while neural network ensembles have been found to reduce variability in results and improve generalization. A binary classification problem based on the median of returns is used, and the ensemble's forecast depends on a threshold value, which is the minimum number of LSTMs required to agree upon the result. The model is applied to the constituents of the smaller, less efficient Stockholm OMX30 instead of other major market indices such as the DJIA and S&P500 commonly found in literature. With a straightforward trading strategy, comparisons with a randomly chosen portfolio and a portfolio containing all the stocks in the index show that the portfolio resulting from the LSTM ensemble provides better average daily returns and higher cumulative returns over time. Moreover, the LSTM portfolio also exhibits less volatility, leading to higher risk-return ratios. ",

We demonstrate that the web of pairwise lead-lag relationships between time series can be helpfully construed as a directed network, for which there exist suitable algorithms for the detection of pairs of lead-lag clusters with high pairwise imbalance. Within our framework, we consider a number of choices for the pairwise lead-lag metric and directed network clustering components. Our framework is validated on both a synthetic generative model for multivariate lead-lag time series systems and daily real-world US equity prices data. We showcase that our method is able to detect statistically significant lead-lag clusters in the US equity market. We study the nature of these clusters in the context of the empirical finance literature on lead-lag relations and demonstrate how these can be used for the construction of predictive financial signals.

In this work we contribute an approach to learning under such group structure, that does not require prior information on the group identities. Our paradigm is motivated by the Laplacian geometry of an underlying network with a related community structure, and proceeds by directly incorporating this into a penalty that is effectively computed via a heat flow-based local network dynamics. In fact, we demonstrate a procedure to construct such a network based on the available data. Notably, we dispense with computationally intensive pre-processing involving clustering of variables, spectral or otherwise. Our technique is underpinned by rigorous theorems that guarantee its effective performance and provide bounds on its sample complexity. In particular, in a wide range of settings, it provably suffices to run the heat flow dynamics for time that is only logarithmic in the problem dimensions. We explore in detail the interfaces of our approach with key statistical physics models in network science, such as the Gaussian Free Field and the Stochastic Block Model. We validate our approach by successful applications to real-world data from a wide array of application domains, including computer science, genetics, climatology and economics. Our work raises the possibility of applying similar diffusion-based techniques to classical learning tasks, exploiting the interplay between geometric, dynamical and stochastic structures underlying the data.
