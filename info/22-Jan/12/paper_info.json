    "title": "CausalKG: Causal Knowledge Graph Explainability using interventional and  counterfactual reasoning",
    "abstract": "Humans use causality and hypothetical retrospection in their daily decision-making, planning, and understanding of life events. The human mind, while retrospecting a given situation, think about questions such as \"What was the cause of the given situation?\", \"What would be the effect of my action?\", or \"Which action led to this effect?\". It develops a causal model of the world, which learns with fewer data points, makes inferences, and contemplates counterfactual scenarios. The unseen, unknown, scenarios are known as counterfactuals. AI algorithms use a representation based on knowledge graphs (KG) to represent the concepts of time, space, and facts. A KG is a graphical data model which captures the semantic relationships between entities such as events, objects, or concepts. The existing KGs represent causal relationships extracted from texts based on linguistic patterns of noun phrases for causes and effects as in ConceptNet and WordNet. The current causality representation in KGs makes it challenging to support counterfactual reasoning. A richer representation of causality in AI systems using a KG-based approach is needed for better explainability, and support for intervention and counterfactuals reasoning, leading to improved understanding of AI systems by humans. The causality representation requires a higher representation framework to define the context, the causal information, and the causal effects. The proposed Causal Knowledge Graph (CausalKG) framework, leverages recent progress of causality and KG towards explainability. CausalKG intends to address the lack of a domain adaptable causal model and represent the complex causal relations using the hyper-relational graph representation in the KG. We show that the CausalKG's interventional and counterfactual reasoning can be used by the AI system for the domain explainability. ",

    "abstract": "Studying structural properties of linear dynamical systems through invariant subspaces is one of the key contributions of the geometric approach to system theory. In general, a model of the dynamics is required in order to compute the invariant subspaces of interest. In this paper we overcome this limitation by finding data-driven formulas for some of the foundational tools of geometric control. In particular, for an unknown linear system, we show how controlled and conditioned invariant subspaces can be found directly from experimental data. We use our formulas and approach to (i) find a feedback gain that confines the system state within a desired subspace, (ii) compute the invariant zeros of the unknown system, and (iii) design attacks that remain undetectable.

    "title": "Learning Fair Node Representations with Graph Counterfactual Fairness",
    "abstract": "Fair machine learning aims to mitigate the biases of model predictions against certain subpopulations regarding sensitive attributes such as race and gender. Among the many existing fairness notions, counterfactual fairness measures the model fairness from a causal perspective by comparing the predictions of each individual from the original data and the counterfactuals. In counterfactuals, the sensitive attribute values of this individual had been modified. Recently, a few works extend counterfactual fairness to graph data, but most of them neglect the following facts that can lead to biases: 1) the sensitive attributes of each node's neighbors may causally affect the prediction w.r.t. this node; 2) the sensitive attributes may causally affect other features and the graph structure. To tackle these issues, in this paper, we propose a novel fairness notion - graph counterfactual fairness, which considers the biases led by the above facts. To learn node representations towards graph counterfactual fairness, we propose a novel framework based on counterfactual data augmentation. In this framework, we generate counterfactuals corresponding to perturbations on each node's and their neighbors' sensitive attributes. Then we enforce fairness by minimizing the discrepancy between the representations learned from the original graph and the counterfactuals for each node. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world graphs show that our framework outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines in graph counterfactual fairness, and also achieves comparable prediction performance.

    "abstract": "Learning invariant representations is an important requirement when training machine learning models that are driven by spurious correlations in the datasets. These spurious correlations, between input samples and the target labels, wrongly direct the neural network predictions resulting in poor performance on certain groups, especially the minority groups. Robust training against these spurious correlations requires the knowledge of group membership for every sample. Such a requirement is impractical in situations where the data labeling efforts for minority or rare groups are significantly laborious or where the individuals comprising the dataset choose to conceal sensitive information. On the other hand, the presence of such data collection efforts results in datasets that contain partially labeled group information. Recent works have tackled the fully unsupervised scenario where no labels for groups are available. Thus, we aim to fill the missing gap in the literature by tackling a more realistic setting that can leverage partially available sensitive or group information during training. First, we construct a constraint set and derive a high probability bound for the group assignment to belong to the set. Second, we propose an algorithm that optimizes for the worst-off group assignments from the constraint set. Through experiments on image and tabular datasets, we show improvements in the minority group's performance while preserving overall aggregate accuracy across groups. ",

Homepage2Vec, thanks to its feature set (textual content, metadata tags, and visual attributes) and recent progress in natural language representation, is language-independent by design and can generate embeddings representation. We show that Homepage2Vec correctly classifies websites with a macro-averaged F1-score of 0.90, with stable performance across low- as well as high-resource languages. Feature analysis shows that a small subset of efficiently computable features suffices to achieve high performance even with limited computational resources.

However, as GNNs are extensively used in human-centered applications, the issue of fairness has arisen. While edge deletion is a common method used to promote fairness in GNNs, it fails to consider when data is inherently missing fair connections. In this work we consider the unexplored method of edge addition, accompanied by deletion, to promote fairness. We propose two model-agnostic algorithms to perform edge editing: a brute force approach and a continuous approximation approach, FairEdit. FairEdit performs efficient edge editing by leveraging gradient information of a fairness loss to find edges that improve fairness. We find that FairEdit outperforms standard training for many data sets and GNN methods, while performing comparably to many state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating FairEdit's ability to improve fairness across many domains and models.

Seeking a generalized transformation decoding the magnitudes of eigencomponents from vector-valued signals is thus the main objective of this paper. Several attempts are explored, and also it is found that performing the transformation at hierarchical levels of adjacency help profile the spectral characteristics of signals more insightfully.

    "abstract": "With quadrotors becoming immensely popular in applications such as relief operations, infrastructure maintenance etc., a key control design challenge arises when the quadrotor has to manoeuvre through constrained spaces during various operational scenarios: for example, inspecting a pipeline within predefined velocity and space, dropping relief material at a precise location under tight spaces etc., under the face of parametric uncertainties and external disturbances. To tackle such scenarios, a controller needs to ensure a predefined tracking accuracy so as not to violate the constraints while simultaneously tackling uncertainties and disturbances. However, state-of-the-art controllers dealing with constrained system motion are either not applicable for an underactuated system like quadrotor, or cannot tackle system uncertainties under full state constraints. This work attempts to fill such a gap in literature by designing Barrier Lyapunov Function (BLF) based robust controllers to satisfy multiple state-constraints while simultaneously negotiating parametric uncertainties and external disturbances. The superiority of the BLF control method over a typical unconstrained controller is demonstrated, followed by a robust control design to satisfy position and orientation constraints on quadrotor dynamics. Finally, full state-constraints on a quadrotor(i.e., constraints on the position, orientation, linear velocity and angular velocity) are satisfied with robust control. For each control design, the closed-loop system stability is studied analytically and the efficacy of the design is validated extensively either via realistic simulation scenarios or via experiments performed on a real quadrotor.

    "abstract": "Applications running in geographically distributed setting are becoming prevalent. Large-scale online services often share or replicate their data into multiple data centers (DCs) in different geographic regions. Driven by the data communication need of these applications, inter-datacenter network (IDN) is getting increasingly important. However, we find congestion control for inter-datacenter networks quite challenging. Firstly, the inter-datacenter communication involves both data center networks (DCNs) and wide-area networks (WANs) connecting multiple data centers. Such a network environment presents quite heterogeneous characteristics (e.g., buffer depths, RTTs). Existing congestion control mechanisms consider either DCN or WAN congestion, while not simultaneously capturing the degree of congestion for both. Secondly, to reduce evolution cost and improve flexibility, large enterprises have been building and deploying their wide-area routers based on shallow-buffered switching chips. However, with legacy congestion control mechanisms (e.g., TCP Cubic), shallow buffer can easily get overwhelmed by large BDP (bandwidth-delay product) wide-area traffic, leading to high packet losses and degraded throughput. This thesis describes my research efforts on optimizing congestion control mechanisms for the inter-datacenter networks. First, we design GEMINI - a practical congestion control mechanism that simultaneously handles congestions both in DCN andWAN. Second, we present FlashPass - a proactive congestion control mechanism that achieves near zero loss without degrading throughput under the shallow-buffered WAN. Extensive evaluation shows their superior performance over existing congestion control mechanisms. ",

Our experiment with participants in the automotive design field that used both the proposed D-Graph and a baseline tool for design-concept-phrase creation tasks suggested a positive difference in participants' self-evaluation on the phrases they created, though not significant. Experts' evaluations on the phrases did not show significant differences. Negative correlations between the cosine similarity of the two words in a design-concept phrase and the experts' evaluation were significant.

Second, and crucially, it is also possible to learn to compose API functions into a sequence, given an input and the desired final output, without explicitly knowing the intermediate values. We show that we can speed up an enumerative program synthesizer by using predictions from our model variants.

In this paper, in addition to considering the integrity of the information from the training data of the ciphertext pair, domain knowledge about the structure of differential cryptanalysis is also considered into the training process of deep learning to improve the performance.

Most of algorithms usually assume that the malicious at tackers no more than benign clients or the data distribution is independent identically distribution (IID). However, no one knows the number of malicious attackers and the data distribution is usually non identically distribution (Non-IID). In this paper, we propose RFLBAT which utilizes principal component analysis (PCA) technique and Kmeans clustering algorithm to defend against backdoor attack. Our algorithm RFLBAT does not bound the number of backdoored attackers and the data distribution, and requires no auxiliary information outside of the learning process. We conduct extensive experiments including a variety of backdoor attack types. Experimental results demonstrate that RFLBAT outperforms the existing state-of-the-art algorithms and is able to resist various backdoor attack scenarios including different number of attackers (DNA), different Non-IID scenarios (DNS), different number of clients (DNC) and distributed backdoor attack (DBA).

    "abstract": "Object detection using aerial drone imagery has received a great deal of attention in recent years. While visible light images are adequate for detecting objects in most scenarios, thermal cameras can extend the capabilities of object detection to night-time or occluded objects. As such, RGB and Infrared (IR) fusion methods for object detection are useful and important. One of the biggest challenges in applying deep learning methods to RGB/IR object detection is the lack of available training data for drone IR imagery, especially at night. In this paper, we develop several strategies for creating synthetic IR images using the AIRSim simulation engine and CycleGAN. Furthermore, we utilize an illumination-aware fusion framework to fuse RGB and IR images for object detection on the ground. We characterize and test our methods for both simulated and actual data. Our solution is implemented on an NVIDIA Jetson Xavier running on an actual drone, requiring about 28 milliseconds of processing per RGB/IR image pair. ",

    "abstract": "Unobserved confounding is the main obstacle to causal effect estimation from observational data. Instrumental variables (IVs) are widely used for causal effect estimation when there exist latent confounders. With the standard IV method, when a given IV is valid, unbiased estimation can be obtained, but the validity requirement of standard IV is strict and untestable. Conditional IV has been proposed to relax the requirement of standard IV by conditioning on a set of observed variables (known as a conditioning set for a conditional IV). However, the criterion for finding a conditioning set for a conditional IV needs complete causal structure knowledge or a directed acyclic graph (DAG) representing the causal relationships of both observed and unobserved variables. This makes it impossible to discover a conditioning set directly from data. In this paper, by leveraging maximal ancestral graphs (MAGs) in causal inference with latent variables, we propose a new type of IV, ancestral IV in MAG, and develop the theory to support data-driven discovery of the conditioning set for a given ancestral IV in MAG. Based on the theory, we develop an algorithm for unbiased causal effect estimation with an ancestral IV in MAG and observational data. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets have demonstrated the performance of the algorithm in comparison with existing IV methods. ",

However, most of the augmentation methods are non-learnable, which causes the issue of generating unbeneficial augmented graphs. Such augmentation may degenerate the representation ability of graph contrastive learning methods. Therefore, we motivate our method to generate augmented graph by a learnable graph augmenter, called MEta Graph Augmentation (MEGA). We then clarify that a \"good\" graph augmentation must have uniformity at the instance-level and informativeness at the feature-level. To this end, we propose a novel approach to learning a graph augmenter that can generate an augmentation with uniformity and informativeness. The objective of the graph augmenter is to promote our feature extraction network to learn a more discriminative feature representation, which motivates us to propose a meta-learning paradigm. Empirically, the experiments across multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that MEGA outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in graph self-supervised learning tasks. Further experimental studies prove the effectiveness of different terms of MEGA. ",

    "abstract": "Proximity detection is to determine whether an IoT receiver is within a certain distance from a signal transmitter. Due to its low cost and high popularity, Bluetooth low energy (BLE) has been used to detect proximity based on the received signal strength indicator (RSSI). To address the fact that RSSI can be markedly influenced by device carriage states, previous works have incorporated RSSI with inertial measurement unit (IMU) using deep learning. However, they have not sufficiently accounted for the impact of multipath. Furthermore, due to the special setup, the IMU data collected in the training process may be biased, which hampers the system's robustness and generalizability. This issue has not been studied before. We propose PRID, an IMU-assisted BLE proximity detection approach robust against RSSI fluctuation and IMU data bias. PRID histogramizes RSSI to extract multipath features and uses carriage state regularization to mitigate overfitting due to IMU data bias. We further propose PRID-lite based on a binarized neural network to substantially cut memory requirements for resource-constrained devices. We have conducted extensive experiments under different multipath environments, data bias levels, and a crowdsourced dataset. Our results show that PRID significantly reduces false detection cases compared with the existing arts (by over 50%). PRID-lite further reduces over 90% PRID model size and extends 60% battery life, with a minor compromise in accuracy (7%). ",

    "abstract": "Eternal Vertex Cover problem is a dynamic variant of the vertex cover problem. We have a two player game in which guards are placed on some vertices of a graph. In every move, one player (the attacker) attacks an edge. In response to the attack, the second player (defender) moves the guards along the edges of the graph in such a manner that at least one guard moves along the attacked edge. If such a movement is not possible, then the attacker wins. If the defender can defend the graph against an infinite sequence of attacks, then the defender wins. The minimum number of guards with which the defender has a winning strategy is called the Eternal Vertex Cover Number of the graph G. On general graphs, the computational problem of determining the minimum eternal vertex cover number is NP-hard and admits a 2-approximation algorithm and an exponential kernel. The complexity of the problem on bipartite graphs is open, as is the question of whether the problem admits a polynomial kernel. We settle both these questions by showing that Eternal Vertex Cover is NP-hard and does not admit a polynomial compression even on bipartite graphs of diameter six. This result also holds for split graphs. We also show that the problem admits a polynomial time algorithm on the class of cobipartite graphs. ",

Before they are widely adopted, the fundamental issues of robustness need to be addressed. Along this line, we propose a formal framework to evaluate word-level robustness. First, to study safe regions for a model, we introduce robustness radius which is the boundary where the model can resist any perturbation. As calculating the maximum robustness radius is computationally hard, we estimate its upper and lower bound. We repurpose attack methods as ways of seeking upper bound and design a pseudo-dynamic programming algorithm for a tighter upper bound. Then verification method is utilized for a lower bound. Further, for evaluating the robustness of regions outside a safe radius, we reexamine robustness from another view: quantification. A robustness metric with a rigorous statistical guarantee is introduced to measure the quantification of adversarial examples, which indicates the model's susceptibility to perturbations outside the safe radius. The metric helps us figure out why state-of-the-art models like BERT can be easily fooled by a few word substitutions, but generalize well in the presence of real-world noises. ",

    "abstract": "Existing learning methods for LiDAR-based applications use 3D points scanned under a pre-determined beam configuration, e.g., the elevation angles of beams are often evenly distributed. Those fixed configurations are task-agnostic, so simply using them can lead to sub-optimal performance. In this work, we take a new route to learn to optimize the LiDAR beam configuration for a given application. Specifically, we propose a reinforcement learning-based learning-to-optimize (RL-L2O) framework to automatically optimize the beam configuration in an end-to-end manner for different LiDAR-based applications. The optimization is guided by the final performance of the target task and thus our method can be integrated easily with any LiDAR-based application as a simple drop-in module. The method is especially useful when a low-resolution (low-cost) LiDAR is needed, for instance, for system deployment at a massive scale. We use our method to search for the beam configuration of a low-resolution LiDAR for two important tasks: 3D object detection and localization. Experiments show that the proposed RL-L2O method improves the performance in both tasks significantly compared to the baseline methods. We believe that a combination of our method with the recent advances of programmable LiDARs can start a new research direction for LiDAR-based active perception.

To realize the full potential of heterogeneous computers, however, many hardware and software design challenges have to be overcome. While architectural and system simulators can be used to analyze heterogeneous computers, they are faced with unavoidable compromises between simulation speed and performance modeling accuracy. In this work we present HEROv2, an FPGA-based research platform that enables accurate and fast exploration of heterogeneous computers consisting of accelerators based on clusters of 32-bit RISC-V cores and an application-class 64-bit ARMv8 or RV64 host processor. HEROv2 allows to seamlessly share data between 64-bit hosts and 32-bit accelerators and comes with a fully open-source on-chip network, a unified heterogeneous programming interface, and a mixed-data-model, mixed-ISA heterogeneous compiler based on LLVM. We evaluate HEROv2 in four case studies from the application level over toolchain and system architecture down to accelerator microarchitecture. We demonstrate how HEROv2 enables effective research and development on the full stack of heterogeneous computing. For instance, the compiler can tile loops and infer data transfers to and from the accelerators, which leads to a speedup of up to 4.4x compared to the original program and in most cases is only 15 % slower than a handwritten implementation, which requires 2.6x more code.

    "abstract": "Third-party libraries with rich functionalities facilitate the fast development of Node.js software, but also bring new security threats that vulnerabilities could be introduced through dependencies. In particular, the threats could be excessively amplified by transitive dependencies. Existing research either considers direct dependencies or reasoning transitive dependencies based on reachability analysis, which neglects the NPM-specific dependency resolution rules, resulting in wrongly resolved dependencies. Consequently, further fine-grained analysis, such as vulnerability propagation and their evolution in dependencies, cannot be carried out precisely at a large scale, as well as deriving ecosystem-wide solutions for vulnerabilities in dependencies. To fill this gap, we propose a knowledge graph-based dependency resolution, which resolves the dependency relations of dependencies as trees (i.e., dependency trees), and investigates the security threats from vulnerabilities in dependency trees at a large scale. We first construct a complete dependency-vulnerability knowledge graph (DVGraph) that captures the whole NPM ecosystem (over 10 million library versions and 60 million well-resolved dependency relations). Based on it, we propose DTResolver to statically and precisely resolve dependency trees, as well as transitive vulnerability propagation paths, by considering the official dependency resolution rules. Based on that, we carry out an ecosystem-wide empirical study on vulnerability propagation and its evolution in dependency trees. Our study unveils lots of useful findings, and we further discuss the lessons learned and solutions for different stakeholders to mitigate the vulnerability impact in NPM. For example, we implement a dependency tree based vulnerability remediation method (DTReme) for NPM packages, and receive much better performance than the official tool (npm audit fix). ",

Our NSOS relies strongly on the foundation of a hierarchical architecture that incorporates dedicated entities per domain to manage every segment of the mobile network from the access, to the transport and core network part for a scalable orchestration of federated network slices. The DASA enables the NSOS to autonomously adapt its resources to changes in the demand for slice orchestration requests (SORs) while enforcing a given mean overall time taken by the NSOS to process any SOR. The proposed DASA includes both proactive and reactive resource provisioning techniques). The proposed resource dimensioning heuristic algorithm of the DASA is based on a queuing model for the NSOS, which consists of an open network of G/G/m queues. Finally, we validate the proper operation and evaluate the performance of our DASA solution for the NSOS by means of system-level simulations. ",

SGADV utilizes the dissimilarity score to produce the optimized adversarial example, i.e., similarity-based adversarial attack. This technique applies to both white-box and gray-box attacks against authentication systems that determine genuine or imposter users using the dissimilarity score. To validate the effectiveness of SGADV, we conduct extensive experiments on face datasets of LFW, CelebA, and CelebA-HQ against deep face recognition models of FaceNet and InsightFace in both white-box and gray-box settings. The results suggest that the proposed method significantly outperforms the existing adversarial attack techniques in the gray-box setting.

We discuss the reasons why differential privacy is not an effective protection in this setting and mention potential other risk mitigation methods. ",

    "abstract": "Video content is multifaceted, consisting of objects, scenes, interactions or actions. The existing datasets mostly label only one of the facets for model training, resulting in the video representation that biases to only one facet depending on the training dataset. There is no study yet on how to learn a video representation from multifaceted labels, and whether multifaceted information is helpful for video representation learning. In this paper, we propose a new learning framework, MUlti-Faceted Integration (MUFI), to aggregate facets from different datasets for learning a representation that could reflect the full spectrum of video content. Technically, MUFI formulates the problem as visual-semantic embedding learning, which explicitly maps video representation into a rich semantic embedding space, and jointly optimizes video representation from two perspectives. One is to capitalize on the intra-facet supervision between each video and its own label descriptions, and the second predicts the \"semantic representation\" of each video from the facets of other datasets as the inter-facet supervision. Extensive experiments demonstrate that learning 3D CNN via our MUFI framework on a union of four large-scale video datasets plus two image datasets leads to superior capability of video representation. The pre-learnt 3D CNN with MUFI also shows clear improvements over other approaches on several downstream video applications. More remarkably, MUFI achieves 98.1%/80.9% on UCF101/HMDB51 for action recognition and 101.5% in terms of CIDEr-D score on MSVD for video captioning. ",

    "abstract": "Vision-language pre-training has been an emerging and fast-developing research topic, which transfers multi-modal knowledge from rich-resource pre-training task to limited-resource downstream tasks. Unlike existing works that predominantly learn a single generic encoder, we present a pre-trainable Universal Encoder-DEcoder Network (Uni-EDEN) to facilitate both vision-language perception (e.g., visual question answering) and generation (e.g., image captioning). Uni-EDEN is a two-stream Transformer based structure, consisting of three modules: object and sentence encoders that separately learns the representations of each modality, and sentence decoder that enables both multi-modal reasoning and sentence generation via inter-modal interaction. Considering that the linguistic representations of each image can span different granularities in this hierarchy including, from simple to comprehensive, individual label, a phrase, and a natural sentence, we pre-train Uni-EDEN through multi-granular vision-language proxy tasks: Masked Object Classification (MOC), Masked Region Phrase Generation (MRPG), Image-Sentence Matching (ISM), and Masked Sentence Generation (MSG). In this way, Uni-EDEN is endowed with the power of both multi-modal representation extraction and language modeling. Extensive experiments demonstrate the compelling generalizability of Uni-EDEN by fine-tuning it to four vision-language perception and generation downstream tasks. ",

Controlling this movement in real time with a user-defined control signal is also an important task in video games for example. Solutions based on fully-connected layers (MLPs) and Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) have given impressive results in generating and controlling various movements with close-range interactions between the environment and the virtual character. However, a major shortcoming of fully-connected layers is their computational and memory cost which may lead to sub-optimized solution. In this work, we apply pruning algorithms to compress an MLP- MoE neural network in the context of interactive character animation, which reduces its number of parameters and accelerates its computation time with a trade-off between this acceleration and the synthesized motion quality. This work demonstrates that, with the same number of experts and parameters, the pruned model produces less motion artifacts than the dense model and the learned high-level motion features are similar for both ",

Despite these successes, not all applications can be fuzzed efficiently. In particular, stateful applications such as network protocol implementations are constrained by their low fuzzing throughput and the need to develop fuzzing harnesses that reset their state and isolate their side effects. In this paper, we present SnapFuzz, a novel fuzzing framework for network applications. SnapFuzz offers a robust architecture that transforms slow asynchronous network communication into fast synchronous communication based on UNIX domain sockets, speeds up all file operations by redirecting them to an in-memory filesystem, and removes the need for many fragile modifications, such as configuring time delays or writing cleanup scripts, together with several other improvements. Using SnapFuzz, we fuzzed five popular networking applications: LightFTP, Dnsmasq, LIVE555, TinyDTLS and Dcmqrscp. We report impressive performance speedups of 72.4x, 49.7x, 24.8x, 23.9x, and 8.5x, respectively, with significantly simpler fuzzing harnesses in all cases. Through its performance advantage, SnapFuzz has also found 12 previously-unknown crashes in these applications. ",

Moving away from the canonical position error bound (PEB) analysis, we develop a realistic framework in which each positioning measurement is affected by errors depending upon the actual wireless channel between the measuring base station and the target device. Our solution, referred to as LOKO, is a fast-converging algorithm that can be readily applied to current 5G (or future) roll-out processes.

This paper proposes training a graph neural network (GNN) to learn the estimates given the PMU voltage and current measurements as inputs, with the intent of obtaining fast and accurate predictions during the evaluation phase. GNN is trained using synthetic datasets, created by randomly sampling sets of measurements in the power system and labelling them with a solution obtained using a linear SE with PMUs solver.

    "abstract": "In the area of graph drawing, the One-Sided Crossing Minimization Problem (OSCM) is defined on a bipartite graph with both vertex sets aligned parallel to each other and all edges being drawn as straight lines. The task is to find a permutation of one of the node sets such that the total number of all edge-edge intersections, called crossings, is minimized. Usually, the degree of the nodes of one set is limited by some constant k, with the problem then abbreviated to OSCM-k. In this work, we study an online variant of this problem, in which one of the node sets is already given. The other node set and the incident edges are revealed iteratively and each node has to be inserted into placeholders, which we call slots. The goal is again to minimize the number of crossings in the final graph. Minimizing crossings in an online way is related to the more empirical field of dynamic graph drawing. Note the slotted OSCM problem makes instances harder to solve for an online algorithm but in the offline case it is equivalent to the version without slots. We show that the online slotted OSCM-k is not competitive for any k greater or equal 2 and subsequently limit the graph class to that of 2-regular graphs, for which we show a lower bound of 4/3 and an upper bound of 5 on the competitive ratio.

Answering questions like these requires us to differentially describe groups of graphs: Given a set of graphs and a partition of these graphs into groups, discover what graphs in one group have in common, how they systematically differ from graphs in other groups, and how multiple groups of graphs are related. We refer to this task as graph group analysis, which seeks to describe similarities and differences between graph groups by means of statistically significant subgraphs. To perform graph group analysis, we introduce Gragra, which uses maximum entropy modeling to identify a non-redundant set of subgraphs with statistically significant associations to one or more graph groups. Through an extensive set of experiments on a wide range of synthetic and real-world graph groups, we confirm that Gragra works well in practice. ",

We present a theoretical analysis suggesting that many specialized multi-task optimizers can be interpreted as forms of regularization. Moreover, we show that, when coupled with standard regularization and stabilization techniques from single-task learning, unitary scalarization matches or improves upon the performance of complex multi-task optimizers in both supervised and reinforcement learning settings.

Hence, current methods to represent 3D people do not provide a full generative model of people in clothing. In this paper, we propose a novel method that learns to generate detailed 3D shapes of people in a variety of garments with corresponding skinning weights. Specifically, we devise a multi-subject forward skinning module that is learned from only a few posed, un-rigged scans per subject. To capture the stochastic nature of high-frequency details in garments, we leverage an adversarial loss formulation that encourages the model to capture the underlying statistics. We provide empirical evidence that this leads to realistic generation of local details such as wrinkles. We show that our model is able to generate natural human avatars wearing diverse and detailed clothing. Furthermore, we show that our method can be used on the task of fitting human models to raw scans, outperforming the previous state-of-the-art. ",

    "abstract": "The electrical generation and transmission infrastructures of many countries are under increased pressure. This partially reflects the move towards low carbon economies and the increased reliance on renewable power generation systems. There has been a reduction in the use of traditional fossil fuel generation systems, which provide a stable base load, and this has been replaced with more unpredictable renewable generation. As a consequence, the available load on the grid is becoming more unstable. To cope with this variability, the UK National Grid has placed emphasis on the investigation of various technical mechanisms (e.g. implementation of smart grids, energy storage technologies, auxiliary power sources), which may be able to prevent critical situations, when the grid may become sometimes unstable. The successful implementation of these mechanisms may require large numbers of electrical consumers (e.g. HVAC systems, food refrigeration systems) for example to make additional investments in energy storage technologies (food refrigeration systems) or to integrate their electrical demand from industrial processes into the National Grid (HVAC systems). However, in the situation of food refrigeration systems, during these critical situations, even if the thermal inertia within refrigeration systems may maintain effective performance of the device for a short period of time (e.g. under 1 minute) when the electrical input load into the system is reduced, this still carries the paramount risk of food safety even for very short periods of time (e.g. under 1 minute). Therefore before considering any future actions (e.g. investing in energy storage technologies) to prevent the critical situations when grid becomes unstable, it is also needed to understand during the normal use how the temperature profiles evolve along the time inside these massive networks of food refrigeration systems.

The current work aims to understand two basic questions regarding the deep neural network (DNN) method: what data the DNN needs and how general the DNN method can be. Sampling and preprocessing determine the DNN training dataset, further affect DNN prediction ability. The current work proposes using Box-Cox transformation (BCT) to preprocess the combustion data. In addition, this work compares different sampling methods with or without preprocessing, including the Monte Carlo method, manifold sampling, generative neural network method (cycle-GAN), and newly-proposed multi-scale sampling. Our results reveal that the DNN trained by the manifold data can capture the chemical kinetics in limited configurations but cannot remain robust toward perturbation, which is inevitable for the DNN coupled with the flow field. The Monte Carlo and cycle-GAN samplings can cover a wider phase space but fail to capture small-scale intermediate species, producing poor prediction results. A three-hidden-layer DNN, based on the multi-scale method without specific flame simulation data, allows predicting chemical kinetics in various scenarios and being stable during the temporal evolutions. This single DNN is readily implemented with several CFD codes and validated in various combustors, including (1). zero-dimensional autoignition, (2). one-dimensional freely propagating flame, (3). two-dimensional jet flame with triple-flame structure, and (4). three-dimensional turbulent lifted flames. The results demonstrate the satisfying accuracy and generalization ability of the pre-trained DNN.

While it is well-known that similarity is associated with high abundance of triangles (3-cycles), there is no such result for complementarity. We argue that quadrangles (4-cycles) are the characteristic motif of complementarity-driven relations. Starting from very general geometric arguments we introduce two families of coefficients measuring the extent to which relations are shaped by similarity or complementarity. We study their main properties and show, through several case studies, that they can be used to distinguish between different kinds of social relations or networks from different domains as well as detect groups of similar or complementary nodes.

State-of-the-art deep learning approaches predominantly apply convolutional layers in segmentation and are typically highly customized for a specific experimental configuration; often unable to generalize to unknown data. As the model capacity of classical convolutional layers is limited by a finite set of learned kernels, our approach uses a graph representation of the image and focuses on the node transitions in multiple magnifications. We propose a novel architecture for semantic segmentation of cell nuclei robust to differences in experimental configuration such as staining and variation of cell types. The architecture is comprised of a novel neuroplastic graph attention network based on residual graph attention layers and concurrent optimization of the graph structure representing multiple magnification levels of the histopathological image. The modification of graph structure, which generates the node features by projection, is as important to the architecture as the graph neural network itself. It determines the possible message flow and critical properties to optimize attention, graph structure, and node updates in a balanced magnification loss. In experimental evaluation, our framework outperforms ensembles of state-of-the-art neural networks, with a fraction of the neurons typically required, and sets new standards for the segmentation of new nuclei datasets.

In particular, quantum machine learning, a class of quantum algorithms which exploit qubits for creating trainable neural networks, will provide more power to solve problems such as pattern recognition, clustering and machine learning in general. The building block of feed-forward neural networks consists of one layer of neurons connected to an output neuron that is activated according to an arbitrary activation function. The corresponding learning algorithm goes under the name of Rosenblatt perceptron. Quantum perceptrons with specific activation functions are known, but a general method to realize arbitrary activation functions on a quantum computer is still lacking. Here we fill this gap with a quantum algorithm which is capable to approximate any analytic activation functions to any given order of its power series. Unlike previous proposals providing irreversible measurement--based and simplified activation functions, here we show how to approximate any analytic function to any required accuracy without the need to measure the states encoding the information. Thanks to the generality of this construction, any feed-forward neural network may acquire the universal approximation properties according to Hornik's theorem.

In this concept, the 3D segmentation network learns from dual reciprocal adversarial learning approaches. To enhance the generalization across the segmentation predictions and to make the segmentation network robust, we adhere to the Virtual Adversarial Training approach by generating more adversarial examples via adding some noise on original patient data. By incorporating a critic that acts as a quantitative subjective referee, the segmentation network learns from the uncertainty information associated with segmentation results. We trained and evaluated network architecture on the RSNA-ASNR-MICCAI BraTS 2021 dataset. Our performance on the online validation dataset is as follows: Dice Similarity Score of 81.38%, 90.77% and 85.39%; Hausdorff Distance (95\\%) of 21.83 mm, 5.37 mm, 8.56 mm for the enhancing tumor, whole tumor and tumor core, respectively. Similarly, our approach achieved a Dice Similarity Score of 84.55%, 90.46% and 85.30%, as well as Hausdorff Distance (95\\%) of 13.48 mm, 6.32 mm and 16.98 mm on the final test dataset. Overall, our proposed approach yielded better performance in segmentation accuracy for each tumor sub-region.

    "title": "Learning to Enhance or Not: Neural Network-Based Switching of Enhanced  and Observed Signals for Overlapping Speech Recognition",
    "abstract": "The combination of a deep neural network (DNN) -based speech enhancement (SE) front-end and an automatic speech recognition (ASR) back-end is a widely used approach to implement overlapping speech recognition. However, the SE front-end generates processing artifacts that can degrade the ASR performance. We previously found that such performance degradation can occur even under fully overlapping conditions, depending on the signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). To mitigate the degradation, we introduced a rule-based method to switch the ASR input between the enhanced and observed signals, which showed promising results. However, the rule's optimality was unclear because it was heuristically designed and based only on SIR and SNR values. In this work, we propose a DNN-based switching method that directly estimates whether ASR will perform better on the enhanced or observed signals. We also introduce soft-switching that computes a weighted sum of the enhanced and observed signals for ASR input, with weights given by the switching model's output posteriors. The proposed learning-based switching showed performance comparable to that of rule-based oracle switching. The soft-switching further improved the ASR performance and achieved a relative character error rate reduction of up to 23 % as compared with the conventional method. ",

    "title": "Neural Architecture Search For LF-MMI Trained Time Delay Neural Networks",
    "abstract": "State-of-the-art automatic speech recognition (ASR) system development is data and computation intensive. The optimal design of deep neural networks (DNNs) for these systems often require expert knowledge and empirical evaluation. In this paper, a range of neural architecture search (NAS) techniques are used to automatically learn two types of hyper-parameters of factored time delay neural networks (TDNN-Fs): i) the left and right splicing context offsets; and ii) the dimensionality of the bottleneck linear projection at each hidden layer. These techniques include the differentiable neural architecture search (DARTS) method integrating architecture learning with lattice-free MMI training; Gumbel-Softmax and pipelined DARTS methods reducing the confusion over candidate architectures and improving the generalization of architecture selection; and Penalized DARTS incorporating resource constraints to balance the trade-off between performance and system complexity. Parameter sharing among TDNN-F architectures allows an efficient search over up to 7^28 different systems. Statistically significant word error rate (WER) reductions of up to 1.2% absolute and relative model size reduction of 31% were obtained over a state-of-the-art 300-hour Switchboard corpus trained baseline LF-MMI TDNN-F system featuring speed perturbation, i-Vector and learning hidden unit contribution (LHUC) based speaker adaptation as well as RNNLM rescoring. Performance contrasts on the same task against recent end-to-end systems reported in the literature suggest the best NAS auto-configured system achieves state-of-the-art WERs of 9.9% and 11.1% on the NIST Hub5' 00 and Rt03s test sets respectively with up to 96% model size reduction. Further analysis using Bayesian learning shows that the proposed NAS approaches can effectively minimize the structural redundancy in the TDNN-F systems and reduce their model parameter uncertainty. Consistent performance improvements were also obtained on a UASpeech dysarthric speech recognition task. ",

    "abstract": "In graph analysis, a classic task consists in computing similarity measures between (groups of) nodes. In latent space random graphs, nodes are associated to unknown latent variables. One may then seek to compute distances directly in the latent space, using only the graph structure. In this paper, we show that it is possible to consistently estimate entropic-regularized Optimal Transport (OT) distances between groups of nodes in the latent space. We provide a general stability result for entropic OT with respect to perturbations of the cost matrix. We then apply it to several examples of random graphs, such as graphons or $\\epsilon$-graphs on manifolds. Along the way, we prove new concentration results for the so-called Universal Singular Value Thresholding estimator, and for the estimation of geodesic distances on a manifold. ",
