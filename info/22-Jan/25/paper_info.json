    "title": "GreaseLM: Graph REASoning Enhanced Language Models for Question  Answering",
    "abstract": "Answering complex questions about textual narratives requires reasoning over both stated context and the world knowledge that underlies it. However, pretrained language models (LM), the foundation of most modern QA systems, do not robustly represent latent relationships between concepts, which is necessary for reasoning. While knowledge graphs (KG) are often used to augment LMs with structured representations of world knowledge, it remains an open question how to effectively fuse and reason over the KG representations and the language context, which provides situational constraints and nuances. In this work, we propose GreaseLM, a new model that fuses encoded representations from pretrained LMs and graph neural networks over multiple layers of modality interaction operations. Information from both modalities propagates to the other, allowing language context representations to be grounded by structured world knowledge, and allowing linguistic nuances (e.g., negation, hedging) in the context to inform the graph representations of knowledge. Our results on three benchmarks in the commonsense reasoning (i.e., CommonsenseQA, OpenbookQA) and medical question answering (i.e., MedQA-USMLE) domains demonstrate that GreaseLM can more reliably answer questions that require reasoning over both situational constraints and structured knowledge, even outperforming models 8x larger.

Face liveness detection is one of the key steps involved in user identity verification of customers during the online onboarding/transaction processes. During identity verification, an unauthenticated user tries to bypass the verification system by several means, for example, they can capture a user photo from social media and do an imposter attack using printouts of users faces or using a digital photo from a mobile device and even create a more sophisticated attack like video replay attack. We have tried to understand the different methods of attack and created an in-house large-scale dataset covering all the kinds of attacks to train a robust deep learning model. We propose an ensemble method where multiple features of the face and background regions are learned to predict whether the user is a bonafide or an attacker. ",

    "abstract": "A reservoir computer (RC) is a type of simplified recurrent neural network architecture that has demonstrated success in the prediction of spatiotemporally chaotic dynamical systems. A further advantage of RC is that it reproduces intrinsic dynamical quantities essential for its incorporation into numerical forecasting routines such as the ensemble Kalman filter -- used in numerical weather prediction to compensate for sparse and noisy data. We explore here the architecture and design choices for a \"best in class\" RC for a number of characteristic dynamical systems, and then show the application of these choices in scaling up to larger models using localization. Our analysis points to the importance of large scale parameter optimization. We also note in particular the importance of including input bias in the RC design, which has a significant impact on the forecast skill of the trained RC model. In our tests, the the use of a nonlinear readout operator does not affect the forecast time or the stability of the forecast. The effects of the reservoir dimension, spinup time, amount of training data, normalization, noise, and the RC time step are also investigated. While we are not aware of a generally accepted best reported mean forecast time for different models in the literature, we report over a factor of 2 increase in the mean forecast time compared to the best performing RC model of Vlachas et.al (2020) for the 40 dimensional spatiotemporally chaotic Lorenz 1996 dynamics, and we are able to accomplish this using a smaller reservoir size.

    "abstract": "How to obtain hierarchical representations with an increasing level of abstraction becomes one of the key issues of learning with deep neural networks. A variety of RNN models have recently been proposed to incorporate both explicit and implicit hierarchical information in modeling languages in the literature. In this paper, we propose a novel approach called the latent indicator layer to identify and learn implicit hierarchical information (e.g., phrases), and further develop an EM algorithm to handle the latent indicator layer in training. The latent indicator layer further simplifies a text's hierarchical structure, which allows us to seamlessly integrate different levels of attention mechanisms into the structure. We called the resulting architecture as the EM-HRNN model. Furthermore, we develop two bootstrap strategies to effectively and efficiently train the EM-HRNN model on long text documents. Simulation studies and real data applications demonstrate that the EM-HRNN model with bootstrap training outperforms other RNN-based models in document classification tasks. The performance of the EM-HRNN model is comparable to a Transformer-based method called Bert-base, though the former is much smaller model and does not require pre-training. ",

    "abstract": "In recent years, hyperspectral image (HSI) classification based on generative adversarial networks (GAN) has achieved great progress. GAN-based classification methods can mitigate the limited training sample dilemma to some extent. However, several studies have pointed out that existing GAN-based HSI classification methods are heavily affected by the imbalanced training data problem. The discriminator in GAN always contradicts itself and tries to associate fake labels to the minority-class samples, and thus impair the classification performance. Another critical issue is the mode collapse in GAN-based methods. The generator is only capable of producing samples within a narrow scope of the data space, which severely hinders the advancement of GAN-based HSI classification methods. In this paper, we proposed an Adaptive DropBlock-enhanced Generative Adversarial Networks (ADGAN) for HSI classification. First, to solve the imbalanced training data problem, we adjust the discriminator to be a single classifier, and it will not contradict itself. Second, an adaptive DropBlock (AdapDrop) is proposed as a regularization method employed in the generator and discriminator to alleviate the mode collapse issue. The AdapDrop generated drop masks with adaptive shapes instead of a fixed size region, and it alleviates the limitations of DropBlock in dealing with ground objects with various shapes. Experimental results on three HSI datasets demonstrated that the proposed ADGAN achieved superior performance over state-of-the-art GAN-based methods.

Simultaneously, vision transformers and its variants have emerged as a promising and scalable alternative to convolutions on various computer vision tasks. In this paper, we are the first to question if self-supervised vision transformers (SSL-ViTs) can be adapted to two important computer vision tasks in the low-label, high-data regime: few-shot image classification and zero-shot image retrieval. The motivation is to reduce the number of manual annotations required to train a visual embedder, and to produce generalizable, semantically meaningful and robust embeddings. For few-shot image classification we train SSL-ViTs without any supervision, on external data, and use this trained embedder to adapt quickly to novel classes with limited number of labels. For zero-shot image retrieval, we use SSL-ViTs pre-trained on a large dataset without any labels and fine-tune them with several metric learning objectives. Our self-supervised attention representations outperforms the state-of-the-art on several public benchmarks for both tasks, namely miniImageNet and CUB200 for few-shot image classification by up-to 6%-10%, and Stanford Online Products, Cars196 and CUB200 for zero-shot image retrieval by up-to 4%-11%.

Most previous works adopt a self-supervised method which uses pseudo-labeled samples to guide subsequent training and testing. However, deep networks commonly require many high-quality samples for parameter optimization. The noise in pseudo-labels inevitably affects the final change detection performance. To solve the problem, we propose a Graph-based Knowledge Supplement Network (GKSNet). To be more specific, we extract discriminative information from the existing labeled dataset as additional knowledge, to suppress the adverse effects of noisy samples to some extent. Afterwards, we design a graph transfer module to distill contextual information attentively from the labeled dataset to the target dataset, which bridges feature correlation between datasets. To validate the proposed method, we conducted extensive experiments on four SAR datasets, which demonstrated the superiority of the proposed GKSNet as compared to several state-of-the-art baselines.

Especially, by leveraging the effectiveness of adversarial autoencoder (AAE) which influences the distribution of the investigated data explicitly, the raw SAR dataset is augmented into an enhanced version with a large quantity and diversity. Besides, an auto-labeling scheme is proposed to improve labeling efficiency. Finally, with jointly training small target chips and large-scene images, an integrated YOLO network combining non-maximum suppression on sub-images is used to realize multiple targets detection of high resolution images. The numerical experimental results on the MSTAR dataset show that our method can realize target detection and recognition on large-scene images accurately and efficiently.

Recent advances illustrate that how to effectively model these nonlinear variational information and learn invariant representations is an open challenge in the community of computer vision and pattern recognition To this end, we try to design a new algorithm to handle this problem. Firstly, the second-order statistic, i.e., covariance matrix is applied to model the original image sets. Due to the space formed by a set of nonsingular covariance matrices is a well-known Symmetric Positive Definite (SPD) manifold, generalising the Euclidean collaborative representation to the SPD manifold is not an easy task. Then, we devise two strategies to cope with this issue. One attempts to embed the SPD manifold-valued data representations into an associated tangent space via the matrix logarithm map. Another is to embed them into a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS) by utilizing the Riemannian kernel function. After these two treatments, CRC is applicable to the SPD manifold-valued features.

    "abstract": "Object detection has been widely used in many safety-critical tasks, such as autonomous driving. However, its vulnerability to adversarial examples has not been sufficiently studied, especially under the practical scenario of black-box attacks, where the attacker can only access the query feedback of predicted bounding-boxes and top-1 scores returned by the attacked model. Compared with black-box attack to image classification, there are two main challenges in black-box attack to detection. Firstly, even if one bounding-box is successfully attacked, another sub-optimal bounding-box may be detected near the attacked bounding-box. Secondly, there are multiple bounding-boxes, leading to very high attack cost. To address these challenges, we propose a Parallel Rectangle Flip Attack (PRFA) via random search. We explain the difference between our method with other attacks in Fig.~\\ref{fig1}. Specifically, we generate perturbations in each rectangle patch to avoid sub-optimal detection near the attacked region. Besides, utilizing the observation that adversarial perturbations mainly locate around objects' contours and critical points under white-box attacks, the search space of attacked rectangles is reduced to improve the attack efficiency. Moreover, we develop a parallel mechanism of attacking multiple rectangles simultaneously to further accelerate the attack process. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method can effectively and efficiently attack various popular object detectors, including anchor-based and anchor-free, and generate transferable adversarial examples.

Therefore, in this paper, we proposed a framework to improve CWS, named HGNSeg. It exploits multi-level external information sufficiently with the pre-trained language model and heterogeneous graph neural network. The experimental results on six benchmark datasets (e.g., Bakeoff 2005, Bakeoff 2008) validate that our approach can effectively improve the performance of Chinese word segmentation.

Unfortunately, the large amount of interactive sample labeling efforts has dramatically hindered the application of deep learning methods, especially for 3D modeling tasks, which require heterogeneous samples. To alleviate the work of data annotation for learned 3D modeling of fa\\c{c}ades, this paper proposed a semi-supervised adversarial recognition strategy embedded in inverse procedural modeling. Beginning with textured LOD-2 (Level-of-Details) models, we use the classical convolutional neural networks to recognize the types and estimate the parameters of windows from image patches. The window types and parameters are then assembled into procedural grammar. A simple procedural engine is built inside an existing 3D modeling software, producing fine-grained window geometries. To obtain a useful model from a few labeled samples, we leverage the generative adversarial network to train the feature extractor in a semi-supervised manner. The adversarial training strategy can also exploit unlabeled data to make the training phase more stable. Experiments using publicly available fa\\c{c}ade image datasets reveal that the proposed training strategy can obtain about 10% improvement in classification accuracy and 50% improvement in parameter estimation under the same network structure. In addition, performance gains are more pronounced when testing against unseen data featuring different fa\\c{c}ade styles. ",

Several risk factors, such as post-transplant illnesses, new malignancies, and even organ damage, can impair long-term survival. Therefore, technologies like Machine Learning are deployed for investigating the survival prediction of BMT receivers along with the influences that limit their resilience. In this study, an efficient survival classification model is presented in a comprehensive manner, incorporating the Chi-squared feature selection method to address the dimensionality problem and Hyper Parameter Optimization (HPO) to increase accuracy. A synthetic dataset is generated by imputing the missing values, transforming the data using dummy variable encoding, and compressing the dataset from 59 features to the 11 most correlated features using Chi-squared feature selection. The dataset was split into train and test sets at a ratio of 80:20, and the hyperparameters were optimized using Grid Search Cross-Validation. Several supervised ML methods were trained in this regard, like Decision Tree, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Gradient Boosting Classifier, Ada Boost, and XG Boost. The simulations have been performed for both the default and optimized hyperparameters by using the original and reduced synthetic dataset. After ranking the features using the Chi-squared test, it was observed that the top 11 features with HPO, resulted in the same accuracy of prediction (94.73%) as the entire dataset with default parameters. Moreover, this approach requires less time and resources for predicting the survivability of children undergoing BMT. Hence, the proposed approach may aid in the development of a computer-aided diagnostic system with satisfactory accuracy and minimal computation time by utilizing medical data records. ",

Moreover, to implement distributed learners, we propose a developed variant of soft Actor-Critic (SAC) with less hyperparameter sensitivity. Finally, we present numerical results to showcase the gain of the adopted approach on our built OpenAI-based network slicing environment and verify the performance in terms of latency, SLA Q-th percentile, and time efficiency. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that studies the feasibility of an AI-driven approach for massive network slicing under statistical SLA. ",

    "abstract": "In wireless network, the optimization problems generally have complex constraints, and are usually solved via utilizing the traditional optimization methods that have high computational complexity and need to be executed repeatedly with the change of network environments. In this paper, to overcome these shortcomings, an unsupervised deep unrolling framework based on projection gradient descent, i.e., unrolled PGD network (UPGDNet), is designed to solve a family of constrained optimization problems. The set of constraints is divided into two categories according to the coupling relations among optimization variables and the convexity of constraints. One category of constraints includes convex constraints with decoupling among optimization variables, and the other category of constraints includes non-convex or convex constraints with coupling among optimization variables. Then, the first category of constraints is directly projected onto the feasible region, while the second category of constraints is projected onto the feasible region using neural network. Finally, an unrolled sum rate maximization network (USRMNet) is designed based on UPGDNet to solve the weighted SR maximization problem for the multiuser ultra-reliable low latency communication system. Numerical results show that USRMNet has a comparable performance with low computational complexity and an acceptable generalization ability in terms of the user distribution. ",

However, the convolution operation is based on a local sliding window mechanism, which is difficult to construct the long-range dependencies of the feature maps. Meanwhile, the self-attention based global relationship aggregation methods have been widely used in computer vision, but these methods are difficult to handle high-resolution images because of the high computational complexity. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a Linear Array Self-attention (LASA) mechanism, which uses only two 2-D feature encodings to construct 3-D global weights and then refines feature maps generated by convolution layers. Based on LASA, Linear Array Network (LAN) is proposed, which is superior to the existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in both RGB and RAW based low-light enhancement tasks with a smaller amount of parameters.

Although there is an unprecedented growth in the adoption of mHealth systems, partly due to the COVID-19 pandemic, concerns about data privacy risks due to security breaches are also increasing. Whilst some studies have analyzed mHealth apps from different angles, including security, there is relatively little evidence for data privacy issues that may exist in mHealth apps used for mental health services, whose recipients can be particularly vulnerable. This paper reports an empirical study aimed at systematically identifying and understanding data privacy incorporated in mental health apps. We analyzed 27 top-ranked mental health apps from Google Play Store. Our methodology enabled us to perform an in-depth privacy analysis of the apps, covering static and dynamic analysis, data sharing behaviour, server-side tests, privacy impact assessment requests, and privacy policy evaluation. Furthermore, we mapped the findings to the LINDDUN threat taxonomy, describing how threats manifest on the studied apps. The findings reveal important data privacy issues such as unnecessary permissions, insecure cryptography implementations, and leaks of personal data and credentials in logs and web requests. There is also a high risk of user profiling as the apps' development do not provide foolproof mechanisms against linkability, detectability and identifiability. Data sharing among third parties and advertisers in the current apps' ecosystem aggravates this situation. Based on the empirical findings of this study, we provide recommendations to be considered by different stakeholders of mHealth apps in general and apps developers in particular. [...] ",

    "abstract": "Many prominent smart-contract applications such as payment channels, auctions, and voting systems often involve a mechanism in which some party must respond to a challenge or appeal some action within a fixed time limit. This pattern of challenge-response mechanisms poses great risks if during periods of high transaction volume, the network becomes congested. In this case fee market competition can prevent the inclusion of the response in blocks, causing great harm. As a result, responders are allowed long periods to submit their response and overpay in fees. To overcome these problems and improve challenge-response protocols, we suggest a secure mechanism that detects congestion in blocks and adjusts the deadline of the response accordingly. The responder is thus guaranteed a deadline extension should congestion arise. We lay theoretical foundations for congestion signals in blockchains and then proceed to analyze and discuss possible attacks on the mechanism and evaluate its robustness. Our results show that in Ethereum, using short response deadlines as low as 3 hours, the protocol has >99% defense rate from attacks even by miners with up to 33% of the computational power. Using shorter deadlines such as one hour is also possible with a similar defense rate for attackers with up to 27% of the power. ",

We assume that all the radars use same parameters, e.g., chirp duration, chirp slope, cutoff frequency, number of chirps per packet, etc, and propose and analyze slotted ALOHA and CSMA protocols to mitigate narrowband interference. We define a notion of throughput to quantify the performance of the proposed protocols. In the case of ALOHA, we analyze interference probability and throughput as functions of the system parameters. We observe that interference probability and throughput may behave differently than in wireless communication networks. For instance, if the number of chirps per packet is larger than one, the interference probabilities may be smaller for higher transmission rates. We define a medium sensing procedure, referred to as clear channel assessment (CCA), as a part of the proposed CSMA, and also define CCA success and failure events. In CSMA, the radars transmit only after a successful CCA. We study, CCA success probability, interference probability and throughput as functions of the system parameters. We observe that, unlike wireless communication networks, using the highest possible attempt rates may maximize throughput in few network scenarios. We perform an extensive simulation to verify our analytical results and to compare slotted ALOHA and CSMA. We observe that CSMA outperforms ALOHA in all realistic scenarios. ",

    "abstract": "One of the most prominent and widely-used blockchain privacy solutions are zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) mixers operating on top of smart contract-enabled blockchains. ZKP mixers typically advertise their level of privacy through a so-called anonymity set size, similar to k-anonymity, where a user hides among a set of $k$ other users. In reality, however, these anonymity set claims are mostly inaccurate, as we find through empirical measurements of the currently most active ZKP mixers. We propose five heuristics that, in combination, can increase the probability that an adversary links a withdrawer to the correct depositor on average by 51.94% (108.63%) on the most popular Ethereum (ETH) and Binance Smart Chain (BSC) mixer, respectively. Our empirical evidence is hence also the first to suggest a differing privacy-predilection of users on ETH and BSC. We further identify 105 Decentralized Finance (DeFi) attackers leveraging ZKP mixers as the initial funds and to deposit attack revenue (e.g., from phishing scams, hacking centralized exchanges, and blockchain project attacks). State-of-the-art mixers are moreover tightly intertwined with the growing DeFi ecosystem by offering ``anonymity mining'' (AM) incentives, i.e., mixer users receive monetary rewards for mixing coins. However, contrary to the claims of related work, we find that AM does not always contribute to improving the quality of an anonymity set size of a mixer, because AM tends to attract privacy-ignorant users naively reusing addresses.

We present novel results by systematically investigating a clinical dataset and a clinically relevant 5-class classification scheme, in addition to benchmark datasets and the binary classification scheme. Moreover, we derive a connection between uncertainty measures and classifier risk, from which we develop a new uncertainty measure. We observe that the previously proposed entropy-based uncertainty measure generalizes to the clinical dataset on the binary classification scheme but not on the 5-class scheme, whereas our new uncertainty measure generalizes to the latter case.

    "abstract": "Counterfactual explanations (CEs) are a powerful means for understanding how decisions made by algorithms can be changed. Researchers have proposed a number of desiderata that CEs should meet to be practically useful, such as requiring minimal effort to enact, or complying with causal models. We consider a further aspect to improve the usability of CEs: robustness to adverse perturbations, which may naturally happen due to unfortunate circumstances. Since CEs typically prescribe a sparse form of intervention (i.e., only a subset of the features should be changed), we provide two definitions of robustness, which concern, respectively, the features to change and to keep as they are. These definitions are workable in that they can be incorporated as penalty terms in the loss functions that are used for discovering CEs. To experiment with the proposed definitions of robustness, we create and release code where five data sets (commonly used in the field of fair and explainable machine learning) have been enriched with feature-specific annotations that can be used to sample meaningful perturbations. Our experiments show that CEs are often not robust and, if adverse perturbations take place, the intervention they prescribe may require a much larger cost than anticipated, or even become impossible. However, accounting for robustness in the search process, which can be done rather easily, allows discovering robust CEs systematically. Robust CEs are resilient to adverse perturbations: additional intervention to contrast perturbations is much less costly than for non-robust CEs.

Two current methods of representation are available, one based on graph theory, where a network node is reduced to a point in a graph, and the other the use of non-methodological iconic depictions such as human heads, walls, towers or computer racks. In this paper, we adopt an abstract representation methodology, the thinging machine (TM), proposed in software engineering to model computer networks. TM defines a single coherent network architecture and topology that is constituted from only five generic actions with two types of arrows. Without loss of generality, this paper applies TM to model the area of network monitoring in packet-mode transmission. Complex network documents are difficult to maintain and are not guaranteed to mirror actual situations. Network monitoring is constant monitoring for and alerting of malfunctions, failures, stoppages or suspicious activities in a network system. Current monitoring systems are built on ad hoc descriptions that lack systemization. The TM model of monitoring presents a theoretical foundation integrated with events and behavior descriptions. To investigate TM modeling s feasibility, we apply it to an existing computer network in a Kuwaiti enterprise to create an integrated network system that includes hardware, software and communication facilities. The final specifications point to TM modeling s viability in the computer networking field. ",

Taking this into account, we consider a cell-free massive MIMO-enabled mobile edge network to meet the stringent requirements of the advanced services. For the considered mobile edge network, we formulate a joint communication and computing resource allocation (JCCRA) problem with the objective of minimizing energy consumption of the users while meeting the tight delay constraints. We then propose a fully distributed cooperative solution approach based on multiagent deep deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG) algorithm. The simulation results demonstrate that the performance of the proposed distributed approach has converged to that of a centralized deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG)-based target benchmark, while alleviating the large overhead associated with the latter.

To achieve the low-complexity transmitter design, two analytical precoders, one closed-form method of adjusting the RIS phase-shifting matrices, and semi-iterative power allocation (PA) strategy of maximizing secrecy sum rate (SSR) are proposed. First, the geometric parallelogram (GPG) criterion is employed to give the phase-shifting matrices of RISs. Then, two precoders, called maximizing singular value (Max-SV) and maximizing signal-to-leakage-noise ratio (Max-SLNR), are proposed to enhance the SSR. Evenly, the maximizing SSR PA with hybrid iterative closed-form (HICF) is further proposed to improve the SSR and derived to be one root of a sixth-order polynomial computed by: (1) the Newton-Raphson algorithm is repeated twice to reduce the order of the polynomial from six to four; (2) the remaining four feasible solutions can be directly obtained by the Ferrari's method. Simulation results show that using the proposed Max-SV and Max-SLNR, the proposed GPG makes a significant SSR improvement over random phase and no RIS. Given GPG, the proposed Max-SV outperforms the proposed leakage for small-scale or medium-scale RIS. Particularly, the proposed HICF PA stragey shows about ten percent performance gain over equal PA.

Here we focus on a recently proposed RSR method termed Dual Principal Component Pursuit (DPCP) approach, which aims to recover a basis of the orthogonal complement of the subspace and is amenable to handling subspaces of high relative dimension. Prior work has shown that DPCP can provably recover the correct subspace in the presence of outliers, as long as the true dimension of the subspace is known. We show that DPCP can provably solve RSR problems in the {\\it unknown} subspace dimension regime, as long as orthogonality constraints -- adopted in previous DPCP formulations -- are relaxed and random initialization is used instead of spectral one. Namely, we propose a very simple algorithm based on running multiple instances of a projected sub-gradient descent method (PSGM), with each problem instance seeking to find one vector in the null space of the subspace. We theoretically prove that under mild conditions this approach will succeed with high probability. In particular, we show that 1) all of the problem instances will converge to a vector in the nullspace of the subspace and 2) the ensemble of problem instance solutions will be sufficiently diverse to fully span the nullspace of the subspace thus also revealing its true unknown codimension. We provide empirical results that corroborate our theoretical results and showcase the remarkable implicit rank regularization behavior of PSGM algorithm that allows us to perform RSR without being aware of the subspace dimension.

In this work, we present Mazi, an algorithm that jointly learns the hierarchical community structure and the node representations of the graph in an unsupervised fashion. To account for the structure in the node representations, Mazi generates node representations at each level of the hierarchy, and utilizes them to influence the node representations of the original graph. Further, the communities at each level are discovered by simultaneously maximizing the modularity metric and minimizing the distance between the representations of a node and its community. Using multi-label node classification and link prediction tasks, we evaluate our method on a variety of synthetic and real-world graphs and demonstrate that Mazi outperforms other hierarchical and non-hierarchical methods.

    "title": "HiSTGNN: Hierarchical Spatio-temporal Graph Neural Networks for Weather  Forecasting",
    "abstract": "Weather Forecasting is an attractive challengeable task due to its influence on human life and complexity in atmospheric motion. Supported by massive historical observed time series data, the task is suitable for data-driven approaches, especially deep neural networks. Recently, the Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) based methods have achieved excellent performance for spatio-temporal forecasting. However, the canonical GNNs-based methods only individually model the local graph of meteorological variables per station or the global graph of whole stations, lacking information interaction between meteorological variables in different stations. In this paper, we propose a novel Hierarchical Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Network (HiSTGNN) to model cross-regional spatio-temporal correlations among meteorological variables in multiple stations. An adaptive graph learning layer and spatial graph convolution are employed to construct self-learning graph and study hidden dependency among nodes of variable-level and station-level graph. For capturing temporal pattern, the dilated inception as the backbone of gate temporal convolution is designed to model long and various meteorological trends. Moreover, a dynamic interaction learning is proposed to build bidirectional information passing in hierarchical graph. Experimental results on three real-world meteorological datasets demonstrate the superior performance of HiSTGNN beyond 7 baselines and it reduces the errors by 4.2% to 11.6% especially compared to state-of-the-art weather forecasting method.

By closely inspecting the surface that the MSE loss, used to train such networks, traces under varying degradations, we were able to identify its parameterizable property. We leverage this property to propose an adverasrial attack that is able to locate the optimum degradation (effective) without needing multiple gradient-ascent steps (fast).

The ego vehicle can proceed to change lanes if a safe evasion trajectory exists even in the worst case, otherwise, it can hesitate around current lateral position or return back to the original lane.

    "abstract": "Controllable text generation concerns two fundamental tasks of wide applications, namely generating text of given attributes (i.e., attribute-conditional generation), and minimally editing existing text to possess desired attributes (i.e., text attribute transfer). Extensive prior work has largely studied the two problems separately, and developed different conditional models which, however, are prone to producing biased text (e.g., various gender stereotypes). This paper proposes to formulate controllable text generation from a principled causal perspective which models the two tasks with a unified framework. A direct advantage of the causal formulation is the use of rich causality tools to mitigate generation biases and improve control. We treat the two tasks as interventional and counterfactual causal inference based on a structural causal model, respectively. We then apply the framework to the challenging practical setting where confounding factors (that induce spurious correlations) are observable only on a small fraction of data. Experiments show significant superiority of the causal approach over previous conditional models for improved control accuracy and reduced bias. ",

However, not everything that we gaze upon, is something we want to interact with; this is known as the Midas Touch problem for gaze interfaces. To overcome the Midas Touch problem, present interfaces tend not to rely on natural gaze cues, but rather use dwell time or gaze gestures. Here we present an entirely data-driven approach to decode human intention for object manipulation tasks based solely on natural gaze cues. We run data collection experiments where 16 participants are given manipulation and inspection tasks to be performed on various objects on a table in front of them. The subjects' eye movements are recorded using wearable eye-trackers allowing the participants to freely move their head and gaze upon the scene. We use our Semantic Fovea, a convolutional neural network model to obtain the objects in the scene and their relation to gaze traces at every frame. We then evaluate the data and examine several ways to model the classification task for intention prediction. Our evaluation shows that intention prediction is not a naive result of the data, but rather relies on non-linear temporal processing of gaze cues. We model the task as a time series classification problem and design a bidirectional Long-Short-Term-Memory (LSTM) network architecture to decode intentions. Our results show that we can decode human intention of motion purely from natural gaze cues and object relative position, with $91.9\\%$ accuracy. Our work demonstrates the feasibility of natural gaze as a Zero-UI interface for human-machine interaction, i.e., users will only need to act naturally, and do not need to interact with the interface itself or deviate from their natural eye movement patterns.

In this work, we propose a hierarchical neural network based planner that analyzes the underlying physical scenarios of the system and learns a system-level behavior planning scheme with multiple scenario-specific motion-planning strategies. We then develop an efficient verification method that incorporates overapproximation of the system state reachable set and novel partition and union techniques for formally ensuring system safety under our physics-aware planner. With theoretical analysis, we show that considering the different physical scenarios and building a hierarchical planner based on such analysis may improve system safety and verifiability.

This concept is very close and analogous to the classic normal mapping on meshes, broadly used in Computer Graphics.

However, studying the RL-based approaches from the adversary's perspective has received little attention. Additionally, RL-based approaches in an anti-adversary or adversarial paradigm mostly consider single-channel communication (either channel selection or single channel power control), while multi-channel communication is more common in practice. In this paper, we propose a multi-agent adversary system (MAAS) for modeling and analyzing adversaries in a wireless communication scenario by careful design of the reward function under realistic communication scenarios. In particular, by modeling the adversaries as learning agents, we show that the proposed MAAS is able to successfully choose the transmitted channel(s) and their respective allocated power(s) without any prior knowledge of the sender strategy. Compared to the single-agent adversary (SAA), multi-agents in MAAS can achieve significant reduction in signal-to-noise ratio (SINR) under the same power constraints and partial observability, while providing improved stability and a more efficient learning process. Moreover, through empirical studies we show that the results in simulation are close to the ones in communication in reality, a conclusion that is pivotal to the validity of performance of agents evaluated in simulations.

    "abstract": "Automated hiring systems are among the fastest-developing of all high-stakes AI systems. Among these are algorithmic personality tests that use insights from psychometric testing, and promise to surface personality traits indicative of future success based on job seekers' resumes or social media profiles. We interrogate the validity of such systems using stability of the outputs they produce, noting that reliability is a necessary, but not a sufficient, condition for validity. Our approach is to (a) develop a methodology for an external audit of stability of predictions made by algorithmic personality tests, and (b) instantiate this methodology in an audit of two systems, Humantic AI and Crystal. Crucially, rather than challenging or affirming the assumptions made in psychometric testing -- that personality is a meaningful and measurable construct, and that personality traits are indicative of future success on the job -- we frame our methodology around testing the underlying assumptions made by the vendors of the algorithmic personality tests themselves. In our audit of Humantic AI and Crystal, we find that both systems show substantial instability with respect to key facets of measurement, and so cannot be considered valid testing instruments. For example, Crystal frequently computes different personality scores if the same resume is given in PDF vs. in raw text format, violating the assumption that the output of an algorithmic personality test is stable across job-irrelevant variations in the input. Among other notable findings is evidence of persistent -- and often incorrect -- data linkage by Humantic AI. ",

The success of this task depends on cross-modal representation learning that projects both videos and sentences into common spaces for semantic similarity computation. In this work, we concentrate on video representation learning, an essential component for text-to-video retrieval. Inspired by the reading strategy of humans, we propose a Reading-strategy Inspired Visual Representation Learning (RIVRL) to represent videos, which consists of two branches: a previewing branch and an intensive-reading branch. The previewing branch is designed to briefly capture the overview information of videos, while the intensive-reading branch is designed to obtain more in-depth information. Moreover, the intensive-reading branch is aware of the video overview captured by the previewing branch. Such holistic information is found to be useful for the intensive-reading branch to extract more fine-grained features. Extensive experiments on three datasets are conducted, where our model RIVRL achieves a new state-of-the-art on TGIF and VATEX.

Most prior works treat partial or full videos as a whole, which neglects the semantic consistencies among partial videos of various progress levels due to their large intra-class variances. In contrast, we partition original partial or full videos to form a series of new partial videos and mine the Action Semantic Consistent Knowledge (ASCK) among these new partial videos evolving in arbitrary progress levels. Moreover, a novel Action Semantic Consistent learning network (ASCNet) under the teacher-student framework is proposed for early action prediction. Specifically, we treat partial videos as nodes and their action semantic consistencies as edges. Then we build a bi-directional fully connected graph for the teacher network and a single-directional fully connected graph for the student network to model ASCK among partial videos. The MSE and MMD losses are incorporated as our distillation loss to further transfer the ASCK from the teacher to the student network. Extensive experiments and ablative studies have been conducted, demonstrating the effectiveness of modeling ASCK for early action prediction.

    "abstract": "As a substantial amount of multivariate time series data is being produced by the complex systems in Smart Manufacturing, improved anomaly detection frameworks are needed to reduce the operational risks and the monitoring burden placed on the system operators. However, building such frameworks is challenging, as a sufficiently large amount of defective training data is often not available and frameworks are required to capture both the temporal and contextual dependencies across different time steps while being robust to noise. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised Attention-based Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (ConvLSTM) Autoencoder with Dynamic Thresholding (ACLAE-DT) framework for anomaly detection and diagnosis in multivariate time series. The framework starts by pre-processing and enriching the data, before constructing feature images to characterize the system statuses across different time steps by capturing the inter-correlations between pairs of time series. Afterwards, the constructed feature images are fed into an attention-based ConvLSTM autoencoder, which aims to encode the constructed feature images and capture the temporal behavior, followed by decoding the compressed knowledge representation to reconstruct the feature images input. The reconstruction errors are then computed and subjected to a statistical-based, dynamic thresholding mechanism to detect and diagnose the anomalies. Evaluation results conducted on real-life manufacturing data demonstrate the performance strengths of the proposed approach over state-of-the-art methods under different experimental settings. ",

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a new approach for privacy-preserving and verifiable convolutional neural network (CNN) testing, enabling a CNN model developer to convince a user of the truthful CNN performance over non-public data from multiple testers, while respecting model privacy. To balance the security and efficiency issues, three new efforts are done by appropriately integrating homomorphic encryption (HE) and zero-knowledge succinct non-interactive argument of knowledge (zk-SNARK) primitives with the CNN testing. First, a CNN model to be tested is strategically partitioned into a private part kept locally by the model developer, and a public part outsourced to an outside server. Then, the private part runs over HE-protected test data sent by a tester and transmits its outputs to the public part for accomplishing subsequent computations of the CNN testing. Second, the correctness of the above CNN testing is enforced by generating zk-SNARK based proofs, with an emphasis on optimizing proving overhead for two-dimensional (2-D) convolution operations, since the operations dominate the performance bottleneck during generating proofs. We specifically present a new quadratic matrix programs (QMPs)-based arithmetic circuit with a single multiplication gate for expressing 2-D convolution operations between multiple filters and inputs in a batch manner. Third, we aggregate multiple proofs with respect to a same CNN model but different testers' test data (i.e., different statements) into one proof, and ensure that the validity of the aggregated proof implies the validity of the original multiple proofs. Lastly, our experimental results demonstrate that our QMPs-based zk-SNARK performs nearly 13.9$\\times$faster than the existing QAPs-based zk-SNARK in proving time, and 17.6$\\times$faster in Setup time, for high-dimension matrix multiplication.

    "abstract": "Graph neural networks (GNNs) process large-scale graphs consisting of a hundred billion edges. In contrast to traditional deep learning, unique behaviors of the emerging GNNs are engaged with a large set of graphs and embedding data on storage, which exhibits complex and irregular preprocessing. We propose a novel deep learning framework on large graphs, HolisticGNN, that provides an easy-to-use, near-storage inference infrastructure for fast, energy-efficient GNN processing. To achieve the best end-to-end latency and high energy efficiency, HolisticGNN allows users to implement various GNN algorithms and directly executes them where the actual data exist in a holistic manner. It also enables RPC over PCIe such that the users can simply program GNNs through a graph semantic library without any knowledge of the underlying hardware or storage configurations. We fabricate HolisticGNN's hardware RTL and implement its software on an FPGA-based computational SSD (CSSD). Our empirical evaluations show that the inference time of HolisticGNN outperforms GNN inference services using high-performance modern GPUs by 7.1x while reducing energy consumption by 33.2x, on average.

The wide deployment of phasor measurement units (PMUs) promotes the development of data-driven approaches for transient stability assessment. This paper proposes the temporal and topological embedding deep neural network (TTEDNN) model to forecast transient stability with the early transient dynamics. The TTEDNN model can accurately and efficiently predict the transient stability by extracting the temporal and topological features from the time-series data of the early transient dynamics. The grid-informed adjacency matrix is used to incorporate the power grid structural and electrical parameter information. The transient dynamics simulation environments under the single-node and multiple-node perturbations are used to test the performance of the TTEDNN model for the IEEE 39-bus and IEEE 118-bus power systems. The results show that the TTEDNN model has the best and most robust prediction performance. Furthermore, the TTEDNN model also demonstrates the transfer capability to predict the transient stability in the more complicated transient dynamics simulation environments. ",

To train a neural implicit function, we propose a loss function that allows terms with high-order derivatives, such as the alignment between the principal directions, to learn more geometric details. During training, we consider a non-uniform sampling strategy based on the discrete curvatures of the triangle mesh to access points with more geometric details. This sampling implies faster learning while preserving geometric accuracy. We present the analytical differential geometry formulas for neural surfaces, such as normal vectors and curvatures. We use them to render the surfaces using sphere tracing. Additionally, we propose a network optimization based on singular value decomposition to reduce the number of parameters. ",

    "abstract": "We focus on Maximum Inner Product Search (MIPS), which is an essential problem in many machine learning communities. Given a query, MIPS finds the most similar items with the maximum inner products. Methods for Nearest Neighbor Search (NNS) which is usually defined on metric space don't exhibit the satisfactory performance for MIPS problem since inner product is a non-metric function. However, inner products exhibit many good properties compared with metric functions, such as avoiding vanishing and exploding gradients. As a result, inner product is widely used in many recommendation systems, which makes efficient Maximum Inner Product Search a key for speeding up many recommendation systems. Graph based methods for NNS problem show the superiorities compared with other class methods. Each data point of the database is mapped to a node of the proximity graph. Nearest neighbor search in the database can be converted to route on the proximity graph to find the nearest neighbor for the query. This technique can be used to solve MIPS problem. Instead of searching the nearest neighbor for the query, we search the item with maximum inner product with query on the proximity graph. In this paper, we propose a reinforcement model to train an agent to search on the proximity graph automatically for MIPS problem if we lack the ground truths of training queries. If we know the ground truths of some training queries, our model can also utilize these ground truths by imitation learning to improve the agent's search ability. By experiments, we can see that our proposed mode which combines reinforcement learning with imitation learning shows the superiorities over the state-of-the-art methods ",

    "abstract": "Reconstruction of CT images from a limited set of projections through an object is important in several applications ranging from medical imaging to industrial settings. As the number of available projections decreases, traditional reconstruction techniques such as the FDK algorithm and model-based iterative reconstruction methods perform poorly. Recently, data-driven methods such as deep learning-based reconstruction have garnered a lot of attention in applications because they yield better performance when enough training data is available. However, even these methods have their limitations when there is a scarcity of available training data. This work focuses on image reconstruction in such settings, i.e., when both the number of available CT projections and the training data is extremely limited. We adopt a sequential reconstruction approach over several stages using an adversarially trained shallow network for 'destreaking' followed by a data-consistency update in each stage. To deal with the challenge of limited data, we use image subvolumes to train our method, and patch aggregation during testing. To deal with the computational challenge of learning on 3D datasets for 3D reconstruction, we use a hybrid 3D-to-2D mapping network for the 'destreaking' part. Comparisons to other methods over several test examples indicate that the proposed method has much potential, when both the number of projections and available training data are highly limited. ",

Extraction of synthesis information from scientific publications is still challenging, especially for extracting synthesis actions, because of the lack of a comprehensive labeled dataset using a solid, robust, and well-established ontology for describing synthesis procedures. In this work, we propose the first Unified Language of Synthesis Actions (ULSA) for describing ceramics synthesis procedures. We created a dataset of 3,040 synthesis procedures annotated by domain experts according to the proposed ULSA scheme. To demonstrate the capabilities of ULSA, we built a neural network-based model to map arbitrary ceramics synthesis paragraphs into ULSA and used it to construct synthesis flowcharts for synthesis procedures. Analysis for the flowcharts showed that (a) ULSA covers essential vocabulary used by researchers when describing synthesis procedures and (b) it can capture important features of synthesis protocols. This work is an important step towards creating a synthesis ontology and a solid foundation for autonomous robotic synthesis. ",

To understand this inadequacy, there is need to investigate if spectral analysis of transformer will reveal insights on its expressive power. Similar studies already established that spectral analysis of Graph neural networks (GNNs) provides extra perspectives on their expressiveness. In this work, we systematically study and prove the link between the spatial and spectral domain in the realm of the transformer. We further provide a theoretical analysis that the spatial attention mechanism in the transformer cannot effectively capture the desired frequency response, thus, inherently limiting its expressiveness in spectral space. Therefore, we propose FeTA, a framework that aims to perform attention over the entire graph spectrum analogous to the attention in spatial space. Empirical results suggest that FeTA provides homogeneous performance gain against vanilla transformer across all tasks on standard benchmarks and can easily be extended to GNN based models with low-pass characteristics (e.g., GAT). Furthermore, replacing the vanilla transformer model with FeTA in recently proposed position encoding schemes has resulted in comparable or better performance than transformer and GNN baselines. ",

The agents are \\textit{heterogeneous}: each agent has limited access to a local subset of arms and the agents are asynchronous with different gaps between decision-making rounds. The goal for each agent is to find its optimal local arm, and agents can cooperate by sharing their observations with others. While cooperation between agents improves the performance of learning, it comes with an additional complexity of communication between agents. For this heterogeneous multi-agent setting, we propose two learning algorithms, \\ucbo and \\AAE. We prove that both algorithms achieve order-optimal regret, which is $O\\left(\\sum_{i:\\tilde{\\Delta}_i>0} \\log T/\\tilde{\\Delta}_i\\right)$, where $\\tilde{\\Delta}_i$ is the minimum suboptimality gap between the reward mean of arm $i$ and any local optimal arm.

In this paper, we provide a novel dynamical-system view of FCMs and propose a new framework for identifying causal direction in the bivariate case. We first show the connection between FCMs and optimal transport, and then study optimal transport under the constraints of FCMs. Furthermore, by exploiting the dynamical interpretation of optimal transport under the FCM constraints, we determine the corresponding underlying dynamical process of the static cause-effect pair data under the least action principle. It provides a new dimension for describing static causal discovery tasks, while enjoying more freedom for modeling the quantitative causal influences. In particular, we show that Additive Noise Models (ANMs) correspond to volume-preserving pressureless flows. Consequently, based on their velocity field divergence, we introduce a criterion to determine causal direction. With this criterion, we propose a novel optimal transport-based algorithm for ANMs which is robust to the choice of models and extend it to post-noninear models.

The debate around their value and connotations, led by humanist scholars, is today more relevant than ever, seeing how common these representations are as support for historical analysis. Force-directed networks, in particular, are popular as they can be developed relatively quickly, and reveal patterns and structures in data. The underlying algorithms, although powerful in revealing hidden patterns, do not retain meaningful structure and existing hierarchies within historical social networks. In this article, we question the foreign aspect of this structure that force-directed layout create in historical datasets. We explore the importance of hierarchy in social networks, and investigate whether hierarchies -- strongly present within our models of social structure -- affect our perception of social network data. Results from our user evaluation indicate that hierarchical network representations reduce cognitive load and leads to more frequent and deeper insights into historical social networks. We also find that users report a preference for the hierarchical graph representation. We analyse these findings in light of the broader discussion on the value of force-directed network representations within humanistic research, and introduce open questions for future work in this line of research.

    "abstract": "We developed an integrated recurrent neural network and nonlinear regression spatio-temporal model for vector-borne disease evolution. We take into account climate data and seasonality as external factors that correlate with disease transmitting insects (e.g. flies), also spill-over infections from neighboring regions surrounding a region of interest. The climate data is encoded to the model through a quadratic embedding scheme motivated by recommendation systems. The neighboring regions' influence is modeled by a long short-term memory neural network. The integrated model is trained by stochastic gradient descent and tested on leish-maniasis data in Sri Lanka from 2013-2018 where infection outbreaks occurred. Our model outperformed ARIMA models across a number of regions with high infections, and an associated ablation study renders support to our modeling hypothesis and ideas. ",

    "title": "Dynamic Label Assignment for Object Detection by Combining Predicted and  Anchor IoUs",
    "abstract": "Label assignment plays a significant role in modern object detection models. Detection models may yield totally different performances with different label assignment strategies. For anchor-based detection models, the IoU threshold between the anchors and their corresponding ground truth bounding boxes is the key element since the positive samples and negative samples are divided by the IoU threshold. Early object detectors simply utilize a fixed threshold for all training samples, while recent detection algorithms focus on adaptive thresholds based on the distribution of the IoUs to the ground truth boxes. In this paper, we introduce a simple and effective approach to perform label assignment dynamically based on the training status with predictions. By introducing the predictions in label assignment, more high-quality samples with higher IoUs to the ground truth objects are selected as the positive samples, which could reduce the discrepancy between the classification scores and the IoU scores, and generate more high-quality boundary boxes. Our approach shows improvements in the performance of the detection models with the adaptive label assignment algorithm and lower bounding box losses for those positive samples, indicating more samples with higher quality predicted boxes are selected as positives.

    "abstract": "Many real-world networks are inherently decentralized. For example, in social networks, each user maintains a local view of a social graph, such as a list of friends and her profile. It is typical to collect these local views of social graphs and conduct graph learning tasks. However, learning over graphs can raise privacy concerns as these local views often contain sensitive information. In this paper, we seek to ensure private graph learning on a decentralized network graph. Towards this objective, we propose {\\em Solitude}, a new privacy-preserving learning framework based on graph neural networks (GNNs), with formal privacy guarantees based on edge local differential privacy. The crux of {\\em Solitude} is a set of new delicate mechanisms that can calibrate the introduced noise in the decentralized graph collected from the users. The principle behind the calibration is the intrinsic properties shared by many real-world graphs, such as sparsity. Unlike existing work on locally private GNNs, our new framework can simultaneously protect node feature privacy and edge privacy, and can seamlessly incorporate with any GNN with privacy-utility guarantees. Extensive experiments on benchmarking datasets show that {\\em Solitude} can retain the generalization capability of the learned GNN while preserving the users' data privacy under given privacy budgets.

    "abstract": "Recent works on Multimodal 3D Computer-aided diagnosis have demonstrated that obtaining a competitive automatic diagnosis model when a 3D convolution neural network (CNN) brings more parameters and medical images are scarce remains nontrivial and challenging. Considering both consistencies of regions of interest in multimodal images and diagnostic accuracy, we propose a novel mutual attention-based hybrid dimensional network for MultiModal 3D medical image classification (MMNet). The hybrid dimensional network integrates 2D CNN with 3D convolution modules to generate deeper and more informative feature maps, and reduce the training complexity of 3D fusion. Besides, the pre-trained model of ImageNet can be used in 2D CNN, which improves the performance of the model. The stereoscopic attention is focused on building rich contextual interdependencies of the region in 3D medical images. To improve the regional correlation of pathological tissues in multimodal medical images, we further design a mutual attention framework in the network to build the region-wise consistency in similar stereoscopic regions of different image modalities, providing an implicit manner to instruct the network to focus on pathological tissues. MMNet outperforms many previous solutions and achieves results competitive to the state-of-the-art on three multimodal imaging datasets, i.e., Parotid Gland Tumor (PGT) dataset, the MRNet dataset, and the PROSTATEx dataset, and its advantages are validated by extensive experiments.

    "abstract": "According to the World Health Organization (WHO), one in four people will be affected by mental disorders at some point in their lives. However, in many parts of the world, patients do not actively seek professional diagnosis because of stigma attached to mental illness, ignorance of mental health and its associated symptoms. In this paper, we propose a model for passively detecting mental disorders using conversations on Reddit. Specifically, we focus on a subset of mental disorders that are characterized by distinct emotional patterns (henceforth called emotional disorders): major depressive, anxiety, and bipolar disorders. Through passive (i.e., unprompted) detection, we can encourage patients to seek diagnosis and treatment for mental disorders. Our proposed model is different from other work in this area in that our model is based entirely on the emotional states, and the transition between these states of users on Reddit, whereas prior work is typically based on content-based representations (e.g., n-grams, language model embeddings, etc). We show that content-based representation is affected by domain and topic bias and thus does not generalize, while our model, on the other hand, suppresses topic-specific information and thus generalizes well across different topics and times. We conduct experiments on our model's ability to detect different emotional disorders and on the generalizability of our model. Our experiments show that while our model performs comparably to content-based models, such as BERT, it generalizes much better across time and topic. ",

    "abstract": "The proliferation of wireless devices and their ever increasing influence on our day-to-day life is very evident and seems irreplaceable. This exponential growth in demand, both in terms of the number of devices and Quality of Service (QoS) had spawned the concept of cross-layer optimization several years ago. The primary goal of the cross-layer approach was to liberate the strict boundary between the layers of the traditional Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) protocol stack. The initial decade focused on establishing the theoretical feasibility of this revolutionary concept and gauging the effectiveness and limits of this idea. During the next phase, the advent of software defined radios (SDR) accelerated the growth of this domain due to its added flexibility. Yet, there has been a gaping abyss between solutions designed in theory and ones deployed in practice. To establish this, we first present an elaborate survey of the cross-layer protocol stack literature. Next, we briefly discuss how a commercial off-the-shelf (COTS), low SWaP (Size, Weight, and Power) embedded SDR (e-SDR) was transformed into a standalone, fieldable transceiver. Thereafter, we provide the software design ethos that focuses on efficiency and flexibility such that the optimization objectives and cross-layer interactions can be reconfigured rapidly. To demonstrate our claims, we provide results from extensive outdoor over-the-air experiments in various settings with up to 10-node network topologies. The results from the field trials demonstrate high reliability, throughput, and dynamic routing capability. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time in literature, a COTS e-SDR has been leveraged to successfully design a cross-layer optimized transceiver that is capable of forming an ad hoc network that provides high throughput and high reliability in a ruggedized, weatherized, and fieldable form factor.

    "abstract": "The cybersecurity breaches expose surveillance video streams to forgery attacks, under which authentic streams are falsified to hide unauthorized activities. Traditional video forensics approaches can localize forgery traces using spatial-temporal analysis on relatively long video clips, while falling short in real-time forgery detection. The recent work correlates time-series camera and wireless signals to detect looped videos but cannot realize fine-grained forgery localization. To overcome these limitations, we propose Secure-Pose, which exploits the pervasive coexistence of surveillance and Wi-Fi infrastructures to defend against video forgery attacks in a real-time and fine-grained manner. We observe that coexisting camera and Wi-Fi signals convey common human semantic information and forgery attacks on video streams will decouple such information correspondence. Particularly, retrievable human pose features are first extracted from concurrent video and Wi-Fi channel state information (CSI) streams. Then, a lightweight detection network is developed to accurately discover forgery attacks and an efficient localization algorithm is devised to seamlessly track forgery traces in video streams. We implement Secure-Pose using one Logitech camera and two Intel 5300 NICs and evaluate it in different environments. Secure-Pose achieves a high detection accuracy of 98.7% and localizes abnormal objects under playback and tampering attacks. ",

We aim to improve the achievable average rate via the joint robust design of UAV trajectory, IRS passive beamforming and GN's power allocation. However, the formulated optimization problem is challenging to solve due to its non-convexity and coupled variables. To overcome the difficulty, we propose an alternating optimization (AO) based algorithm to solve it sub-optimally by leveraging semidefinite relaxation (SDR), successive convex approximation (SCA), and S-procedure methods. Simulation results show that by deploying the IRS near the GN, our proposed algorithm always improves the uplink achievable average rate significantly compared with the benchmark algorithms, while deploying the IRS nearby the jammer is effective only when the jammer's location is perfectly known.

A deep neural network is trained in parallel on multiple tasks, where each task is trained only on a subset of the network resources. Each subset consists of network segments, that can be combined and shared across specific tasks. Tasks can share resources with other tasks, while having independent task-related network resources. Therefore, the trained network can share similar representations across various tasks, while also enabling independent task-related representations. The above allows for some crucial outcomes. (1) The parallel nature of our approach negates the issue of catastrophic forgetting. (2) The sharing of segments uses network resources more efficiently. (3) We show that the network does indeed use learned knowledge from some tasks in other tasks, through shared representations. (4) Through examination of individual task-related and shared representations, the model offers transparency in the network and in the relationships across tasks in a multi-task setting. Evaluation of the proposed approach against complex competing approaches such as Continual Learning, Neural Architecture Search, and Multi-task learning shows that it is capable of learning robust representations.

Then, we propose (2) a new Adaptive Genetic Algorithm for Community Detection, along with (3) a new initial population generation function, and (4) a new adaptive mutation function called sine-based mutation function. Using the proposed method, we combine similarity-based and modularity-optimization-based approaches to find the communities of complex networks in an evolutionary framework. Besides the fact that the proposed representation scheme can avoid meaningless mutations or disconnected communities, we show that the new initial population generation function, and the new adaptive mutation function, can improve the convergence time of the algorithm.

In this paper, we propose BAERASE, a novel method that can erase the backdoor injected into the victim model through machine unlearning. Specifically, BAERASE mainly implements backdoor defense in two key steps. First, trigger pattern recovery is conducted to extract the trigger patterns infected by the victim model. Here, the trigger pattern recovery problem is equivalent to the one of extracting an unknown noise distribution from the victim model, which can be easily resolved by the entropy maximization based generative model. Subsequently, BAERASE leverages these recovered trigger patterns to reverse the backdoor injection procedure and induce the victim model to erase the polluted memories through a newly designed gradient ascent based machine unlearning method. Compared with the previous machine unlearning solutions, the proposed approach gets rid of the reliance on the full access to training data for retraining and shows higher effectiveness on backdoor erasing than existing fine-tuning or pruning methods. Moreover, experiments show that BAERASE can averagely lower the attack success rates of three kinds of state-of-the-art backdoor attacks by 99\\% on four benchmark datasets. ",

    "abstract": "Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death worldwide and a good prognosis depends on early diagnosis. Unfortunately, screening programs for the early diagnosis of lung cancer are uncommon. This is in-part due to the at-risk groups being located in rural areas far from medical facilities. Reaching these populations would require a scaled approach that combines mobility, low cost, speed, accuracy, and privacy. We can resolve these issues by combining the chest X-ray imaging mode with a federated deep-learning approach, provided that the federated model is trained on homogenous data to ensure that no single data source can adversely bias the model at any point in time. In this study we show that an image pre-processing pipeline that homogenizes and debiases chest X-ray images can improve both internal classification and external generalization, paving the way for a low-cost and accessible deep learning-based clinical system for lung cancer screening. An evolutionary pruning mechanism is used to train a nodule detection deep learning model on the most informative images from a publicly available lung nodule X-ray dataset. Histogram equalization is used to remove systematic differences in image brightness and contrast. Model training is performed using all combinations of lung field segmentation, close cropping, and rib suppression operators. We show that this pre-processing pipeline results in deep learning models that successfully generalize an independent lung nodule dataset using ablation studies to assess the contribution of each operator in this pipeline. In stripping chest X-ray images of known confounding variables by lung field segmentation, along with suppression of signal noise from the bone structure we can train a highly accurate deep learning lung nodule detection algorithm with outstanding generalization accuracy of 89% to nodule samples in unseen data.

We start with a detailed description of our attack against our own design, to highlight which information is needed to increase the success of an attack, i.e. we use it as a blueprint to the following attack against commercially available crypto chips. We would like to stress that our attack against our own design is very similar to what happens during certification e.g. according to Common Criteria Standard as in those cases the manufacturer needs to provide detailed information. When attacking the commercial designs without signing NDAs, we needed to intensively search the Internet for information about the designs. We cannot to reveal the private keys used by the attacked commercial authentication chips 100% correctly. Moreover, the missing knowledge of the used keys does not allow us to evaluate the success of our attack. We were able to reveal information on the processing sequence during the authentication process even as detailed as identifying the clock cycles in which the individual key bits are processed. To summarize the effort of such an attack is significantly higher than the one of attacking a well-known implementation. ",

In spite of its extensive use in many fields, such as ADMET prediction, virtual screening, protein folding and generative chemistry, little has been explored in terms of the out-of-distribution (OOD) learning problem with \\emph{noise}, which is inevitable in real world AIDD applications. In this work, we present DrugOOD, a systematic OOD dataset curator and benchmark for AI-aided drug discovery, which comes with an open-source Python package that fully automates the data curation and OOD benchmarking processes. We focus on one of the most crucial problems in AIDD: drug target binding affinity prediction, which involves both macromolecule (protein target) and small-molecule (drug compound). In contrast to only providing fixed datasets, DrugOOD offers automated dataset curator with user-friendly customization scripts, rich domain annotations aligned with biochemistry knowledge, realistic noise annotations and rigorous benchmarking of state-of-the-art OOD algorithms. Since the molecular data is often modeled as irregular graphs using graph neural network (GNN) backbones, DrugOOD also serves as a valuable testbed for \\emph{graph OOD learning} problems. Extensive empirical studies have shown a significant performance gap between in-distribution and out-of-distribution experiments, which highlights the need to develop better schemes that can allow for OOD generalization under noise for AIDD.

    "abstract": "Adversarial examples (AEs) pose severe threats to the applications of deep neural networks (DNNs) to safety-critical domains, e.g., autonomous driving. While there has been a vast body of AE defense solutions, to the best of our knowledge, they all suffer from some weaknesses, e.g., defending against only a subset of AEs or causing a relatively high accuracy loss for legitimate inputs. Moreover, most existing solutions cannot defend against adaptive attacks, wherein attackers are knowledgeable about the defense mechanisms and craft AEs accordingly. In this paper, we propose a novel AE detection framework based on the very nature of AEs, i.e., their semantic information is inconsistent with the discriminative features extracted by the target DNN model. To be specific, the proposed solution, namely ContraNet, models such contradiction by first taking both the input and the inference result to a generator to obtain a synthetic output and then comparing it against the original input. For legitimate inputs that are correctly inferred, the synthetic output tries to reconstruct the input. On the contrary, for AEs, instead of reconstructing the input, the synthetic output would be created to conform to the wrong label whenever possible. Consequently, by measuring the distance between the input and the synthetic output with metric learning, we can differentiate AEs from legitimate inputs. We perform comprehensive evaluations under various AE attack scenarios, and experimental results show that ContraNet outperforms existing solutions by a large margin, especially under adaptive attacks. Moreover, our analysis shows that successful AEs that can bypass ContraNet tend to have much-weakened adversarial semantics. We have also shown that ContraNet can be easily combined with adversarial training techniques to achieve further improved AE defense capabilities. ",

In cell phone camera systems, various errors, such as interferences at the lens-barrel and lens-lens interfaces and axial, radial, and tilt misalignments, accumulate and alter profile of the lenses in a stochastic manner which ultimately changes optical focusing properties. Nonlinear finite element analysis of the stochastic mechanical behavior of lenses due to the interference fits is used on high-performance computing (HPC) to generate sufficient training and testing data for subsequent deep learning. Once properly trained and validated, the surrogate neural network model enabled accurate and almost instant evaluations of millions of function evaluations providing the final lens profiles. This computational model, enhanced by artificial intelligence, enabled us to efficiently perform Monte-Carlo analysis for sensitivity and uncertainty quantification of the final lens profile to various interferences. It can be further coupled with an optical analysis to perform ray tracing and analyze the focal properties of the lens module. Moreover, it can provide a valuable tool for optimizing tolerance design and intelligent components matching for many similar press-fit assembly processes. ",

    "abstract": "Many fabless semiconductor companies outsource their designs to third-party fabrication houses. As trustworthiness of chain after outsourcing including fabrication houses is not established, any adversary in between, with malicious intent may tamper the design by inserting Hardware Trojans (HTs). Detection of such HTs is of utmost importance to assure the trust and integrity of the chips. However, the efficiency of detection techniques based on side-channel analysis is largely affected by process variations. In this paper, a methodology for detecting HTs by analyzing the delays of topologically symmetric paths is proposed. The proposed technique, rather than depending on golden ICs as a reference for HT detection, employs the concept of self-referencing. In this work, the fact that delays of topologically symmetric paths in an IC will be affected similarly by process variations is exploited. A procedure to chose topologically symmetric paths that are minimally affected by process variations is presented. Further, a technique is proposed to create topologically symmetric paths by inserting extra logic gates if such paths do not exist in the design intrinsically. Simulations performed on ISCAS-85 benchmarks establish that the proposed method is able to achieve a true positive rate of 100% with a false positive rate less than 3%. In our experimentation, We have considered the maximum of 15% intra-die and 20% inter-die variations in threshold voltage (Vth). ",

One common approach to speed up training is model parallelization, where large neural networks are split across multiple devices.

This work studies the impact of graph traversal order on device placement. In particular, we empirically study how different graph traversal order leads to different device placement, which in turn affects the training execution time. Our experiment results show that the best graph traversal order depends on the type of neural networks and their computation graphs features. In this work, we also provide recommendations on choosing graph traversal order in device placement for various neural network families to improve the training time in model parallelization. ",

    "abstract": "Intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRSs) have emerged as a promising economical solution to implement cell-free networks. However, the performance gains achieved by IRSs critically depend on smartly tuned passive beamforming based on the assumption that the accurate channel state information (CSI) knowledge is available at the central processing unit (CPU), which is practically impossible. Thus, in this paper, we investigate the impact of the CSI uncertainty on IRS-assisted cell-free networks. We adopt a stochastic method to cope with the CSI uncertainty by maximizing the expectation of the sum-rate, which guarantees the robust performance over the average. Accordingly, an average sum-rate maximization problem is formulated, which is non-convex and arduous to obtain its optimal solution due to the coupled variables and the expectation operation with respect to CSI uncertainties. As a compromising approach, we develop an efficient robust joint design algorithm with low-complexity. Particularly, the original problem is equivalently transformed into a tractable form by employing algebraic manipulations. Then, the locally optimal solution can be obtained iteratively. We further prove that the CSI uncertainty has no direct impact on the optimizing of the passive reflecting beamforming. It is worth noting that the investigated scenario is flexible and general in communications, thus the proposed algorithm can act as a general framework to solve various sum-rate maximization problems. Simulation results demonstrate that IRSs can achieve considerable data rate improvement for conventional cell-free networks, and confirm the resilience of the proposed algorithm against the CSI uncertainty.

Fully mining the correlation and causation between the variables in a multivariate time series exhibits noticeable results in improving the performance of a time series model. Recently, some models have explored the dependencies between variables through end-to-end graph structure learning without the need for pre-defined graphs. However, most current models do not incorporate the trade-off between effectiveness and flexibility and lack the guidance of domain knowledge in the design of graph learning algorithms. Besides, they have issues generating sparse graph structures, which pose challenges to end-to-end learning. In this paper, we propose Learning Sparse and Continuous Graphs for Forecasting (LSCGF), a novel deep learning model that joins graph learning and forecasting. Technically, LSCGF leverages the spatial information into convolutional operation and extracts temporal dynamics using the diffusion convolution recurrent network. At the same time, we propose a brand new method named Smooth Sparse Unit (SSU) to learn sparse and continuous graph adjacency matrix. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performances with minor trainable parameters. ",

KG creation is laborious, and demands data management techniques to be executed efficiently. This paper tackles the problem of the automatic generation of KG creation processes declaratively specified; it proposes techniques for planning and transforming heterogeneous data into RDF triples following mapping assertions specified in the RDF Mapping Language (RML). Given a set of mapping assertions, the planner provides an optimized execution plan by partitioning and scheduling the execution of the assertions. First, the planner assesses an optimized number of partitions considering the number of data sources, type of mapping assertions, and the associations between different assertions. After providing a list of partitions and assertions that belong to each partition, the planner determines their execution order. A greedy algorithm is implemented to generate the partitions' bushy tree execution plan. Bushy tree plans are translated into operating system commands that guide the execution of the partitions of the mapping assertions in the order indicated by the bushy tree. The proposed optimization approach is evaluated over state-of-the-art RML-compliant engines and existing benchmarks of data sources and RML triples maps. Our experimental results suggest that the performance of the studied engines can be considerably improved, particularly in a complex setting with numerous triples maps and data sources. As a result, engines that usually time in complex cases out can, if not entirely execute all the assertions, still produce a portion of the KG. ",

To solve these two issues, we propose a new graph neural network called GND-Nets (for Graph Neural Diffusion Networks) that exploits the local and global neighborhood information of a vertex in a single layer. Exploiting the shallow network mitigates the over-smoothing problem while exploiting the local and global neighborhood information mitigates the under-smoothing problem. The utilization of the local and global neighborhood information of a vertex is achieved by a new graph diffusion method called neural diffusions, which integrate neural networks into the conventional linear and nonlinear graph diffusions. The adoption of neural networks makes neural diffusions adaptable to different datasets.

    "abstract": "Learning-based pre-simulation (i.e., layout-to-fabrication) models have been proposed to predict the fabrication-induced shape deformation from an IC layout to its fabricated circuit. Such models are usually driven by pairwise learning, involving a training set of layout patterns and their reference shape images after fabrication. However, it is expensive and time-consuming to collect the reference shape images of all layout clips for model training and updating. To address the problem, we propose a deep learning-based layout novelty detection scheme to identify novel (unseen) layout patterns, which cannot be well predicted by a pre-trained pre-simulation model. We devise a global-local novelty scoring mechanism to assess the potential novelty of a layout by exploiting two subnetworks: an autoencoder and a pretrained pre-simulation model. The former characterizes the global structural dissimilarity between a given layout and training samples, whereas the latter extracts a latent code representing the fabrication-induced local deformation. By integrating the global dissimilarity with the local deformation boosted by a self-attention mechanism, our model can accurately detect novelties without the ground-truth circuit shapes of test samples. Based on the detected novelties, we further propose two active-learning strategies to sample a reduced amount of representative layouts most worthy to be fabricated for acquiring their ground-truth circuit shapes. Experimental results demonstrate i) our method's effectiveness in layout novelty detection, and ii) our active-learning strategies' ability in selecting representative novel layouts for keeping a learning-based pre-simulation model updated.

The present research work is based on the prediction of penetration depth using Supervised Machine Learning algorithms such as Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest Algorithm, and Robust Regression algorithm. A Friction Stir Spot Welding (FSSW) was used to join two elements of AA1230 aluminum alloys. The dataset consists of three input parameters: Rotational Speed (rpm), Dwelling Time (seconds), and Axial Load (KN), on which the machine learning models were trained and tested. It observed that the Robust Regression machine learning algorithm outperformed the rest of the algorithms by resulting in the coefficient of determination of 0.96. The research work also highlights the application of image processing techniques to find the geometrical features of the weld formation. ",

We examine, experiment and evaluate existing methods and conjecture that neither current sequential models nor traditional machine learning models are satisfactorily sufficient to analyze Raman spectra.

RamanNet is immune to invariance property in CNN and at the same time better than traditional machine learning models for the inclusion of sparse connectivity.

In our setting, the adversary aims to modify the differentially private information of a statistical dataset by inserting additional data without being detected by using the differential privacy to her/his own benefit. To this end, firstly via hypothesis testing, we characterize a statistical threshold for the adversary, which balances the privacy budget and the induced bias (the impact of the attack) in order to remain undetected. In addition, we establish the privacy-distortion tradeoff in the sense of the well-known rate-distortion function for the Gaussian mechanism by using an information-theoretic approach and present an upper bound on the variance of the attacker's additional data as a function of the sensitivity and the original data's second-order statistics. Lastly, we introduce a new privacy metric based on Chernoff information for classifying adversaries under differential privacy as a stronger alternative for the Gaussian mechanism.

    "abstract": "Wearable and unobtrusive monitoring and prediction of epileptic seizures has the potential to significantly increase the life quality of patients, but is still an unreached goal due to challenges of real-time detection and wearable devices design. Hyperdimensional (HD) computing has evolved in recent years as a new promising machine learning approach, especially when talking about wearable applications. But in the case of epilepsy detection, standard HD computing is not performing at the level of other state-of-the-art algorithms. This could be due to the inherent complexity of the seizures and their signatures in different biosignals, such as the electroencephalogram (EEG), the highly personalized nature, and the disbalance of seizure and non-seizure instances. In the literature, different strategies for improved learning of HD computing have been proposed, such as iterative (multi-pass) learning, multi-centroid learning and learning with sample weight (\"OnlineHD\"). Yet, most of them have not been tested on the challenging task of epileptic seizure detection, and it stays unclear whether they can increase the HD computing performance to the level of the current state-of-the-art algorithms, such as random forests. Thus, in this paper, we implement different learning strategies and assess their performance on an individual basis, or in combination, regarding detection performance and memory and computational requirements. Results show that the best-performing algorithm, which is a combination of multi-centroid and multi-pass, can indeed reach the performance of the random forest model on a highly unbalanced dataset imitating a real-life epileptic seizure detection application.

We come in defence of VA systems by contributing two interview studies with VA researchers to gather critics and replies to those critics. First, we interview 24 researchers about criticisms for VA systems they have received from peers. Through an iterative coding and refinement process, we summarize the interview data into a list of 36 common criticisms. Second, we interview 17 researchers to validate our list and collect replies to those criticisms. We conclude by discussing eight important problems and future research opportunities to advance the theoretical and practical underpinnings of VA systems. We highlight that the presented knowledge is deep, extensive, but also imperfect, provocative, and controversial, and thus recommend reading with an inclusive and critical eye.

Since facial attributes have various data structure and carry different information, existing approaches fail to specifically consider the optimal way to extract depression-related features from each of them, as well as investigates the best fusion strategy. In this paper, we propose to extend Neural Architecture Search (NAS) technique for designing an optimal model for multiple facial attributes-based depression recognition, which can be efficiently and robustly implemented in a small dataset. Our approach first conducts a warmer up step to the feature extractor of each facial attribute, aiming to largely reduce the search space and providing customized architecture, where each feature extractor can be either a Convolution Neural Networks (CNN) or Graph Neural Networks (GNN). Then, we conduct an end-to-end architecture search for all feature extractors and the fusion network, allowing the complementary depression cues to be optimally combined with less redundancy. The experimental results on AVEC 2016 dataset show that the model explored by our approach achieves breakthrough performance with 27\\% and 30\\% RMSE and MAE improvements over the existing state-of-the-art. In light of these findings, this paper provides solid evidences and a strong baseline for applying NAS to time-series data-based mental health analysis. ",

However, this is not always the case for graph generative models (GGMs), making their evaluation challenging. Currently, the standard process for evaluating GGMs suffers from three critical limitations: i) it does not produce a single score which makes model selection challenging, ii) in many cases it fails to consider underlying edge and node features, and iii) it is prohibitively slow to perform. In this work, we mitigate these issues by searching for scalar, domain-agnostic, and scalable metrics for evaluating and ranking GGMs. To this end, we study existing GGM metrics and neural-network-based metrics emerging from generative models of images that use embeddings extracted from a task-specific network. Motivated by the power of certain Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to extract meaningful graph representations without any training, we introduce several metrics based on the features extracted by an untrained random GNN. We design experiments to thoroughly test metrics on their ability to measure the diversity and fidelity of generated graphs, as well as their sample and computational efficiency. Depending on the quantity of samples, we recommend one of two random-GNN-based metrics that we show to be more expressive than pre-existing metrics. While we focus on applying these metrics to GGM evaluation, in practice this enables the ability to easily compute the dissimilarity between any two sets of graphs regardless of domain.

We observe that wav2vec2.0 pre-trained on noisy data can obtain good representations and thus improve the ASR performance on the noisy test set, which however brings a performance degradation on the clean test set. To avoid this issue, in this work we propose an enhanced wav2vec2.0 model. Specifically, the noisy speech and the corresponding clean version are fed into the same feature encoder, where the clean speech provides training targets for the model. Experimental results reveal that the proposed method can not only improve the ASR performance on the noisy test set which surpasses the original wav2vec2.0, but also ensure a tiny performance decrease on the clean test set.

This gave rise to graph neural network (GNN) models that can be applied to graph-structured datasets arising, for example, in social networks, biochemistry, and material science. Graph convolutional networks (GCNs) in particular, inspired by their Euclidean counterparts, have been successful in processing graph data by extracting structure-aware features. However, current GNN models (and GCNs in particular) are known to be constrained by various phenomena that limit their expressive power and ability to generalize to more complex graph datasets. Most models essentially rely on low-pass filtering of graph signals via local averaging operations, thus leading to oversmoothing. Here, we propose a hybrid GNN framework that combines traditional GCN filters with band-pass filters defined via the geometric scattering transform. We further introduce an attention framework that allows the model to locally attend over the combined information from different GNN filters at the node level. Our theoretical results establish the complementary benefits of the scattering filters to leverage structural information from the graph, while our experiments show the benefits of our method on various learning tasks.

Therefore, equivariant properties can be achieved by aggregating the features from different positions. On the other hand, an adaptive fusion convolution (AFC) module is designed for the proposed Ms-CapsNet. Higher semantic features can be captured for the primary capsules. Feature extracted by the AFC module significantly improves the robustness to speckle noise. The effectiveness of the proposed Ms-CapsNet is verified on three real SAR datasets. The comparison experiments with four state-of-the-art methods demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method. Our codes are available at https://github.com/summitgao/SAR_CD_MS_CapsNet . ",

Numerous definitions of adversarial risk -- not all mathematically rigorous and differing subtly in the details -- have appeared in the literature. In this paper, we revisit these definitions, make them rigorous, and critically examine their similarities and differences. Our technical tools derive from optimal transport, robust statistics, functional analysis, and game theory. Our contributions include the following: generalizing Strassen's theorem to the unbalanced optimal transport setting with applications to adversarial classification with unequal priors; showing an equivalence between adversarial robustness and robust hypothesis testing with $\\infty$-Wasserstein uncertainty sets; proving the existence of a pure Nash equilibrium in the two-player game between the adversary and the algorithm; and characterizing adversarial risk by the minimum Bayes error between a pair of distributions belonging to the $\\infty$-Wasserstein uncertainty sets. Our results generalize and deepen recently discovered connections between optimal transport and adversarial robustness and reveal new connections to Choquet capacities and game theory. ",

    "abstract": "Reinforcement learning (RL) techniques have shown great success in quantitative investment tasks, such as portfolio management and algorithmic trading. Especially, intraday trading is one of the most profitable and risky tasks because of the intraday behaviors of the financial market that reflect billions of rapidly fluctuating values. However, it is hard to apply existing RL methods to intraday trading due to the following three limitations: 1) overlooking micro-level market information (e.g., limit order book); 2) only focusing on local price fluctuation and failing to capture the overall trend of the whole trading day; 3) neglecting the impact of market risk. To tackle these limitations, we propose DeepScalper, a deep reinforcement learning framework for intraday trading. Specifically, we adopt an encoder-decoder architecture to learn robust market embedding incorporating both macro-level and micro-level market information. Moreover, a novel hindsight reward function is designed to provide the agent a long-term horizon for capturing the overall price trend. In addition, we propose a risk-aware auxiliary task by predicting future volatility, which helps the agent take market risk into consideration while maximizing profit. Finally, extensive experiments on two stock index futures and four treasury bond futures demonstrate that DeepScalper achieves significant improvement against many state-of-the-art approaches. ",

    "abstract": "We consider the task of learning causal structures from data stored on multiple machines, and propose a novel structure learning method called distributed annealing on regularized likelihood score (DARLS) to solve this problem. We model causal structures by a directed acyclic graph that is parameterized with generalized linear models, so that our method is applicable to various types of data. To obtain a high-scoring causal graph, DARLS simulates an annealing process to search over the space of topological sorts, where the optimal graphical structure compatible with a sort is found by a distributed optimization method. This distributed optimization relies on multiple rounds of communication between local and central machines to estimate the optimal structure. We establish its convergence to a global optimizer of the overall score that is computed on all data across local machines. To the best of our knowledge, DARLS is the first distributed method for learning causal graphs with such theoretical guarantees. Through extensive simulation studies, DARLS has shown competing performance against existing methods on distributed data, and achieved comparable structure learning accuracy and test-data likelihood with competing methods applied to pooled data across all local machines. In a real-world application for modeling protein-DNA binding networks with distributed ChIP-Sequencing data, DARLS also exhibits higher predictive power than other methods, demonstrating a great advantage in estimating causal networks from distributed data.

This article provides tools to understand this phenomenon in the context of structured populations, which engage in a process of opinion formation: What can the connectivity structure of a population reveal about correlations in opinions of its individuals? By studying the voter model, a classical model of opinion formation, we derive analytical results clarifying how local (individual) and global (population-wide) opinion correlations are expected to depend on the population structure. This dependency is revealed by replacing the conventional distance on structured populations (the shortest path) by an effective distance based on diffusion processes. We show that global properties of real-world population structures, such as degree-heterogeneity and small-worldness, have important ramifications for global opinion correlations and, in particular, for opinion diversity. Our results open new perspectives for understanding how to change interaction patterns such that they sustain opinion diversity and, thereby, the innovation, productivity, resilience, and collective intelligence of a society.

A serious limitation of many published approaches is insufficient attention paid to explaining decisions made by deep learning models. Using explainable artificial intelligence methods, we demonstrate that model decisions may rely on confounding factors rather than medical pathology. After an analysis of potential confounding factors found on chest X-ray images, we propose a novel method to minimise their negative impact. We show that our proposed method is more robust than previous attempts to counter confounding factors such as ECG leads in chest X-rays that often influence model classification decisions.

In this work, we address the generalizability of spoofing detection by proposing prototypical loss under the meta-learning paradigm to mimic the unseen test scenario during training. Prototypical loss with metric-learning objectives can learn the embedding space directly and emerges as a strong alternative to prevailing classification loss functions. We propose an anti-spoofing system based on squeeze-excitation Residual network (SE-ResNet) architecture with prototypical loss. We demonstrate that the proposed single system without any data augmentation can achieve competitive performance to the recent best anti-spoofing systems on ASVspoof 2019 logical access (LA) task. Furthermore, the proposed system with data augmentation outperforms the ASVspoof 2021 challenge best baseline both in the progress and evaluation phase of the LA task. On ASVspoof 2019 and 2021 evaluation set LA scenario, we attain a relative 68.4% and 3.6% improvement in min-tDCF compared to the challenge best baselines, respectively. ",

In these networks, interactions occur locally between individuals (i.e., nodes) who connect with each other at different times, culminating into a complex system-wide web that has a dynamic composition. Dynamic behavior in networks occurs not only locally but also at the global level, as systems expand or shrink due either to: changes in the size of node population or variations in the chance of a connection between two nodes. Here, we propose a numerical maximum-likelihood method to estimate population size and the probability of two nodes connecting at any given point in time. An advantage of the method is that it relies only on aggregate quantities, which are easy to access and free from privacy issues. Our approach enables us to identify the simultaneous (rather than the asynchronous) contribution of each mechanism in the densification and sparsification of human contacts, providing a better understanding of how humans collectively construct and deconstruct social networks.

In general, the identification of reliable interactions among drugs and proteins can boost the development of effective pharmaceuticals. In this work, we leverage random walks and matrix factorization techniques towards DTI prediction. In particular, we take a multi-layered network perspective, where different layers correspond to different similarity metrics between drugs and targets. To fully take advantage of topology information captured in multiple views, we develop an optimization framework, called MDMF, for DTI prediction. The framework learns vector representations of drugs and targets that not only retain higher-order proximity across all hyper-layers and layer-specific local invariance, but also approximates the interactions with their inner product. Furthermore, we propose an ensemble method, called MDMF2A, which integrates two instantiations of the MDMF model that optimize surrogate losses of the area under the precision-recall curve (AUPR) and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), respectively. The empirical study on real-world DTI datasets shows that our method achieves significant improvement over current state-of-the-art approaches in four different settings. Moreover, the validation of highly ranked non-interacting pairs also demonstrates the potential of MDMF2A to discover novel DTIs. ",

Ethanol of area-equivalent radius about 1.29 mm was dropped from impact heights ranging from 4 cm to 60 cm (splashing threshold 20 cm) and impacted on a hydrophilic surface. The images captured when half of the drop impacted the surface were labeled according to their outcome, splashing or nonsplashing, and were used to train an FNN. A classification accuracy higher than 96% was achieved. To extract the image features identified by the FNN for classification, the weight matrix of the trained FNN for identifying splashing drops was visualized. Remarkably, the visualization showed that the trained FNN identified the contour height of the main body of the impacting drop as an important characteristic differentiating between splashing and nonsplashing drops, which has not been reported in previous studies. This feature was found throughout the impact, even when one and three-quarters of the drop impacted the surface. To confirm the importance of this image feature, the FNN was retrained to classify using only the main body without checking for the presence of ejected secondary droplets. The accuracy was still higher than 82%, confirming that the contour height is an important feature distinguishing splashing from nonsplashing drops. Several aspects of drop impact are analyzed and discussed with the aim of identifying the possible mechanism underlying the difference in contour height between splashing and nonsplashing drops. ",

    "abstract": "With the rapid development of additive manufacturing, microstructures are attracting both academic and industrial interests. As an efficient way of analyzing the mechanical behaviors of microstructures, the homogenization method has been well studied in the literature. However, the classic homogenization method still faces challenges. Its computational cost is high for topological optimization that requires highly repeated calculation. The computation is more expensive when the microstructure is deformed from a regular cubic, causing changes for the virtual homogeneous material properties. To conquer this problem, we introduce a fine-designed 3D convolutional neural network (CNN), named DH-Net, to predict the homogenized properties of deformed microstructures. The novelty of DH-Net is that it predicts the local displacement rather than the homogenized properties. The macroscopic strains are considered as a constant in the loss function based on minimum potential energy. Thus DH-Net is label-free and more computation efficient than existing deep learning methods with the mean square loss function. We apply the shape-material transformation that a deformed microstructure with isotropic material can be bi-transformed into a regular structure with a transformed base material, such that the input with a CNN-friendly form feeds in DH-Net. DH-Net predicts homogenized properties with hundreds of acceleration compared to the standard homogenization method and even supports online computing. Moreover, it does not require a labeled dataset and thus can be much faster than current deep learning methods in training processing. DH-Net can predict both homogenized material properties and micro-mechanical properties, which is unavailable for existing DL methods. The generalization of DH-Net for different base materials and different types of microstructures is also taken into account. ",

Our network utilizes semantic segmentation to improve generator shape consistency, thus creating more realistic synthesised volumes to be used when re-training the segmentation network.

Finally, the minimum number of parameters describing the linear laws of this series is identified through stepped time windows. Based on the results, linear laws typically became more complex (containing an additional third parameter that indicates hidden Markov property) in two periods: before the crash of cryptocurrency markets inducted by the COVID-19 pandemic (12 March 2020), and before the record-breaking surge in the price of Bitcoin (Q4 2020 - Q1 2021).

In detail, the hybrid method is based on using both image processing and deep learning for better results. Reliable disease detection from histo-pathology images is known as an open problem in medical image processing and alternative solutions need to be developed. In this context, 520 histopathology images were collected in a joint study with Burdur Mehmet Akif Ersoy University, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, and Department of Pathology. Manually detecting and interpreting these images requires expertise and a lot of processing time. For this reason, veterinarians, especially newly recruited physicians, have a great need for imaging and computer vision systems in the development of detection and treatment methods for this disease. The proposed solution method in this study is to use the CLAHE method and image processing together. After this preprocessing, the diagnosis is made by classifying a convolutional neural network sup-ported by the VGG-16 architecture. This method uses completely original dataset images. Two types of systems were applied for the evaluation parameters. While the F1 Score was 93% in the method classified without data preprocessing, it was 98% in the method that was preprocessed with the CLAHE method. ",

    "title": "A Bayesian Permutation training deep representation learning method for  speech enhancement with variational autoencoder",
    "abstract": "Recently, variational autoencoder (VAE), a deep representation learning (DRL) model, has been used to perform speech enhancement (SE). However, to the best of our knowledge, current VAE-based SE methods only apply VAE to the model speech signal, while noise is modeled using the traditional non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) model. One of the most important reasons for using NMF is that these VAE-based methods cannot disentangle the speech and noise latent variables from the observed signal. Based on Bayesian theory, this paper derives a novel variational lower bound for VAE, which ensures that VAE can be trained in supervision, and can disentangle speech and noise latent variables from the observed signal. This means that the proposed method can apply the VAE to model both speech and noise signals, which is totally different from the previous VAE-based SE works. More specifically, the proposed DRL method can learn to impose speech and noise signal priors to different sets of latent variables for SE. The experimental results show that the proposed method can not only disentangle speech and noise latent variables from the observed signal but also obtain a higher scale-invariant signal-to-distortion ratio and speech quality score than the similar deep neural network-based (DNN) SE method.
