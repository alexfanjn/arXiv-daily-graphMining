    "title": "Advancing Deep Residual Learning by Solving the Crux of Degradation in  Spiking Neural Networks",
    "abstract": "Despite the rapid progress of neuromorphic computing, the inadequate depth and the resulting insufficient representation power of spiking neural networks (SNNs) severely restrict their application scope in practice. Residual learning and shortcuts have been evidenced as an important approach for training deep neural networks, but rarely did previous work assess their applicability to the characteristics of spike-based communication and spatiotemporal dynamics. This negligence leads to impeded information flow and the accompanying degradation problem. In this paper, we identify the crux and then propose a novel residual block for SNNs, which is able to significantly extend the depth of directly trained SNNs, e.g., up to 482 layers on CIFAR-10 and 104 layers on ImageNet, without observing any slight degradation problem. We validate the effectiveness of our methods on both frame-based and neuromorphic datasets, and our SRM-ResNet104 achieves a superior result of 76.02% accuracy on ImageNet, the first time in the domain of directly trained SNNs. The great energy efficiency is estimated and the resulting networks need on average only one spike per neuron for classifying an input sample. We believe our powerful and scalable modeling will provide a strong support for further exploration of SNNs. ",

    "title": "Efficient Training of Spiking Neural Networks with Temporally-Truncated  Local Backpropagation through Time",
    "abstract": "Directly training spiking neural networks (SNNs) has remained challenging due to complex neural dynamics and intrinsic non-differentiability in firing functions. The well-known backpropagation through time (BPTT) algorithm proposed to train SNNs suffers from large memory footprint and prohibits backward and update unlocking, making it impossible to exploit the potential of locally-supervised training methods. This work proposes an efficient and direct training algorithm for SNNs that integrates a locally-supervised training method with a temporally-truncated BPTT algorithm. The proposed algorithm explores both temporal and spatial locality in BPTT and contributes to significant reduction in computational cost including GPU memory utilization, main memory access and arithmetic operations. We thoroughly explore the design space concerning temporal truncation length and local training block size and benchmark their impact on classification accuracy of different networks running different types of tasks. The results reveal that temporal truncation has a negative effect on the accuracy of classifying frame-based datasets, but leads to improvement in accuracy on dynamic-vision-sensor (DVS) recorded datasets. In spite of resulting information loss, local training is capable of alleviating overfitting. The combined effect of temporal truncation and local training can lead to the slowdown of accuracy drop and even improvement in accuracy. In addition, training deep SNNs models such as AlexNet classifying CIFAR10-DVS dataset leads to 7.26% increase in accuracy, 89.94% reduction in GPU memory, 10.79% reduction in memory access, and 99.64% reduction in MAC operations compared to the standard end-to-end BPTT.

    "abstract": "Uniswap, like other DEXs, has gained much attention this year because it is a non-custodial and publicly verifiable exchange that allows users to trade digital assets without trusted third parties. However, its simplicity and lack of regulation also makes it easy to execute initial coin offering scams by listing non-valuable tokens. This method of performing scams is known as rug pull, a phenomenon that already existed in traditional finance but has become more relevant in DeFi. Various projects such as [34,37] have contributed to detecting rug pulls in EVM compatible chains. However, the first longitudinal and academic step to detecting and characterizing scam tokens on Uniswap was made in [44]. The authors collected all the transactions related to the Uniswap V2 exchange and proposed a machine learning algorithm to label tokens as scams. However, the algorithm is only valuable for detecting scams accurately after they have been executed. This paper increases their data set by 20K tokens and proposes a new methodology to label tokens as scams. After manually analyzing the data, we devised a theoretical classification of different malicious maneuvers in Uniswap protocol. We propose various machine-learning-based algorithms with new relevant features related to the token propagation and smart contract heuristics to detect potential rug pulls before they occur. In general, the models proposed achieved similar results. The best model obtained an accuracy of 0.9936, recall of 0.9540, and precision of 0.9838 in distinguishing non-malicious tokens from scams prior to the malicious maneuver. ",

While recent advances in deep learning (DL) provide a powerful approach to dealing with large-scale NSGs, DL methods such as NSG-NFSP suffer from the problem of data inefficiency. Furthermore, due to centralized control, they cannot scale to scenarios with a large number of resources. In this paper, we propose a novel DL-based method, NSGZero, to learn a non-exploitable policy in NSGs. NSGZero improves data efficiency by performing planning with neural Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). Our main contributions are threefold. First, we design deep neural networks (DNNs) to perform neural MCTS in NSGs. Second, we enable neural MCTS with decentralized control, making NSGZero applicable to NSGs with many resources. Third, we provide an efficient learning paradigm, to achieve joint training of the DNNs in NSGZero. Compared to state-of-the-art algorithms, our method achieves significantly better data efficiency and scalability. ",

    "abstract": "The quantitative understanding and precise control of complex dynamical systems can only be achieved by observing their internal states via measurement and/or estimation. In large-scale dynamical networks, it is often difficult or physically impossible to have enough sensor nodes to make the system fully observable. Even if the system is in principle observable, high-dimensionality poses fundamental limits on the computational tractability and performance of a full-state observer. To overcome the curse of dimensionality, we instead require the system to be functionally observable, meaning that a targeted subset of state variables can be reconstructed from the available measurements. Here, we develop a graph-based theory of functional observability, which leads to highly scalable algorithms to i) determine the minimal set of required sensors and ii) design the corresponding state observer of minimum order. Compared to the full-state observer, the proposed functional observer achieves the same estimation quality with substantially less sensing and computational resources, making it suitable for large-scale networks. We apply the proposed methods to the detection of cyber-attacks in power grids from limited phase measurement data and the inference of the prevalence rate of infection during an epidemic under limited testing conditions. The applications demonstrate that the functional observer can significantly scale up our ability to explore otherwise inaccessible dynamical processes on complex networks. ",

In configurable software systems, the combinatorics that arises from the multitude of features a user might select from adds a further layer of complexity. We introduce the notion of feature causality, which is based on counterfactual reasoning and inspired by the seminal definition of actual causality by Halpern and Pearl. Feature causality operates at the level of system configurations and is capable of identifying features and their interactions that are the reason for emerging functional and non-functional properties. We present various methods to explicate these reasons, in particular well-established notions of responsibility and blame that we extend to the feature-oriented setting. Establishing a close connection of feature causality to prime implicants, we provide algorithms to effectively compute feature causes and causal explications. By means of an evaluation on a wide range of configurable software systems, including community benchmarks and real-world systems, we demonstrate the feasibility of our approach: We illustrate how our notion of causality facilitates to identify root causes, estimate the effects of features, and detect feature interactions.

    "abstract": "Social media data such as Twitter messages (\"tweets\") pose a particular challenge to NLP systems because of their short, noisy, and colloquial nature. Tasks such as Named Entity Recognition (NER) and syntactic parsing require highly domain-matched training data for good performance. While there are some publicly available annotated datasets of tweets, they are all purpose-built for solving one task at a time. As yet there is no complete training corpus for both syntactic analysis (e.g., part of speech tagging, dependency parsing) and NER of tweets. In this study, we aim to create Tweebank-NER, an NER corpus based on Tweebank V2 (TB2), and we use these datasets to train state-of-the-art NLP models. We first annotate named entities in TB2 using Amazon Mechanical Turk and measure the quality of our annotations. We train a Stanza NER model on the new benchmark, achieving competitive performance against other non-transformer NER systems. Finally, we train other Twitter NLP models (a tokenizer, lemmatizer, part of speech tagger, and dependency parser) on TB2 based on Stanza, and achieve state-of-the-art or competitive performance on these tasks. We release the dataset and make the models available to use in an \"off-the-shelf\" manner for future Tweet NLP research.

    "abstract": "Efficient anomaly detection and diagnosis in multivariate time-series data is of great importance for modern industrial applications. However, building a system that is able to quickly and accurately pinpoint anomalous observations is a challenging problem. This is due to the lack of anomaly labels, high data volatility and the demands of ultra-low inference times in modern applications. Despite the recent developments of deep learning approaches for anomaly detection, only a few of them can address all of these challenges. In this paper, we propose TranAD, a deep transformer network based anomaly detection and diagnosis model which uses attention-based sequence encoders to swiftly perform inference with the knowledge of the broader temporal trends in the data. TranAD uses focus score-based self-conditioning to enable robust multi-modal feature extraction and adversarial training to gain stability. Additionally, model-agnostic meta learning (MAML) allows us to train the model using limited data. Extensive empirical studies on six publicly available datasets demonstrate that TranAD can outperform state-of-the-art baseline methods in detection and diagnosis performance with data and time-efficient training. Specifically, TranAD increases F1 scores by up to 17%, reducing training times by up to 99% compared to the baselines. ",

However, to be able to adapt to the ever-changing environment, the DRL solution implemented on an embedded device has to continue to occasionally take exploratory actions even after initial convergence. In other words, the device has to occasionally take random actions and update the value function, i.e., re-train the Artificial Neural Network (ANN), to ensure its performance remains optimal. Unfortunately, embedded devices often lack processing power and energy required to train the ANN. The energy aspect is particularly challenging when the edge device is powered only by a means of Energy Harvesting (EH). To overcome this problem, we propose a two-part algorithm in which the DRL process is trained at the sink. Then the weights of the fully trained underlying ANN are periodically transferred to the EH-powered embedded device taking actions. Using an EH-powered sensor, real-world measurements dataset, and optimizing for Age of Information (AoI) metric, we demonstrate that such a DRL solution can operate without any degradation in the performance, with only a few ANN updates per day.

The offline coarse space is efficiently constructed only once based on the initial permeability field with parallel computing. A rigorous convergence analysis is performed for two types of snapshot spaces. The analysis indicates that the convergence rates of the proposed multiscale method depend on the coarse meshsize and the eigenvalue decay of the local spectral problem. To further increase the accuracy of multiscale method, residual driven online multiscale basis is added to the offline space. The construction of online multiscale basis is based on a carefully design error indicator motivated by the analysis. We find that online basis is particularly important for the singular source. Rich numerical tests on typical 3D highly heterogeneous medias are presented to demonstrate the impressive computational advantages of the proposed multiscale method. ",

    "abstract": "Neural code models have introduced significant improvements over many software analysis tasks like type inference, vulnerability detection, etc. Despite the good performance of such models under the common intra-project independent and identically distributed (IID) training and validation setting, we observe that they usually fail to generalize to real-world inter-project out-of-distribution (OOD) setting. In this work, we show that such phenomenon is caused by model heavily relying on project-specific, ungeneralizable tokens like self-defined variable and function names for downstream prediction, and we formulate it as the project-specific bias learning behavior. We propose a measurement to interpret such behavior, termed as Cond-Idf, which combines co-occurrence probability and inverse document frequency to measure the level of relatedness of token with label and its project-specificness. The approximation indicates that without proper regularization with prior knowledge, model tends to leverage spurious statistical cues for prediction. Equipped with these observations, we propose a bias mitigation mechanism Batch Partition Regularization (BPR) that regularizes model to infer based on proper behavior by leveraging latent logic relations among samples. Experimental results on two deep code benchmarks indicate that BPR can improve both inter-project OOD generalization and adversarial robustness while not sacrificing accuracy on IID data. ",

    "abstract": "Recently, the concept of open radio access network (O-RAN) has been proposed, which aims to adopt intelligence and openness in the next generation radio access networks (RAN). It provides standardized interfaces and the ability to host network applications from third-party vendors by x-applications (xAPPs), which enables higher flexibility for network management. However, this may lead to conflicts in network function implementations, especially when these functions are implemented by different vendors. In this paper, we aim to mitigate the conflicts between xAPPs for near-real-time (near-RT) radio intelligent controller (RIC) of O-RAN. In particular, we propose a team learning algorithm to enhance the performance of the network by increasing cooperation between xAPPs. We compare the team learning approach with independent deep Q-learning where network functions individually optimize resources. Our simulations show that team learning has better network performance under various user mobility and traffic loads. With 6 Mbps traffic load and 20 m/s user movement speed, team learning achieves 8% higher throughput and 64.8% lower PDR. ",

However, the availability of data can be an issue due to privacy concerns, data size, data quality, and so on. To this end, in this paper, we propose a Variational AutoEncoder Generative Adversarial Network (VAE-GAN) as a smart grid data generative model which is capable of learning various types of data distributions and generating plausible samples from the same distribution without performing any prior analysis on the data before the training phase.We compared the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, maximum mean discrepancy (MMD), and Wasserstein distance between the synthetic data (electrical load and PV production) distribution generated by the proposed model, vanilla GAN network, and the real data distribution, to evaluate the performance of our model. Furthermore, we used five key statistical parameters to describe the smart grid data distribution and compared them between synthetic data generated by both models and real data. Experiments indicate that the proposed synthetic data generative model outperforms the vanilla GAN network. The distribution of VAE-GAN synthetic data is the most comparable to that of real data. ",

This paper studies how to attain pufferfish privacy by the exponential mechanism, an additive noise scheme that generalizes Gaussian and Laplace noise. A sufficient condition is derived showing that pufferfish privacy is attained by calibrating noise to the sensitivity of the Kantorovich optimal transport plan. Such a plan can be directly computed by using the data statistics conditioned on the secret, the prior knowledge about the system. It is shown that Gaussian noise provides better data utility than Laplace noise when the privacy budget $\\epsilon$ is small. The sufficient condition is then relaxed to reduce the noise power. Experimental results show that the relaxed sufficient condition improves data utility of the pufferfish private data regulation schemes. ",

This holds despite the fact that GPT-J was not trained on the problems in question and is not provided with any examples to work from. We further find that the code written by GPT-J is diverse in structure, lacking any particular tells that future plagiarism detection techniques may use to try to identify algorithmically generated code.

    "abstract": "Unsupervised graph representation learning has emerged as a powerful tool to address real-world problems and achieves huge success in the graph learning domain. Graph contrastive learning is one of the unsupervised graph representation learning methods, which recently attracts attention from researchers and has achieved state-of-the-art performances on various tasks. The key to the success of graph contrastive learning is to construct proper contrasting pairs to acquire the underlying structural semantics of the graph. However, this key part is not fully explored currently, most of the ways generating contrasting pairs focus on augmenting or perturbating graph structures to obtain different views of the input graph. But such strategies could degrade the performances via adding noise into the graph, which may narrow down the field of the applications of graph contrastive learning. In this paper, we propose a novel graph contrastive learning method, namely \\textbf{D}ual \\textbf{S}pace \\textbf{G}raph \\textbf{C}ontrastive (DSGC) Learning, to conduct graph contrastive learning among views generated in different spaces including the hyperbolic space and the Euclidean space. Since both spaces have their own advantages to represent graph data in the embedding spaces, we hope to utilize graph contrastive learning to bridge the spaces and leverage advantages from both sides. The comparison experiment results show that DSGC achieves competitive or better performances among all the datasets. In addition, we conduct extensive experiments to analyze the impact of different graph encoders on DSGC, giving insights about how to better leverage the advantages of contrastive learning between different spaces.

    "abstract": "Binary-source code matching plays an important role in many security and software engineering related tasks such as malware detection, reverse engineering and vulnerability assessment. Currently, several approaches have been proposed for binary-source code matching by jointly learning the embeddings of binary code and source code in a common vector space. Despite much effort, existing approaches target on matching the binary code and source code written in a single programming language. However, in practice, software applications are often written in different programming languages to cater for different requirements and computing platforms. Matching binary and source code across programming languages introduces additional challenges when maintaining multi-language and multi-platform applications. To this end, this paper formulates the problem of cross-language binary-source code matching, and develops a new dataset for this new problem. We present a novel approach XLIR, which is a Transformer-based neural network by learning the intermediate representations for both binary and source code. To validate the effectiveness of XLIR, comprehensive experiments are conducted on two tasks of cross-language binary-source code matching, and cross-language source-source code matching, on top of our curated dataset. Experimental results and analysis show that our proposed XLIR with intermediate representations significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art models in both of the two tasks. ",

However, this does not hold for real applications as the degradation process is complex and cannot be approximated by these idea cases well. Moreover, obtaining high-resolution (HR) videos and the corresponding low-resolution (LR) ones in real-world scenarios is difficult. To overcome these problems, we propose a self-supervised learning method to solve the blind video SR problem, which simultaneously estimates blur kernels and HR videos from the LR videos. As directly using LR videos as supervision usually leads to trivial solutions, we develop a simple and effective method to generate auxiliary paired data from original LR videos according to the image formation of video SR, so that the networks can be better constrained by the generated paired data for both blur kernel estimation and latent HR video restoration. In addition, we introduce an optical flow estimation module to exploit the information from adjacent frames for HR video restoration. Experiments show that our method performs favorably against state-of-the-art ones on benchmarks and real-world videos. ",

As the increasingly grow of coil number, however, it simultaneously aggravates the drawbacks of data storage and reconstruction speed, especially in some iterative reconstructions. Coil compression addresses these issues by generating fewer virtual coils. In this work, a novel variable augmented network for invertible coil compression (VAN-ICC) is presented, which utilizes inherent reversibility of normalizing-flow-based models, for better compression and invertible recovery. VAN-ICC trains invertible network by finding an invertible and bijective function, which can map the original image to the compression image. In the experiments, both fully-sampled images and under-sampled images were used to verify the effectiveness of the model. Extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrated that, in comparison with SCC and GCC, VAN-ICC can carry through better compression effect with equal number of virtual coils. Additionally, its performance is not susceptible to different num-ber of virtual coils. ",

Many of these workflows have significant computational, storage, and communication demands, and thus must execute on a range of large-scale computer systems, from local clusters to public clouds and upcoming exascale HPC platforms. Historically, infrastructures for workflow execution consisted of complex, integrated systems, developed in-house by workflow practitioners with strong dependencies on a range of legacy technologies. Due to the increasing need to support workflows, dedicated workflow systems were developed to provide abstractions for creating, executing, and adapting workflows conveniently and efficiently while ensuring portability. While these efforts are all worthwhile individually, there are now hundreds of independent workflow systems. The resulting workflow system technology landscape is fragmented, which may present significant barriers for future workflow users due to many seemingly comparable, yet usually mutually incompatible, systems that exist. In order to tackle some of these challenges, the DOE-funded ExaWorks and NSF-funded WorkflowsRI projects have organized in 2021 a series of events entitled the \"Workflows Community Summit\". The third edition of the ``Workflows Community Summit\" explored workflows challenges and opportunities from the perspective of computing centers and facilities. The third summit brought together a small group of facilities representatives with the aim to understand how workflows are currently being used at each facility, how facilities would like to interact with workflow developers and users, how workflows fit with facility roadmaps, and what opportunities there are for tighter integration between facilities and workflows.

By constructing connected paths between multi-scale local features and the global decoding stream with our proposed selective feature fusion module, the network can integrate both representations and recover fine details. In addition, the proposed decoder shows better performance than the previously proposed decoders, with considerably less computational complexity.

    "abstract": "Deep image steganography is a data hiding technology that conceal data in digital images via deep neural networks. However, existing deep image steganography methods only consider the visual similarity of container images to host images, and neglect the statistical security (stealthiness) of container images. Besides, they usually hides data limited to image type and thus relax the constraint of lossless extraction. In this paper, we address the above issues in a unified manner, and propose deep image steganography that can embed data with arbitrary types into images for secure data hiding and lossless data revealing. First, we formulate the data hiding as an image colorization problem, in which the data is binarized and further mapped into the color information for a gray-scale host image. Second, we design a conditional invertible neural network which uses gray-scale image as prior to guide the color generation and perform data hiding in a secure way. Finally, to achieve lossless data revealing, we present a multi-stage training scheme to manage the data loss due to rounding errors between hiding and revealing processes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can perform secure data hiding by generating realism color images and successfully resisting the detection of steganalysis. Moreover, we can achieve 100% revealing accuracy in different scenarios, indicating the practical utility of our steganography in the real-world. ",

Due to insufficient task-specific training data and corresponding ground truth, most existing end-to-end image fusion methods easily fall into overfitting or tedious parameter optimization processes. Two-stage methods avoid the need of large amount of task-specific training data by training encoder-decoder network on large natural image datasets and utilizing the extracted features for fusion, but the domain gap between natural images and different fusion tasks results in limited performance. In this study, we design a novel encoder-decoder based image fusion framework and propose a destruction-reconstruction based self-supervised training scheme to encourage the network to learn task-specific features. Specifically, we propose three destruction-reconstruction self-supervised auxiliary tasks for multi-modal image fusion, multi-exposure image fusion and multi-focus image fusion based on pixel intensity non-linear transformation, brightness transformation and noise transformation, respectively. In order to encourage different fusion tasks to promote each other and increase the generalizability of the trained network, we integrate the three self-supervised auxiliary tasks by randomly choosing one of them to destroy a natural image in model training. In addition, we design a new encoder that combines CNN and Transformer for feature extraction, so that the trained model can exploit both local and global information. Extensive experiments on multi-modal image fusion, multi-exposure image fusion and multi-focus image fusion tasks demonstrate that our proposed method achieves the state-of-the-art performance in both subjective and objective evaluations.

The huge volume of political discussions on social media platforms, like, Twitter, provide opportunities in developing automated mechanisms to identify individual stance and subsequently, scale to a large volume of users. However, issues like short text and huge variance in the vocabulary of the tweets make such exercise enormously difficult. Existing stance detection algorithms require either event specific training data or annotated twitter handles and therefore, are difficult to adapt to new events. In this paper, we propose a sign network based framework that use external information sources, like news articles to create a signed network of relevant entities with respect to a news event and subsequently use the same to detect stance of any tweet towards the event. Validation on 5,000 tweets related to 10 events indicates that the proposed approach can ensure over 6.5% increase in average F1 score compared to the existing stance detection approaches. ",

Behind its revolutionary representation power, the requirements for dedicated model designs and a massive amount of computation resources expose image encoders to the risks of potential model stealing attacks -- a cheap way to mimic the well-trained encoder performance while circumventing the demanding requirements. Yet conventional attacks only target supervised classifiers given their predicted labels and/or posteriors, which leaves the vulnerability of unsupervised encoders unexplored. In this paper, we first instantiate the conventional stealing attacks against encoders and demonstrate their severer vulnerability compared with downstream classifiers. To better leverage the rich representation of encoders, we further propose Cont-Steal, a contrastive-learning-based attack, and validate its improved stealing effectiveness in various experiment settings. As a takeaway, we appeal to our community's attention to the intellectual property protection of representation learning techniques, especially to the defenses against encoder stealing attacks like ours.

In this paper, we design and implement a novel LSTM-based adversarial mechanism with representation learning to attain a privacy-preserving feature representation of the original geolocated data (mobility data) for a sharing purpose. We quantify the utility-privacy trade-off of mobility datasets in terms of trajectory reconstruction risk, user re-identification risk, and mobility predictability. Our proposed architecture reports a Pareto Frontier analysis that enables the user to assess this trade-off as a function of Lagrangian loss weight parameters. The extensive comparison results on four representative mobility datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed architecture and the efficiency of the proposed privacy-preserving features extractor. Our results show that by exploring Pareto optimal setting, we can simultaneously increase both privacy (45%) and utility (32%). ",

Our new causally masked approach generates tokens left to right while also masking out a small number of long token spans that are generated at the end of the string, instead of their original positions. The casual masking object provides a type of hybrid of the more common causal and masked language models, by enabling full generative modeling while also providing bidirectional context when generating the masked spans. We train causally masked language-image models on large-scale web and Wikipedia articles, where each document contains all of the text, hypertext markup, hyperlinks, and image tokens (from a VQVAE-GAN), provided in the order they appear in the original HTML source (before masking). The resulting CM3 models can generate rich structured, multi-modal outputs while conditioning on arbitrary masked document contexts, and thereby implicitly learn a wide range of text, image, and cross modal tasks. They can be prompted to recover, in a zero-shot fashion, the functionality of models such as DALL-E, GENRE, and HTLM. We set the new state-of-the-art in zero-shot summarization, entity linking, and entity disambiguation while maintaining competitive performance in the fine-tuning setting. We can generate images unconditionally, conditioned on text (like DALL-E) and do captioning all in a zero-shot setting with a single model. ",

ThorFI is designed to provide non-intrusive fault injection capabilities for a cloud tenant, and to isolate injections from interfering with other tenants on the infrastructure. We present the solution in the context of the OpenStack cloud management platform, and release this implementation as open-source software. Finally, we present two relevant case studies of ThorFI, respectively in an NFV IMS and of a high-availability cloud application. The case studies show that ThorFI can enhance functional tests with fault injection, as in 4%-34% of the test cases the IMS is unable to handle faults; and that despite redundancy in virtual networks, faults in one virtual network segment can propagate to other segments, and can affect the throughput and response time of the cloud application as a whole, by about 3 times in the worst case.

The focus is on the case where the agents have possibly repeated unstable eigenvalues since those with stable eigenvalues are well-known. It proposes the use of a generalized gain matrix and shows that under reasonable conditions, synchronization/consensus is achieved when the gain is sufficiently large. When the communication network is non time-varying and the dynamics of the agent have eigenvalues in the closed left-half complex plane, the proposed approach includes the standard consensus result. Several connections to standard results are also highlighted. The existences of such gain matrices for consensus are shown under three communication settings: fixed graph, switching among undirected and connected graphs and switching among directed and connected graphs. An adaptive scheme to realize the gain matrix for the case of undirected and fixed network is also shown and illustrated via an example. ",

Multiple approaches to automate it using various machine learning techniques have been proposed. The first research papers that apply deep neural networks to this problem were published in the last two years. In this work, we conduct a replicability study of the first two deep learning papers for citation screening and evaluate their performance on 23 publicly available datasets. While we succeeded in replicating the results of one of the papers, we were unable to replicate the results of the other. We summarise the challenges involved in the replication, including difficulties in obtaining the datasets to match the experimental setup of the original papers and problems with executing the original source code. Motivated by this experience, we subsequently present a simpler model based on averaging word embeddings that outperforms one of the models on 18 out of 23 datasets and is, on average, 72 times faster than the second replicated approach. Finally, we measure the training time and the invariance of the models when exposed to a variety of input features and random initialisations, demonstrating differences in the robustness of these approaches.

However, due to the limitations in hardware, scan time, and throughput, it is often clinically challenging to obtain high-quality MR images. In this article, we propose a method of using artificial intelligence to expand the channel to achieve the effect of increasing the virtual coil. The main feature of our work is utilizing dummy variable technology to expand the channel in both the image and k-space domains. The high-dimensional information formed by channel expansion is used as the prior information of parallel imaging to improve the reconstruction effect of parallel imaging. Two features are introduced, namely variable enhancement and sum of squares (SOS) objective function. Variable argumentation provides the network with more high-dimensional prior information, which is helpful for the network to extract the deep feature in-formation of the image. The SOS objective function is employed to solve the problem that k-space data is difficult to train while speeding up the convergence speed. Ablation studies and experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves significantly higher image reconstruction performance than current state-of-the-art techniques. ",

    "abstract": "Participatory budgeting (PB) is a democratic process for allocating funds to projects based on the votes of members of the community. Different rules have been used to aggregate participants' votes. Past research has studied the trade-off between notions of social welfare and fairness in the multi-winner setting (a special case of participatory budgeting with identical project costs) by Lackner and Skowron (2020). But there is little understanding of this trade-off in the more general PB setting. This paper provides a theoretical and empirical study of the worst-case guarantees of several common rules to better understand the trade-off between social welfare, representation. We show that many of the guarantees from the multi-winner setting do not generalize to the PB setting, and that the introduction of costs leads to substantially worse guarantees, thereby exacerbating the welfare-representation trade-off. We extend our theoretical analysis to studying how the requirement of proportionality over voting rules affects this trade-off. We further study how the requirement of proportionality over voting rules effects the guarantees on social welfare and representation. We study the latter point also empirically, both on real and synthetic datasets. We show that variants of the recently suggested voting rule Rule-X (which satisfies proportionality) do very well in practice both with respect to social welfare and representation. ",

We derive the moments of the conditional successful transmission probability (STP). By taking the temporal random arrival of traffic into consideration, an equation is formulated to derive the meta distribution and the meta distribution can be obtained in a recursive manner. The numerical results reveal the impact of the key network parameters, such as the SINR threshold and the blockage parameter, on the network performance. ",

In a first class, propagation is modeled as a wave which emanates from a set of known nodes at an initial time, to all other unknown nodes at later times with an ordering determined by the time at which the information wave front reaches nodes. A second class of models is based on the notion of a travel time along paths between nodes. The time of information propagation from an initial known set of nodes to a node is defined as the minimum of a generalized travel time over subsets of all admissible paths. A final class is given by imposing a local equation of an eikonal form at each unknown node, with boundary conditions at the known nodes. The solution value of the local equation at a node is coupled the neighbouring nodes with smaller solution values. We provide precise formulations of the model classes in this graph setting, and prove equivalences between them. Motivated by the connection between first arrival time model and the eikonal equation in the continuum setting, we demonstrate that for graphs in the particular form of grids in Euclidean space mean field limits under grid refinement of certain graph models lead to Hamilton-Jacobi PDEs. For a specific parameter setting, we demonstrate that the solution on the grid approximates the Euclidean distance. ",

However, the anti-counterfeiting QR code has the risk of being copied and forged in the circulation process. In reality, copying is usually based on genuine anti-counterfeiting QR codes, but the brands and models of copiers are diverse, and it is extremely difficult to determine which individual copier the forged anti-counterfeiting code come from. In response to the above problems, this paper proposes a method for copy forgery identification of anti-counterfeiting QR code based on deep learning. We first analyze the production principle of anti-counterfeiting QR code, and convert the identification of copy forgery to device category forensics, and then a Dual-Branch Multi-Scale Feature Fusion network is proposed. During the design of the network, we conducted a detailed analysis of the data preprocessing layer, single-branch design, etc., combined with experiments, the specific structure of the dual-branch multi-scale feature fusion network is determined. The experimental results show that the proposed method has achieved a high accuracy of copy forgery identification, which exceeds the current series of methods in the field of image forensics. ",

However, current researchers only focus on short-term or long-term vessel trajectory prediction, which leads to insufficient accuracy of trajectory prediction and lack of in-depth mining of comprehensive historical trajectory data. This paper proposes an Automatic Identification System (AIS) data-driven long short-term memory (LSTM) method based on the fusion of the forward sub-network and the reverse sub-network (termed as FRA-LSTM) to predict the vessel trajectory. The forward sub-network in our method combines LSTM and attention mechanism to mine features of forward historical trajectory data. Simultaneously, the reverse sub-network combines bi-directional LSTM (BiLSTM) and attention mechanism to mine features of backward historical trajectory data. Finally, the final predicted trajectory is generated by fusing output features of the forward and reverse sub-network. Based on plenty of experiments, we prove that the accuracy of our proposed method in predicting short-term and mid-term trajectories has increased by 96.8% and 86.5% on average compared with the BiLSTM and Seq2seq. Furthermore, the average accuracy of our method is 90.1% higher than that of compared the BiLSTM and Seq2seq in predicting long-term trajectories. ",

In order to make timely and well-informed decisions, it is imperative to be able to come up with proxies for these parameters which can be sampled quickly and efficiently, especially during disruptive events, like the COVID-19 pandemic. Recently, there has been a lot of focus on using remote sensing data for this purpose. The data has become cheaper to collect compared to surveys, and can be available in real time. In this work, we present Regional GDP NightLight (ReGNL), a neural network based model which is trained on a custom dataset of historical nightlights and GDP data along with the geographical coordinates of a place, and estimates the GDP of the place, given the other parameters. Taking the case of 50 US states, we find that ReGNL is disruption-agnostic and is able to predict the GDP for both normal years (2019) and for years with a disruptive event (2020). ReGNL outperforms timeseries ARIMA methods for prediction, even during the pandemic. Following from our findings, we make a case for building infrastructures to collect and make available granular data, especially in resource-poor geographies, so that these can be leveraged for policy making during disruptive events.

Also, different infrastructure providers will charge slicing service depending on specific access technology supported across sites and IoT data collection patterns. We introduce a pricing mechanism based on Age of Information (AoI) to reduce the cost of SPs. It provides incentives for devices to smooth traffic by shifting part of the traffic load from highly congested and more expensive locations to lesser charged ones, while meeting QoS requirements of the IoT service. The proposed optimal pricing scheme comprises a two-stage decision process, where the SP determines the pricing of each location and devices schedule uploads of collected data based on the optimal uploading policy. Simulations show that the SP attains consistent cost reductions tuning the trade-off between slicing costs and the AoI of uploaded IoT data. ",

    "abstract": "Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) demonstrate great performance in various applications but have high computational complexity. Quantization is applied to reduce the latency and storage cost of CNNs. Among the quantization methods, Binary and Ternary Weight Networks (BWNs and TWNs) have a unique advantage over 8-bit and 4-bit quantization. They replace the multiplication operations in CNNs with additions, which are favoured on In-Memory-Computing (IMC) devices. IMC acceleration for BWNs has been widely studied. However, though TWNs have higher accuracy and better sparsity, IMC acceleration for TWNs has limited research. TWNs on existing IMC devices are inefficient because the sparsity is not well utilized, and the addition operation is not efficient. In this paper, we propose FAT as a novel IMC accelerator for TWNs. First, we propose a Sparse Addition Control Unit, which utilizes the sparsity of TWNs to skip the null operations on zero weights. Second, we propose a fast addition scheme based on the memory Sense Amplifier to avoid the time overhead of both carry propagation and writing back the carry to the memory cells. Third, we further propose a Combined-Stationary data mapping to reduce the data movement of both activations and weights and increase the parallelism of memory columns. Simulation results show that for addition operations at the Sense Amplifier level, FAT achieves 2.00X speedup, 1.22X power efficiency and 1.22X area efficiency compared with State-Of-The-Art IMC accelerator ParaPIM. FAT achieves 10.02X speedup and 12.19X energy efficiency compared with ParaPIM on networks with 80% sparsity ",

    "abstract": "In biomedical image analysis, the applicability of deep learning methods is directly impacted by the quantity of image data available. This is due to deep learning models requiring large image datasets to provide high-level performance. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have been widely utilized to address data limitations through the generation of synthetic biomedical images. GANs consist of two models. The generator, a model that learns how to produce synthetic images based on the feedback it receives. The discriminator, a model that classifies an image as synthetic or real and provides feedback to the generator. Throughout the training process, a GAN can experience several technical challenges that impede the generation of suitable synthetic imagery. First, the mode collapse problem whereby the generator either produces an identical image or produces a uniform image from distinct input features. Second, the non-convergence problem whereby the gradient descent optimizer fails to reach a Nash equilibrium. Thirdly, the vanishing gradient problem whereby unstable training behavior occurs due to the discriminator achieving optimal classification performance resulting in no meaningful feedback being provided to the generator. These problems result in the production of synthetic imagery that is blurry, unrealistic, and less diverse. To date, there has been no survey article outlining the impact of these technical challenges in the context of the biomedical imagery domain. This work presents a review and taxonomy based on solutions to the training problems of GANs in the biomedical imaging domain. This survey highlights important challenges and outlines future research directions about the training of GANs in the domain of biomedical imagery. ",

    "abstract": "Skin dynamics contributes to the enriched realism of human body models in rendered scenes. Traditional methods rely on physics-based simulations to accurately reproduce the dynamic behavior of soft tissues. Due to the model complexity and thus the heavy computation, however, they do not directly offer practical solutions to domains where real-time performance is desirable. The quality shapes obtained by physics-based simulations are not fully exploited by example-based or more recent datadriven methods neither, with most of them having focused on the modeling of static skin shapes by leveraging quality data. To address these limitations, we present a learningbased method for dynamic skin deformation. At the core of our work is a recurrent neural network that learns to predict the nonlinear, dynamics-dependent shape change over time from pre-existing mesh deformation sequence data. Our network also learns to predict the variation of skin dynamics across different individuals with varying body shapes. After training the network delivers realistic, high-quality skin dynamics that is specific to a person in a real-time course. We obtain results that significantly saves the computational time, while maintaining comparable prediction quality compared to state-of-the-art results. ",

This limits the impact of our research since learning-based computer vision methods can only be used in scenarios that are supported by existing datasets. In this work, we present a full object keypoint tracking toolkit, encompassing the entire process from data collection, labeling, model learning and evaluation. We present a semi-automatic way of collecting and labeling datasets using a wrist mounted camera on a standard robotic arm.

But, almost always, there exist unusual conditions that trigger atypical behaviors, which are hard to predict in program specifications, and are thus often not coded. In this paper, we consider the problem of detecting and recommending such missing behaviors, a task that we call code sophistication. Previous research on coding assistants usually focuses on recommending code fragments based on specifications of the intended behavior. In contrast, code sophistication happens in the absence of a specification, aiming to help developers complete the logic of their programs with missing and unspecified behaviors. We outline the research challenges to this problem and present early results showing how program logic can be completed by leveraging code structure and information about the usage of input parameters.

    "abstract": "Most existing Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are proposed without considering the selection bias in data, i.e., the inconsistent distribution between the training set with test set. In reality, the test data is not even available during the training process, making selection bias agnostic. Training GNNs with biased selected nodes leads to significant parameter estimation bias and greatly impacts the generalization ability on test nodes. In this paper, we first present an experimental investigation, which clearly shows that the selection bias drastically hinders the generalization ability of GNNs, and theoretically prove that the selection bias will cause the biased estimation on GNN parameters. Then to remove the bias in GNN estimation, we propose a novel Debiased Graph Neural Networks (DGNN) with a differentiated decorrelation regularizer. The differentiated decorrelation regularizer estimates a sample weight for each labeled node such that the spurious correlation of learned embeddings could be eliminated. We analyze the regularizer in causal view and it motivates us to differentiate the weights of the variables based on their contribution on the confounding bias. Then, these sample weights are used for reweighting GNNs to eliminate the estimation bias, thus help to improve the stability of prediction on unknown test nodes. Comprehensive experiments are conducted on several challenging graph datasets with two kinds of label selection biases. The results well verify that our proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art methods and DGNN is a flexible framework to enhance existing GNNs. ",

In this paper, we: (i) analyse the whole-system security and privacy threats to existing wearable BCI products from an operating system and adversarial machine learning perspective; and (ii) introduce Argus, the first information flow control system for wearable BCI applications that mitigates these attacks. Argus' domain-specific design leads to a lightweight implementation on Linux ARM platforms suitable for existing BCI use-cases. Our proof of concept attacks on real-world BCI devices (Muse, NeuroSky, and OpenBCI) led us to discover more than 300 vulnerabilities across the stacks of six major attack vectors. Our evaluation shows Argus is highly effective in tracking sensitive dataflows and restricting these attacks with an acceptable memory and performance overhead (<15%). ",

Such multi-domain architecture shall be agnostic of the underlying virtualization and network infrastructure technologies. Its objective is to extend the traditional orchestration, management and control capabilities by means of models and constructs in order to form a well-stitched composition of network slices. To facilitate such composition of networking and compute/storage resources, this paper introduces a management and orchestration architecture that incorporates Software Defined Networking (SDN) and Network Function Virtualization (NFV) components to the basic 3GPP network slice management. The proposed architecture is broadly divided into four major strata, namely Multi-domain Service Conductor Stratum, Domain-specific Fully-Fledged Orchestration Stratum, Sub-Domain Management and Orchestration (MANO) and Connectivity Stratum, and Logical Multidomain Slice Instance stratum. Each of these strata is described in detail providing also the fundamental operational specifics for instantiating and managing the resulting federated network slices. ",

Both the 3GPP and the ETSI proposals offered numerous benefits, particularly the ability to deliver highly customizable services. Nevertheless, compared to large datacenters that tolerate the hosting of standard virtualization technologies (Virtual Machines (VMs) and servers), MEC nodes are characterized by lower computational resources, thus the debut of lightweight micro-service based applications. Motivated by the deficiency of current micro-services-based applications to support users'mobility and assuming that all these issues are under the umbrella of Service Function Chain (SFC) migrations, we aim to introduce, explain and evaluate diverse SFC migration patterns. The obtained results demonstrate that there is no clear vanquisher, but selecting the right SFC migration pattern depends on users'motion, applications'requirements, and MEC nodes'resources. ",

IR serve an important function in the biomedical domain, where content and sources of scientific knowledge may evolve rapidly. Although neural retrievers have surpassed traditional IR approaches such as TF-IDF and BM25 in standard open-domain question answering tasks, they are still found lacking in the biomedical domain. In this paper, we seek to improve information retrieval (IR) using neural retrievers (NR) in the biomedical domain, and achieve this goal using a three-pronged approach. First, to tackle the relative lack of data in the biomedical domain, we propose a template-based question generation method that can be leveraged to train neural retriever models. Second, we develop two novel pre-training tasks that are closely aligned to the downstream task of information retrieval. Third, we introduce the ``Poly-DPR'' model which encodes each context into multiple context vectors. Extensive experiments and analysis on the BioASQ challenge suggest that our proposed method leads to large gains over existing neural approaches and beats BM25 in the small-corpus setting. We show that BM25 and our method can complement each other, and a simple hybrid model leads to further gains in the large corpus setting. ",

Motivated by this requirement, we conduct an empirical centrality analysis of the popular Lightning Network, and in particular, the betweenness centrality distribution of the routing system. Based on our extensive data set (using several millions of channel update messages), we implemented a TimeMachine tool which enables us to study the network evolution over time. We find that although the network is generally fairly decentralized, a small number of nodes can attract a significant fraction of the transactions, introducing skew. Furthermore, our analysis suggests that over the last two years, the centrality has increased significantly, e.g., the inequality (measured by the Gini index) has increased by more than 10%. ",

While most previous studies rely on accurate explicit structural information, recent works explore the implicit scene representation of Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) for realistic generation. In order to capture the inconsistent motions as well as the semantic difference between human head and torso, some work models them via two individual sets of NeRF, leading to unnatural results. In this work, we propose Semantic-aware Speaking Portrait NeRF (SSP-NeRF), which creates delicate audio-driven portraits using one unified set of NeRF. The proposed model can handle the detailed local facial semantics and the global head-torso relationship through two semantic-aware modules. Specifically, we first propose a Semantic-Aware Dynamic Ray Sampling module with an additional parsing branch that facilitates audio-driven volume rendering. Moreover, to enable portrait rendering in one unified neural radiance field, a Torso Deformation module is designed to stabilize the large-scale non-rigid torso motions. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our proposed approach renders more realistic video portraits compared to previous methods. Project page: https://alvinliu0.github.io/projects/SSP-NeRF ",

We build on top of Tensor Field Networks (TFNs), a class of permutation- and rotation-equivariant, and translation-invariant 3D networks. During inference, our method takes an unseen full or partial 3D point cloud at an arbitrary pose and outputs an equivariant canonical pose. During training, this network uses self-supervision losses to learn the canonical pose from an un-canonicalized collection of full and partial 3D point clouds. ConDor can also learn to consistently co-segment object parts without any supervision.

The increasing use of artificial intelligence (AI) in the automation of carcinoma diagnosis also reveals a significant rise in the use of deep network models. In this systematic literature review, we present a comprehensive review of the state-of-the-art approaches reported in carcinoma diagnosis using histopathological images. Studies are selected from well-known databases with strict inclusion/exclusion criteria. We have categorized the articles and recapitulated their methods based on specific organs of carcinoma origin. Further, we have summarized pertinent literature on AI methods, highlighted critical challenges and limitations, and provided insights on future research direction in automated carcinoma diagnosis. Out of 101 articles selected, most of the studies experimented on private datasets with varied image sizes, obtaining accuracy between 63% and 100%. Overall, this review highlights the need for a generalized AI-based carcinoma diagnostic system.

We show that the objective function is increasing along the gradient flow. Further, we prove that if the regularization in terms of the mean-field measure is sufficient, the gradient flow converges exponentially fast to the unique stationary solution, which is the unique maximizer of the regularized MDP objective. Lastly, we study the sensitivity of the value function along the gradient flow with respect to regularization parameters and the initial condition. Our results rely on the careful analysis of non-linear Fokker--Planck--Kolmogorov equation and extend the pioneering work of Mei et al. 2020 and Agarwal et al. 2020, which quantify the global convergence rate of policy gradient for entropy-regularized MDPs in the tabular setting.

    "title": "Lung Swapping Autoencoder: Learning a Disentangled Structure-texture  Representation of Chest Radiographs",
    "abstract": "Well-labeled datasets of chest radiographs (CXRs) are difficult to acquire due to the high cost of annotation. Thus, it is desirable to learn a robust and transferable representation in an unsupervised manner to benefit tasks that lack labeled data. Unlike natural images, medical images have their own domain prior; e.g., we observe that many pulmonary diseases, such as the COVID-19, manifest as changes in the lung tissue texture rather than the anatomical structure. Therefore, we hypothesize that studying only the texture without the influence of structure variations would be advantageous for downstream prognostic and predictive modeling tasks. In this paper, we propose a generative framework, the Lung Swapping Autoencoder (LSAE), that learns factorized representations of a CXR to disentangle the texture factor from the structure factor. Specifically, by adversarial training, the LSAE is optimized to generate a hybrid image that preserves the lung shape in one image but inherits the lung texture of another. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the disentangled texture representation, we evaluate the texture encoder $Enc^t$ in LSAE on ChestX-ray14 (N=112,120), and our own multi-institutional COVID-19 outcome prediction dataset, COVOC (N=340 (Subset-1) + 53 (Subset-2)). On both datasets, we reach or surpass the state-of-the-art by finetuning $Enc^t$ in LSAE that is 77% smaller than a baseline Inception v3. Additionally, in semi-and-self supervised settings with a similar model budget, $Enc^t$ in LSAE is also competitive with the state-of-the-art MoCo. By \"re-mixing\" the texture and shape factors, we generate meaningful hybrid images that can augment the training set. This data augmentation method can further improve COVOC prediction performance. The improvement is consistent even when we directly evaluate the Subset-1 trained model on Subset-2 without any fine-tuning. ",

    "abstract": "Learned iterative reconstruction algorithms for inverse problems offer the flexibility to combine analytical knowledge about the problem with modules learned from data. This way, they achieve high reconstruction performance while ensuring consistency with the measured data. In computed tomography, extending such approaches from 2D fan-beam to 3D cone-beam data is challenging due to the prohibitively high GPU memory that would be needed to train such models. This paper proposes to use neural ordinary differential equations to solve the reconstruction problem in a residual formulation via numerical integration. For training, there is no need to backpropagate through several unrolled network blocks nor through the internals of the solver. Instead, the gradients are obtained very memory-efficiently in the neural ODE setting allowing for training on a single consumer graphics card. The method is able to reduce the root mean squared error by over 30% compared to the best performing classical iterative reconstruction algorithm and produces high quality cone-beam reconstructions even in a sparse view scenario.

The proposed framework is developed by adapting Capsule Network (CapsNet) architecture into image-to-image regression encoder-decoder network. Specifically, the aim is to exploit the benefits of CapsNet over convolution neural network (CNN) $-$ retaining pose and position information related to an entity to name a few. The performance of proposed approach is illustrated by solving an elliptic stochastic partial differential equation (SPDE), which also governs systems in mechanics such as steady heat conduction, ground water flow or other diffusion processes, based uncertainty quantification problem with an input dimensionality of $1024$. However, the problem definition does not the restrict the random diffusion field to a particular covariance structure, and the more strenuous task of response prediction for an arbitrary diffusion field is solved. The obtained results from performance evaluation indicate that the proposed approach is accurate, efficient, and robust. ",
