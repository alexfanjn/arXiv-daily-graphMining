    "title": "Autonomous Cyber Defense Introduces Risk: Can We Manage the Risk?",
    "abstract": "From denial-of-service attacks to spreading of ransomware or other malware across an organization's network, it is possible that manually operated defenses are not able to respond in real time at the scale required, and when a breach is detected and remediated the damage is already made. Autonomous cyber defenses therefore become essential to mitigate the risk of successful attacks and their damage, especially when the response time, effort and accuracy required in those defenses is impractical or impossible through defenses operated exclusively by humans. Autonomous agents have the potential to use ML with large amounts of data about known cyberattacks as input, in order to learn patterns and predict characteristics of future attacks. Moreover, learning from past and present attacks enable defenses to adapt to new threats that share characteristics with previous attacks. On the other hand, autonomous cyber defenses introduce risks of unintended harm. Actions arising from autonomous defense agents may have harmful consequences of functional, safety, security, ethical, or moral nature. Here we focus on machine learning training, algorithmic feedback, and algorithmic constraints, with the aim of motivating a discussion on achieving trust in autonomous cyber defenses. ",

Recently, Ta-Shma used s-wide replacement walks in his breakthrough construction of a binary linear code almost matching the Gilbert-Varshamov bound (STOC 2017). Ta-Shma's original analysis was entirely linear algebraic, and subsequent developments have inherited this viewpoint. In this work, we rederive Ta-Shma's analysis from a combinatorial point of view using repeated application of the expander mixing lemma.

    "abstract": "While Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) achieve spectacular results on unstructured data like images, there is still a gap on tabular data, data for which state of the art supervised learning still favours to a large extent decision tree (DT)-based models. This paper proposes a new path forward for the generation of tabular data, exploiting decades-old understanding of the supervised task's best components for DT induction, from losses (properness), models (tree-based) to algorithms (boosting). The \\textit{properness} condition on the supervised loss -- which postulates the optimality of Bayes rule -- leads us to a variational GAN-style loss formulation which is \\textit{tight} when discriminators meet a calibration property trivially satisfied by DTs, and, under common assumptions about the supervised loss, yields \"one loss to train against them all\" for the generator: the $\\chi^2$. We then introduce tree-based generative models, \\textit{generative trees} (GTs), meant to mirror on the generative side the good properties of DTs for classifying tabular data, with a boosting-compliant \\textit{adversarial} training algorithm for GTs. We also introduce \\textit{copycat training}, in which the generator copies at run time the underlying tree (graph) of the discriminator DT and completes it for the hardest discriminative task, with boosting compliant convergence. We test our algorithms on tasks including fake/real distinction, training from fake data and missing data imputation. Each one of these tasks displays that GTs can provide comparatively simple -- and interpretable -- contenders to sophisticated state of the art methods for data generation (using neural network models) or missing data imputation (relying on multiple imputation by chained equations with complex tree-based modeling).

The estimated dependence measure is subsequently used to prune a collection of redundant and uninformative layers. Model-freeness of our measure guarantees that no parametric assumptions on the feature map distribution are required, making it computationally appealing for very high dimensional feature space in DNNs. Extensive numerical experiments on various architectures show the efficacy of the proposed pruning approach with competitive performance to state-of-the-art methods. ",

    "abstract": "Given a sequence of random (directed and weighted) graphs, we address the problem of online monitoring and detection of changes in the underlying data distribution. Our idea is to endow sequential change-point detection (CPD) techniques with a graph representation learning substrate based on the versatile Random Dot Product Graph (RDPG) model. We consider efficient, online updates of a judicious monitoring function, which quantifies the discrepancy between the streaming graph observations and the nominal RDPG. This reference distribution is inferred via spectral embeddings of the first few graphs in the sequence. We characterize the distribution of this running statistic to select thresholds that guarantee error-rate control, and under simplifying approximations we offer insights on the algorithm's detection resolution and delay. The end result is a lightweight online CPD algorithm, that is also explainable by virtue of the well-appreciated interpretability of RDPG embeddings. This is in stark contrast with most existing graph CPD approaches, which either rely on extensive computation, or they store and process the entire observed time series. An apparent limitation of the RDPG model is its suitability for undirected and unweighted graphs only, a gap we aim to close here to broaden the scope of the CPD framework. Unlike previous proposals, our non-parametric RDPG model for weighted graphs does not require a priori specification of the weights' distribution to perform inference and estimation. This network modeling contribution is of independent interest beyond CPD. We offer an open-source implementation of the novel online CPD algorithm for weighted and direct graphs, whose effectiveness and efficiency are demonstrated via (reproducible) synthetic and real network data experiments.

However, they often violate syntactic and semantic rules of their output language, limiting their practical usability. In this paper, we propose Synchromesh: a framework for substantially improving the reliability of pre-trained models for code generation. Synchromesh comprises two components. First, it retrieves few-shot examples from a training bank using Target Similarity Tuning (TST), a novel method for semantic example selection. TST learns to recognize utterances that describe similar target programs despite differences in surface natural language features. Then, Synchromesh feeds the examples to a pre-trained language model and samples programs using Constrained Semantic Decoding (CSD): a general framework for constraining the output to a set of valid programs in the target language. CSD leverages constraints on partial outputs to sample complete correct programs, and needs neither re-training nor fine-tuning of the language model. We evaluate our methods by synthesizing code from natural language descriptions using GPT-3 and Codex in three real-world languages: SQL queries, Vega-Lite visualizations and SMCalFlow programs. These domains showcase rich constraints that CSD is able to enforce, including syntax, scope, typing rules, and contextual logic. We observe substantial complementary gains from CSD and TST in prediction accuracy and in effectively preventing run-time errors. ",

Recent advancements of ubiquitous wearable technologies have increased the reliability of such tools in detecting and accurately estimating mental states (e.g., mood, stress, etc.), offering comprehensive and continuous monitoring of individuals over time. Previous attempts to model an individual's mental state were limited to subjective approaches or the inclusion of only a few modalities (i.e., phone, watch). Thus, the goal of our study was to investigate the capacity to more accurately predict affect through a fully automatic and objective approach using multiple commercial devices. Longitudinal physiological data and daily assessments of emotions were collected from a sample of college students using smart wearables and phones for over a year. Results showed that our model was able to predict next-day affect with accuracy comparable to state of the art methods. ",

Typical applications of the Linear Threshold Model assume that thresholds are either the same for all network nodes or randomly distributed, even though some people may be more susceptible to peer pressure than others. To address individual-level differences, we propose causal inference methods for estimating individual thresholds that can more accurately predict whether and when individuals will be affected by their peers. We introduce the concept of heterogeneous peer effects and develop a Structural Causal Model which corresponds to the Linear Threshold Model and supports heterogeneous peer effect identification and estimation. We develop two algorithms for individual threshold estimation, one based on causal trees and one based on causal meta-learners. Our experimental results on synthetic and real-world datasets show that our proposed models can better predict individual-level thresholds in the Linear Threshold Model and thus more precisely predict which nodes will get activated over time.

    "abstract": "This paper studies the multi-agent resource allocation problem in vehicular networks using non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) and network slicing. To ensure heterogeneous service requirements for different vehicles, we propose a network slicing architecture. We focus on a non-cellular network scenario where vehicles communicate by the broadcast approach via the direct device-to-device interface. In such a vehicular network, resource allocation among vehicles is very difficult, mainly due to (i) the rapid variation of wireless channels among highly mobile vehicles and (ii) the lack of a central coordination point. Thus, the possibility of acquiring instantaneous channel state information to perform centralized resource allocation is precluded. The resource allocation problem considered is therefore very complex. It includes not only the usual spectrum and power allocation, but also coverage selection (which target vehicles to broadcast to) and packet selection (which network slice to use). This problem must be solved jointly since selected packets can be overlaid using NOMA and therefore spectrum and power must be carefully allocated for better vehicle coverage. To do so, we provide a optimization approach and study the NP-hardness of the problem. Then, we model the problem using multi-agent Markov decision process. Finally, we use a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approach to solve the problem. The proposed DRL algorithm is practical because it can be implemented in an online and distributed manner. We show that our approach is robust and efficient when faced with different variations of the network parameters and compared to centralized benchmarks. ",

However, companies are similar across a variety of dimensions that should be leveraged in relevant prediction problems. This is particularly true for large, complex organizations which may not be well defined by a single industry and have no clear peers. To enable prediction using company information across a variety of dimensions, we create an embedding of company stocks, Stock2Vec, which can be easily added to any prediction model that applies to companies with associated stock prices. We describe the process of creating this rich vector representation from stock price fluctuations, and characterize what the dimensions represent. We then conduct comprehensive experiments to evaluate this embedding in applied machine learning problems in various business contexts. Our experiment results demonstrate that the four features in the Stock2Vec embedding can readily augment existing cross-company models and enhance cross-company predictions. ",

However, the cumbersome analysis and description make the naive method challenging to adapt to the increasingly complex hierarchical tree problems. To improve the efficiency of hierarchical tree research, we propose an embeddable matrix representation for hierarchical trees, called Generation Matrix. It can transform the abstract hierarchical tree into a concrete matrix representation and then take the hierarchical tree as a whole to study, which dramatically reduces the complexity of research. Mathematical analysis shows that Generation Matrix can simulate various recursive algorithms without accessing local structures and provides a variety of interpretable matrix operations to support the research of hierarchical trees. Applying Generation Matrix to differential privacy hierarchical tree release, we propose a Generation Matrix-based optimally consistent release algorithm (GMC). It provides an exceptionally concise process description so that we can describe its core steps as a simple matrix expression rather than multiple complicated recursive processes like existing algorithms. Our experiments show that GMC takes only a few seconds to complete a release for large-scale datasets with more than 10 million nodes.

Spatial crowdsourcing (SC)-servers (such as offered by DiDi, MeiTuan and Uber) assign different tasks based on workers' location information.However, SC-servers are often untrustworthy and have the threat of revealing workers' privacy. In this paper, we introduce a framework Geo-MOEA (Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithm) to protect location privacy of workers involved on SC platform in 5G environment. We propose an adaptive regionalized obfuscation mechanism with inference error bounds based on geo-indistinguishability (a strong notion of differential privacy), which is suitable for the context of large-scale location data and task allocations. This offers locally generated pseudo-locations of workers to be reported instead of their actual locations.Further, to optimize the trade-off between SC service availability and privacy protection, we utilize MOEA to improve the global applicability of the mechanism in 5G environment. Finally, by simulating the location scenario, the visual results on experiments show that the mechanism can not only protect location privacy, but also achieve high availability of services as desired.

Our main results establish the Pareto frontier of the tradeoff between privacy (preventing the adversary from inferring reviewer identity) and utility (accepting better papers), and design explicit computationally-efficient algorithms that we prove are Pareto optimal.

    "title": "Learning Deep Semantic Model for Code Search using CodeSearchNet Corpus",
    "abstract": "Semantic code search is the task of retrieving relevant code snippet given a natural language query. Different from typical information retrieval tasks, code search requires to bridge the semantic gap between the programming language and natural language, for better describing intrinsic concepts and semantics. Recently, deep neural network for code search has been a hot research topic. Typical methods for neural code search first represent the code snippet and query text as separate embeddings, and then use vector distance (e.g. dot-product or cosine) to calculate the semantic similarity between them. There exist many different ways for aggregating the variable length of code or query tokens into a learnable embedding, including bi-encoder, cross-encoder, and poly-encoder. The goal of the query encoder and code encoder is to produce embeddings that are close with each other for a related pair of query and the corresponding desired code snippet, in which the choice and design of encoder is very significant. In this paper, we propose a novel deep semantic model which makes use of the utilities of not only the multi-modal sources, but also feature extractors such as self-attention, the aggregated vectors, combination of the intermediate representations. We apply the proposed model to tackle the CodeSearchNet challenge about semantic code search. We align cross-lingual embedding for multi-modality learning with large batches and hard example mining, and combine different learned representations for better enhancing the representation learning. Our model is trained on CodeSearchNet corpus and evaluated on the held-out data, the final model achieves 0.384 NDCG and won the first place in this benchmark.

    "abstract": "Hypergraphs offer flexible and robust data representations for many applications, but methods that work directly on hypergraphs are not readily available and tend to be prohibitively expensive. Much of the current analysis of hypergraphs relies on first performing a graph expansion -- either based on the nodes (clique expansion), or on the edges (line graph) -- and then running standard graph analytics on the resulting representative graph. However, this approach suffers from massive space complexity and high computational cost with increasing hypergraph size. Here, we present efficient, parallel algorithms to accelerate and reduce the memory footprint of higher-order graph expansions of hypergraphs. Our results focus on the edge-based $s$-line graph expansion, but the methods we develop work for higher-order clique expansions as well. To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first framework to enable hypergraph spectral analysis of a large dataset on a single shared-memory machine. Our methods enable the analysis of datasets from many domains that previous graph-expansion-based models are unable to provide. The proposed $s$-line graph computation algorithms are orders of magnitude faster than state-of-the-art sparse general matrix-matrix multiplication methods, and obtain approximately $5-31{\\times}$ speedup over a prior state-of-the-art heuristic-based algorithm for $s$-line graph computation.

In this paper, we propose an extensive form perfect information game to model interactions and optimal city resource allocations when a Terrorist Organization (TO) performs attacks on multiple targets across two conceptual SC levels, a physical, and a cyber-social. The Smart City Defense Game (SCDG) considers three players that initially are entitled to a specific finite budget. Two SC agencies that have to defend their physical or social territories respectively, fight against a common enemy, the TO. Each layer consists of multiple targets and the attack outcome depends on whether the resources allocated there by the associated agency, exceed or not the TO's. Each player's utility is equal to the number of successfully defended targets. The two agencies are allowed to make budget transfers provided that it is beneficial for both. We completely characterize the Sub-game Perfect Nash Equilibrium (SPNE) of the SCDG that consists of strategies for optimal resource exchanges between SC agencies and accounts for the TO's budget allocation across the physical and social targets. Also, we present numerical and comparative results demonstrating that when the SC players act according to the SPNE, they maximize the number of successfully defended targets. The SCDG is shown to be a promising solution for modeling critical resource allocations between SC parties in the face of multi-layer simultaneous terrorist attacks. ",

    "abstract": "Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) have recently attracted vast interest and achieved state-of-the-art performance on graphs, but its success could typically hinge on careful training with amounts of expensive and time-consuming labeled data. To alleviate labeled data scarcity, self-training methods have been widely adopted on graphs by labeling high-confidence unlabeled nodes and then adding them to the training step. In this line, we empirically make a thorough study for current self-training methods on graphs. Surprisingly, we find that high-confidence unlabeled nodes are not always useful, and even introduce the distribution shift issue between the original labeled dataset and the augmented dataset by self-training, severely hindering the capability of self-training on graphs. To this end, in this paper, we propose a novel Distribution Recovered Graph Self-Training framework (DR-GST), which could recover the distribution of the original labeled dataset. Specifically, we first prove the equality of loss function in self-training framework under the distribution shift case and the population distribution if each pseudo-labeled node is weighted by a proper coefficient. Considering the intractability of the coefficient, we then propose to replace the coefficient with the information gain after observing the same changing trend between them, where information gain is respectively estimated via both dropout variational inference and dropedge variational inference in DR-GST. However, such a weighted loss function will enlarge the impact of incorrect pseudo labels. As a result, we apply the loss correction method to improve the quality of pseudo labels. Both our theoretical analysis and extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed DR-GST, as well as each well-designed component in DR-GST. ",

    "abstract": "Security in the fifth generation (5G) networks has become one of the prime concerns in the telecommunication industry. 5G security challenges come from the fact that 5G networks involve different stakeholders using different security requirements and measures. Deficiencies in security management between these stakeholders can lead to security attacks. Therefore, security solutions should be conceived for the safe deployment of different 5G verticals (e.g., industry 4.0, Internet of Things (IoT), etc.). The interdependencies among 5G and fully connected systems, such as IoT, entail some standard security requirements, namely integrity, availability, and confidentiality. In this article, we propose a hierarchical architecture for securing 5G enabled IoT networks, and a security model for the prediction and detection of False Data Injection Attacks (FDIA) and Distributed Denial of Service attacks (DDoS). The proposed security model is based on a Markov stochastic process, which is used to observe the behavior of each network device, and employ a range-based behavior sifting policy. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed architecture and model in detecting and predicting FDIA and DDoS attacks in the context of 5G enabled IoT. ",

The 5G technologies are expected to foresee demands of diverse vertical applications with diverse requirements including high traffic volume, massive connectivity, high quality of service, and low latency.

However, these technologies raise several issues regarding transparency, decentralization, and reliability. Furthermore, 5G networks are expected to connect many heterogeneous devices and machines which will raise several security concerns regarding users' confidentiality, data privacy, and trustworthiness. To work seamlessly and securely in such scenarios, future 5G networks need to deploy smarter and more efficient security functions. Motivated by the aforementioned issues, blockchain was proposed by researchers to overcome 5G issues because of its capacities to ensure transparency, data reliability, trustworthiness, immutability in a distributed environment. Indeed, blockchain has gained momentum as a novel technology that gives rise to a plethora of new decentralized technologies.

    "abstract": "Learning a powerful representation from point clouds is a fundamental and challenging problem in the field of computer vision. Different from images where RGB pixels are stored in the regular grid, for point clouds, the underlying semantic and structural information of point clouds is the spatial layout of the points. Moreover, the properties of challenging in-context and background noise pose more challenges to point cloud analysis. One assumption is that the poor performance of the classification model can be attributed to the indistinguishable embedding feature that impedes the search for the optimal classifier. This work offers a new strategy for learning powerful representations via a contrastive learning approach that can be embedded into any point cloud classification network. First, we propose a supervised contrastive classification method to implement embedding feature distribution refinement by improving the intra-class compactness and inter-class separability. Second, to solve the confusion problem caused by small inter-class compactness and inter-class separability. Second, to solve the confusion problem caused by small inter-class variations between some similar-looking categories, we propose a confusion-prone class mining strategy to alleviate the confusion effect. Finally, considering that outliers of the sample clusters in the embedding space may cause performance degradation, we design an entropy-aware attention module with information entropy theory to identify the outlier cases and the unstable samples by measuring the uncertainty of predicted probability. The results of extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches by achieving 82.9% accuracy on the real-world ScanObjectNN dataset and substantial performance gains up to 2.9% in DCGNN, 3.1% in PointNet++, and 2.4% in GBNet.

The idea of ensemble learning is to assemble diverse models or multiple predictions and, thus, boost prediction performance. However, it is still an open question to what extent as well as which ensemble learning strategies are beneficial in deep learning based medical image classification pipelines. In this work, we proposed a reproducible medical image classification pipeline for analyzing the performance impact of the following ensemble learning techniques: Augmenting, Stacking, and Bagging. The pipeline consists of state-of-the-art preprocessing and image augmentation methods as well as 9 deep convolution neural network architectures. It was applied on four popular medical imaging datasets with varying complexity. Furthermore, 12 pooling functions for combining multiple predictions were analyzed, ranging from simple statistical functions like unweighted averaging up to more complex learning-based functions like support vector machines. Our results revealed that Stacking achieved the largest performance gain of up to 13% F1-score increase. Augmenting showed consistent improvement capabilities by up to 4% and is also applicable to single model based pipelines. Cross-validation based Bagging demonstrated to be the most complex ensemble learning method, which resulted in an F1-score decrease in all analyzed datasets (up to -10%). Furthermore, we demonstrated that simple statistical pooling functions are equal or often even better than more complex pooling functions. We concluded that the integration of Stacking and Augmentation ensemble learning techniques is a powerful method for any medical image classification pipeline to improve robustness and boost performance.

We formulate a 2D MACC coded caching model, formed by a server containing $N$ files, $K_1\\times K_2$ cache-nodes with limited memory $M$ which are placed on a grid with $K_1$ rows and $K_2$ columns, and $K_1\\times K_2$ cache-less users such that each user is connected to $L^2$ nearby cache-nodes. More precisely, for each row (or column), every user can access $L$ consecutive cache-nodes, referred to as row (or column) 1D MACC problem in the 2D MACC model. The server is connected to the users through an error-free shared link, while the users can retrieve the cached content of the connected cache-nodes without cost. Our objective is to minimize the worst-case transmission load among all possible users' demands. In this paper, we propose a baseline scheme which directly extends an existing 1D MACC scheme to the 2D model by using a Minimum Distance Separable (MDS) code, and two improved schemes. In the first scheme referred to as grouping scheme, which works when $K_1$ and $K_2$ are divisible by $L$, we partition the cache-nodes and users into $L^2$ groups according to their positions, such that no two users in the same group share any cache-node, and we utilize the seminal shared-link coded caching scheme proposed by Maddah-Ali and Niesen for each group. Subsequently, for any model parameters satisfying $\\min\\{K_1,K_2\\}>L$ we propose the second scheme, referred to as hybrid scheme, consisting in a highly non-trivial way to construct a 2D MACC scheme through a vertical and a horizontal 1D MACC schemes.

Although previous works did utilize images/videos to detect this disorder, none have explicitly focused on the eyes. Most of them require the entire face. One obvious advantage of having an eye-focused detection system is that subjects' anonymity is not at risk. Also, our AI decisions based on simple blinking patterns make them explainable and straightforward. Specifically, we develop a novel feature called blink similarity, which measures the similarity between the two blinking patterns. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed feature is quite robust, for it helps in Bell's Palsy detection even with very few labels. Our proposed eye-focused detection system is not only cheaper but also more convenient than several existing methods. ",

Since frauds, churns and defaults happen less frequently, the datasets for these problems turn out to be naturally highly unbalanced. Consequently, all supervised machine learning classifiers tend to yield substantial false-positive rates when trained on such unbalanced datasets. We propose two ways of data balancing. In the first, we propose an oversampling method to generate synthetic samples of minority class using Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). We employ Vanilla GAN [1], Wasserstein GAN [2] and CTGAN [3] separately to oversample the minority class samples. In order to assess the efficacy of our proposed approach, we use a host of machine learning classifiers, including Random Forest, Decision Tree, support vector machine (SVM), and Logistic Regression on the data balanced by GANs. In the second method, we introduce a hybrid method to handle data imbalance. In this second way, we utilize the power of undersampling and over-sampling together by augmenting the synthetic minority class data oversampled by GAN with the undersampled majority class data obtained by one-class support vigor machine (OCSVM) [4]. We combine both over-sampled data generated by GAN and the data under-sampled by OCSVM [4] and pass the resultant data to classifiers. When we compared our results to those of Farquad et al.

    "abstract": "Generative models for graphs have been actively studied for decades, and they have a wide range of applications. Recently, learning-based graph generation that reproduces real-world graphs has gradually attracted the attention of many researchers. Several generative models that utilize modern machine learning technologies have been proposed, though a conditional generation of general graphs is less explored in the field. In this paper, we propose a generative model that allows us to tune a value of a global-level structural feature as a condition. Our model called GraphTune enables to tune a value of any structural feature of generated graphs using Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) and Conditional Variational AutoEncoder (CVAE). We performed comparative evaluations of GraphTune and conventional models with a real graph dataset. The evaluations show that GraphTune enables to clearly tune a value of a global-level structural feature compared to the conventional models. ",

    "abstract": "We present in-hand manipulation skills on a dexterous, compliant, anthropomorphic hand. Even though these skills were derived in a simplistic manner, they exhibit surprising robustness to variations in shape, size, weight, and placement of the manipulated object. They are also very insensitive to variation of execution speeds, ranging from highly dynamic to quasi-static. The robustness of the skills leads to compositional properties that enable extended and robust manipulation programs. To explain the surprising robustness of the in-hand manipulation skills, we performed a detailed, empirical analysis of the skills' performance. From this analysis, we identify three principles for skill design: 1) Exploiting the hardware's innate ability to drive hard-to-model contact dynamics. 2) Taking actions to constrain these interactions, funneling the system into a narrow set of possibilities. 3) Composing such action sequences into complex manipulation programs. We believe that these principles constitute an important foundation for robust robotic in-hand manipulation, and possibly for manipulation in general. ",

These CNN models frequently rely on vast amounts of labeled data for training, difficult to obtain, especially for rare diseases. Furthermore, a deep learning system trained on a data set with only one or a few diseases cannot detect other diseases, limiting the system's practical use in disease identification. We have introduced an unsupervised approach for detecting anomalies in retinal images to overcome this issue. We have proposed a simple, memory efficient, easy to train method which followed a multi-step training technique that incorporated autoencoder training and Multi-Scale Deep Feature Sparse Coding (MDFSC), an extended version of normal sparse coding, to accommodate diverse types of retinal datasets.

One of the most challenging problems for graph-based semi-supervised node classification is how to use the implicit information among various data to improve the performance of classifying. Traditional studies on graph-based semi-supervised learning have focused on the pairwise connections among data. However, the data correlation in real applications could be beyond pairwise and more complicated. The density information has been demonstrated to be an important clue, but it is rarely explored in depth among existing graph-based semi-supervised node classification methods. To develop a flexible and effective model for graph-based semi-supervised node classification, we propose a novel Density-Aware Hyper-Graph Neural Networks (DA-HGNN). In our proposed approach, hyper-graph is provided to explore the high-order semantic correlation among data, and a density-aware hyper-graph attention network is presented to explore the high-order connection relationship. Extensive experiments are conducted in various benchmark datasets, and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. ",

Unlike the worst-case approach, the present method provides upper and lower bounds for the mean and standard deviation of compliance as well as the optimized topological layouts of a structure for various scenarios. In the proposed approach, the imprecise random field variables are determined utilizing parameterized p-boxes with different confidence intervals. The Karhunen-Lo\\`eve (K-L) expansion is extended to provide a spectral description of the imprecise random field. The linear superposition method in conjunction with a linear combination of orthogonal functions is employed to obtain explicit mathematical expressions for the first and second order statistical moments of the structural compliance. Then, an interval sensitivity analysis is carried out, applying the Orthogonal Similarity Transformation (OST) method with the boundaries of each of the intermediate variable searched efficiently at every iteration using a Combinatorial Approach (CA). Finally, the validity, accuracy, and applicability of the work are rigorously checked by comparing the outputs of the proposed approach with those obtained using the particle swarm optimization (PSO) and Quasi-Monte-Carlo Simulation (QMCS) methods. Three different numerical examples with imprecise random field loads are presented to show the effectiveness and feasibility of the study. ",

    "abstract": "Adversarial examples have posed a severe threat to deep neural networks due to their transferable nature. Currently, various works have paid great efforts to enhance the cross-model transferability, which mostly assume the substitute model is trained in the same domain as the target model. However, in reality, the relevant information of the deployed model is unlikely to leak. Hence, it is vital to build a more practical black-box threat model to overcome this limitation and evaluate the vulnerability of deployed models. In this paper, with only the knowledge of the ImageNet domain, we propose a Beyond ImageNet Attack (BIA) to investigate the transferability towards black-box domains (unknown classification tasks). Specifically, we leverage a generative model to learn the adversarial function for disrupting low-level features of input images. Based on this framework, we further propose two variants to narrow the gap between the source and target domains from the data and model perspectives, respectively. Extensive experiments on coarse-grained and fine-grained domains demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed methods. Notably, our methods outperform state-of-the-art approaches by up to 7.71\\% (towards coarse-grained domains) and 25.91\\% (towards fine-grained domains) on average.

However, fine tuning such models requires a large number of training examples for each target task. Simultaneously, many realistic NLP problems are \"few shot\", without a sufficiently large training set. In this work, we propose a novel conditional neural process-based approach for few-shot text classification that learns to transfer from other diverse tasks with rich annotation. Our key idea is to represent each task using gradient information from a base model and to train an adaptation network that modulates a text classifier conditioned on the task representation. While previous task-aware few-shot learners represent tasks by input encoding, our novel task representation is more powerful, as the gradient captures input-output relationships of a task. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms traditional fine-tuning, sequential transfer learning, and state-of-the-art meta learning approaches on a collection of diverse few-shot tasks. We further conducted analysis and ablations to justify our design choices. ",

    "abstract": "We consider Time-to-Live (TTL) caches that tag every object in cache with a specific (and possibly renewable) expiration time. State-of-the-art models for TTL caches assume zero object fetch delay, i.e., the time required to fetch a requested object that is not in cache from a different cache or the origin server. Particularly, in cache hierarchies, this delay has a significant impact on performance metrics such as the object hit probability. Recent work suggests that the impact of the object fetch delay on the cache performance will continue to increase due to the scaling mismatch between shrinking inter-request times (due to higher data center link rates) in contrast to processing and memory access times. In this paper, we analyze tree-based cache hierarchies with random object fetch delays and provide an exact analysis of the corresponding object hit probability. Our analysis allows understanding the impact of random delays and TTLs on cache metrics for a wide class of request stream models characterized through Markov arrival processes. This is expressed through a metric that we denote delay impairment of the hit probability. In addition, we analyze and extend state-of-the-art approximations of the hit probability to take the delay into account. We provide numerical and trace-based simulation-based evaluation results showing that larger TTLs do not efficiently compensate for the detrimental effect of object fetch delays. Our evaluations also show that unlike our exact model the state-of-the-art approximations do not capture the impact of the object fetch delay well especially for cache hierarchies. Surprisingly, we show that the impact of this delay on the hit probability is not monotonic but depends on the request stream properties, as well as, the TTL. ",

Our proposed models perform either microscopic or macroscopic edits to the input graph while training GNNs and learn node embeddings that are both accurate and fair under the context of link recommendations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on four real world datasets and show that we can improve the recommendation fairness by several factors at negligible cost to link prediction accuracy.

We implemented a robot controller able to vary these factors and explored how this variation impacted on people's perception. Results from a within-participants study involving 23 participants show that people prefer a robot rotating its body when crossing them. Additionally, a sliding motion is rated as being warmer.

This work shows that single and multi objective stances can be synergistically combined to better answer the transit network design problem (TNDP). Single objective formulations are dynamically inferred from the rating of networks in the approximated (multi-objective) Pareto Front, where a regression approach is used to infer the optimal weights of transfer needs, times, distances, coverage, and costs. As a guiding case study, the solution is applied to the multimodal public transport network in the city of Lisbon, Portugal. The system takes individual trip data given by smartcard validations at CARRIS buses and METRO subway stations and uses them to estimate the origin-destination demand in the city. Then, Genetic Algorithms are used, considering both single and multi objective approaches, to redesign the bus network that better fits the observed traffic demand. The proposed TNDP optimization proved to improve results, with reductions in objective functions of up to 28.3%. The system managed to extensively reduce the number of routes, and all passenger related objectives, including travel time and transfers per trip, significantly improve. Grounded on automated fare collection data, the system can incrementally redesign the bus network to dynamically handle ongoing changes to the city traffic. ",

This means that an IDS would only be able to detect an attack after it has been executed on the system under attack and might have caused damage to the system. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end early intrusion detection system to prevent network attacks before they could cause any more damage to the system under attack while preventing unforeseen downtime and interruption.

In this paper, we study such a new sequential pattern mining problem and propose a corresponding efficient sequential miner with novel strategies to prune search space efficiently. Experiments on both real and synthetic data show the utility of our approach. ",

We propose bit-serial weight pools, an end-to-end framework that includes network compression and acceleration of arbitrary sub-byte precision. The framework can achieve up to 8x compression compared to 8-bit networks by sharing a pool of weights across the entire network. We further propose a bit-serial lookup based software implementation that allows runtime-bitwidth tradeoff and is able to achieve more than 2.8x speedup and 7.5x storage compression compared to 8-bit weight pool networks, with less than 1% accuracy drop.

    "abstract": "From the point of view of the human brain, continual learning can perform various tasks without mutual interference. An effective way to reduce mutual interference can be found in sparsity and selectivity of neurons. According to Aljundi et al. and Hadsell et al., imposing sparsity at the representational level is advantageous for continual learning because sparse neuronal activations encourage less overlap between parameters, resulting in less interference. Similarly, highly selective neural networks are likely to induce less interference since particular response in neurons will reduce the chance of overlap with other parameters. Considering that the human brain performs continual learning over the lifespan, finding conditions where sparsity and selectivity naturally arises may provide insight for understanding how the brain functions. This paper investigates various conditions that naturally increase sparsity and selectivity in a neural network. This paper tested different optimizers with Hoyer's sparsity metric and CCMAS selectivity metric in MNIST classification task. It is essential to note that investigations on the natural occurrence of sparsity and selectivity concerning various conditions have not been acknowledged in any sector of neuroscience nor machine learning until this day. This paper found that particular conditions increase sparsity and selectivity such as applying a large learning rate and lowering a batch size. In addition to the relationship between the condition, sparsity, and selectivity, the following will be discussed based on empirical analysis: 1. The relationship between sparsity and selectivity and 2. The relationship between test accuracy, sparsity, and selectivity. ",

The proposed method is a parametric modeling technique that is based on sequential learning and sparse regularization. The dynamics are categorized into two parts: linear evolution and nonlinear forcing. The former advances the dynamical system in time on an embedded manifold, while the latter causes divergent behaviors in temporal evolution, such as bursting and switching.

While past work has modeled (dis)agreement in social networks using signed graphs, these approaches have not modeled agreement patterns across a range of correlated topics. For instance, disagreement on one topic may make disagreement(or agreement) more likely for related topics. We propose the Stance Embeddings Model(SEM), which jointly learns embeddings for each user and topic in signed social graphs with distinct edge types for each topic. By jointly learning user and topic embeddings, SEM is able to perform cold-start topic stance detection, predicting the stance of a user on topics for which we have not observed their engagement. We demonstrate the effectiveness of SEM using two large-scale Twitter signed graph datasets we open-source. One dataset, TwitterSG, labels (dis)agreements using engagements between users via tweets to derive topic-informed, signed edges. The other, BirdwatchSG, leverages community reports on misinformation and misleading content. On TwitterSG and BirdwatchSG, SEM shows a 39% and 26% error reduction respectively against strong baselines. ",

The core idea behind the proposed approach is to split the time-series at an arbitrary point and estimate the ratio of densities of distribution (using a parametric model such as a neural network) before and after the split point. The DRE-CUSUM change detection statistic is then derived from the cumulative sum (CUSUM) of the logarithm of the estimated density ratio. We present a theoretical justification as well as accuracy guarantees which show that the proposed statistic can reliably detect statistical changes, irrespective of the split point. While there have been prior works on using density ratio based methods for change detection, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first unsupervised change detection approach with a theoretical justification and accuracy guarantees. The simplicity of the proposed framework makes it readily applicable in various practical settings (including high-dimensional time-series data); we also discuss generalizations for online change detection. We experimentally show the superiority of DRE-CUSUM using both synthetic and real-world datasets over existing state-of-the-art unsupervised algorithms (such as Bayesian online change detection, its variants as well as several other heuristic methods).

Most previous work focuses on designing heuristic rules or distance metrics to check whether a state is novel without considering such a discrimination process that can be learned. In this paper, we propose a novel method called generative adversarial exploration (GAEX) to encourage exploration in RL via introducing an intrinsic reward output from a generative adversarial network, where the generator provides fake samples of states that help discriminator identify those less frequently visited states. Thus the agent is encouraged to visit those states which the discriminator is less confident to judge as visited. GAEX is easy to implement and of high training efficiency. In our experiments, we apply GAEX into DQN and the DQN-GAEX algorithm achieves convincing performance on challenging exploration problems, including the game Venture, Montezuma's Revenge and Super Mario Bros, without further fine-tuning on complicate learning algorithms. To our knowledge, this is the first work to employ GAN in RL exploration problems. ",

Compared to supervised learning that leverages high-quality labeled datasets to achieve good performance, self-supervised learning relies on unlabeled datasets to pre-train powerful encoders which can then be treated as feature extractors for various downstream tasks. The huge amount of data and computational resources consumption makes the encoders themselves become a valuable intellectual property of the model owner. Recent research has shown that the ML model's copyright is threatened by model stealing attacks, which aims to train a surrogate model to mimic the behavior of a given model. We empirically show that pre-trained encoders are highly vulnerable to model stealing attacks. However, most of the current efforts of copyright protection algorithms such as fingerprinting and watermarking concentrate on classifiers. Meanwhile, the intrinsic challenges of pre-trained encoder's copyright protection remain largely unstudied. We fill the gap by proposing SSLGuard, the first watermarking algorithm for pre-trained encoders. Given a clean pre-trained encoder, SSLGuard embeds a watermark into it and outputs a watermarked version. The shadow training technique is also applied to preserve the watermark under potential model stealing attacks. Our extensive evaluation shows that SSLGuard is effective in watermark injection and verification, and is robust against model stealing and other watermark removal attacks such as pruning and finetuning.

Currently, the mean field variational Bayesian framework is the de facto methodology used by the existing methods, in which the unconstrained inference step is often implemented by a message passing neural network. However, such formulation fails to explore other inference strategies, and largely ignores the more general constrained optimization models. In this paper, we present a constrained structure learning method, for which an explicit constrained variational inference objective is proposed. Instead of applying the ubiquitous message-passing strategy, a generic constrained optimization method - entropic mirror descent - is utilized to solve the constrained variational inference step. We validate the proposed generic model on various popular scene graph generation benchmarks and show that it outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. ",

Graves generates a graph representation of a program from which a GNN predicts a score for a verifier that indicates its performance on the program. We evaluate Graves on a set of 10 verification tools and over 8000 verification problems and find that it improves the state-of-the-art in verification algorithm selection by 11\\%. We conjecture this is in part due to Graves' use of GNNs with attention mechanisms.

Through a dynamical systems lens, we overcome challenges associated with hierarchy, and establish implicit regularization towards low hierarchical tensor rank. This translates to an implicit regularization towards locality for the associated convolutional networks.

With the increasing computational power, current protein language models pre-trained with millions of diverse sequences can advance the parameter scale from million-level to billion-level and achieve remarkable improvement.

We construct a novel large-scale knowledge graph that consists of GO and its related proteins, and gene annotation texts or protein sequences describe all nodes in the graph. We propose novel contrastive learning with knowledge-aware negative sampling to jointly optimize the knowledge graph and protein embedding during pre-training.

    "abstract": "The prediction of energetically stable crystal structures formed by a given chemical composition is a central problem in solid-state physics. In principle, the crystalline state of assembled atoms can be determined by optimizing the energy surface, which in turn can be evaluated using first-principles calculations. However, performing the iterative gradient descent on the potential energy surface using first-principles calculations is prohibitively expensive for complex systems, such as those with many atoms per unit cell. Here, we present a unique methodology for crystal structure prediction (CSP) that relies on a machine learning algorithm called metric learning. It is shown that a binary classifier, trained on a large number of already identified crystal structures, can determine the isomorphism of crystal structures formed by two given chemical compositions with an accuracy of approximately 96.4\\%. For a given query composition with an unknown crystal structure, the model is used to automatically select from a crystal structure database a set of template crystals with nearly identical stable structures to which element substitution is to be applied. Apart from the local relaxation calculation of the identified templates, the proposed method does not use ab initio calculations. The potential of this substation-based CSP is demonstrated for a wide variety of crystal systems. ",

    "abstract": "Deep learning-based methods in computational microscopy have been shown to be powerful but in general face some challenges due to limited generalization to new types of samples and requirements for large and diverse training data. Here, we demonstrate a few-shot transfer learning method that helps a holographic image reconstruction deep neural network rapidly generalize to new types of samples using small datasets. We pre-trained a convolutional recurrent neural network on a large dataset with diverse types of samples, which serves as the backbone model. By fixing the recurrent blocks and transferring the rest of the convolutional blocks of the pre-trained model, we reduced the number of trainable parameters by ~90% compared with standard transfer learning, while achieving equivalent generalization. We validated the effectiveness of this approach by successfully generalizing to new types of samples using small holographic datasets for training, and achieved (i) ~2.5-fold convergence speed acceleration, (ii) ~20% computation time reduction per epoch, and (iii) improved reconstruction performance over baseline network models trained from scratch. This few-shot transfer learning approach can potentially be applied in other microscopic imaging methods, helping to generalize to new types of samples without the need for extensive training time and data.

Here, we investigate a way of improving the Multi-Frame Quality Enhancement approach. This approach consists of making use of the frames that have the peak quality in the region to improve those that have a lower quality in that region. This approach consists of obtaining quantized data from the videos using a deep belief network. The quantized data is then fed into the MF-CNN architecture to improve the compressed video. We further investigate the impact of using a Bi-LSTM for detecting the peak quality frames. Our approach obtains better results than the first approach of the MFQE which uses an SVM for PQF detection. On the other hand, our MFQE approach does not outperform the latest version of the MQFE approach that uses a Bi-LSTM for PQF detection. ",

Recently, similar concept cells were discovered in a multimodal network called CLIP (Radford et at., 2021). Here, we ask whether CLIP can explain the fMRI activity of the human hippocampus better than a purely visual (or linguistic) model. We extend our analysis to a range of publicly available uni- and multi-modal models. We demonstrate that \"multimodality\" stands out as a key component when assessing the ability of a network to explain the multivoxel activity in the hippocampus. ",

In 2018, the Italian community officially joined LOFAR project, and it deployed a distributed computing and storage infrastructure dedicated to LOFAR data analysis. The infrastructure is based on 4 nodes distributed in different Italian locations and it offers services for pipelines execution, storage of final and intermediate results and support for the use of the software and infrastructure. As the analysis of the LOw-Frequency ARray data requires a very complex computational procedure, a container-based approach has been adopted to distribute software environments to the different computing resources. A science platform approach is used to facilitate interactive access to computational resources. In this paper, we describe the architecture and main features of the infrastructure. ",

    "abstract": "An islanded inverter-based microgrid is a collection of heterogeneous DC energy resources, e.g., photovoltaic arrays, fuel cells, and energy-storage devices, interfaced to an AC distribution network and operated independently from the bulk power system. Energy conversion is typically managed by power electronics in voltage source inverters. Drawing from the control of synchronous machines in bulk power systems, different control schemes have been recently adopted in order to achieve a stable network operation. The vast majority of academic and industrial efforts opt for these strategies during real-time operation. Starting with a dynamical averaged DC/AC converter model, we review different controllers by presenting their main scope analytically and through simulations. Next, we explore a new alternative of controlling DC/AC converters in bulk power systems by matching traditional synchronous machines with emphasis on the role that DC-circuit can play in control architecture, usually neglected in conventional strategies. Compared to standard emulation methods, our controller relies solely on readily available DC-side measurements and takes into account the natural DC and AC storage elements. As a result, our controller is generally faster and less vulnerable to delays and measurement inaccuracies. We additionally provide insightful interpretations of the suggested control, various plug-and-play properties of the closed-loop, such as steady-state power flow analysis, passivity with respect to the DC and AC ports, stability proof as well as high-level control architectures contributing to enhancing the controller performance and attaining further control goals, which we illustrate in both analysis and simulation.

First, we study the properties of these filters and show that they are linear and shift-invariant, as well as permutation and orientation equivariant. These filters can also be implemented in a distributed fashion with a low computational complexity, as they involve only (multiple rounds of) simplicial shifting between upper and lower adjacent simplices. Second, focusing on edge-flows, we study the frequency responses of these filters and examine how we can use the Hodge-decomposition to delineate gradient, curl and harmonic frequencies. We discuss how these frequencies correspond to the lower- and the upper-adjacent couplings and the kernel of the Hodge Laplacian, respectively, and can be tuned independently by our filter designs. Third, we study different procedures for designing simplicial convolutional filters and discuss their relative advantages. Finally, we corroborate our simplicial filters in several applications: to extract different frequency components of a simplicial signal, to denoise edge flows, and to analyze financial markets and traffic networks.
