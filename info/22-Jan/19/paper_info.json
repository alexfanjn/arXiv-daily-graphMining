    "abstract": "Physic-Informed Neural Networks (PINN) are neural networks (NNs) that encode model equations, like Partial Differential Equations (PDE), as a component of the neural network itself. PINNs are nowadays used to solve PDEs, fractional equations, and integral-differential equations. This novel methodology has arisen as a multi-task learning framework in which a NN must fit observed data while reducing a PDE residual. This article provides a comprehensive review of the literature on PINNs: while the primary goal of the study was to characterize these networks and their related advantages and disadvantages, the review also attempts to incorporate publications on a larger variety of issues, including physics-constrained neural networks (PCNN), where the initial or boundary conditions are directly embedded in the NN structure rather than in the loss functions. The study indicates that most research has focused on customizing the PINN through different activation functions, gradient optimization techniques, neural network structures, and loss function structures. Despite the wide range of applications for which PINNs have been used, by demonstrating their ability to be more feasible in some contexts than classical numerical techniques like Finite Element Method (FEM), advancements are still possible, most notably theoretical issues that remain unresolved.

    "abstract": "The next generation of cellular networks will be characterized by softwarized, open, and disaggregated architectures exposing analytics and control knobs to enable network intelligence. How to realize this vision, however, is largely an open problem. In this paper, we take a decisive step forward by presenting and prototyping OrchestRAN, a novel orchestration framework that embraces and builds upon the Open RAN paradigm to provide a practical solution to these challenges. OrchestRAN has been designed to execute in the non-real-time RAN Intelligent Controller (RIC) and allows Network Operators (NOs) to specify high-level control/inference objectives (i.e., adapt scheduling, and forecast capacity in near-real-time for a set of base stations in Downtown New York). OrchestRAN automatically computes the optimal set of data-driven algorithms and their execution location to achieve intents specified by the NOs while meeting the desired timing requirements. We show that the problem of orchestrating intelligence in Open RAN is NP-hard, and design low-complexity solutions to support real-world applications. We prototype OrchestRAN and test it at scale on Colosseum. Our experimental results on a network with 7 base stations and 42 users demonstrate that OrchestRAN is able to instantiate data-driven services on demand with minimal control overhead and latency. ",

    "abstract": "The success of machine learning (ML) in materials property prediction depends heavily on how the materials are represented for learning. Two dominant families of material descriptors exist, one that encodes crystal structure in the representation and the other that only uses stoichiometric information with the hope of discovering new materials. Graph neural networks (GNNs) in particular have excelled in predicting material properties within chemical accuracy. However, current GNNs are limited to only one of the above two avenues owing to the little overlap between respective material representations. Here, we introduce a new concept of formula graph which unifies both stoichiometry-only and structure-based material descriptors. We further develop a self-attention integrated GNN that assimilates a formula graph and show that the proposed architecture produces material embeddings transferable between the two domains. Our model substantially outperforms previous structure-based GNNs as well as structure-agnostic counterparts while exhibiting better sample efficiency and faster convergence. Finally, the model is applied in a challenging exemplar to predict the complex dielectric function of materials and nominate new substances that potentially exhibit epsilon-near-zero phenomena. ",

However, the assumption can be approximately violated in many ways, leading to sub-optimal solutions. Although there is a line of research in Bayesian network structure learning that focuses on weakening the assumption, such as exact search methods with well-defined score functions, they do not scale well to large graphs. In this work, we introduce several strategies to improve the scalability of exact score-based methods in the linear Gaussian setting. In particular, we develop a super-structure estimation method based on the support of inverse covariance matrix which requires assumptions that are strictly weaker than faithfulness, and apply it to restrict the search space of exact search. We also propose a local search strategy that performs exact search on the local clusters formed by each variable and its neighbors within two hops in the super-structure. Numerical experiments validate the efficacy of the proposed procedure, and demonstrate that it scales up to hundreds of nodes with a high accuracy. ",

    "abstract": "Symbolic representations are a useful tool for the dimension reduction of temporal data, allowing for the efficient storage of and information retrieval from time series. They can also enhance the training of machine learning algorithms on time series data through noise reduction and reduced sensitivity to hyperparameters. The adaptive Brownian bridge-based aggregation (ABBA) method is one such effective and robust symbolic representation, demonstrated to accurately capture important trends and shapes in time series. However, in its current form the method struggles to process very large time series. Here we present a new variant of the ABBA method, called fABBA. This variant utilizes a new aggregation approach tailored to the piecewise representation of time series. By replacing the k-means clustering used in ABBA with a sorting-based aggregation technique, and thereby avoiding repeated sum-of-squares error computations, the computational complexity is significantly reduced. In contrast to the original method, the new approach does not require the number of time series symbols to be specified in advance. Through extensive tests we demonstrate that the new method significantly outperforms ABBA with a considerable reduction in runtime while also outperforming the popular SAX and 1d-SAX representations in terms of reconstruction accuracy. We further demonstrate that fABBA can compress other data types such as images. ",

    "abstract": "While Active Learning (AL) techniques are explored in Neural Machine Translation (NMT), only a few works focus on tackling low annotation budgets where a limited number of sentences can get translated. Such situations are especially challenging and can occur for endangered languages with few human annotators or having cost constraints to label large amounts of data. Although AL is shown to be helpful with large budgets, it is not enough to build high-quality translation systems in these low-resource conditions. In this work, we propose a cost-effective training procedure to increase the performance of NMT models utilizing a small number of annotated sentences and dictionary entries. Our method leverages monolingual data with self-supervised objectives and a small-scale, inexpensive dictionary for additional supervision to initialize the NMT model before applying AL. We show that improving the model using a combination of these knowledge sources is essential to exploit AL strategies and increase gains in low-resource conditions. We also present a novel AL strategy inspired by domain adaptation for NMT and show that it is effective for low budgets. We propose a new hybrid data-driven approach, which samples sentences that are diverse from the labelled data and also most similar to unlabelled data. Finally, we show that initializing the NMT model and further using our AL strategy can achieve gains of up to $13$ BLEU compared to conventional AL methods. ",

    "abstract": "Neural ordinary differential equations (NODEs) -- parametrizations of differential equations using neural networks -- have shown tremendous promise in learning models of unknown continuous-time dynamical systems from data. However, every forward evaluation of a NODE requires numerical integration of the neural network used to capture the system dynamics, making their training prohibitively expensive. Existing works rely on off-the-shelf adaptive step-size numerical integration schemes, which often require an excessive number of evaluations of the underlying dynamics network to obtain sufficient accuracy for training. By contrast, we accelerate the evaluation and the training of NODEs by proposing a data-driven approach to their numerical integration. The proposed Taylor-Lagrange NODEs (TL-NODEs) use a fixed-order Taylor expansion for numerical integration, while also learning to estimate the expansion's approximation error. As a result, the proposed approach achieves the same accuracy as adaptive step-size schemes while employing only low-order Taylor expansions, thus greatly reducing the computational cost necessary to integrate the NODE. A suite of numerical experiments, including modeling dynamical systems, image classification, and density estimation, demonstrate that TL-NODEs can be trained more than an order of magnitude faster than state-of-the-art approaches, without any loss in performance.

We use graph notation, where all possible stems are represented as vertices, and co-existence as edges. This full Stem-graph presents all possible folding structure, and we pick sub-graph(s) which give the best matching energy for folding structure prediction. We introduce a Stem-Loop score to add structure information and to speed up the computation. The proposed method can handle secondary structure prediction as well as protein folding with pseudo knots. Numerical experiments are done using a laptop and results take only a few minutes or seconds. One of the strengths of this approach is in the simplicity and flexibility of the algorithm, and it gives deterministic answer.

    "abstract": "The objective of image manipulation detection is to identify and locate the manipulated regions in the images. Recent approaches mostly adopt the sophisticated Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to capture the tampering artifacts left in the images to locate the manipulated regions. However, these approaches ignore the feature correlations, i.e., feature inconsistencies, between manipulated regions and non-manipulated regions, leading to inferior detection performance. To address this issue, we propose a hierarchical Graph Convolutional Network (HGCN-Net), which consists of two parallel branches: the backbone network branch and the hierarchical graph representation learning (HGRL) branch for image manipulation detection. Specifically, the feature maps of a given image are extracted by the backbone network branch, and then the feature correlations within the feature maps are modeled as a set of fully-connected graphs for learning the hierarchical graph representation by the HGRL branch. The learned hierarchical graph representation can sufficiently capture the feature correlations across different scales, and thus it provides high discriminability for distinguishing manipulated and non-manipulated regions. Extensive experiments on four public datasets demonstrate that the proposed HGCN-Net not only provides promising detection accuracy, but also achieves strong robustness under a variety of common image attacks in the task of image manipulation detection, compared to the state-of-the-arts.

    "abstract": "Action recognition is a key algorithmic part of emerging on-the-edge smart video surveillance and security systems. Skeleton-based action recognition is an attractive approach which, instead of using RGB pixel data, relies on human pose information to classify appropriate actions. However, existing algorithms often assume ideal conditions that are not representative of real-world limitations, such as noisy input, latency requirements, and edge resource constraints. To address the limitations of existing approaches, this paper presents Real-World Graph Convolution Networks (RW-GCNs), an architecture-level solution for meeting the domain constraints of Real World Skeleton-based Action Recognition. Inspired by the presence of feedback connections in the human visual cortex, RW-GCNs leverage attentive feedback augmentation on existing near state-of-the-art (SotA) Spatial-Temporal Graph Convolution Networks (ST-GCNs). The ST-GCNs' design choices are derived from information theory-centric principles to address both the spatial and temporal noise typically encountered in end-to-end real-time and on-the-edge smart video systems. Our results demonstrate RW-GCNs' ability to serve these applications by achieving a new SotA accuracy on the NTU-RGB-D-120 dataset at 94.1%, and achieving 32X less latency than baseline ST-GCN applications while still achieving 90.4% accuracy on the Northwestern UCLA dataset in the presence of spatial keypoint noise. RW-GCNs further show system scalability by running on the 10X cost effective NVIDIA Jetson Nano (as opposed to NVIDIA Xavier NX), while still maintaining a respectful range of throughput (15.6 to 5.5 Actions per Second) on the resource constrained device.

The goal is to design an allocation mechanism such that each worker is incentivized to invite her neighbours to join the allocation, although they are competing for the task. Moreover, the performance of each worker is uncertain, which is modelled as the quality level of her task execution. The literature has proposed solutions to tackle the uncertainty problem by paying them after verifying their execution. Here, we extend the problem to the network setting. The challenge is that the requester relies on the workers to invite each other to find the best worker, and the performance of each worker is also unknown to the task requester. In this paper, we propose a new mechanism to solve the two challenges at the same time. The mechanism guarantees that inviting more workers and reporting/performing according to her true ability is a dominant strategy for each worker. We believe that the new solution can be widely applied in the digital economy powered by social connections such as crowdsourcing and contests. ",

This study covers a variety of comparisons from mathematical comparisons, visualization in the differential domain for backpropagation, loss convergence in the training process, and anomaly detection performance. In an overall view, LMSE is superior to the existing MSE function in terms of strongness of loss convergence, anomaly detection performance.

FAIRIF can be applied on a wide range of models trained by stochastic gradient descent without changing the model, while only requiring group annotations on a small validation set to compute sample weights. Theoretically, we show that, in the classification setting, three notions of disparity among different groups can be mitigated by training with the weights. Experiments on synthetic data sets demonstrate that FAIRIF yields models with better fairness-utility trade-offs against various types of bias; and on real-world data sets, we show the effectiveness and scalability of FAIRIF.

To address this problem, in this paper, we propose a novel stratified client selection scheme to reduce the variance for the pursuit of better convergence and higher accuracy. Specifically, to mitigate the impact of heterogeneity, we develop stratification based on clients' local data distribution to derive approximate homogeneous strata for better selection in each stratum. Concentrating on a limited sampling ratio scenario, we next present an optimized sample size allocation scheme by considering the diversity of stratum's variability, with the promise of further variance reduction. Theoretically, we elaborate the explicit relation among different selection schemes with regard to variance, under heterogeneous settings, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our selection scheme.

This kind of methods attempts to learn one hash function for both the query and database samples in a symmetric way.

In this paper, we propose a novel deep hashing method, named asymmetric hash code learning (AHCL), for RSIR. The proposed AHCL generates the hash codes of query and database images in an asymmetric way. In more detail, the hash codes of query images are obtained by binarizing the output of the network, while the hash codes of database images are directly learned by solving the designed objective function. In addition, we combine the semantic information of each image and the similarity information of pairs of images as supervised information to train a deep hashing network, which improves the representation ability of deep features and hash codes. The experimental results on three public datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms symmetric methods in terms of retrieval accuracy and efficiency.

    "abstract": "Learning from different data views by exploring the underlying complementary information among them can endow the representation with stronger expressive ability. However, high-dimensional features tend to contain noise, and furthermore, the quality of data usually varies for different samples (even for different views), i.e., one view may be informative for one sample but not the case for another. Therefore, it is quite challenging to integrate multi-view noisy data under unsupervised setting. Traditional multi-view methods either simply treat each view with equal importance or tune the weights of different views to fixed values, which are insufficient to capture the dynamic noise in multi-view data. In this work, we devise a novel unsupervised multi-view learning approach, termed as Dynamic Uncertainty-Aware Networks (DUA-Nets). Guided by the uncertainty of data estimated from the generation perspective, intrinsic information from multiple views is integrated to obtain noise-free representations. Under the help of uncertainty, DUA-Nets weigh each view of individual sample according to data quality so that the high-quality samples (or views) can be fully exploited while the effects from the noisy samples (or views) will be alleviated. Our model achieves superior performance in extensive experiments and shows the robustness to noisy data. ",

Here, we propose a semantic decoupled representation learning for RS image CD. Typically, the object of interest (e.g., building) is relatively small compared to the vast background. Different from existing methods expressing an image into one representation vector that may be dominated by irrelevant land-covers, we disentangle representations of different semantic regions by leveraging the semantic mask. We additionally force the model to distinguish different semantic representations, which benefits the recognition of objects of interest in the downstream CD task. We construct a dataset of bitemporal images with semantic masks in an effortless manner for pre-training.

When minimising the empirical risk, the generalisation of the learnt function still depends on the performance on the training data, the Vapnik-Chervonenkis(VC)-dimension of the function and the number of training examples. Neural networks have a large number of parameters, which correlates with their VC-dimension that is typically large but not infinite, and typically a large number of training instances are needed to effectively train them. In this work, we explore how to optimize feature mappings using neural network with the intention to reduce the effective VC-dimension of the hyperplane found in the space generated by the mapping. An interpretation of the results of this study is that it is possible to define a loss that controls the VC-dimension of the separating hyperplane. We evaluate this approach and observe that the performance when using this method improves when the size of the training set is small. ",

These are important issues for the economics of cable laying and significantly change the model and the optimization process. We pose the problem as a variant of the Steiner tree problem, but one in which the Steiner nodes can vary in number, while incurring a penalty. We refer to it as the weighted Steiner node problem. It differs from the Euclidean Steiner tree problem, where Steiner points are forced to have degree three; this is no longer the case, in general, when nodes incur a cost. We are able to prove that our algorithm is applicable to Steiner nodes with degree greater than three, enabling optimization of network costs in this context. The optimal solution is achieved in polynomialtime using dynamic programming. ",

With a black-box detector, we design features capturing the dependencies to allow a reinforcement learning to learn an effective and interpretable attack policy based on the detector output. To speed up learning, we devise: (i) a credit assignment method that decomposes delayed rewards to individual attacking steps proportional to their effects; (ii) a time-dependent control variate to reduce variance due to large graphs and many attacking steps. On two social rumor datasets, we demonstrate: (i) the effectiveness of the attacks compared to rule-based attacks and end-to-end approaches; (ii) the usefulness of the proposed credit assignment strategy and control variate; (iii) interpretability of the policy when generating strong attacks.

How to utilize multiple views latent representation of each single task to improve each learning task performance is a challenge problem. Based on this, we proposed a novel semi-supervised algorithm, termed as Multi-Task Multi-View learning based on Common and Special Features (MTMVCSF). In general, multi-views are the different aspects of an object and every view includes the underlying common or special information of this object. As a consequence, we will mine multiple views jointly latent factor of each learning task which consists of each view special feature and the common feature of all views. By this way, the original multi-task multi-view data has degenerated into multi-task data, and exploring the correlations among multiple tasks enables to make an improvement on the performance of learning algorithm. Another obvious advantage of this approach is that we get latent representation of the set of unlabeled instances by the constraint of regression task with labeled instances. The performance of classification and semi-supervised clustering task in these latent representations perform obviously better than it in raw data. Furthermore, an anti-noise multi-task multi-view algorithm called AN-MTMVCSF is proposed, which has a strong adaptability to noise labels. The effectiveness of these algorithms is proved by a series of well-designed experiments on both real world and synthetic data. ",

    "abstract": "Limited urban parking space combined with urbanization has necessitated the development of smart parking systems that can communicate the availability of parking slots to the end users. Towards this, various deep learning based solutions using convolutional neural networks have been proposed for parking space occupation detection. Though these approaches are robust to partial obstructions and lighting conditions, their performance is found to degrade in the presence of haze conditions. Looking in this direction, this paper investigates the use of dehazing networks that improves the performance of parking space occupancy classifier under hazy conditions. Additionally, training procedures are proposed for dehazing networks to maximize the performance of the system on both hazy and non-hazy conditions. The proposed system is deployable as part of existing smart parking systems where limited number of cameras are used to monitor hundreds of parking spaces. To validate our approach, we have developed a custom hazy parking system dataset from real-world task-driven test set of RESIDE-\\b{eta} dataset. The proposed approach is tested against existing state-of-the-art parking space detectors on CNRPark-EXT and hazy parking system datasets. Experimental results indicate that there is a significant accuracy improvement of the proposed approach on the hazy parking system dataset. ",

Previous works mainly focus on homogeneous recommendation and little progress has been made for heterogeneous recommender systems.

State-of-the-art methods are incapable of leveraging attributes from different types of items and thus suffer from data sparsity problems. And it is indeed quite challenging to represent items with different feature spaces jointly. To tackle this problem, we propose a kernel-based neural network, namely deep unified representation (or DURation) for heterogeneous recommendation, to jointly model unified representations of heterogeneous items while preserving their original feature space topology structures. Theoretically, we prove the representation ability of the proposed model. Besides, we conduct extensive experiments on real-world datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that with the unified representation, our model achieves remarkable improvement (e.g., 4.1% ~ 34.9% lift by AUC score and 3.7% lift by online CTR) over existing state-of-the-art models.

We leverage cross-lingual word embeddings to train our neural network systems on the source language and apply it to the target language, which lacks labeled examples, and show that good performance can be achieved. We then incorporate unlabeled target language data for further model improvements by bootstrapping labels using an ensemble of different model architectures.

TriLock can achieve high, tunable functional corruptibility while still guaranteeing exponential queries to the SAT solver in a SAT-based attack.

Our analysis shows the timing of the volume changes in online discussions roughly corresponds to the dates when the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics released the Consumer Price Index (CPI). The usage of the hashtags varies across left- and right-leaning users. Left-leaning users tend to discuss more diverse subtopics while right-leaning users focus on blaming U.S. President Joe Biden for the inflation. Unlike previous studies, we characterize political polarization by jointly modeling user information, their connections, and the multi-modal post contents in a heterogeneous graph. By mapping the node embeddings into a two-dimensional space, we find there is clear segregation between left- and right-leaning users. Although using only one of the features or the concatenation does not improve the performance of modeling, we find notable differences in user descriptions, topics, images, and levels of retweet activities. Our framework shows wide applicability and can be further extended by integrating other modalities of data and more relations. The findings have implications for understanding online political polarization and designing mitigation policies for potentially negative outcome of extreme polarization. ",

    "abstract": "Writer identification has practical applications for forgery detection and forensic science. Most models based on deep neural networks extract features from character image or sub-regions in character image, which ignoring features contained in page-region image. Our proposed global regular network (GRN) pays attention to these features. GRN network consists of two branches: one branch takes page handwriting as input to extract global features, and the other takes word handwriting as input to extract local features. Global features and local features merge in a global residual way to form overall features of the handwriting. The proposed GRN has two attributions: one is adding a branch to extract features contained in page; the other is using residual attention network to extract local feature. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of both strategies. On CVL dataset, our models achieve impressive 99.98% top-1 accuracy and 100% top-5 accuracy with shorter training time and fewer network parameters, which exceeded the state-of-the-art structure. The experiment shows the powerful ability of the network in the field of writer identification. The source code is available at https://github.com/wangshiyu001/GRN. ",

    "title": "Enhancement of Healthcare Data Performance Metrics using Neural Network  Machine Learning Algorithms",
    "abstract": "Patients are often encouraged to make use of wearable devices for remote collection and monitoring of health data. This adoption of wearables results in a significant increase in the volume of data collected and transmitted. The battery life of the devices is then quickly diminished due to the high processing requirements of the devices. Given the importance attached to medical data, it is imperative that all transmitted data adhere to strict integrity and availability requirements. Reducing the volume of healthcare data for network transmission may improve sensor battery life without compromising accuracy. There is a trade-off between efficiency and accuracy which can be controlled by adjusting the sampling and transmission rates. This paper demonstrates that machine learning can be used to analyse complex health data metrics such as the accuracy and efficiency of data transmission to overcome the trade-off problem. The study uses time series nonlinear autoregressive neural network algorithms to enhance both data metrics by taking fewer samples to transmit. The algorithms were tested with a standard heart rate dataset to compare their accuracy and efficiency. The result showed that the Levenbery-Marquardt algorithm was the best performer with an efficiency of 3.33 and accuracy of 79.17%, which is similar to other algorithms accuracy but demonstrates improved efficiency. This proves that machine learning can improve without sacrificing a metric over the other compared to the existing methods with high efficiency. ",

    "abstract": "Two major challenges of 3D LiDAR Panoptic Segmentation (PS) are that point clouds of an object are surface-aggregated and thus hard to model the long-range dependency especially for large instances, and that objects are too close to separate each other. Recent literature addresses these problems by time-consuming grouping processes such as dual-clustering, mean-shift offsets, etc., or by bird-eye-view (BEV) dense centroid representation that downplays geometry. However, the long-range geometry relationship has not been sufficiently modeled by local feature learning from the above methods. To this end, we present SCAN, a novel sparse cross-scale attention network to first align multi-scale sparse features with global voxel-encoded attention to capture the long-range relationship of instance context, which can boost the regression accuracy of the over-segmented large objects. For the surface-aggregated points, SCAN adopts a novel sparse class-agnostic representation of instance centroids, which can not only maintain the sparsity of aligned features to solve the under-segmentation on small objects, but also reduce the computation amount of the network through sparse convolution. Our method outperforms previous methods by a large margin in the SemanticKITTI dataset for the challenging 3D PS task, achieving 1st place with a real-time inference speed. ",

    "abstract": "Mapping and localization are two essential tasks for mobile robots in real-world applications. However, largescale and dynamic scenes challenge the accuracy and robustness of most current mature solutions. This situation becomes even worse when computational resources are limited. In this paper, we present a novel lightweight object-level mapping and localization method with high accuracy and robustness. Different from previous methods, our method does not need a prior constructed precise geometric map, which greatly releases the storage burden, especially for large-scale navigation. We use object-level features with both semantic and geometric information to model landmarks in the environment. Particularly, a learning topological primitive is first proposed to efficiently obtain and organize the object-level landmarks. On the basis of this, we use a robot-centric mapping framework to represent the environment as a semantic topology graph and relax the burden of maintaining global consistency at the same time. Besides, a hierarchical memory management mechanism is introduced to improve the efficiency of online mapping with limited computational resources. Based on the proposed map, the robust localization is achieved by constructing a novel local semantic scene graph descriptor, and performing multi-constraint graph matching to compare scene similarity. Finally, we test our method on a low-cost embedded platform to demonstrate its advantages. Experimental results on a large scale and multi-session real-world environment show that the proposed method outperforms the state of arts in terms of lightweight and robustness. ",

    "abstract": "Unsupervised sentence embedding aims to obtain the most appropriate embedding for a sentence to reflect its semantic. Contrastive learning has been attracting developing attention. For a sentence, current models utilize diverse data augmentation methods to generate positive samples, while consider other independent sentences as negative samples. Then they adopt InfoNCE loss to pull the embeddings of positive pairs gathered, and push those of negative pairs scattered. Although these models have made great progress on sentence embedding, we argue that they may suffer from feature suppression. The models fail to distinguish and decouple textual similarity and semantic similarity. And they may overestimate the semantic similarity of any pairs with similar textual regardless of the actual semantic difference between them. This is because positive pairs in unsupervised contrastive learning come with similar and even the same textual through data augmentation. To alleviate feature suppression, we propose contrastive learning for unsupervised sentence embedding with soft negative samples (SNCSE). Soft negative samples share highly similar textual but have surely and apparently different semantic with the original samples. Specifically, we take the negation of original sentences as soft negative samples, and propose Bidirectional Margin Loss (BML) to introduce them into traditional contrastive learning framework, which merely involves positive and negative samples. Our experimental results show that SNCSE can obtain state-of-the-art performance on semantic textual similarity (STS) task with average Spearman's correlation coefficient of 78.97% on BERTbase and 79.23% on RoBERTabase. Besides, we adopt rank-based error analysis method to detect the weakness of SNCSE for future study. ",

The multiresolution structure allows the network to disambiguate hash collisions, making for a simple architecture that is trivial to parallelize on modern GPUs. We leverage this parallelism by implementing the whole system using fully-fused CUDA kernels with a focus on minimizing wasted bandwidth and compute operations.

With this high-quality dataset, we provide a strong baseline classifier, COLDetector, with 81% accuracy for offensive language detection. Furthermore, we also utilize the proposed \\textsc{COLDetector} to study output offensiveness of popular Chinese language models (CDialGPT and CPM). We find that (1) CPM tends to generate more offensive output than CDialGPT, and (2) certain type of prompts, like anti-bias sentences, can trigger offensive outputs more easily.Altogether, our resources and analyses are intended to help detoxify the Chinese online communities and evaluate the safety performance of generative language models.

All of these designs interact with the considered communication environment. Lastly, we compare the performance of the proposed algorithm with conventional Q-learning and SARSA Q-learning algorithms. The simulation outcomes show that: 1) Compared with the traditional Q learning algorithms, the proposed solution is able to converges within \\myb{200} episodes for providing as low as $10^{-2}$ long-term mean error; 2) NOMA assisted URLLC outperforms traditional OMA systems in terms of decoding error probabilities; and 3) The proposed feedback system is efficient for the long-term learning process.

The iterative optimization of segmentor and generator can build an end-to-end network for unsupervised change detection, the adversarial process between segmentor and discriminator can provide the solutions for weakly and regional supervised change detection, the segmentor itself can be trained for fully supervised task. The experiments indicate the effectiveness of the propsed framework in unsupervised, weakly supervised and regional supervised change detection.

The advantage of steganography over cryptography is that the intended secret message does not attract attention and is thus more suitable for secret communication in a highly-surveillant environment such as civil disobedience movements. Internet memes in social media and messaging apps have become a popular culture worldwide, so this folk custom is a good application scenario for image steganography. We try to explore and adopt the steganography techniques on the Internet memes in this work. We implement and improve the HiDDeN model by changing the Conv-BN-ReLU blocks convolution layer with a multiscale autoencoder network so that the neural network learns to embed message bits in higher-level feature space. Compared to methods that convolve feature filters on the row-pixel domain, our proposed MS-Hidden network learns to hide secrets in both low-level and high-level image features. As a result, the proposed model significantly reduces the bit-error rate to empirically 0% and the required network parameters are much less than the HiDDeN model. ",

    "abstract": "Millions of stray animals suffer on the streets or are euthanized in shelters every day around the world. In order to better adopt stray animals, scoring the pawpularity (cuteness) of stray animals is very important, but evaluating the pawpularity of animals is a very labor-intensive thing. Consequently, there has been an urgent surge of interest to develop an algorithm that scores pawpularity of animals. However, the dataset in Kaggle not only has images, but also metadata describing images. Most methods basically focus on the most advanced image regression methods in recent years, but there is no good method to deal with the metadata of images. To address the above challenges, the paper proposes an image regression model called PETS-SWINF that considers metadata of the images. Our results based on a dataset of Kaggle competition, \"PetFinder.my\", show that PETS-SWINF has an advantage over only based images models. Our results shows that the RMSE loss of the proposed model on the test dataset is 17.71876 but 17.76449 without metadata. The advantage of the proposed method is that PETS-SWINF can consider both low-order and high-order features of metadata, and adaptively adjust the weights of the image model and the metadata model. The performance is promising as our leadboard score is ranked 15 out of 3545 teams (Gold medal) currently for 2021 Kaggle competition on the challenge \"PetFinder.my\". ",

    "abstract": "Due to diverse architectures in deep neural networks (DNNs) with severe overparameterization, regularization techniques are critical for finding optimal solutions in the huge hypothesis space. In this paper, we propose an effective regularization technique, called Neighborhood Region Smoothing (NRS). NRS leverages the finding that models would benefit from converging to flat minima, and tries to regularize the neighborhood region in weight space to yield approximate outputs. Specifically, gap between outputs of models in the neighborhood region is gauged by a defined metric based on Kullback-Leibler divergence. This metric provides similar insights with the minimum description length principle on interpreting flat minima. By minimizing both this divergence and empirical loss, NRS could explicitly drive the optimizer towards converging to flat minima. We confirm the effectiveness of NRS by performing image classification tasks across a wide range of model architectures on commonly-used datasets such as CIFAR and ImageNet, where generalization ability could be universally improved. Also, we empirically show that the minima found by NRS would have relatively smaller Hessian eigenvalues compared to the conventional method, which is considered as the evidence of flat minima. ",

    "abstract": "Most researchers have tried to enhance the robustness of deep neural networks (DNNs) by revealing and repairing the vulnerability of DNNs with specialized adversarial examples. Parts of the attack examples have imperceptible perturbations restricted by Lp norm. However, due to their high-frequency property, the adversarial examples usually have poor transferability and can be defensed by denoising methods. To avoid the defects, some works make the perturbations unrestricted to gain better robustness and transferability. However, these examples usually look unnatural and alert the guards. To generate unrestricted adversarial examples with high image quality and good transferability, in this paper, we propose Adversarial Lightness Attack (ALA), a white-box unrestricted adversarial attack that focuses on modifying the lightness of the images. The shape and color of the samples, which are crucial to human perception, are barely influenced. To obtain adversarial examples with high image quality, we craft a naturalness-aware regularization. To achieve stronger transferability, we propose random initialization and non-stop attack strategy in the attack procedure. We verify the effectiveness of ALA on two popular datasets for different tasks (i.e., ImageNet for image classification and Places-365 for scene recognition). The experiments show that the generated adversarial examples have both strong transferability and high image quality. Besides, the adversarial examples can also help to improve the standard trained ResNet50 on defending lightness corruption. ",

    "abstract": "5G networks provide higher flexibility and improved performance compared to previous cellular technologies. This has raised expectations on the possibility to support advanced V2X services using the cellular network via Vehicle-to-Network (V2N) and V2N2V connections. Most existing studies focus on evaluating the performance and feasibility of the 5G radio access network to support advanced V2X services. The network deployment and dimensioning also have a strong impact on the end-to-end (E2E) performance, and hence on the suitability of V2N and V2N2V connections to support advanced V2X services. This is specially the case for the E2E latency that is a critical requirement of V2X services. This paper introduces a novel E2E latency model for 5G V2N/V2N2V communications. The model includes the latency introduced at the radio, transport, core, Internet, peering points and application server (AS) for single mobile network operator (MNO) and multi-MNO scenarios. This paper estimates the E2E latency for a large variety of possible 5G network deployments that are being discussed or envisioned to support V2X services. This includes the possibility to deploy the V2X AS from the edge of the network to the cloud. The model is utilized to analyze the impact of different 5G network deployments and configurations on the E2E latency. The analysis helps identify which 5G network deployments and configurations are more suitable to meet V2X latency requirements. The conducted analysis highlights the challenge for centralized network deployments that locate the V2X AS at the cloud to meet the latency requirements of advanced V2X services. Locating the V2X AS closer to the cell edge reduces the latency, but requires a higher number of ASs and also careful dimensioning of the network and its configuration to ensure sufficient network and V2X AS resources are dedicated to serve the V2X traffic.

    "abstract": "Identifying clusters or community structures in networks has become an integral part of social network analysis. Though many methods were proposed, the label propagation algorithm (LPA) is a popular computationally efficient method with running time linear. However, the LPA provides different combination of communities on the same network due to the randomness in LPA. Many improvements have been proposed to tackle this stability problem by eliminating the randomness. This paper put forward an improvement to the standard LPA by proposing a label initialization method based on link similarity. The similarity is measured based on the connection strength between two nodes. The method is tested on real and synthetic measures to analyze the performance. ",

Motivated by the success of artificial intelligence in other domains, O-RAN strives to leverage machine learning (ML) to automatically and efficiently manage network resources in diverse use cases such as traffic steering, quality of experience prediction, and anomaly detection. Unfortunately, ML-based systems are not free of vulnerabilities; specifically, they suffer from a special type of logical vulnerabilities that stem from the inherent limitations of the learning algorithms. To exploit these vulnerabilities, an adversary can utilize an attack technique referred to as adversarial machine learning (AML). These special type of attacks has already been demonstrated in recent researches. In this paper, we present a systematic AML threat analysis for the O-RAN. We start by reviewing relevant ML use cases and analyzing the different ML workflow deployment scenarios in O-RAN. Then, we define the threat model, identifying potential adversaries, enumerating their adversarial capabilities, and analyzing their main goals. Finally, we explore the various AML threats in the O-RAN and review a large number of attacks that can be performed to materialize these threats and demonstrate an AML attack on a traffic steering model.

They have scope in reinventing old businesses, and they are even developing new opportunities for various brands and franchisors. UAVs are used in the supply chain, maintaining surveillance and serving as mobile hotspots. Although UAVs have potential applications, they bring several societal concerns and challenges that need addressing in public safety, privacy, and cyber security. UAVs are prone to various cyber-attacks and vulnerabilities; they can also be hacked and misused by malicious entities resulting in cyber-crime. The adversaries can exploit these vulnerabilities, leading to data loss, property, and destruction of life. One can partially detect the attacks like false information dissemination, jamming, gray hole, blackhole, and GPS spoofing by monitoring the UAV behavior, but it may not resolve privacy issues.

To solve such optimization problems, inventory managers need to decide what quantities to order from each supplier, given the on-hand inventory and outstanding orders, so that the expected backlogging, holding, and sourcing costs are jointly minimized. Inventory management problems have been studied extensively for over 60 years, and yet even basic dual sourcing problems, in which orders from an expensive supplier arrive faster than orders from a regular supplier, remain intractable in their general form. In this work, we approach dual sourcing from a neural-network-based optimization lens. By incorporating inventory dynamics into the design of neural networks, we are able to learn near-optimal policies of commonly used instances within a few minutes of CPU time on a regular personal computer. To demonstrate the versatility of inventory-dynamics-informed neural networks, we show that they are able to control inventory dynamics with empirical demand distributions that are challenging to tackle effectively using alternative, state-of-the-art approaches.

We construct linear codes over $\\mathbb{F}_q$, for $q=\\text{poly}(1/\\varepsilon)$, that can efficiently decode from a $\\delta$ fraction of insdel errors and have rate $(1-4\\delta)/8-\\varepsilon$. We also show that by allowing codes over $\\mathbb{F}_{q^2}$ that are linear over $\\mathbb{F}_q$, we can improve the rate to $(1-\\delta)/4-\\varepsilon$ while not sacrificing efficiency.

    "abstract": "The Cloud paradigm is at a critical point in which the existing energy-efficiency techniques are reaching a plateau, while the computing resources demand at Data Center facilities continues to increase exponentially. The main challenge in achieving a global energy efficiency strategy based on Artificial Intelligence is that we need massive amounts of data to feed the algorithms. Nowadays, any optimization strategy must begin with data. However, companies with access to these large amounts of data decide not to share them because it could compromise their security. This paper proposes a time-series data augmentation methodology based on synthetic scenario forecasting within the Data Center. For this purpose, we will implement a powerful generative algorithm: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). The use of GANs will allow us to handle multivariate data and data from different natures (e.g., categorical). On the other hand, adapting Data Centers' operational management to the occurrence of sporadic anomalies is complicated due to the reduced frequency of failures in the system. Therefore, we also propose a methodology to increase the generated data variability by introducing on-demand anomalies. We validated our approach using real data collected from an operating Data Center, successfully obtaining forecasts of random scenarios with several hours of prediction. Our research will help to optimize the energy consumed in Data Centers, although the proposed methodology can be employed in any similar time-series-like problem. ",

    "abstract": "A new approach to seismic interpretation is proposed to leverage visual perception and human visual system modeling. Specifically, a saliency detection algorithm based on a novel attention model is proposed for identifying subsurface structures within seismic data volumes. The algorithm employs 3D-FFT and a multi-dimensional spectral projection, which decomposes local spectra into three distinct components, each depicting variations along different dimensions of the data. Subsequently, a novel directional center-surround attention model is proposed to incorporate directional comparisons around each voxel for saliency detection within each projected dimension. Next, the resulting saliency maps along each dimension are combined adaptively to yield a consolidated saliency map, which highlights various structures characterized by subtle variations and relative motion with respect to their neighboring sections. A priori information about the seismic data can be either embedded into the proposed attention model in the directional comparisons, or incorporated into the algorithm by specifying a template when combining saliency maps adaptively. Experimental results on two real seismic datasets from the North Sea, Netherlands and Great South Basin, New Zealand demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm for detecting salient seismic structures of different natures and appearances in one shot, which differs significantly from traditional seismic interpretation algorithms. The results further demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms comparable state-of-the-art saliency detection algorithms for natural images and videos, which are inadequate for seismic imaging data.

    "abstract": "Adversarial Examples (AEs) can deceive Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) and have received a lot of attention recently. However, majority of the research on AEs is in the digital domain and the adversarial patches are static, which is very different from many real-world DNN applications such as Traffic Sign Recognition (TSR) systems in autonomous vehicles. In TSR systems, object detectors use DNNs to process streaming video in real time. From the view of object detectors, the traffic sign`s position and quality of the video are continuously changing, rendering the digital AEs ineffective in the physical world. In this paper, we propose a systematic pipeline to generate robust physical AEs against real-world object detectors. Robustness is achieved in three ways. First, we simulate the in-vehicle cameras by extending the distribution of image transformations with the blur transformation and the resolution transformation. Second, we design the single and multiple bounding boxes filters to improve the efficiency of the perturbation training. Third, we consider four representative attack vectors, namely Hiding Attack, Appearance Attack, Non-Target Attack and Target Attack. We perform a comprehensive set of experiments under a variety of environmental conditions, and considering illuminations in sunny and cloudy weather as well as at night. The experimental results show that the physical AEs generated from our pipeline are effective and robust when attacking the YOLO v5 based TSR system. The attacks have good transferability and can deceive other state-of-the-art object detectors. We launched HA and NTA on a brand-new 2021 model vehicle. Both attacks are successful in fooling the TSR system, which could be a life-threatening case for autonomous vehicles. Finally, we discuss three defense mechanisms based on image preprocessing, AEs detection, and model enhancing. ",

    "abstract": "Backdoor attacks have been widely studied to hide the misclassification rules in the normal models, which are only activated when the model is aware of the specific inputs (i.e., the trigger). However, despite their success in the conventional Euclidean space, there are few studies of backdoor attacks on graph structured data. In this paper, we propose a new type of backdoor which is specific to graph data, called neighboring backdoor. Considering the discreteness of graph data, how to effectively design the triggers while retaining the model accuracy on the original task is the major challenge. To address such a challenge, we set the trigger as a single node, and the backdoor is activated when the trigger node is connected to the target node. To preserve the model accuracy, the model parameters are not allowed to be modified. Thus, when the trigger node is not connected, the model performs normally. Under these settings, in this work, we focus on generating the features of the trigger node. Two types of backdoors are proposed: (1) Linear Graph Convolution Backdoor which finds an approximation solution for the feature generation (can be viewed as an integer programming problem) by looking at the linear part of GCNs. (2) Variants of existing graph attacks. We extend current gradient-based attack methods to our backdoor attack scenario. Extensive experiments on two social networks and two citation networks datasets demonstrate that all proposed backdoors can achieve an almost 100\\% attack success rate while having no impact on predictive accuracy.

However, these methods suffer from slow and poor convergence, and they may fail to infer a certain path when there is a missing edge along the path. Here we present SQUIRE, the first Sequence-to-sequence based multi-hop reasoning framework, which utilizes an encoder-decoder structure to translate the query to a path. Our model design brings about two benefits: (1) It can learn and predict in an end-to-end fashion, which gives better and faster convergence; (2) Our model does not rely on existing edges to generate the path, and has the flexibility to complete missing edges along the path, especially in sparse KGs. Experiments on standard and sparse KGs show that our approach yields significant improvement over prior methods, while converging 4x-7x faster. ",

Firstly, it puts unidirectional emphasis on pushing sampled negative entities far away rather than pulling positively aligned pairs close, as is done in the well-established supervised EA. Secondly, KGs contain rich side information (e.g., entity description), and how to effectively leverage those information has not been adequately investigated in self-supervised EA. In this paper, we propose an interactive contrastive learning model for self-supervised EA. The model encodes not only structures and semantics of entities (including entity name, entity description, and entity neighborhood), but also conducts cross-KG contrastive learning by building pseudo-aligned entity pairs. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms previous best self-supervised results by a large margin (over 9% average improvement) and performs on par with previous SOTA supervised counterparts, demonstrating the effectiveness of the interactive contrastive learning for self-supervised EA.

We show that, when the received powers of the users are sufficiently different, the proposed clustering-based approach achieves an SER performance on a par with that of the conventional maximum-likelihood detector with full channel state information. However, unlike the proposed approach, the maximum-likelihood detector requires the transmission of a large number of pilot symbols to accurately estimate the channel. The accuracy of the utilized clustering algorithm depends on the number of the data points available at the receiver. Therefore, there exists a tradeoff between accuracy and block length. We provide a comprehensive performance analysis of the proposed approach as well as deriving a theoretical bound on its SER performance as a function of the block length. Our simulation results corroborate the effectiveness of the proposed approach and verify that the calculated theoretical bound can predict the SER performance of the proposed approach well. ",

Most mesh creation techniques assume that the input surface is not self-intersecting. However, due to numerical and/or user error, input surfaces are commonly self-intersecting to some degree. The removal of self-intersection is a burdensome task that complicates workflow and generally slows down the process of creating simulation-ready digital assets. We present a method for the creation of a volumetric embedding hexahedron mesh from a self-intersecting input triangle mesh. Our method is designed for efficiency by minimizing use of computationally expensive exact/adaptive precision arithmetic. Although our approach allows for nearly no limit on the degree of self-intersection in the input surface, our focus is on efficiency in the most common case: many minimal self-intersections. The embedding hexahedron mesh is created from a uniform background grid and consists of hexahedron elements that are geometrical copies of grid cells. Multiple copies of a single grid cell are used to resolve regions of self-intersection/overlap. Lastly, we develop a novel topology-aware embedding mesh coarsening technique to allow for user-specified mesh resolution as well as a topology-aware tetrahedralization of the hexahedron mesh. ",

Albeit moderate improvements in current approaches, they commonly require high-quality homologous data sources of videos and audios, thus causing the failure to leverage heterogeneous data sufficiently. In practice, it may be intractable to collect the perfect homologous data in some cases, for example, audio-corrupted or picture-blurry videos. To explore this kind of data and support high-fidelity few-shot visual dubbing, in this paper, we novelly propose a simple yet efficient two-stage framework with a higher flexibility of mining heterogeneous data. Specifically, our two-stage paradigm employs facial landmarks as intermediate prior of latent representations and disentangles the lip movements prediction from the core task of realistic talking head generation. By this means, our method makes it possible to independently utilize the training corpus for two-stage sub-networks using more available heterogeneous data easily acquired. Besides, thanks to the disentanglement, our framework allows a further fine-tuning for a given talking head, thereby leading to better speaker-identity preserving in the final synthesized results. Moreover, the proposed method can also transfer appearance features from others to the target speaker. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method in generating highly realistic videos synchronized with the speech over the state-of-the-art. ",

The proposed approach prescribes a structure for the controller based on relevant scientific knowledge (such as Lyapunov stability theory or domain experiences) while considering the tunable elements inside the given structure as the point of parametrisation with neural networks. To optimise a cost represented as a function of the neural network weights, the proposed approach utilises the continuous-time policy gradient method based on adjoint sensitivity analysis as a means for correct and performant computation of cost gradient. This enables combining the stability, robustness, and physical interpretability of an analytically-derived structure for the feedback controller with the representational flexibility and optimised resulting performance provided by machine learning techniques. Such a hybrid paradigm for fixed-structure control synthesis is particularly useful for optimising adaptive nonlinear controllers to achieve improved performance in online operation, an area where the existing theory prevails the design of structure while lacking clear analytical understandings about tuning of the gains and the uncertainty model basis functions that govern the performance characteristics. Numerical experiments on aerospace applications illustrate the utility of the structured nonlinear controller optimisation framework. ",

    "abstract": "Gridworlds have been long-utilised in AI research, particularly in reinforcement learning, as they provide simple yet scalable models for many real-world applications such as robot navigation, emergent behaviour, and operations research. We initiate a study of gridworlds using the mathematical framework of reconfigurable systems and state complexes due to Abrams, Ghrist & Peterson. State complexes represent all possible configurations of a system as a single geometric space, thus making them conducive to study using geometric, topological, or combinatorial methods. The main contribution of this work is a modification to the original Abrams, Ghrist & Peterson setup which we believe is more naturally-suited to the context of gridworlds. With this modification, the state complexes may exhibit geometric defects (failure of Gromov's Link Condition), however, we argue that these failures can indicate undesirable or dangerous states in the gridworld. Our results provide a novel method for seeking guaranteed safety limitations in discrete task environments with single or multiple agents, and offer potentially useful geometric and topological information for incorporation in or analysis of machine learning systems.

    "title": "Action Keypoint Network for Efficient Video Recognition",
    "abstract": "Reducing redundancy is crucial for improving the efficiency of video recognition models. An effective approach is to select informative content from the holistic video, yielding a popular family of dynamic video recognition methods. However, existing dynamic methods focus on either temporal or spatial selection independently while neglecting a reality that the redundancies are usually spatial and temporal, simultaneously. Moreover, their selected content is usually cropped with fixed shapes, while the realistic distribution of informative content can be much more diverse. With these two insights, this paper proposes to integrate temporal and spatial selection into an Action Keypoint Network (AK-Net). From different frames and positions, AK-Net selects some informative points scattered in arbitrary-shaped regions as a set of action keypoints and then transforms the video recognition into point cloud classification. AK-Net has two steps, i.e., the keypoint selection and the point cloud classification. First, it inputs the video into a baseline network and outputs a feature map from an intermediate layer. We view each pixel on this feature map as a spatial-temporal point and select some informative keypoints using self-attention. Second, AK-Net devises a ranking criterion to arrange the keypoints into an ordered 1D sequence. Consequentially, AK-Net brings two-fold benefits for efficiency: The keypoint selection step collects informative content within arbitrary shapes and increases the efficiency for modeling spatial-temporal dependencies, while the point cloud classification step further reduces the computational cost by compacting the convolutional kernels. Experimental results show that AK-Net can consistently improve the efficiency and performance of baseline methods on several video recognition benchmarks. ",

    "abstract": "Cross-camera image data association is essential for many multi-camera computer vision tasks, such as multi-camera pedestrian detection, multi-camera multi-target tracking, 3D pose estimation, etc. This association task is typically stated as a bipartite graph matching problem and often solved by applying minimum-cost flow techniques, which may be computationally inefficient with large data. Furthermore, cameras are usually treated by pairs, obtaining local solutions, rather than finding a global solution at once. Other key issue is that of the affinity measurement: the widespread usage of non-learnable pre-defined distances, such as the Euclidean and Cosine ones. This paper proposes an efficient approach for cross-cameras data-association focused on a global solution, instead of processing cameras by pairs. To avoid the usage of fixed distances, we leverage the connectivity of Graph Neural Networks, previously unused in this scope, using a Message Passing Network to jointly learn features and similarity. We validate the proposal for pedestrian multi-view association, showing results over the EPFL multi-camera pedestrian dataset. Our approach considerably outperforms the literature data association techniques, without requiring to be trained in the same scenario in which it is tested.

Recently, Traor\\'e et al. have proposed the framework of Fitness Landscape Footprint to help describe and compare neural architecture search problems. It attempts at describing why a search strategy might be successful, struggle or fail on a target task. Our study leverages this methodology in the context of searching across sensors, including sensor data fusion. In particular, we apply the Fitness Landscape Footprint to the real-world image classification problem of So2Sat LCZ42, in order to identify the most beneficial sensor to our neural network hyper-parameter optimization problem. From the perspective of distributions of fitness, our findings indicate a similar behaviour of the search space for all sensors: the longer the training time, the larger the overall fitness, and more flatness in the landscapes (less ruggedness and deviation). Regarding sensors, the better the fitness they enable (Sentinel-2), the better the search trajectories (smoother, higher persistence). Results also indicate very similar search behaviour for sensors that can be decently fitted by the search space (Sentinel-2 and fusion). ",

    "abstract": "Dynamic techniques are a scalable and effective way to analyze concurrent programs. Instead of analyzing all behaviors of a program, these techniques detect errors by focusing on a single program execution. Often a crucial step in these techniques is to define a causal ordering between events in the execution, which is then computed using vector clocks, a simple data structure that stores logical times of threads. The two basic operations of vector clocks, namely join and copy, require $\\Theta(k)$ time, where $k$ is the number of threads. Thus they are a computational bottleneck when $k$ is large. In this work, we introduce tree clocks, a new data structure that replaces vector clocks for computing causal orderings in program executions. Joining and copying tree clocks takes time that is roughly proportional to the number of entries being modified, and hence the two operations do not suffer the a-priori $\\Theta(k)$ cost per application. We show that when used to compute the classic happens-before (HB) partial order, tree clocks are optimal, in the sense that no other data structure can lead to smaller asymptotic running time. Moreover, we demonstrate that tree clocks can be used to compute other partial orders, such as schedulable-happens-before (SHB) and the standard Mazurkiewicz (MAZ) partial order, and thus are a versatile data structure. Our experiments show that just by replacing vector clocks with tree clocks, the computation becomes from $2.02 \\times$ faster (MAZ) to $2.66 \\times$ (SHB) and $2.97 \\times$ (HB) on average per benchmark. These results illustrate that tree clocks have the potential to become a standard data structure with wide applications in concurrent analyses. ",

    "abstract": "The CAN Bus is crucial to the efficiency, and safety of modern vehicle infrastructure. Electronic Control Units (ECUs) exchange data across a shared bus, dropping messages whenever errors occur. If an ECU generates enough errors, their transmitter is put in a bus-off state, turning it off. Previous work abuses this process to disable ECUs, but is trivial to detect through the multiple errors transmitted over the bus. We propose a novel attack, undetectable by prior intrusion detection systems, which disables ECUs within a single message without generating any errors on the bus. Performing this attack requires the ability to flip bits on the bus, but not with any level of sophistication. We show that an attacker who can only flip bits 40% of the time can execute our stealthy attack 100% of the time. But this attack, and all prior CAN attacks, rely on the ability to read the bus. We propose a new technique which synchronizes the bus, such that even a blind attacker, incapable of reading the bus, can know when to transmit. Taking a limited attacker's chance of success from the percentage of dead bus time, to 100%. Finally, we propose a small modification to the CAN error process to ensure an ECU cannot fail without being detected, no matter how advanced the attacker is. Taken together we advance the state of the art for CAN attacks and blind attackers, while proposing a detection system against stealthy attacks, and the larger problem of CAN's abusable error frames.

Once such a model is established, further benefits can be reaped, such as the analysis of complex technical correlations within the system. Various insights can be gained by displaying the model as a formal graph and querying it. To enable such queries, a graph schema needs to be designed, which allows to transfer the model into a graph database. In the course of this paper, we discuss the design of a graph schema and MBSE modelling approach, enabling deep going system analysis and anomaly resolution in complex embedded systems. The schema and modelling approach are designed to answer questions such as what happens if there is an electrical short in a component? Which other components are now offline and which data cannot be gathered anymore? Or if a condition cannot be met, which alternative routes can be established to reach a certain state of the system. We build on the use case of qualification and operations of a small spacecraft. Structural and behavioral elements of the MBSE model are transferred to a graph database where analyses are conducted on the system. The schema is implemented by an adapter for MagicDraw to Neo4j. A selection of complex analyses are shown on the example of the MOVE-II space mission. ",

    "abstract": "In recent years, graph neural networks (GNNs) have emerged as a successful tool in a variety of graph-related applications. However, the performance of GNNs can be deteriorated when noisy connections occur in the original graph structures; besides, the dependence on explicit structures prevents GNNs from being applied to general unstructured scenarios. To address these issues, recently emerged deep graph structure learning (GSL) methods propose to jointly optimize the graph structure along with GNN under the supervision of a node classification task. Nonetheless, these methods focus on a supervised learning scenario, which leads to several problems, i.e., the reliance on labels, the bias of edge distribution, and the limitation on application tasks. In this paper, we propose a more practical GSL paradigm, unsupervised graph structure learning, where the learned graph topology is optimized by data itself without any external guidance (i.e., labels). To solve the unsupervised GSL problem, we propose a novel StrUcture Bootstrapping contrastive LearnIng fraMEwork (SUBLIME for abbreviation) with the aid of self-supervised contrastive learning. Specifically, we generate a learning target from the original data as an \"anchor graph\", and use a contrastive loss to maximize the agreement between the anchor graph and the learned graph. To provide persistent guidance, we design a novel bootstrapping mechanism that upgrades the anchor graph with learned structures during model learning. We also design a series of graph learners and post-processing schemes to model the structures to learn. Extensive experiments on eight benchmark datasets demonstrate the significant effectiveness of our proposed SUBLIME and high quality of the optimized graphs. ",

Previous PTQ methods usually reduce compression error via performing layer-by-layer parameters calibration. However, with lower representational ability of extremely compressed parameters (e.g., the bit-width goes less than 4), it is hard to eliminate all the layer-wise errors. This work addresses this issue via proposing a unit-wise feature reconstruction algorithm based on an observation of second order Taylor series expansion of the unit-wise error. It indicates that leveraging the interaction between adjacent layers' parameters could compensate layer-wise errors better. In this paper, we define several adjacent layers as a Basic-Unit, and present a unit-wise post-training algorithm which can minimize quantization error. This method achieves near-original accuracy on ImageNet and COCO when quantizing FP32 models to INT4 and INT3. ",

In the absence of labels, these features can be learned by self-supervised techniques under the generic assumption that the most abstract features are those which are statistically most over-represented in comparison to other distributions from the same domain. In this work, we show that self-distillation of the in-distribution training set together with contrasting against negative examples derived from shifting transformation of auxiliary data strongly improves OOD detection. We find that this improvement depends on how the negative samples are generated. In particular, we observe that by leveraging negative samples, which keep the statistics of low-level features while changing the high-level semantics, higher average detection performance is obtained. Furthermore, good negative sampling strategies can be identified from the sensitivity of the OOD detection score. The efficiency of our approach is demonstrated across a diverse range of OOD detection problems, setting new benchmarks for unsupervised OOD detection in the visual domain. ",

These include nonholonomic motion constraints, constant speed constraints, holonomic coordination constraints, and equality/inequality geometric constraints. We develop a general framework involving differential-algebraic equations and viability theory to determine coordination feasibility for a coordinated motion control under heterogeneous vehicle dynamics and different types of coordination task constraints. If a coordinated motion solution exists for the derived differential-algebraic equations and/or inequalities, a constructive algorithm is proposed to derive an equivalent dynamical system that generates a set of feasible coordinated motions for each individual vehicle. In case studies on coordinating two vehicles, we derive analytical solutions to motion generation for two-vehicle groups consisting of car-like vehicles, unicycle vehicles, or vehicles with constant speeds, which serve as benchmark coordination tasks for more complex vehicle groups. The motion generation algorithm is well-backed by simulation data for a wide variety of coordination situations involving heterogeneous vehicles. We then extend the vehicle control framework to deal with the cooperative coordination problem with time-varying coordination tasks and leader-follower structure. We show several simulation experiments on multi-vehicle coordination under various constraints to validate the theory and the effectiveness of the proposed schemes. ",

When designing deep neural networks (DNN) for extracting bottleneck features, key considerations include training targets, activation functions, and loss functions. In this paper, we systematically study the impact of these choices on the performance of TD-SV. For training targets, we consider speaker identity, time-contrastive learning (TCL) and auto-regressive prediction coding with the first being supervised and the last two being self-supervised. Furthermore, we study a range of loss functions when speaker identity is used as the training target. With regard to activation functions, we study the widely used sigmoid function, rectified linear unit (ReLU), and Gaussian error linear unit (GELU). We experimentally show that GELU is able to reduce the error rates of TD-SV significantly compared to sigmoid, irrespective of training target. Among the three training targets, TCL performs the best. Among the various loss functions, cross entropy, joint-softmax and focal loss functions outperform the others. Finally, score-level fusion of different systems is also able to reduce the error rates. Experiments are conducted on the RedDots 2016 challenge database for TD-SV using short utterances.

However, in the common practice, this layer is not separately segmented but rather included in the outer nuclear layer since it is difficult to perceive HFL contours on standard optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging. Due to its variable reflectivity under an imaging beam, delineating the HFL contours necessitates directional OCT, which requires additional imaging. This paper addresses this issue by introducing a shape-preserving network, FourierNet, that achieves HFL segmentation in standard OCT scans with the target performance obtained when directional OCT scans are used. FourierNet is a new cascaded network design that puts forward the idea of benefiting the shape prior of HFL in the network training. This design proposes to represent the shape prior by extracting Fourier descriptors on the HFL contours and defining an additional regression task of learning these descriptors. It then formulates HFL segmentation as concurrent learning of regression and classification tasks, in which Fourier descriptors are estimated from an input image to encode the shape prior and used together with the input image to construct the HFL segmentation map. Our experiments on 1470 images of 30 OCT scans reveal that quantifying the HFL shape with Fourier descriptors and concurrently learning them with the main task of HFL segmentation lead to better results. This indicates the effectiveness of designing a shape-preserving network to improve HFL segmentation by reducing the need to perform directional OCT imaging. ",

On the other hand, models can be analysed as \"black boxes\", e.g., by associating the input samples with extra annotations that do not contribute to model training but can be exploited for characterizing the model response. Such performance-driven meta-annotations enable the detailed characterization of performance metrics and errors and help scientists identify the features of the input responsible for prediction failures and focus their model improvement efforts.

    "abstract": "To this day, there are still some countries where the exchange of kidneys between multiple incompatible patient-donor pairs is restricted by law. Typically, legal regulations in this context are put in place to prohibit coercion and manipulation in order to prevent a market for organ trade. Yet, in countries where kidney exchange is practiced, existing platforms to facilitate such exchanges generally lack sufficient privacy mechanisms. In this paper, we propose a privacy-preserving protocol for kidney exchange that not only addresses the privacy problem of existing platforms but also is geared to lead the way in overcoming legal issues in those countries where kidney exchange is still not practiced. In our approach, we use the concept of secret sharing to distribute the medical data of patients and donors among a set of computing peers in a privacy-preserving fashion. These computing peers then execute our new Secure Multi-Party Computation (SMPC) protocol among each other to determine an optimal set of kidney exchanges.

We have implemented the protocol in the SMPC benchmarking framework MP-SPDZ and provide a comprehensive performance evaluation.

    "title": "Make Reddit Great Again: Assessing Community Effects of Moderation  Interventions on r/The_Donald",
    "abstract": "The subreddit r/The_Donald was repeatedly denounced as a toxic and misbehaving online community, reasons for which it faced a sequence of increasingly constraining moderation interventions by Reddit administrators. It was quarantined in June 2019, restricted in February 2020, and finally banned in June 2020, but despite precursory work on the matter, the effects of this sequence of interventions are still unclear. In this work, we follow a multidimensional causal inference approach to study data containing more than 15M posts made in a time frame of 2 years, to examine the effects of such interventions within and without the subreddit. We find that the interventions had strong positive effects toward reducing the activity of problematic users both inside and outside of r/The_Donald. However, the interventions also caused an increase in toxicity and led users to share more polarized and less factual news. Additional findings of our study are that the restriction had stronger effects than the quarantine and that core users of r/The_Donald suffered stronger effects than the other users. Overall, our results provide evidence that the interventions had mixed effects and paint a nuanced picture of the consequences of community-level moderation strategies. We conclude by reflecting on the challenges of policing online platforms and by discussing implications for the design and deployment of moderation interventions. ",

    "abstract": "This paper introduces a new theoretical framework for optimizing second-order behaviors of wireless networks. Unlike existing techniques for network utility maximization, which only considers first-order statistics, this framework models every random process by its mean and temporal variance. The inclusion of temporal variance makes this framework well-suited for modeling stateful fading wireless channels and emerging network performance metrics such as age-of-information (AoI). Using this framework, we sharply characterize the second-order capacity region of wireless access networks. We also propose a simple scheduling policy and prove that it can achieve every interior point in the second-order capacity region. To demonstrate the utility of this framework, we apply it for an important open problem: the optimization of AoI over Gilbert-Elliott channels. We show that this framework provides a very accurate characterization of AoI. Moreover, it leads to a tractable scheduling policy that outperforms other existing work. ",

    "abstract": "Pattern matching on graphs has been widely studied lately due to its importance in genomics applications. Unfortunately, even the simplest problem of deciding if a string appears as a subpath of a graph admits a quadratic lower bound under the Orthogonal Vectors Hypothesis (Equi et al. ICALP 2019, SOFSEM 2021). To avoid this bottleneck, the research has shifted towards more specific graph classes, e.g. those induced from multiple sequence alignments (MSAs). Consider segmenting $\\mathsf{MSA}[1..m,1..n]$ into $b$ blocks $\\mathsf{MSA}[1..m,1..j_1]$, $\\mathsf{MSA}[1..m,j_1+1..j_2]$, $\\ldots$, $\\mathsf{MSA}[1..m,j_{b-1}+1..n]$. The distinct strings in the rows of the blocks, after the removal of gap symbols, form the nodes of an elastic founder graph (EFG) where the edges represent the original connections observed in the MSA. An EFG is called indexable if a node label occurs as a prefix of only those paths that start from a node of the same block. Equi et al. (ISAAC 2021) showed that such EFGs support fast pattern matching and gave an $O(mn \\log m)$-time algorithm for preprocessing the MSA in a way that allows the construction of indexable EFGs maximizing the number of blocks and, alternatively, minimizing the maximum length of a block, in $O(n)$ and $O(n \\log\\log n)$ time respectively. Using the suffix tree and solving a novel ancestor problem on trees, we improve the preprocessing to $O(mn)$ time and the $O(n \\log \\log n)$-time EFG construction to $O(n)$ time, thus showing that both types of indexable EFGs can be constructed in time linear in the input size.

However, it remains challenging to make these two data sources complementary and beneficial to each other. In this paper, we propose \\textit{AutoAlign}, an automatic feature fusion strategy for 3D object detection. Instead of establishing deterministic correspondence with camera projection matrix, we model the mapping relationship between the image and point clouds with a learnable alignment map. This map enables our model to automate the alignment of non-homogenous features in a dynamic and data-driven manner. Specifically, a cross-attention feature alignment module is devised to adaptively aggregate \\textit{pixel-level} image features for each voxel. To enhance the semantic consistency during feature alignment, we also design a self-supervised cross-modal feature interaction module, through which the model can learn feature aggregation with \\textit{instance-level} feature guidance. Extensive experimental results show that our approach can lead to 2.3 mAP and 7.0 mAP improvements on the KITTI and nuScenes datasets, respectively. Notably, our best model reaches 70.9 NDS on the nuScenes testing leaderboard, achieving competitive performance among various state-of-the-arts. ",

To do this, the agent has to decide its sequence of target-visits and the corresponding dwell-times at each visited target. For a given visiting sequence, we prove that in an optimal dwelling time allocation the peak uncertainty is the same among all the targets. This allows us to formulate the optimization of dwelling times as a resource allocation problem and to solve it using a novel efficient algorithm. Next, we optimize the visiting sequence using a greedy exploration process, using heuristics inspired by others developed in the context of the traveling salesman problem.

The special case with one link connecting each node has been studied by Fong et. al [1], and a multi-hop multi-link setting has been studied by Domanovitz et. al [2]. The topology with three nodes and multiple links is studied in this paper. Each link is subject to a different number of erasures due to different channel conditions. An information-theoretic upper bound is derived, and an achievable scheme is presented. The proposed scheme judiciously allocates rates for each link based on the concept of delay spectrum. The achievable scheme is compared to two baseline schemes and the scheme proposed in [2]. Experimental results show that this scheme achieves higher rates than the other schemes, and can achieve the upper bound even in non-trivial scenarios. The scheme is further extended to handle different propagation delays in each link, something not previously considered in the literature. Simulations over statistical channels show that the proposed scheme can outperform the simpler baseline under practical models. ",

We compare the state-of-the-art methods and highlight that experimental performance is still not very good.

    "abstract": "In a cooperative multiagent system, a collection of agents executes a joint policy in order to achieve some common objective. The successful deployment of such systems hinges on the availability of reliable inter-agent communication. However, many sources of potential disruption to communication exist in practice, such as radio interference, hardware failure, and adversarial attacks. In this work, we develop joint policies for cooperative multiagent systems that are robust to potential losses in communication. More specifically, we develop joint policies for cooperative Markov games with reach-avoid objectives. First, we propose an algorithm for the decentralized execution of joint policies during periods of communication loss. Next, we use the total correlation of the state-action process induced by a joint policy as a measure of the intrinsic dependencies between the agents. We then use this measure to lower-bound the performance of a joint policy when communication is lost. Finally, we present an algorithm that maximizes a proxy to this lower bound in order to synthesize minimum-dependency joint policies that are robust to communication loss. Numerical experiments show that the proposed minimum-dependency policies require minimal coordination between the agents while incurring little to no loss in performance; the total correlation value of the synthesized policy is one fifth of the total correlation value of the baseline policy which does not take potential communication losses into account. As a result, the performance of the minimum-dependency policies remains consistently high regardless of whether or not communication is available. By contrast, the performance of the baseline policy decreases by twenty percent when communication is lost. ",

    "abstract": "Object detection is increasingly used onboard Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) for various applications; however, the machine learning (ML) models for UAV-based detection are often validated using data curated for tasks unrelated to the UAV application. This is a concern because training neural networks on large-scale benchmarks have shown excellent capability in generic object detection tasks, yet conventional training approaches can lead to large inference errors for UAV-based images. Such errors arise due to differences in imaging conditions between images from UAVs and images in training. To overcome this problem, we characterize boundary conditions of ML models, beyond which the models exhibit rapid degradation in detection accuracy. Our work is focused on understanding the impact of different UAV-based imaging conditions on detection performance by using synthetic data generated using a game engine. Properties of the game engine are exploited to populate the synthetic datasets with realistic and annotated images. Specifically, it enables the fine control of various parameters, such as camera position, view angle, illumination conditions, and object pose. Using the synthetic datasets, we analyze detection accuracy in different imaging conditions as a function of the above parameters. We use three well-known neural network models with different model complexity in our work. In our experiment, we observe and quantify the following: 1) how detection accuracy drops as the camera moves toward the nadir-view region; 2) how detection accuracy varies depending on different object poses, and 3) the degree to which the robustness of the models changes as illumination conditions vary.

The proposed formulation relies on the discrete extension operator proposed in the aggregated finite element method. This formulation is robust with respect to the location of the boundary/interface within the cell. One can prove enhanced stability results, not only on the physical domain, but on the whole active mesh. However, the stability constants grow exponentially with the polynomial order being used, since the underlying extension operators are defined via extrapolation. To address this issue, we introduce a new variant of aggregated finite elements, in which the extension in the physical domain is an interpolation for polynomials of order higher than two. As a result, the stability constants only grow at a polynomial rate with the order of approximation. We demonstrate that this approach enables robust high-order approximations with the aggregated finite element method. ",

However, the political discourse is increasingly characterized by hate speech, which affects not only the reputation of individual politicians but also the functioning of society at large. In this work, we empirically analyze how the amount of hate speech in replies to posts from politicians on Twitter depends on personal characteristics, such as their party affiliation, gender, and ethnicity. For this purpose, we employ Twitter's Historical API to collect every tweet posted by members of the 117th U.S. Congress for an observation period of more than six months. Additionally, we gather replies for each tweet and use machine learning to predict the amount of hate speech they embed. Subsequently, we implement hierarchical regression models to analyze whether politicians with certain characteristics receive more hate speech. We find that tweets are particularly likely to receive hate speech in replies if they are authored by (i) persons of color from the Democratic party, (ii) white Republicans, and (iii) women. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that more negative sentiment (in the source tweet) is associated with more hate speech (in replies). However, the association varies across parties: negative sentiment attracts more hate speech for Democrats (vs. Republicans). Altogether, our empirical findings imply significant differences in how politicians are treated on social media depending on their party affiliation, gender, and ethnicity. ",

    "abstract": "Although autonomous vehicles (AVs) are expected to revolutionize transportation, robust perception across a wide range of driving contexts remains a significant challenge. Techniques to fuse sensor data from camera, radar, and lidar sensors have been proposed to improve AV perception. However, existing methods are insufficiently robust in difficult driving contexts (e.g., bad weather, low light, sensor obstruction) due to rigidity in their fusion implementations. These methods fall into two broad categories: (i) early fusion, which fails when sensor data is noisy or obscured, and (ii) late fusion, which cannot leverage features from multiple sensors and thus produces worse estimates. To address these limitations, we propose HydraFusion: a selective sensor fusion framework that learns to identify the current driving context and fuses the best combination of sensors to maximize robustness without compromising efficiency. HydraFusion is the first approach to propose dynamically adjusting between early fusion, late fusion, and combinations in-between, thus varying both how and when fusion is applied. We show that, on average, HydraFusion outperforms early and late fusion approaches by 13.66% and 14.54%, respectively, without increasing computational complexity or energy consumption on the industry-standard Nvidia Drive PX2 AV hardware platform. We also propose and evaluate both static and deep-learning-based context identification strategies.

In this work, to unleash the power of representation learning in OL2R, we propose to directly learn a neural ranking model from users' implicit feedback (e.g., clicks) collected on the fly. We focus on RankNet and LambdaRank, due to their great empirical success and wide adoption in offline settings, and control the notorious explore-exploit trade-off based on the convergence analysis of neural networks using neural tangent kernel. Specifically, in each round of result serving, exploration is only performed on document pairs where the predicted rank order between the two documents is uncertain; otherwise, the ranker's predicted order will be followed in result ranking. We prove that under standard assumptions our OL2R solution achieves a gap-dependent upper regret bound of $O(\\log^2(T))$, in which the regret is defined on the total number of mis-ordered pairs over $T$ rounds. Comparisons against an extensive set of state-of-the-art OL2R baselines on two public learning to rank benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed solution. ",

    "abstract": "In the evolutionary multi-objective optimization (EMO) field, the standard practice is to present the final population of an EMO algorithm as the output. However, it has been shown that the final population often includes solutions which are dominated by other solutions generated and discarded in previous generations. Recently, a new EMO framework has been proposed to solve this issue by storing all the non-dominated solutions generated during the evolution in an archive and selecting a subset of solutions from the archive as the output. The key component in this framework is the subset selection from the archive which usually stores a large number of candidate solutions. However, most studies on subset selection focus on small candidate solution sets for environmental selection. There is no benchmark test suite for large-scale subset selection. This paper aims to fill this research gap by proposing a benchmark test suite for subset selection from large candidate solution sets, and comparing some representative methods using the proposed test suite. The proposed test suite together with the benchmarking studies provides a baseline for researchers to understand, use, compare, and develop subset selection methods in the EMO field. ",

    "abstract": "As the problems to be optimized with deep learning become more practical, their datasets inevitably contain a variety of noise, such as mislabeling and substitution by estimated inputs/outputs, which would have negative impacts on the optimization results. As a safety net, it is a natural idea to improve a stochastic gradient descent (SGD) optimizer, which updates the network parameters as the final process of learning, to be more robust to noise. The related work revealed that the first momentum utilized in the Adam-like SGD optimizers can be modified based on the noise-robust student's t-distribution, resulting in inheriting the robustness to noise. In this paper, we propose AdaTerm, which derives not only the first momentum but also all the involved statistics based on the student's t-distribution. If the computed gradients seem to probably be aberrant, AdaTerm is expected to exclude the computed gradients for updates, and reinforce the robustness for the next updates; otherwise, it updates the network parameters normally, and can relax the robustness for the next updates. With this noise-adaptive behavior, the excellent learning performance of AdaTerm was confirmed via typical optimization problems with several cases where the noise ratio would be different. ",

    "abstract": "Recently, recommendation based on causal inference has gained much attention in the industrial community. The introduction of causal techniques into recommender systems (RS) has brought great development to this field and has gradually become a trend. However, a unified causal analysis framework has not been established yet. On one hand, the existing causal methods in RS lack a clear causal and mathematical formalization on the scientific questions of interest. Many confusions need to be clarified: what exactly is being estimated, for what purpose, in which scenario, by which technique, and under what plausible assumptions. On the other hand, technically speaking, the existence of various biases is the main obstacle to drawing causal conclusions from observed data. Yet, formal definitions of the biases in RS are still not clear. Both of the limitations greatly hinder the development of RS. In this paper, we attempt to give a causal analysis framework to accommodate different scenarios in RS, thereby providing a principled and rigorous operational guideline for causal recommendation. We first propose a step-by-step guideline on how to clarify and investigate problems in RS using causal concepts. Then, we provide a new taxonomy and give a formal definition of various biases in RS from the perspective of violating what assumptions are adopted in standard causal analysis. Finally, we find that many problems in RS can be well formalized into a few scenarios using the proposed causal analysis framework. ",

Such problems are practically relevant when a decision maker (DM) is interested in identifying alternative designs with similar performance. There has been significant research interest in recent years to develop efficient algorithms to deal with MMOPs. However, the existing algorithms still require prohibitive number of function evaluations (often in several thousands) to deal with problems involving as low as two objectives and two variables. The algorithms are typically embedded with sophisticated, customized mechanisms that require additional parameters to manage the diversity and convergence in the variable and the objective spaces. In this letter, we introduce a steady-state evolutionary algorithm for solving MMOPs, with a simple design and no additional userdefined parameters that need tuning compared to a standard EA. We report its performance on 21 MMOPs from various test suites that are widely used for benchmarking using a low computational budget of 1000 function evaluations. The performance of the proposed algorithm is compared with six state-of-the-art algorithms (MO Ring PSO SCD, DN-NSGAII, TriMOEA-TA&R, CPDEA, MMOEA/DC and MMEA-WI). The proposed algorithm exhibits significantly better performance than the above algorithms based on the established metrics including IGDX, PSP and IGD.

    "abstract": "Hate speech is a major issue in social networks due to the high volume of data generated daily. Recent works demonstrate the usefulness of machine learning (ML) in dealing with the nuances required to distinguish between hateful posts from just sarcasm or offensive language. Many ML solutions for hate speech detection have been proposed by either changing how features are extracted from the text or the classification algorithm employed. However, most works consider only one type of feature extraction and classification algorithm. This work argues that a combination of multiple feature extraction techniques and different classification models is needed. We propose a framework to analyze the relationship between multiple feature extraction and classification techniques to understand how they complement each other. The framework is used to select a subset of complementary techniques to compose a robust multiple classifiers system (MCS) for hate speech detection. The experimental study considering four hate speech classification datasets demonstrates that the proposed framework is a promising methodology for analyzing and designing high-performing MCS for this task. MCS system obtained using the proposed framework significantly outperforms the combination of all models and the homogeneous and heterogeneous selection heuristics, demonstrating the importance of having a proper selection scheme.

The probability of detection is a nonlinear function of the aircraft pose and radar position. Current path planning techniques for this application assume that the aircraft pose is deterministic. In practice, however, the aircraft pose is estimated using a navigation filter and therefore contains uncertainty. The uncertainty in the aircraft pose induces uncertainty in the probability of detection, but this phenomenon is generally not considered when path planning. This paper provides a method for combining aircraft pose uncertainty with single-pulse radar detection models to aid mission planning efforts. The method linearizes the expression for the probability of detection and three radar cross section models. The linearized models are then used to determine the variability of the probability of detection induced by uncertainty in the aircraft pose. The results of this paper validate the linearization using Monte Carlo analysis and explore the sensitivity of the probability of detection to aircraft pose uncertainty. ",

In particular, we show that the optimal solution of the maximum likelihood estimator can be refined to distances on graphs based on a novel statistical distance centrality that captures the optimality of the nonconvex problem. An efficient contact tracing algorithm is then proposed to solve the general case of finite degree-regular graphs with multiple cycles. Our performance evaluation on a variety of graphs shows that our algorithms outperform the existing state-of-the-art heuristics using contact tracing data from the SARS-CoV 2003 and COVID-19 pandemics by correctly identifying the superspreaders on some of the largest superspreading infection clusters in Singapore and Taiwan.

Once they are trained, deep learning models can be deployed on edge computers to perform classification and prediction on real-time data for these applications. Particularly for large models, the limited computational and memory resources on a single edge device can become the throughput bottleneck for an inference pipeline. To increase throughput and decrease per-device compute load, we present DEFER (Distributed Edge inFERence), a framework for distributed edge inference, which partitions deep neural networks into layers that can be spread across multiple compute nodes. The architecture consists of a single \"dispatcher\" node to distribute DNN partitions and inference data to respective compute nodes. The compute nodes are connected in a series pattern where each node's computed result is relayed to the subsequent node. The result is then returned to the Dispatcher. We quantify the throughput, energy consumption, network payload, and overhead for our framework under realistic network conditions using the CORE network emulator. We find that for the ResNet50 model, the inference throughput of DEFER with 8 compute nodes is 53% higher and per node energy consumption is 63% lower than single device inference. We further reduce network communication demands and energy consumption using the ZFP serialization and LZ4 compression algorithms.

In the last few years, these algorithms have progressed tremendously. Transformer architecture and sentence encoders have proven to give superior results on natural language processing tasks. But a major limitation of these architectures is their applicability for text no longer than a few hundred words. In this paper, we explore hierarchical transfer learning approaches for long document classification. We employ pre-trained Universal Sentence Encoder (USE) and Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) in a hierarchical setup to capture better representations efficiently. Our proposed models are conceptually simple where we divide the input data into chunks and then pass this through base models of BERT and USE. Then output representation for each chunk is then propagated through a shallow neural network comprising of LSTMs or CNNs for classifying the text data. These extensions are evaluated on 6 benchmark datasets. We show that USE + CNN/LSTM performs better than its stand-alone baseline. Whereas the BERT + CNN/LSTM performs on par with its stand-alone counterpart. However, the hierarchical BERT models are still desirable as it avoids the quadratic complexity of the attention mechanism in BERT. Along with the hierarchical approaches, this work also provides a comparison of different deep learning algorithms like USE, BERT, HAN, Longformer, and BigBird for long document classification. The Longformer approach consistently performs well on most of the datasets. ",

The lack of detection methods limits the use of the tracking methods in real-world applications and is a bottleneck for fully autonomous applications that work with these objects. This paper proposes an approach for detecting deformable one-dimensional objects which can handle crossings and occlusions. It can be used for tasks such as routing and manipulation and automatically provides the initialization required by the tracking methods. Our algorithm takes an image containing a deformable object and outputs a chain of fixed-length cylindrical segments connected with passive spherical joints. The chain follows the natural behavior of the deformable object and fills the gaps and occlusions in the original image. Our tests and experiments have shown that the method can correctly detect deformable one-dimensional objects in various complex conditions. ",

To reduce the degradation of performance after pruning, many methods utilize the loss with sparse regularization to produce structured sparsity. In this paper, we analyze these sparsity-training-based methods and find that the regularization of unpruned channels is unnecessary. Moreover, it restricts the network's capacity, which leads to under-fitting. To solve this problem, we propose a novel pruning method, named MaskSparsity, with pruning-aware sparse regularization. MaskSparsity imposes the fine-grained sparse regularization on the specific filters selected by a pruning mask, rather than all the filters of the model. Before the fine-grained sparse regularization of MaskSparity, we can use many methods to get the pruning mask, such as running the global sparse regularization. MaskSparsity achieves 63.03%-FLOPs reduction on ResNet-110 by removing 60.34% of the parameters, with no top-1 accuracy loss on CIFAR-10. On ILSVRC-2012, MaskSparsity reduces more than 51.07% FLOPs on ResNet-50, with only a loss of 0.76% in the top-1 accuracy. The code is released at https://github.com/CASIA-IVA-Lab/MaskSparsity.

Electronic health records (EHRs), which contain heterogeneous patient information, are widely used in disease risk prediction tasks. One challenge of applying AI models for risk prediction lies in generating interpretable evidence to support the prediction results while retaining the prediction ability. In order to address this problem, we propose the method of jointly embedding words and labels whereby attention modules learn the weights of words from medical notes according to their relevance to the names of risk prediction labels. This approach boosts interpretability by employing an attention mechanism and including the names of prediction tasks in the model. However, its application is only limited to the handling of textual inputs such as medical notes. In this paper, we propose a label dependent attention model LDAM to 1) improve the interpretability by exploiting Clinical-BERT (a biomedical language model pre-trained on a large clinical corpus) to encode biomedically meaningful features and labels jointly; 2) extend the idea of joint embedding to the processing of time-series data, and develop a multi-modal learning framework for integrating heterogeneous information from medical notes and time-series health status indicators. To demonstrate our method, we apply LDAM to the MIMIC-III dataset to predict different disease risks. We evaluate our method both quantitatively and qualitatively. Specifically, the predictive power of LDAM will be shown, and case studies will be carried out to illustrate its interpretability. ",

Our model is featured in the following aspects. First, we adopt a label-dependent mechanism that gives greater attention to words from medical notes that are semantically similar to the names of risk labels. Secondly, as the clinical events (e.g., treatments and drugs) can also indicate the health status of patients, our model utilizes the information from events and uses them to generate an event-guided representation of medical notes. Thirdly, both label-dependent and event-guided representations are integrated to make a robust prediction, in which the interpretability is enabled by the attention weights over words from medical notes. To demonstrate the applicability of the proposed method, we apply it to the MIMIC-III dataset, which contains real-world EHRs collected from hospitals. Our method is evaluated in both quantitative and qualitative ways. ",

    "abstract": "Scene Graph Generation (SGG) aims to build a structured representation of a scene using objects and pairwise relationships, which benefits downstream tasks. However, current SGG methods usually suffer from sub-optimal scene graph generation because of the long-tailed distribution of training data. To address this problem, we propose Resistance Training using Prior Bias (RTPB) for the scene graph generation. Specifically, RTPB uses a distributed-based prior bias to improve models' detecting ability on less frequent relationships during training, thus improving the model generalizability on tail categories. In addition, to further explore the contextual information of objects and relationships, we design a contextual encoding backbone network, termed as Dual Transformer (DTrans). We perform extensive experiments on a very popular benchmark, VG150, to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method for the unbiased scene graph generation. In specific, our RTPB achieves an improvement of over 10% under the mean recall when applied to current SGG methods. Furthermore, DTrans with RTPB outperforms nearly all state-of-the-art methods with a large margin. ",

    "abstract": "This paper investigates sensor scheduling for state estimation of complex networks over shared transmission channels. For a complex network of dynamical systems, referred to as nodes, a sensor network is adopted to measure and estimate the system states in a distributed way, where a sensor is used to measure a node. The estimates are transmitted from sensors to the associated nodes, in the presence of one-step time delay and subject to packet loss. Due to limited transmission capability, only a portion of sensors are allowed to send information at each time step. The goal of this paper is to seek an optimal sensor scheduling policy minimizing the overall estimation errors. Under a distributed state estimation framework, this problem is reformulated as a Markov decision process, where the one-stage reward for each node is strongly coupled. The feasibility of the problem reformulation is ensured. In addition, an easy-to-check condition is established to guarantee the existence of an optimal deterministic and stationary policy. Moreover, it is found that the optimal policies have a threshold, which can be used to reduce the computational complexity in obtaining these policies. Finally, the effectiveness of the theoretical results is illustrated by several simulation examples. ",

    "abstract": "Online multi-object tracking (MOT) is a longstanding task for computer vision and intelligent vehicle platform. At present, the main paradigm is tracking-by-detection, and the main difficulty of this paradigm is how to associate the current candidate detection with the historical tracklets. However, in the MOT scenarios, each historical tracklet is composed of an object sequence, while each candidate detection is just a flat image, which lacks the temporal features of the object sequence. The feature difference between current candidate detection and historical tracklets makes the object association much harder. Therefore, we propose a Spatial-Temporal Mutual {Representation} Learning (STURE) approach which learns spatial-temporal representations between current candidate detection and historical sequence in a mutual representation space. For the historical trackelets, the detection learning network is forced to match the representations of sequence learning network in a mutual representation space. The proposed approach is capable of extracting more distinguishing detection and sequence representations by using various designed losses in object association. As a result, spatial-temporal feature is learned mutually to reinforce the current detection features, and the feature difference can be relieved. To prove the robustness of the STURE, it is applied to the public MOT challenge benchmarks and performs well compared with various state-of-the-art online MOT trackers based on identity-preserving metrics.

Existing work of high-level synthesis (HLS) performance prediction usually needs extensive feature engineering after the synthesis process. To expedite circuit evaluation from as earlier design stage as possible, we propose a rapid and accurate performance modeling, exploiting the representation power of graph neural networks (GNNs) by representing C/C++ programs as graphs. The contribution of this work is three-fold. First, we build a standard benchmark containing 40k C synthesizable programs, which includes both synthetic programs and three sets of real-world HLS benchmarks. Each program is implemented on FPGA to generate ground-truth performance metrics. Second, we formally formulate the HLS performance prediction problem on graphs, and propose multiple modeling strategies with GNNs that leverage different trade-offs between prediction timeliness (early/late prediction) and accuracy. Third, we further propose a novel hierarchical GNN that does not sacrifice timeliness but largely improves prediction accuracy, significantly outperforming HLS tools. We apply extensive evaluations for both synthetic and unseen real-case programs; our proposed predictor largely outperforms HLS by up to 40X and excels existing predictors by 2X to 5X in terms of resource usage and timing prediction.

We recently proposed Deep Learning (DL) models targeting the automation of two tasks: the first model takes as input a code submitted for review and implements in it changes likely to be recommended by a reviewer; the second takes as input the submitted code and a reviewer comment posted in natural language and automatically implements the change required by the reviewer. While the preliminary results we achieved are encouraging, both models had been tested in rather simple code review scenarios, substantially simplifying the targeted problem. This was also due to the choices we made when designing both the technique and the experiments. In this paper, we build on top of that work by demonstrating that a pre-trained Text-To-Text Transfer Transformer (T5) model can outperform previous DL models for automating code review tasks.

Our RePre extends contrastive frameworks by adding a branch for reconstructing raw image pixels in parallel with the existing contrastive objective. RePre is equipped with a lightweight convolution-based decoder that fuses the multi-hierarchy features from the transformer encoder. The multi-hierarchy features provide rich supervisions from low to high semantic information, which are crucial for our RePre. Our RePre brings decent improvements on various contrastive frameworks with different vision transformer architectures. Transfer performance in downstream tasks outperforms supervised pre-training and state-of-the-art (SOTA) self-supervised counterparts. ",

In this work, we consider the problem of finding a minimal node separator whose removal separates a graph into multiple different connected components with fewer than a limited number of vertices in each component. To solve it, we propose a frequent itemset-driven search approach, which integrates the concept of frequent itemset mining in data mining into the well-known memetic search framework. Starting from a high-quality population built by the solution construction and population repair procedures, it iteratively employs the frequent itemset recombination operator (to generate promising offspring solution based on itemsets that frequently occur in high-quality solutions), tabu search-based simulated annealing (to find high-quality local optima), population repair procedure (to modify the population), and rank-based population management strategy (to guarantee a healthy population). Extensive evaluations on 50 widely used benchmark instances show that it significantly outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms. In particular, it discovers 29 new upper bounds and matches 18 previous best-known bounds.

For the TFI-HSS task, the PINN-TFI method encodes constrain terms into the loss function, thus the task is transformed into an optimization problem of minimizing the loss function. In addition, we have found that noise observations significantly affect reconstruction performances of the PINN-TFI method. To alleviate the effect of noise observations, the CMCN-PSO method is proposed to find optimal positions, where the condition number of observations is used to evaluate positions. The results demonstrate that the PINN-TFI method can significantly improve prediction precisions and the CMCN-PSO method can find good positions to acquire a more robust temperature field. ",

In this paper, we focus on the evidence-based fake news detection, where several evidences are utilized to probe the veracity of news (i.e., a claim). Most previous methods first employ sequential models to embed the semantic information and then capture the claim-evidence interaction based on different attention mechanisms. Despite their effectiveness, they still suffer from two main weaknesses. Firstly, due to the inherent drawbacks of sequential models, they fail to integrate the relevant information that is scattered far apart in evidences for veracity checking. Secondly, they neglect much redundant information contained in evidences that may be useless or even harmful. To solve these problems, we propose a unified Graph-based sEmantic sTructure mining framework, namely GET in short. Specifically, different from the existing work that treats claims and evidences as sequences, we model them as graph-structured data and capture the long-distance semantic dependency among dispersed relevant snippets via neighborhood propagation. After obtaining contextual semantic information, our model reduces information redundancy by performing graph structure learning. Finally, the fine-grained semantic representations are fed into the downstream claim-evidence interaction module for predictions. Comprehensive experiments have demonstrated the superiority of GET over the state-of-the-arts. ",

For video generation, there is a recent progress in this area by considering motion and appearance as orthogonal information and designing architectures that efficiently disentangle them. These approaches rely on handcrafting architectures that impose structural priors on the generator to decompose appearance and motion codes in the latent space. Inspired from the recent advancements in the autoencoder based image generation, we present AVLAE (Adversarial Video Latent AutoEncoder) which is a two stream latent autoencoder where the video distribution is learned by adversarial training. In particular, we propose to autoencode the motion and appearance latent vectors of the video generator in the adversarial setting. We demonstrate that our approach learns to disentangle motion and appearance codes even without the explicit structural composition in the generator.

However, the robustness, including robustness to trimaps and generalization to images from different domains, is still under-explored. Although some works propose to either refine the trimaps or adapt the algorithms to real-world images via extra data augmentation, none of them has taken both into consideration, not to mention the significant performance deterioration on benchmarks while using those data augmentation. To fill this gap, we propose an image matting method which achieves higher robustness (RMat) via multilevel context assembling and strong data augmentation targeting matting. Specifically, we first build a strong matting framework by modeling ample global information with transformer blocks in the encoder, and focusing on details in combination with convolution layers as well as a low-level feature assembling attention block in the decoder. Then, based on this strong baseline, we analyze current data augmentation and explore simple but effective strong data augmentation to boost the baseline model and contribute a more generalizable matting method. Compared with previous methods, the proposed method not only achieves state-of-the-art results on the Composition-1k benchmark (11% improvement on SAD and 27% improvement on Grad) with smaller model size, but also shows more robust generalization results on other benchmarks, on real-world images, and also on varying coarse-to-fine trimaps with our extensive experiments.

The challenges do not only lie in understanding the complex driving scenarios but also the numerous possible interactions among road users and environments, which are practically not feasible for explicit modeling. In this work, we tackle the above challenges by jointly learning and predicting the motion of all road users in a scene, using a novel convolutional neural network (CNN) and recurrent neural network (RNN) based architecture. Moreover, by exploiting grid-based input and output data structures, the computational cost is independent of the number of road users and multi-modal predictions become inherent properties of our proposed method. Evaluation on the nuScenes dataset shows that our approach reaches state-of-the-art results in the prediction benchmark. ",

    "abstract": "IPv6 Routing Protocol for Low Power and Lossy Networks (RPL) is an essential routing protocol to enable communications for IoT networks with low power devices. RPL uses an objective function and routing constraints to find an optimized routing path for each node in the network. However, recent research has shown that topological attacks, such as selective forwarding attacks, pose great challenges to the secure routing of IoT networks. Many conventional secure routing solutions, on the other hand, are computationally heavy to be directly applied in resource-constrained IoT networks. There is an urgent need to develop lightweight secure routing solutions for IoT networks. In this paper, we first design and implement a series of advanced selective forwarding attacks from the attack perspective, which can flexibly select the type and percentage of forwarding packets in an energy efficient way, and even bad-mouth other innocent nodes in the network. Experiment results show that the proposed attacks can maximize the attack consequences (i.e. number of dropped packets) while maintaining undetected. Moreover, we propose a lightweight trust-based defense solution to detect and eliminate malicious selective forwarding nodes from the network. The results show that the proposed defense solution can achieve high detection accuracy with very limited extra energy usage (i.e. 3.4%). ",

    "abstract": "In order to develop complex relationships between their inputs and outputs, deep neural networks train and adjust large number of parameters. To make these networks work at high accuracy, vast amounts of data are needed. Sometimes, however, the quantity of data needed is not present or obtainable for training. Neuron-specific dropout (NSDropout) is a tool to address this problem. NSDropout looks at both the training pass, and validation pass, of a layer in a model. By comparing the average values produced by each neuron for each class in a data set, the network is able to drop targeted units. The layer is able to predict what features, or noise, the model is looking at during testing that isn't present when looking at samples from validation. Unlike dropout, the \"thinned\" networks cannot be \"unthinned\" for testing. Neuron-specific dropout has proved to achieve similar, if not better, testing accuracy with far less data than traditional methods including dropout and other regularization methods. Experimentation has shown that neuron-specific dropout reduces the chance of a network overfitting and reduces the need for large training samples on supervised learning tasks in image recognition, all while producing best-in-class results.

    "abstract": "Representation knowledge distillation aims at transferring rich information from one model to another. Current approaches for representation distillation mainly focus on the direct minimization of distance metrics between the models' embedding vectors. Such direct methods may be limited in transferring high-order dependencies embedded in the representation vectors, or in handling the capacity gap between the teacher and student models. In this paper, we introduce two approaches for enhancing representation distillation using classifier sharing between the teacher and student. Specifically, we first show that connecting the teacher's classifier to the student backbone and freezing its parameters is beneficial for the process of representation distillation, yielding consistent improvements. Then, we propose an alternative approach that asks to tailor the teacher model to a student with limited capacity. This approach competes with and in some cases surpasses the first method. Via extensive experiments and analysis, we show the effectiveness of the proposed methods on various datasets and tasks, including image classification, fine-grained classification, and face verification. For example, we achieve state-of-the-art performance for face verification on the IJB-C dataset for a MobileFaceNet model: TAR@(FAR=1e-5)=93.7\\%.

It is recommended that the privacy and accountability requirements, and hence the appropriate form of identity, is considered in designing an identification scheme, and in the adoption of a scheme by data processing systems.

However, existing works have paid very much attention to learning structures on homogeneous networks while the related study on heterogeneous networks is still a void. In this paper, we try to take the first step for representation learning on heterostructures, which is very challenging due to their highly diverse combinations of node types and underlying structures. To effectively distinguish diverse heterostructures, we firstly propose a theoretically guaranteed technique called heterogeneous anonymous walk (HAW) and its variant coarse HAW (CHAW). Then, we devise the heterogeneous anonymous walk embedding (HAWE) and its variant coarse HAWE in a data-driven manner to circumvent using an extremely large number of possible walks and train embeddings by predicting occurring walks in the neighborhood of each node. Finally, we design and apply extensive and illustrative experiments on synthetic and real-world networks to build a benchmark on heterostructure learning and evaluate the effectiveness of our methods. The results demonstrate our methods achieve outstanding performance compared with both homogeneous and heterogeneous classic methods, and can be applied on large-scale networks. ",

The equivalence of causal models is then defined in terms of a natural transformation or isomorphism between two such functors, which we call a $\\Phi$-abstraction and $\\Phi$-equivalence, respectively. It is shown that when one model is a $\\Phi$-abstraction of another, the intervention calculus of the former can be consistently translated into that of the latter.

    "abstract": "This paper introduces a method for the detection of knock occurrences in an internal combustion engine (ICE) using a 1D convolutional neural network trained on in-cylinder pressure data. The model architecture was based on considerations regarding the expected frequency characteristics of knocking combustion. To aid the feature extraction, all cycles were reduced to 60{\\deg} CA long windows, with no further processing applied to the pressure traces. The neural networks were trained exclusively on in-cylinder pressure traces from multiple conditions and labels provided by human experts. The best-performing model architecture achieves an accuracy of above 92% on all test sets in a tenfold cross-validation when distinguishing between knocking and non-knocking cycles. In a multi-class problem where each cycle was labeled by the number of experts who rated it as knocking, 78% of cycles were labeled perfectly, while 90% of cycles were classified at most one class from ground truth. They thus considerably outperform the broadly applied MAPO (Maximum Amplitude of Pressure Oscillation) detection method, as well as other references reconstructed from previous works. Our analysis indicates that the neural network learned physically meaningful features connected to engine-characteristic resonance frequencies, thus verifying the intended theory-guided data science approach. Deeper performance investigation further shows remarkable generalization ability to unseen operating points. In addition, the model proved to classify knocking cycles in unseen engines with increased accuracy of 89% after adapting to their features via training on a small number of exclusively non-knocking cycles. The algorithm takes below 1 ms (on CPU) to classify individual cycles, effectively making it suitable for real-time engine control. ",

Many countries which include United States, India, Brazil, United Kingdom, Russia etc were badly affected by covid-19 pandemic due to the large population. The total confirmed cases reported in this country are 51.7M, 34.7M, 22.2M, 11.3M, 10.2M respectively till December 20, 2021.

The early prediction of covid-19 cases helps to track the transmission dynamics & alert the government to take the necessary precautions. Recurrent Deep learning algorithms is a data driven model which plays a key role to capture the patterns present in time series data. In many literatures, the Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) based model are proposed for the efficient prediction of COVID-19 cases for different provinces.

The proposed LSTM model is trained on one state i.e., Maharashtra and tested for rest of the provinces in India. The concept of Explainable AI is involved in this study for the better interpretation & understanding of the model behavior.

We show a severe adversarial vulnerability of even the strongest current OOD detection techniques. With a small, targeted perturbation to the input pixels, we can change the image assignment from an in-distribution to an out-distribution, and vice versa, easily. In particular, we demonstrate severe adversarial vulnerability on the challenging near OOD CIFAR-100 vs CIFAR-10 task, as well as on the far OOD CIFAR-100 vs SVHN. We study the adversarial robustness of several post-processing techniques, including the simple baseline of Maximum of Softmax Probabilities (MSP), the Mahalanobis distance, and the newly proposed \\textit{Relative} Mahalanobis distance. By comparing the loss of OOD detection performance at various perturbation strengths, we demonstrate the beneficial effect of using ensembles of OOD detectors, and the use of the \\textit{Relative} Mahalanobis distance over other post-processing methods.

The availability of a robust automated cervical image classification system can augment the clinical care provider's limitation in traditional visual inspection with acetic acid (VIA). However, there are a wide variety of cervical inspection objectives which impact the labeling criteria for criteria-specific prediction model development. Moreover, due to the lack of confirmatory test results and inter-rater labeling variation, many images are left unlabeled. Motivated by these challenges, we propose a self-supervised learning (SSL) based approach to produce a pre-trained cervix model from unlabeled cervical images. The developed model is further fine-tuned to produce criteria-specific classification models with the available labeled images. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach using two cervical image datasets. Both datasets are partially labeled and labeling criteria are different. The experimental results show that the SSL-based initialization improves classification performance (Accuracy: 2.5% min) and the inclusion of images from both datasets during SSL further improves the performance (Accuracy: 1.5% min). Further, considering data-sharing restrictions, we experimented with the effectiveness of Federated SSL and find that it can improve performance over the SSL model developed with just its images. This justifies the importance of SSL-based cervix model development. We believe that the present research shows a novel direction in developing criteria-specific custom deep models for cervical image classification by combining images from different sources unlabeled and/or labeled with varying criteria, and addressing image access restrictions.

Using causal Shapley values, we analyze socioeconomic disparities that have a causal link to the spread of COVID-19 in the USA. We study several phases of the disease spread to show how the causal connections change over time. We perform a causal analysis using random effects models and discuss the correspondence between the two methods to verify our results. We show the distinct advantages a non-linear machine learning models have over linear models when performing a multivariate analysis, especially since the machine learning models can map out non-linear correlations in the data.

Although a vast amount of open-source Python code is accessible on many online platforms, programmers often find it difficult to restore a successful runtime environment. Previous studies validated automatic inference of Python dependencies using pre-built knowledge bases. However, these studies do not cover sufficient knowledge to accurately match the Python code and also ignore the potential conflicts between their inferred dependencies, thus resulting in a low success rate of inference. In this paper, we propose PyCRE, a new approach to automatically inferring Python compatible runtime environments with domain knowledge graph (KG). Specifically, we design a domain-specific ontology for Python third-party packages and construct KGs for over 10,000 popular packages in Python 2 and Python 3. PyCRE discovers candidate libraries by measuring the matching degree between the known libraries and the third-party resources used in target code. For the NP-complete problem of dependency solving, we propose a heuristic graph traversal algorithm to efficiently guarantee the compatibility between packages. PyCRE achieves superior performance on a real-world dataset and efficiently resolves nearly half more import errors than previous methods. ",

However, the stringent Quality of Service (QoS) constraints imposed by XR's interactive nature require Network Slicing (NS) solutions to support its use over wireless connections: in this context, quasi-Constant Bit Rate (CBR) encoding is a promising solution, as it can increase the predictability of the stream, making the network resource allocation easier. However, traffic characterization of XR streams is still a largely unexplored subject, particularly with this encoding. In this work, we characterize XR streams from more than 4 hours of traces captured in a real setup, analyzing their temporal correlation and proposing two prediction models for future frame size. Our results show that even the state-of-the-art H.264 CBR mode can have significant frame size fluctuations, which can impact the NS optimization. Our proposed prediction models can be applied to different traces, and even to different contents, achieving very similar performance. We also show the trade-off between network resource efficiency and XR QoS in a simple NS use case. ",

    "abstract": "This paper explores previously unknown backdoor risks in HyperNet-based personalized federated learning (HyperNetFL) through poisoning attacks. Based upon that, we propose a novel model transferring attack (called HNTROJ), i.e., the first of its kind, to transfer a local backdoor infected model to all legitimate and personalized local models, which are generated by the HyperNetFL model, through consistent and effective malicious local gradients computed across all compromised clients in the whole training process. As a result, HNTROJ reduces the number of compromised clients needed to successfully launch the attack without any observable signs of sudden shifts or degradation regarding model utility on legitimate data samples making our attack stealthy. To defend against HNTROJ, we adapted several backdoor-resistant FL training algorithms into HyperNetFL. An extensive experiment that is carried out using several benchmark datasets shows that HNTROJ significantly outperforms data poisoning and model replacement attacks and bypasses robust training algorithms.

    "title": "Attention-based Proposals Refinement for 3D Object Detection",
    "abstract": "Safe autonomous driving technology heavily depends on accurate 3D object detection since it produces input to safety critical downstream tasks such as prediction and navigation. Recent advances in this field is made by developing the refinement stage for voxel-based region proposal networks to better strike the balance between accuracy and efficiency. A popular approach among state-of-the-art frameworks is to divide proposals, or Region of Interest (ROI), into grids and extract feature for each grid location before synthesizing them to ROI feature. While achieving impressive performances, such an approach involves a number of hand crafted components (e.g. grid sampling, set abstraction) which requires expert knowledge to be tuned correctly. This paper takes a more data-driven approach to ROI feature extraction using the attention mechanism. Specifically, points inside a ROI are positionally encoded to incorporate ROI 's geometry. The resulted position encoding and their features are transformed into ROI feature via vector attention. Unlike the original multi-head attention, vector attention assign different weights to different channels within a point feature, thus being able to capture a more sophisticated relation between pooled points and ROI. Experiments on KITTI \\textit{validation} set show that our method achieves competitive performance of 84.84 AP for class Car at Moderate difficulty while having the least parameters compared to closely related methods and attaining a quasi-real time inference speed at 15 FPS on NVIDIA V100 GPU.

By studying large sets of real-world Performance Monitoring (PM) data collected from six international optical networks, we find that it is possible to forecast LOS events with good precision 1-7 days before they occur, albeit at relatively low recall, with supervised machine learning (ML). Our study covers twelve facility types, including 100G lines and ETH10G clients. We show that the precision for a given network improves when training on multiple networks simultaneously relative to training on an individual network. Furthermore, we show that it is possible to forecast LOS from all facility types and all networks with a single model, whereas fine-tuning for a particular facility or network only brings modest improvements. Hence our ML models remain effective for optical networks previously unknown to the model, which makes them usable for commercial applications. ",

The non-linear soft margin support vector machine (SVM) problem is used to provide an automatic modulation classifier (AMC) and a signal power to noise and interference ratio (SINR) estimator. The estimation results of AMC and SINR are used to reassign the modulation type, codding rate, and transmit power through frames of eNode B connections. The AMC success rate versus SINR, total power consuming, and sum capacity are evaluated for OFDM-NOMA assisted 5G system. Results show improvement of success rate compared of some published method. Furthermore, the algorithm directly computes SINR after signal is detected by successive interference cancellation (SIC) and before any signal decoding. Moreover, because of the direct sense of physical channel, the presented algorithm can discount occupied symbols (overhead signaling) for channel quality information (CQI) in network communication signaling. The results also prove that the proposed algorithm reduces the total power consumption and increases the sum capacity through the eNode B connections. Simulation results in compare to other algorithms show more successful AMC, efficient SINR estimator, easier practical implantation, less overhead signaling, less power consumption, and more capacity achievement.

To realize these goals often complex technical solutions must be designed and implemented. In practice, however, it is difficult to synchronize the technical design and implementation phase with the definition of moving Smart City goals. We hypothesize that this is due to a lack of a common language for the different stakeholder groups and the technical disciplines. We address this problem with scenario-based requirements engineering techniques. In particular, we use scenarios at different levels of abstraction and formalization that are connected end-to-end by appropriate methods and tools. This enables fast feedback loops to iteratively align technical requirements, stakeholder expectations, and Smart City goals.

To address this shortcoming, we develop \"robust\" extensions of CTL and CTL*, which we name robust CTL (rCTL) and robust CTL* (rCTL*).

    "abstract": "Aircraft detection in Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery is a challenging task in SAR Automatic Target Recognition (SAR ATR) areas due to aircraft's extremely discrete appearance, obvious intraclass variation, small size and serious background's interference. In this paper, a single-shot detector namely Attentional Feature Refinement and Alignment Network (AFRAN) is proposed for detecting aircraft in SAR images with competitive accuracy and speed. Specifically, three significant components including Attention Feature Fusion Module (AFFM), Deformable Lateral Connection Module (DLCM) and Anchor-guided Detection Module (ADM), are carefully designed in our method for refining and aligning informative characteristics of aircraft. To represent characteristics of aircraft with less interference, low-level textural and high-level semantic features of aircraft are fused and refined in AFFM throughly. The alignment between aircraft's discrete back-scatting points and convolutional sampling spots is promoted in DLCM. Eventually, the locations of aircraft are predicted precisely in ADM based on aligned features revised by refined anchors. To evaluate the performance of our method, a self-built SAR aircraft sliced dataset and a large scene SAR image are collected. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments with detailed analysis illustrate the effectiveness of the three proposed components. Furthermore, the topmost detection accuracy and competitive speed are achieved by our method compared with other domain-specific,e.g., DAPN, PADN, and general CNN-based methods,e.g., FPN, Cascade R-CNN, SSD, RefineDet and RPDet.

Change point detection methods have the ability to discover changes in an unsupervised fashion, which represents a desirable property in the analysis of unbounded and unlabeled data streams. However, one limitation of most of the existing approaches is represented by their limited ability to handle multivariate and high-dimensional data, which is frequently observed in modern applications such as traffic flow prediction, human activity recognition, and smart grids monitoring. In this paper, we attempt to fill this gap by proposing WATCH, a novel Wasserstein distance-based change point detection approach that models an initial distribution and monitors its behavior while processing new data points, providing accurate and robust detection of change points in dynamic high-dimensional data. An extensive experimental evaluation involving a large number of benchmark datasets shows that WATCH is capable of accurately identifying change points and outperforming state-of-the-art methods. ",

In this paper, we question whether we can tackle this issue by harnessing videos of real talking faces, which contain rich information on natural facial appearance and behaviour and are readily available in large quantities online. Our method, termed RealForensics, consists of two stages. First, we exploit the natural correspondence between the visual and auditory modalities in real videos to learn, in a self-supervised cross-modal manner, temporally dense video representations that capture factors such as facial movements, expression, and identity. Second, we use these learned representations as targets to be predicted by our forgery detector along with the usual binary forgery classification task; this encourages it to base its real/fake decision on said factors. We show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on cross-manipulation generalisation and robustness experiments, and examine the factors that contribute to its performance. Our results suggest that leveraging natural and unlabelled videos is a promising direction for the development of more robust face forgery detectors. ",

In this work, we propose MUSE, a new probabilistic modeling framework based on a cascade of Conditional VAEs, which tackles the long-term, uncertain trajectory prediction task using a coarse-to-fine multi-factor forecasting architecture. In its Macro stage, the model learns a joint pixel-space representation of two key factors, the underlying environment and the agent movements, to predict the long and short-term motion goals. Conditioned on them, the Micro stage learns a fine-grained spatio-temporal representation for the prediction of individual agent trajectories. The VAE backbones across the two stages make it possible to naturally account for the joint uncertainty at both levels of granularity. As a result, MUSE offers diverse and simultaneously more accurate predictions compared to the current state-of-the-art. We demonstrate these assertions through a comprehensive set of experiments on nuScenes and SDD benchmarks as well as PFSD, a new synthetic dataset, which challenges the forecasting ability of models on complex agent-environment interaction scenarios.

To address this issue, we propose and investigate an approach that performs a robust acoustic model adaption to a target domain in a cross-lingual, multi-staged manner. Our approach enables the exploitation of large-scale training data from other domains in both the same and other languages. We evaluate our approach using the challenging task of German oral history interviews, where we achieve a relative reduction of the word error rate by more than 30% compared to a model trained from scratch only on the target domain, and 6-7% relative compared to a model trained robustly on 1000 hours of same-language out-of-domain training data.

However, standard DTI estimation methods depend on a large number of high-quality measurements. This would require long scan times and can be particularly difficult to achieve with certain patient populations such as neonates. Here, we propose a method that can accurately estimate the diffusion tensor from only six diffusion-weighted measurements. Our method achieves this by learning to exploit the relationships between the diffusion signals and tensors in neighboring voxels. Our model is based on transformer networks, which represent the state of the art in modeling the relationship between signals in a sequence. In particular, our model consists of two such networks. The first network estimates the diffusion tensor based on the diffusion signals in a neighborhood of voxels. The second network provides more accurate tensor estimations by learning the relationships between the diffusion signals as well as the tensors estimated by the first network in neighboring voxels. Our experiments with three datasets show that our proposed method achieves highly accurate estimations of the diffusion tensor and is significantly superior to three competing methods. Estimations produced by our method with six measurements are comparable with those of standard estimation methods with 30-88 measurements. Hence, our method promises shorter scan times and more reliable assessment of brain white matter, particularly in non-cooperative patients such as neonates and infants. ",

    "abstract": "Message-passing neural networks (MPNN) have shown extremely high efficiency and accuracy in predicting the physical properties of molecules and crystals, and are expected to become the next-generation material simulation tool after the density functional theory (DFT). However, there is currently a lack of a general MPNN framework for directly predicting the tensor properties of the crystals. In this work, a general framework for the prediction of tensor properties was proposed: the tensor property of a crystal can be decomposed into the average of the tensor contributions of all the atoms in the crystal, and the tensor contribution of each atom can be expanded as the sum of the tensor projections in the directions of the edges connecting the atoms. On this basis, the edge-based expansions of force vectors, Born effective charges (BECs), dielectric (DL) and piezoelectric (PZ) tensors were proposed. These expansions are rotationally equivariant, while the coefficients in these tensor expansions are rotationally invariant scalars which are similar to physical quantities such as formation energy and band gap. The advantage of this tensor prediction framework is that it does not require the network itself to be equivariant. Therefore, in this work, we directly designed the edge-based tensor prediction graph neural network (ETGNN) model on the basis of the invariant graph neural network to predict tensors. The validity and high precision of this tensor prediction framework were shown by the tests of ETGNN on the extended systems, random perturbed structures and JARVIS-DFT datasets. This tensor prediction framework is general for nearly all the GNNs and can achieve higher accuracy with more advanced GNNs in the future. ",

This is achieved via suppressing the causal probability of non-causal variables by a wide margin. In ablation studies, we further demonstrate that the assignment of causal probabilities by AutoCI remain consistent in the presence of confounders.

Experimental results demonstrate that our 2-stage model has also achieved SOTA on color VCS reconstruction, leading to a >2.3dB gain in PSNR over the previous SOTA algorithm based on plug-and-play framework, meanwhile speeds up the reconstruction by >17 times. In addition, we have found that our network is also flexible to the mask modulation and scale size for color VCS reconstruction so that a single trained network can be applied to different hardware systems. The code and models will be released to the public. ",

    "abstract": "Current state of the art acoustic models can easily comprise more than 100 million parameters. This growing complexity demands larger training datasets to maintain a decent generalization of the final decision function. An ideal dataset is not necessarily large in size, but large with respect to the amount of unique speakers, utilized hardware and varying recording conditions. This enables a machine learning model to explore as much of the domain-specific input space as possible during parameter estimation. This work introduces Common Phone, a gender-balanced, multilingual corpus recorded from more than 76.000 contributors via Mozilla's Common Voice project. It comprises around 116 hours of speech enriched with automatically generated phonetic segmentation. A Wav2Vec 2.0 acoustic model was trained with the Common Phone to perform phonetic symbol recognition and validate the quality of the generated phonetic annotation. The architecture achieved a PER of 18.1 % on the entire test set, computed with all 101 unique phonetic symbols, showing slight differences between the individual languages. We conclude that Common Phone provides sufficient variability and reliable phonetic annotation to help bridging the gap between research and application of acoustic models. ",

    "abstract": "Diabetic retinopathy refers to the pathology of the retina induced by diabetes and is one of the leading causes of preventable blindness in the world. Early detection of diabetic retinopathy is critical to avoid vision problem through continuous screening and treatment. In traditional clinical practice, the involved lesions are manually detected using photographs of the fundus. However, this task is cumbersome and time-consuming and requires intense effort due to the small size of lesion and low contrast of the images. Thus, computer-assisted diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy based on the detection of red lesions is actively being explored recently. In this paper, we present a convolutional neural network with residual skip connection for the segmentation of exudates in retinal images. To improve the performance of network architecture, a suitable image augmentation technique is used. The proposed network can robustly segment exudates with high accuracy, which makes it suitable for diabetic retinopathy screening. Comparative performance analysis of three benchmark databases: HEI-MED, E-ophtha, and DiaretDB1 is presented. It is shown that the proposed method achieves accuracy (0.98, 0.99, 0.98) and sensitivity (0.97, 0.92, and 0.95) on E-ophtha, HEI-MED, and DiaReTDB1, respectively. ",

To tackle this problem, we proposed CISRNet; a network that employs a two-stage coarse-to-fine learning framework that is mainly optimized for Compressed Image Super-Resolution Problem. Specifically, CISRNet consists of two main subnetworks; the coarse and refinement network, where recursive and residual learning is employed within these two networks respectively.

COVID19 emerged as a pandemic that affected the whole world in a little while. The most important issue in the fight against the epidemic is the early diagnosis and follow-up of COVID19 (+) patients. Therefore, in addition to the RT-PCR test, medical imaging methods are also used when identifying COVID 19 (+) patients. In this study, an alternative approach was proposed using cough data, one of the most prominent symptoms of COVID19 (+) patients. The performances of z-normalization and min-max normalization methods were investigated on these data. All features were obtained using discrete wavelet transform method. Support vector machines (SVM) was used as classifier algorithm. The highest performances of accuracy and F1-score were obtained as 100% and 100% using the min-max normalization, respectively. On the other hand, the highest accuracy and highest F1-score performances were obtained as 99.2 % and 99.0 % using the z-normalization, respectively. In light of the results, it is clear that cough acoustic data will contribute significantly to controlling COVID19 cases. ",

    "abstract": "Quantitative UltraSound (QUS) aims to reveal information about the tissue microstructure using backscattered echo signals from clinical scanners. Among different QUS parameters, scatterer number density is an important property that can affect estimation of other QUS parameters. Scatterer number density can be classified into high or low scatterer densities. If there are more than 10 scatterers inside the resolution cell, the envelope data is considered as Fully Developed Speckle (FDS) and otherwise, as Under Developed Speckle (UDS). In conventional methods, the envelope data is divided into small overlapping windows (a strategy here we refer to as patching), and statistical parameters such as SNR and skewness are employed to classify each patch of envelope data. However, these parameters are system dependent meaning that their distribution can change by the imaging settings and patch size. Therefore, reference phantoms which have known scatterer number density are imaged with the same imaging settings to mitigate system dependency. In this paper, we aim to segment regions of ultrasound data without any patching. A large dataset is generated which has different shapes of scatterer number density and mean scatterer amplitude using a fast simulation method. We employ a convolutional neural network (CNN) for the segmentation task and investigate the effect of domain shift when the network is tested on different datasets with different imaging settings. Nakagami parametric image is employed for the multi-task learning to improve the performance. Furthermore, inspired by the reference phantom methods in QUS, A domain adaptation stage is proposed which requires only two frames of data from FDS and UDS classes. We evaluate our method for different experimental phantoms and in vivo data. ",

The CNN provides a nonlinear mapping between the shapes and their associated attributes while conserving the equivariance of these attributes to the shape translations.

The CNN-based reduced-order model (ROM) is constructed in a completely data-driven manner, and suited for non-intrusive applications. We demonstrate our complete ROM-based shape optimization on a gradient-based three-dimensional shape optimization problem to minimize the induced drag of a wing in potential flow. We show a satisfactory comparison between ROM-based optima for the aerodynamic coefficients compared to their counterparts obtained via a potential flow solver. The predicted behavior of our ROM-based global optima closely matches the theoretical predictions. We also present the learning mechanism of the deep CNN model in a physically interpretable manner. The CNN-ROM-based shape optimization algorithm exhibits significant computational efficiency compared to full order model-based online optimization applications. Thus, it promises a tractable solution for shape optimization of complex configuration and physical problems. ",

WSIs are produced scanning thin tissue samples that are stained to make specific structures visible. They show stain colour heterogeneity due to different preparation and scanning settings applied across medical centers. Stain colour heterogeneity is a problem to train convolutional neural networks (CNN), the state-of-the-art algorithms for most computational pathology tasks, since CNNs usually underperform when tested on images including different stain variations than those within data used to train the CNN. Despite several methods that were developed, stain colour heterogeneity is still an unsolved challenge that limits the development of CNNs that can generalize on data from several medical centers. This paper aims to present a novel method to train CNNs that better generalize on data including several colour variations. The method, called H\\&E-adversarial CNN, exploits H\\&E matrix information to learn stain-invariant features during the training. The method is evaluated on the classification of colon and prostate histopathology images, involving eleven heterogeneous datasets, and compared with five other techniques used to handle stain colour heterogeneity. H\\&E-adversarial CNNs show an improvement in performance compared to the other algorithms, demonstrating that it can help to better deal with stain colour heterogeneous images. ",

Discrete Dirac spheres are introduced as candidates for minimizers for large $m$ in the cases $n=1, f=2$ and $n=2, f=4$. We provide a thorough numerical analysis of the causal action principle for weighted counting measures for large $m$ in the cases $n=1,2$ and $f=2,3,4$. Our numerical findings corroborate that all minimizers for large $m$ are good approximations of the discrete Dirac spheres.

In cases such as cardiac imaging, motion may be unavoidable and evaluating motion may be of clinical interest. Reconstructing images with reduced motion artifacts has typically been achieved by developing systems with faster gantry rotation or using algorithms which measure and/or estimate the displacements. However, these approaches have had limited success due to both physical constraints as well as the challenge of estimating/measuring non-rigid, temporally varying, and patient-specific motions. We propose a novel reconstruction framework, NeuralCT, to generate time-resolved images free from motion artifacts. Our approaches utilizes a neural implicit approach and does not require estimation or modeling of the underlying motion. Instead, boundaries are represented using a signed distance metric and neural implicit framework. We utilize `analysis-by-synthesis' to identify a solution consistent with the acquired sinogram as well as spatial and temporal consistency constraints. We illustrate the utility of NeuralCT in three progressively more complex scenarios: translation of a small circle, heartbeat-like change in an ellipse's diameter, and complex topological deformation. Without hyperparameter tuning or change to the architecture, NeuralCT provides high quality image reconstruction for all three motions, as compared to filtered backprojection, using mean-square-error and Dice metrics.

To construct the low-dimensional learning model, we employ a denoising-based convolutional autoencoder from the full-order snapshots given by time-dependent hyperbolic partial differential equations for wave propagation. To begin, we attempt to address the difficulty in evolving the low-dimensional representation in time with a plain RNN-LSTM for wave propagation phenomenon. We build an attention-based sequence-to-sequence RNN-LSTM architecture to predict the solution over a long time horizon. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed learning model, we consider three benchmark problems namely one-dimensional linear convection, nonlinear viscous Burgers, and two-dimensional Saint-Venant shallow water system. Using the time-series datasets from the benchmark problems, our novel AB-CRAN architecture accurately captures the wave amplitude and preserves the wave characteristics of the solution for long time horizons. The attention-based sequence-to-sequence network increases the time-horizon of prediction by five times compared to the plain RNN-LSTM.

A failure to integrate equity into resilience considerations results in unequal recovery and disproportionate impacts on vulnerable populations, which has long been a concern in the United States. This research investigated aspects of equity related to community resilience in the aftermath of Winter Storm Uri in Texas which led to extended power outages for more than 4 million households. County level outage and recovery data was analyzed to explore potential significant links between various county attributes and their share of the outages during the recovery and restoration phases. Next, satellite imagery was used to examine data at a much higher geographical resolution focusing on census tracts in the city of Houston. The goal was to use computer vision to extract the extent of outages within census tracts and investigate their linkages to census tracts attributes. Results from various statistical procedures revealed statistically significant negative associations between counties' percentage of non-Hispanic whites and median household income with the ratio of outages. Additionally, at census tract level, variables including percentages of linguistically isolated population and public transport users exhibited positive associations with the group of census tracts that were affected by the outage as detected by computer vision analysis. Informed by these results, engineering solutions such as the applicability of grid modernization technologies, together with distributed and renewable energy resources, when controlled for the region's topographical characteristics, are proposed to enhance equitable power grid resiliency in the face of natural hazards.

We show that, given initial data from a short 6250 yr numerical integration, the best-trained artificial neural network (ANN) can predict the trajectories of the 2:3 resonators over the subsequent 18750 yr evolution, covering a full libration cycle over the combined time period. By comparing our ANN's prediction of the resonant angle to the outcome of numerical integrations, the former can predict the resonant angle with an accuracy as small as of a few degrees only, while it has the advantage of considerably saving computational time. More specifically, the trained ANN can effectively measure the resonant amplitudes of the 2:3 resonators, and thus provides a fast approach that can identify the resonant candidates. This may be helpful in classifying a huge population of KBOs to be discovered in future surveys. ",

We show by a numerical example that a direct extension of the classical deep BSDE method to FBSDE, fails for a simple linear-quadratic control problem, and motivate why the new method works. Under regularity and boundedness assumptions on the exact controls of time continuous and time discrete control problems we provide an error analysis for our method. We show empirically that the method converges for three different problems, one being the one that failed for a direct extension of the deep BSDE method. ",

    "abstract": "Graph Theory and Topological Data Analytics, while powerful, have many drawbacks related to their sensitivity and consistency with TDA & Graph Network Analytics. In this paper, we aim to propose a novel approach for encoding vectorized associations between data points for the purpose of enabling smooth transitions between Graph and Topological Data Analytics. We conclusively reveal effective ways of converting such vectorized associations to simplicial complexes representing micro-states in a Phase-Space, resulting in filter specific, homotopic self-expressive, event-driven unique topological signatures which we have referred as Roy-Kesselman Diagrams or R-K Diagrams with persistent homology, which emerge from filter-based encodings of R-K Models. The validity and impact of this approach were tested specifically on high-dimensional raw and derived measures of Gravitational Wave Data from the latest LIGO datasets published by the LIGO Open Science Centre along with testing a generalized approach for a non-scientific use-case, which has been demonstrated using the Tableau Superstore Sales dataset. We believe the findings of our work will lay the foundation for many future scientific and engineering applications of stable, high-dimensional data analysis with the combined effectiveness of Topological Graph Theory transformations.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we study a representation of lattices by means of a set with a binary relation of compatibility. Standard representations of ortholattices, Heyting algebras, and Boolean algebras drop out as special cases, while the proposed representation goes further in covering arbitrary lattices. We then add a second relation of accessibility interacting with compatibility in order to represent lattices with a multiplicative unary operation. The resulting representation yields a unified approach to semantics for modal logics on different non-classical bases, motivated by a recent application of modal orthologic to natural language semantics.

    "abstract": "Graph convolutional neural networks (GCNN) are very popular methods in machine learning and have been applied very successfully to the prediction of the properties of molecules and materials. First-order GCNNs are well known to be incomplete, i.e., there exist graphs that are distinct but appear identical when seen through the lens of the GCNN. More complicated schemes have thus been designed to increase their resolving power. Applications to molecules (and more generally, point clouds), however, add a geometric dimension to the problem. The most straightforward and prevalent approach to construct graph representation for the molecules regards atoms as vertices in a graph and draws a bond between each pair of atoms within a certain preselected cutoff. Bonds can be decorated with the distance between atoms, and the resulting \"distance graph convolution NNs\" (dGCNN) have empirically demonstrated excellent resolving power and are widely used in chemical ML. Here we show that even for the restricted case of graphs induced by 3D atom clouds dGCNNs are not complete. We construct pairs of distinct point clouds that generate graphs that, for any cutoff radius, are equivalent based on a first-order Weisfeiler-Lehman test. This class of degenerate structures includes chemically-plausible configurations, setting an ultimate limit to the expressive power of some of the well-established GCNN architectures for atomistic machine learning. Models that explicitly use angular information in the description of atomic environments can resolve these degeneracies. ",

However, due to storage limitations, some of the information on past traffic is often only retained in an aggregated form. In this paper we show that Linear Gaussian State Space Models yield simple yet effective methods to make predictions based on time series at different aggregation levels. The models link coarse-grained and fine-grained time series to a single model that is able to provide fine-grained predictions. Our numerical experiments show up to 3.7 times improvement in expected mean absolute forecast error when forecasts are made using, instead of ignoring, additional coarse-grained observations. The forecasts are obtained in a Bayesian formulation of the model, which allows for provisioning of a traffic prediction service with highly informative priors obtained from coarse-grained historical data.

In establishing the framework for classification-based anomaly detection in jet physics, we demonstrate that with a \\emph{well-calibrated} and \\emph{powerful enough feature extractor}, a well-trained \\emph{mass-decorrelated} supervised neural jet tagger can serve as a strong generic anti-QCD jet tagger for effectively reducing the QCD background. Imposing \\emph{data-augmented} mass-invariance (decoupling the dominant factor) not only facilitates background estimation, but also induces more substructure-aware representation learning. We are able to reach excellent tagging efficiencies for all the test signals considered. In the best case, we reach a background rejection rate around 50 and a significance improvement factor of 3.6 at 50 \\% signal acceptance, with jet mass decorrelated. This study indicates that supervised Standard Model jet classifiers have great potential in general new physics searches. ",
