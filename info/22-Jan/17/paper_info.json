    "title": "Jamming Attacks on Federated Learning in Wireless Networks",
    "abstract": "Federated learning (FL) offers a decentralized learning environment so that a group of clients can collaborate to train a global model at the server, while keeping their training data confidential. This paper studies how to launch over-the-air jamming attacks to disrupt the FL process when it is executed over a wireless network. As a wireless example, FL is applied to learn how to classify wireless signals collected by clients (spectrum sensors) at different locations (such as in cooperative sensing). An adversary can jam the transmissions for the local model updates from clients to the server (uplink attack), or the transmissions for the global model updates the server to clients (downlink attack), or both. Given a budget imposed on the number of clients that can be attacked per FL round, clients for the (uplink/downlink) attack are selected according to their local model accuracies that would be expected without an attack or ranked via spectrum observations. This novel attack is extended to general settings by accounting different processing speeds and attack success probabilities for clients. Compared to benchmark attack schemes, this attack approach degrades the FL performance significantly, thereby revealing new vulnerabilities of FL to jamming attacks in wireless networks. ",

    "abstract": "A conversational information retrieval (CIR) system is an information retrieval (IR) system with a conversational interface which allows users to interact with the system to seek information via multi-turn conversations of natural language, in spoken or written form. Recent progress in deep learning has brought tremendous improvements in natural language processing (NLP) and conversational AI, leading to a plethora of commercial conversational services that allow naturally spoken and typed interaction, increasing the need for more human-centric interactions in IR. As a result, we have witnessed a resurgent interest in developing modern CIR systems in both research communities and industry. This book surveys recent advances in CIR, focusing on neural approaches that have been developed in the last few years. This book is based on the authors' tutorial at SIGIR'2020 (Gao et al., 2020b), with IR and NLP communities as the primary target audience. However, audiences with other background, such as machine learning and human-computer interaction, will also find it an accessible introduction to CIR. We hope that this book will prove a valuable resource for students, researchers, and software developers. This manuscript is a working draft. Comments are welcome. ",

    "title": "CurvingLoRa to Boost LoRa Network Capacity via Concurrent Transmission",
    "abstract": "LoRaWAN has emerged as an appealing technology to connect IoT devices but it functions without explicit coordination among transmitters, which can lead to many packet collisions as the network scales. State-of-the-art work proposes various approaches to deal with these collisions, but most functions only in high signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) conditions and thus does not scale to many scenarios where weak receptions are easily buried by stronger receptions from nearby transmitters. In this paper, we take a fresh look at LoRa's physical layer, revealing that its underlying linear chirp modulation fundamentally limits the capacity and scalability of concurrentLoRa transmissions. We show that by replacing linear chirps with their non-linear counterparts, we can boost the capacity of concurrent LoRa transmissions and empower the LoRa receiver to successfully receive weak transmissions in the presence of strong colliding signals. Such a non-linear chirp design further enables the receiver to demodulate fully aligned collision symbols - a case where none of the existing approaches can deal with. We implement these ideas in a holistic LoRaWAN stack based on the USRP N210 software-defined radio platform. Our head-to-head comparison with two state-of-the-art research systems and a standard LoRaWAN baseline demonstrates that CurvingLoRa improves the network throughput by 1.6-7.6x while simultaneously sacrificing neither power efficiency nor noise resilience. An open-source dataset and code will be made available before publication. ",

    "abstract": "Emerging applications such as Augmented Reality, the Internet of Vehicles and Remote Surgery require both computing and networking functions working in harmony. The End-to-end (E2E) quality of experience (QoE) for these applications depends on the synchronous allocation of networking and computing resources. However, the relationship between the resources and the E2E QoE outcomes is typically stochastic and non-linear. In order to make efficient resource allocation decisions, it is essential to model these relationships. This article presents a novel machine-learning based approach to learn these relationships and concurrently orchestrate both resources for this purpose. The machine learning models further help make robust allocation decisions regarding stochastic variations and simplify robust optimization to a conventional constrained optimization. When resources are insufficient to accommodate all application requirements, our framework supports executing some of the applications with minimal degradation (graceful degradation) of E2E QoE. We also show how we can implement the learning and optimization methods in a distributed fashion by the Software-Defined Network (SDN) and Kubernetes technologies. Our results show that deep learning-based modelling achieves E2E QoE with approximately 99.8\\% accuracy, and our robust joint-optimization technique allocates resources efficiently when compared to existing differential services alternatives.

    "abstract": "The communication revolution has perpetually reshaped the means through which people send and receive information. Social media is an important pillar of this revolution and has brought profound changes to various aspects of our lives. However, the open environment and popularity of these platforms inaugurate windows of opportunities for various cyber threats, thus social networks have become a fertile venue for spammers and other illegitimate users to execute their malicious activities. These activities include phishing hot and trendy topics and posting a wide range of contents in many topics. Hence, it is crucial to continuously introduce new techniques and approaches to detect and stop this category of users. This paper proposes a novel and effective approach to detect social spammers. An investigation into several attributes to measure topic-dependent and topic-independent users' behaviours on Twitter is carried out. The experiments of this study are undertaken on various machine learning classifiers. The performance of these classifiers are compared and their effectiveness is measured via a number of robust evaluation measures. Further, the proposed approach is benchmarked against state-of-the-art social spam and anomalous detection techniques. These experiments report the effectiveness and utility of the proposed approach and embedded modules. ",

    "abstract": "Variational autoencoders are among the most popular methods for distilling low-dimensional structure from high-dimensional data, making them increasingly valuable as tools for data exploration and scientific discovery. However, unlike typical machine learning problems in which a single model is trained once on a single large dataset, scientific workflows privilege learned features that are reproducible, portable across labs, and capable of incrementally adding new data. Ideally, methods used by different research groups should produce comparable results, even without sharing fully trained models or entire data sets. Here, we address this challenge by introducing the Rosetta VAE (R-VAE), a method of distilling previously learned representations and retraining new models to reproduce and build on prior results. The R-VAE uses post hoc clustering over the latent space of a fully-trained model to identify a small number of Rosetta Points (input, latent pairs) to serve as anchors for training future models. An adjustable hyperparameter, $\\rho$, balances fidelity to the previously learned latent space against accommodation of new data. We demonstrate that the R-VAE reconstructs data as well as the VAE and $\\beta$-VAE, outperforms both methods in recovery of a target latent space in a sequential training setting, and dramatically increases consistency of the learned representation across training runs.

We hope to remedy this issue by accumulating and expounding upon the thoughts and discussions of fair machine learning produced by both social and formal (specifically machine learning and statistics) sciences in this field guide. Specifically, in addition to giving the mathematical and algorithmic backgrounds of several popular statistical and causal-based fair machine learning methods, we explain the underlying philosophical and legal thoughts that support them. Further, we explore several criticisms of the current approaches to fair machine learning from sociological and philosophical viewpoints. It is our hope that this field guide will help fair machine learning practitioners better understand how their algorithms align with important humanistic values (such as fairness) and how we can, as a field, design methods and metrics to better serve oppressed and marginalized populaces.

Currently, artificial intelligence is undergoing a paradigm shift. The foundation models pretrained on massive data and finetuned to downstream tasks surpass specially customized models. This trend inspired us to consider reusing foundation models instead of learning from scratch. Based on this, we propose a flexible and robust approach for automatic code summarization based on neural networks. We assemble available foundation models, such as CodeBERT and GPT-2, into a single model named AdaMo. Moreover, we utilize Gaussian noise as the simulation of contextual information to optimize the latent representation. Furthermore, we introduce two adaptive schemes from the perspective of knowledge transfer, namely continuous pretraining and intermediate finetuning, and design intermediate stage tasks for general sequence-to-sequence learning. Finally, we evaluate AdaMo against a benchmark dataset for code summarization, by comparing it with state-of-the-art models. ",

Although, these techniques have claimed to preserve the accuracy of the sparse DNNs on crossbars, none have studied the impact of the inexorable crossbar non-idealities on the actual performance of the pruned networks. To this end, we perform a comprehensive study to show how highly sparse DNNs, that result in significant crossbar-compression-rate, can lead to severe accuracy losses compared to unpruned DNNs mapped onto non-ideal crossbars. We perform experiments with multiple structured-pruning approaches (such as, C/F pruning, XCS and XRS) on VGG11 and VGG16 DNNs with benchmark datasets (CIFAR10 and CIFAR100). We propose two mitigation approaches - Crossbar column rearrangement and Weight-Constrained-Training (WCT) - that can be integrated with the crossbar-mapping of the sparse DNNs to minimize accuracy losses incurred by the pruned models. These help in mitigating non-idealities by increasing the proportion of low conductance synapses on crossbars, thereby improving their computational accuracies. ",

    "abstract": "Artificial neural networks for simulated motor control and robotics often adopt generic architectures like fully connected MLPs. While general, these tabula rasa architectures rely on large amounts of experience to learn, are not easily transferable to new bodies, and have internal dynamics that are difficult to interpret. In nature, animals are born with highly structured connectivity in their nervous systems shaped by evolution; this innate circuitry acts synergistically with learning mechanisms to provide inductive biases that enable most animals to function well soon after birth and improve abilities efficiently. Convolutional networks inspired by visual circuitry have encoded useful biases for vision. However, it is unknown the extent to which ANN architectures inspired by neural circuitry can yield useful biases for other domains. In this work, we ask what advantages biologically inspired network architecture can provide in the context of motor control. Specifically, we translate C. elegans circuits for locomotion into an ANN model controlling a simulated Swimmer agent. On a locomotion task, our architecture achieves good initial performance and asymptotic performance comparable with MLPs, while dramatically improving data efficiency and requiring orders of magnitude fewer parameters. Our architecture is more interpretable and transfers to new body designs. An ablation analysis shows that principled excitation/inhibition is crucial for learning, while weight initialization contributes to good initial performance. Our work demonstrates several advantages of ANN architectures inspired by systems neuroscience and suggests a path towards modeling more complex behavior. ",

Most of the existing approaches consider the bug triage task as a classification problem, however, classification is not appropriate when the sets of classes change over time (as developers often do in a project). Furthermore, to the best of our knowledge, all the existing models use textual sources of information, i.e., bug descriptions, which are not always available. In this work, we explore the applicability of existing solutions for the bug triage problem when stack traces are used as the main data source of bug reports. Additionally, we reformulate this task as a ranking problem and propose new deep learning models to solve it. The models are based on a bidirectional recurrent neural network with attention and on a convolutional neural network, with the weights of the models optimized using a ranking loss function. To improve the quality of ranking, we propose using additional information from version control system annotations. Two approaches are proposed for extracting features from annotations: manual and using an additional neural network. To evaluate our models, we collected two datasets of real-world stack traces. Our experiments show that the proposed models outperform existing models adapted to handle stack traces. To facilitate further research in this area, we publish the source code of our models and one of the collected datasets. ",

    "abstract": "Optimal Volt/VAR control (VVC) in distribution networks relies on an effective coordination between the conventional utility-owned mechanical devices and the smart residential photovoltaic (PV) inverters. Typically, a central controller carries out a periodic optimization and sends setpoints to the local controller of each device. However, instead of tracking centrally dispatched setpoints, smart PV inverters can cooperate on a much faster timescale to reach optimality within a PV inverter group. To accommodate such PV inverter groups in the VVC architecture, this paper proposes a bi-level optimization framework. The upper-level determines the setpoints of the mechanical devices to minimize the network active power losses, while the lower-level represents the coordinated actions that the inverters take for their own objectives. The interactions between these two levels are captured in the bi-level optimization, which is solved using the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions. This framework fully exploits the capabilities of the different types of voltage regulation devices and enables them to cooperatively optimize their goals. Case studies on typical distribution networks with field-recorded data demonstrate the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed approach. ",

In this paper, we consider the problem of designing shared backup path protection (SBPP) based EON that facilitates the minimum quality-of-transmission (QoT) assured allocation against physical layer impairments (PLIs) under any single link/shared risk link group (SRLG) failure for static and dynamic traffic scenarios. In general, the effect of PLIs on lightpath varies based on the location of failure of a link as it introduces different active working and backup paths. To address these issues in the design of SBPP EON, we formulate a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) based robust optimization framework for static traffic with the objective of minimizing overall fragmentation. In this process, we use the efficient bitloading technique for spectrum allocation for the first time in survivable EONs. In addition, we propose a novel SBPP-impairment aware (SBPP-IA) algorithm considering the limitations of MILP for larger networks. For this purpose, we introduce a novel sorting technique named most congested working-least congested backup first (MCW-LCBF) to sort the given set of static requests. Next, we employ our SBPP-IA algorithm for dynamic traffic scenario and compare it with existing algorithms in terms of different QoT parameters. We demonstrated through simulations that our study provides around 40% more QoT guaranteed requests compared to existing ones. ",

Inspired from this, we tackle video scene segmentation, which is a task of temporally localizing scene boundaries in a video, with a self-supervised learning framework where we mainly focus on designing effective pretext tasks. In our framework, we discover a pseudo-boundary from a sequence of shots by splitting it into two continuous, non-overlapping sub-sequences and leverage the pseudo-boundary to facilitate the pre-training. Based on this, we introduce three novel boundary-aware pretext tasks: 1) Shot-Scene Matching (SSM), 2) Contextual Group Matching (CGM) and 3) Pseudo-boundary Prediction (PP); SSM and CGM guide the model to maximize intra-scene similarity and inter-scene discrimination while PP encourages the model to identify transitional moments. Through comprehensive analysis, we empirically show that pre-training and transferring contextual representation are both critical to improving the video scene segmentation performance.

Although achieving impressive performance, conventional activity detection algorithms are usually designed under certain constraints, such as using trimmed and/or object-centered video clips as inputs. Therefore, they failed to deal with the multi-scale multi-instance cases in real-world unconstrained video streams, which are untrimmed and have large field-of-views. Real-time requirements for streaming analysis also mark brute force expansion of them unfeasible. To overcome these issues, we propose Argus++, a robust real-time activity detection system for analyzing unconstrained video streams. The design of Argus++ introduces overlapping spatio-temporal cubes as an intermediate concept of activity proposals to ensure coverage and completeness of activity detection through over-sampling. The overall system is optimized for real-time processing on standalone consumer-level hardware. Extensive experiments on different surveillance and driving scenarios demonstrated its superior performance in a series of activity detection benchmarks, including CVPR ActivityNet ActEV 2021, NIST ActEV SDL UF/KF, TRECVID ActEV 2020/2021, and ICCV ROAD 2021.

    "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown promising results in various tasks, among which link prediction is an important one. GNN models usually follow a node-centric message passing procedure that aggregates the neighborhood information to the central node recursively. Following this paradigm, features of nodes are passed through edges without caring about where the nodes are located and which role they played. However, the neglected topological information is shown to be valuable for link prediction tasks. In this paper, we propose Structure Enhanced Graph neural network (SEG) for link prediction. SEG introduces the path labeling method to capture surrounding topological information of target nodes and then incorporates the structure into an ordinary GNN model. By jointly training the structure encoder and deep GNN model, SEG fuses topological structures and node features to take full advantage of graph information. Experiments on the OGB link prediction datasets demonstrate that SEG achieves state-of-the-art results among all three public datasets. ",

However, existing micro-expression datasets are limited and usually pose some challenges for training good classifiers. To model the subtle facial muscle motions, we propose a robust micro-expression recognition (MER) framework, namely muscle motion-guided network (MMNet). Specifically, a continuous attention (CA) block is introduced to focus on modeling local subtle muscle motion patterns with little identity information, which is different from most previous methods that directly extract features from complete video frames with much identity information. Besides, we design a position calibration (PC) module based on the vision transformer. By adding the position embeddings of the face generated by PC module at the end of the two branches, the PC module can help to add position information to facial muscle motion pattern features for the MER. Extensive experiments on three public micro-expression datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a large margin. ",

However, large-scale parallel corpora are expensive and challenging to construct. In this work, we introduce a low-cost and effective strategy, ExtraPhrase, to augment training data for abstractive summarization tasks. ExtraPhrase constructs pseudo training data in two steps: extractive summarization and paraphrasing. We extract major parts of an input text in the extractive summarization step, and obtain its diverse expressions with the paraphrasing step. Through experiments, we show that ExtraPhrase improves the performance of abstractive summarization tasks by more than 0.50 points in ROUGE scores compared to the setting without data augmentation. ExtraPhrase also outperforms existing methods such as back-translation and self-training. We also show that ExtraPhrase is significantly effective when the amount of genuine training data is remarkably small, i.e., a low-resource setting. Moreover, ExtraPhrase is more cost-efficient than the existing approaches. ",

TFGM sidesteps two crucial problems when training GNNs: 1) the limited supervision due to expensive annotation, and 2) training's computational cost. A basic framework, BasicTFGM, is first proposed by adopting the inference stage of graph matching methods. Our analysis shows that the BasicTFGM is a linear relaxation to the quadratic assignment formulation of graph matching. This guarantees the preservation of structure compatibility and an efficient polynomial complexity. Empirically, we further improve the BasicTFGM by handcrafting two types of matching priors into the architecture of GNNs: comparing node neighborhoods of different localities and utilizing annotation data if available. For evaluation, we conduct extensive experiments on a broad set of settings, including supervised keypoint matching between images, semi-supervised entity alignment between knowledge graphs, and unsupervised alignment between protein interaction networks. Applying TFGM on various GNNs shows promising improvements over baselines. Further ablation studies demonstrate the effective and efficient training-free property of TFGM.

Traditionally, this problem can ba tackled with the help of expensive sensors such as lidars. Nowadays, the leading research is on robust localization using economic sensors, such as cameras and IMUs. The geometric methods based on these sensors are pretty good in normal conditions withstable lighting and no dynamic objects. These methods suffer from significant loss and divergence in such challenging environments. The scientists came to use deep neural networks (DNNs) as the savior to mitigate this problem. The main idea behind using DNNs was to better understand the problem inside the data and overcome complex conditions (such as a dynamic object in front of the camera, extreme lighting conditions, keeping the track at high speeds, etc.) The prior endto-end DNN methods are able to overcome some of the mentioned challenges. However, no general and robust framework for all of these scenarios is available. In this paper, we have combined geometric and DNN based methods to have the pros of geometric SLAM frameworks and overcome the remaining challenges with the DNNs help. To do this, we have modified the Vins-Mono framework (the most robust and accurate framework till now) and we were able to achieve state-of-the-art results on TUM-Dynamic, TUM-VI, ADVIO and EuRoC datasets compared to geometric and end-to-end DNN based SLAMs. Our proposed framework was also able to achieve acceptable results on extreme simulated cases resembling the challenges mentioned earlier easy.

When transporting passengers or commodities, this fact must be considered for the the planning of itineraries. This has already led to several well-studied algorithmic problems on temporal graphs. The difficulty of the described task is increased by the fact that connections are often unreliable -- in particular, many modes of transportation suffer from occasional delays. If these delays cause subsequent connections to be missed, the consequences can be severe. Thus, it is a vital problem to design itineraries that are robust to (small) delays.

    "abstract": "Ad-hoc search calls for the selection of appropriate answers from a massive-scale corpus. Nowadays, the embedding-based retrieval (EBR) becomes a promising solution, where deep learning based document representation and ANN search techniques are allied to handle this task. However, a major challenge is that the ANN index can be too large to fit into memory, given the considerable size of answer corpus. In this work, we tackle this problem with Bi-Granular Document Representation, where the lightweight sparse embeddings are indexed and standby in memory for coarse-grained candidate search, and the heavyweight dense embeddings are hosted in disk for fine-grained post verification. For the best of retrieval accuracy, a Progressive Optimization framework is designed. The sparse embeddings are learned ahead for high-quality search of candidates. Conditioned on the candidate distribution induced by the sparse embeddings, the dense embeddings are continuously learned to optimize the discrimination of ground-truth from the shortlisted candidates. Besides, two techniques: the contrastive quantization and the locality-centric sampling are introduced for the learning of sparse and dense embeddings, which substantially contribute to their performances. Thanks to the above features, our method effectively handles massive-scale EBR with strong advantages in accuracy: with up to +4.3% recall gain on million-scale corpus, and up to +17.5% recall gain on billion-scale corpus. Besides, Our method is applied to a major sponsored search platform with substantial gains on revenue (+1.95%), Recall (+1.01%) and CTR (+0.49%). ",

However, well-known vulnerabilities of resource-constrained spectrum sensors and the possibility of being manipulated by users with physical access complicate their protection against spectrum sensing data falsification (SSDF) attacks. Most recent literature suggests using behavioral fingerprinting and Machine/Deep Learning (ML/DL) for improving similar cybersecurity issues. Nevertheless, the applicability of these techniques in resource-constrained devices, the impact of attacks affecting spectrum data integrity, and the performance and scalability of models suitable for heterogeneous sensors types are still open challenges. To improve limitations, this work presents seven SSDF attacks affecting spectrum sensors and introduces CyberSpec, an ML/DL-oriented framework using device behavioral fingerprinting to detect anomalies produced by SSDF attacks affecting resource-constrained spectrum sensors. CyberSpec has been implemented and validated in ElectroSense, a real crowdsensing RF monitoring platform where several configurations of the proposed SSDF attacks have been executed in different sensors. A pool of experiments with different unsupervised ML/DL-based models has demonstrated the suitability of CyberSpec detecting the previous attacks within an acceptable timeframe. ",

Through the thematic analysis of interviews conducted with 22 developers, we confirm that conflicts during code reviews are commonplace, anticipated and seen as normal by developers. Even though conflicts do happen and carry a negative impact for the review, conflicts-if resolved constructively-can also create value and bring improvement. Moreover, the analysis provided insights on how strongly conflicts during code review and its context (i.e., code, developer, team, organization) are intertwined.

The temporal attention mechanism is a neural layer design that recently gained popularity due to its ability to focus on important temporal events. In this paper, we propose a neural layer based on the ideas of temporal attention and multi-head attention to extend the capability of the underlying neural network in focusing simultaneously on multiple temporal instances. The effectiveness of our approach is validated using large-scale limit-order book market data to forecast the direction of mid-price movements. Our experiments show that the use of multi-head temporal attention modules leads to enhanced prediction performances compared to baseline models. ",

    "abstract": "Representation is a core issue in artificial intelligence. Humans use discrete language to communicate and learn from each other, while machines use continuous features (like vector, matrix, or tensor in deep neural networks) to represent cognitive patterns. Discrete symbols are low-dimensional, decoupled, and have strong reasoning ability, while continuous features are high-dimensional, coupled, and have incredible abstracting capabilities. In recent years, deep learning has developed the idea of continuous representation to the extreme, using millions of parameters to achieve high accuracies. Although this is reasonable from the statistical perspective, it has other major problems like lacking interpretability, poor generalization, and is easy to be attacked. Since both paradigms have strengths and weaknesses, a better choice is to seek reconciliation. In this paper, we make an initial attempt towards this direction. Specifically, we propose to combine symbolism and connectionism principles by using neural networks to derive a discrete representation. This process is highly similar to human language, which is a natural combination of discrete symbols and neural systems, where the brain processes continuous signals and represents intelligence via discrete language. To mimic this functionality, we denote our approach as machine language. By designing an interactive environment and task, we demonstrated that machines could generate a spontaneous, flexible, and semantic language through cooperation. Moreover, through experiments we show that discrete language representation has several advantages compared with continuous feature representation, from the aspects of interpretability, generalization, and robustness.

    "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks (GNN) have shown remarkable performance in different tasks. However, there are a few studies about GNN on recommender systems. GCN as a type of GNNs can extract high-quality embeddings for different entities in a graph. In a collaborative filtering task, the core problem is to find out how informative an entity would be for predicting the future behavior of a target user. Using an attention mechanism, we can enable GCNs to do such an analysis when the underlying data is modeled as a graph. In this study, we proposed GARec as a model-based recommender system that applies an attention mechanism along with a spatial GCN on a recommender graph to extract embeddings for users and items. The attention mechanism tells GCN how much a related user or item should affect the final representation of the target entity. We compared the performance of GARec against some baseline algorithms in terms of RMSE. The presented method outperforms existing model-based, non-graph neural networks and graph neural networks in different MovieLens datasets. ",

Using a weather radar dataset, this paper shows that the Backbone (BB) - a local-threshold criterion - generates networks whose geographical configuration is complementary to the GT networks. We compare the results for two well-known similarities measures: the Pearson Correlation (PC) coefficient and the Mutual Information (MI). The extracted backbone network (miBB), whose number of links is the same as the global MI (miGT), has the lowest average shortest path and presents a small-world effect. Regarding the global PC (pcGT) and its corresponding BB network (pcBB), there is a significant linear relationship: $R2=0.77$ with a slope of $1.15$ (p-value $<E-7$) for the pcGT network, and $R2=0.68$ with a slope of $0.76$ (p-value $<E-7$) for the pcBB network. In relation to the MI ones, only the miGT present a high $R2$ ($0.79$, with slope = $1.95$), whereas the miBB has an $R2$ of only $0.20$ ($\\text{slope} =0.24$). On the one hand, the GT networks present a sizeable connected component in the central area, close to the main rivers. On the other hand, the BB networks present a few meaningful connected components surrounding the watershed and dominating cells close to the outlet, with significant statistical differences in the altimetry distribution.

However, social robots have not seen widespread adoption, in part because (1) they do not adapt their behavior to new users, and (2) they do not provide sufficient privacy protections. Centralized learning, whereby robots develop skills by gathering data on a server, contributes to these limitations by preventing online learning of new experiences and requiring storage of privacy-sensitive data. In this work, we propose a decentralized learning alternative that improves the privacy and personalization of social robots. We combine two machine learning approaches, Federated Learning and Continual Learning, to capture interaction dynamics distributed physically across robots and temporally across repeated robot encounters. We define a set of criteria that should be balanced in decentralized robot learning scenarios. We also develop a new algorithm -- Elastic Transfer -- that leverages importance-based regularization to preserve relevant parameters across robots and interactions with multiple humans. We show that decentralized learning is a viable alternative to centralized learning in a proof-of-concept Socially-Aware Navigation domain, and demonstrate how Elastic Transfer improves several of the proposed criteria.

    "abstract": "Graph Structure Learning (GSL) recently has attracted considerable attentions in its capacity of optimizing graph structure as well as learning suitable parameters of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) simultaneously. Current GSL methods mainly learn an optimal graph structure (final view) from single or multiple information sources (basic views), however the theoretical guidance on what is the optimal graph structure is still unexplored. In essence, an optimal graph structure should only contain the information about tasks while compress redundant noise as much as possible, which is defined as \"minimal sufficient structure\", so as to maintain the accurancy and robustness. How to obtain such structure in a principled way? In this paper, we theoretically prove that if we optimize basic views and final view based on mutual information, and keep their performance on labels simultaneously, the final view will be a minimal sufficient structure. With this guidance, we propose a Compact GSL architecture by MI compression, named CoGSL. Specifically, two basic views are extracted from original graph as two inputs of the model, which are refinedly reestimated by a view estimator. Then, we propose an adaptive technique to fuse estimated views into the final view. Furthermore, we maintain the performance of estimated views and the final view and reduce the mutual information of every two views. To comprehensively evaluate the performance of CoGSL, we conduct extensive experiments on several datasets under clean and attacked conditions, which demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of CoGSL.

To answer these questions, we need a clear measure of input simplicity (or inversely, complexity), an optimization objective that correlates with simplification, and a framework to incorporate such objective into training and inference. Lastly we need a variety of testbeds to experiment and evaluate the impact of such simplification on learning. In this work, we measure simplicity with the encoding bit size given by a pretrained generative model, and minimize the bit size to simplify inputs in training and inference. We investigate the effect of such simplification in several scenarios: conventional training, dataset condensation and post-hoc explanations. In all settings, inputs are simplified along with the original classification task, and we investigate the trade-off between input simplicity and task performance. For images with injected distractors, such simplification naturally removes superfluous information. For dataset condensation, we find that inputs can be simplified with almost no accuracy degradation. When used in post-hoc explanation, our learning-based simplification approach offers a valuable new tool to explore the basis of network decisions. ",

Due to the lack of physical qubits and an effective means to map real-world data from Euclidean space to Hilbert space, most of these methods focus on quantum analogies or process simulations rather than devising concrete architectures based on qubits. In this paper, we propose a novel hybrid quantum-classical algorithm for graph-structured data, which we refer to as the Decompositional Quantum Graph Neural Network (DQGNN). DQGNN implements the GNN theoretical framework using the tensor product and unity matrices representation, which greatly reduces the number of model parameters required. When controlled by a classical computer, DQGNN can accommodate arbitrarily sized graphs by processing substructures from the input graph using a modestly-sized quantum device. The architecture is based on a novel mapping from real-world data to Hilbert space. This mapping maintains the distance relations present in the data and reduces information loss. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms competitive state-of-the-art models with only 1.68\\% parameters compared to those models. ",

The former maps the input vector into an infinite dimensional feature space via a radial basis function (RBF) kernel, ensuring absence of local minima on its training loss surface. The latter breaks the high-dimensional nonconvex neural network training problem into a series of low-dimensional convex optimization problems, and enables its prediction uncertainty easily assessed. The K-StoNet can be easily trained using the imputation-regularized optimization (IRO) algorithm. Compared to traditional deep neural networks, K-StoNet possesses a theoretical guarantee to asymptotically converge to the global optimum and enables the prediction uncertainty easily assessed.

We introduce a novel methodology allowing for efficient sampling of the high-dimensional Bayesian posterior of the weak lensing mass-mapping problem, and relying on simulations for defining a fully non-Gaussian prior. We aim to demonstrate the accuracy of the method on simulations, and then proceed to applying it to the mass reconstruction of the HST/ACS COSMOS field. The proposed methodology combines elements of Bayesian statistics, analytic theory, and a recent class of Deep Generative Models based on Neural Score Matching. This approach allows us to do the following: 1) Make full use of analytic cosmological theory to constrain the 2pt statistics of the solution. 2) Learn from cosmological simulations any differences between this analytic prior and full simulations. 3) Obtain samples from the full Bayesian posterior of the problem for robust Uncertainty Quantification. We demonstrate the method on the $\\kappa$TNG simulations and find that the posterior mean significantly outperfoms previous methods (Kaiser-Squires, Wiener filter, Sparsity priors) both on root-mean-square error and in terms of the Pearson correlation. We further illustrate the interpretability of the recovered posterior by establishing a close correlation between posterior convergence values and SNR of clusters artificially introduced into a field.
