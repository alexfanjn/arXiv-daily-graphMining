    "title": "On the Prevalence, Impact, and Evolution of SQL Code Smells in  Data-Intensive Systems",
    "abstract": "Code smells indicate software design problems that harm software quality. Data-intensive systems that frequently access databases often suffer from SQL code smells besides the traditional smells. While there have been extensive studies on traditional code smells, recently, there has been a growing interest in SQL code smells. In this paper, we conduct an empirical study to investigate the prevalence and evolution of SQL code smells in open-source, data-intensive systems. We collected 150 projects and examined both traditional and SQL code smells in these projects. Our investigation delivers several important findings. First, SQL code smells are indeed prevalent in data-intensive software systems. Second, SQL code smells have a weak co-occurrence with traditional code smells. Third, SQL code smells have a weaker association with bugs than that of traditional code smells. Fourth, SQL code smells are more likely to be introduced at the beginning of the project lifetime and likely to be left in the code without a fix, compared to traditional code smells. Overall, our results show that SQL code smells are indeed prevalent and persistent in the studied data-intensive software systems. Developers should be aware of these smells and consider detecting and refactoring SQL code smells and traditional code smells separately, using dedicated tools. ",

    "title": "Nonlocal Kernel Network (NKN): a Stable and Resolution-Independent Deep  Neural Network",
    "abstract": "Neural operators have recently become popular tools for designing solution maps between function spaces in the form of neural networks. Differently from classical scientific machine learning approaches that learn parameters of a known partial differential equation (PDE) for a single instance of the input parameters at a fixed resolution, neural operators approximate the solution map of a family of PDEs. Despite their success, the uses of neural operators are so far restricted to relatively shallow neural networks and confined to learning hidden governing laws. In this work, we propose a novel nonlocal neural operator, which we refer to as nonlocal kernel network (NKN), that is resolution independent, characterized by deep neural networks, and capable of handling a variety of tasks such as learning governing equations and classifying images. Our NKN stems from the interpretation of the neural network as a discrete nonlocal diffusion reaction equation that, in the limit of infinite layers, is equivalent to a parabolic nonlocal equation, whose stability is analyzed via nonlocal vector calculus. The resemblance with integral forms of neural operators allows NKNs to capture long-range dependencies in the feature space, while the continuous treatment of node-to-node interactions makes NKNs resolution independent. The resemblance with neural ODEs, reinterpreted in a nonlocal sense, and the stable network dynamics between layers allow for generalization of NKN's optimal parameters from shallow to deep networks. This fact enables the use of shallow-to-deep initialization techniques. Our tests show that NKNs outperform baseline methods in both learning governing equations and image classification tasks and generalize well to different resolutions and depths. ",

    "abstract": "The field of artificial intelligence has significantly advanced over the past decades, inspired by discoveries from the fields of biology and neuroscience. The idea of this work is inspired by the process of self-organization of cortical areas in the human brain from both afferent and lateral/internal connections. In this work, we develop an original brain-inspired neural model associating Self-Organizing Maps (SOM) and Hebbian learning in the Reentrant SOM (ReSOM) model. The framework is applied to multimodal classification problems. Compared to existing methods based on unsupervised learning with post-labeling, the model enhances the state-of-the-art results. This work also demonstrates the distributed and scalable nature of the model through both simulation results and hardware execution on a dedicated FPGA-based platform named SCALP (Self-configurable 3D Cellular Adaptive Platform). SCALP boards can be interconnected in a modular way to support the structure of the neural model. Such a unified software and hardware approach enables the processing to be scaled and allows information from several modalities to be merged dynamically. The deployment on hardware boards provides performance results of parallel execution on several devices, with the communication between each board through dedicated serial links. The proposed unified architecture, composed of the ReSOM model and the SCALP hardware platform, demonstrates a significant increase in accuracy thanks to multimodal association, and a good trade-off between latency and power consumption compared to a centralized GPU implementation.

    "abstract": "State-of-the-art stereo matching networks trained only on synthetic data often fail to generalize to more challenging real data domains. In this paper, we attempt to unfold an important factor that hinders the networks from generalizing across domains: through the lens of shortcut learning. We demonstrate that the learning of feature representations in stereo matching networks is heavily influenced by synthetic data artefacts (shortcut attributes). To mitigate this issue, we propose an Information-Theoretic Shortcut Avoidance~(ITSA) approach to automatically restrict shortcut-related information from being encoded into the feature representations. As a result, our proposed method learns robust and shortcut-invariant features by minimizing the sensitivity of latent features to input variations. To avoid the prohibitive computational cost of direct input sensitivity optimization, we propose an effective yet feasible algorithm to achieve robustness. We show that using this method, state-of-the-art stereo matching networks that are trained purely on synthetic data can effectively generalize to challenging and previously unseen real data scenarios. Importantly, the proposed method enhances the robustness of the synthetic trained networks to the point that they outperform their fine-tuned counterparts (on real data) for challenging out-of-domain stereo datasets.

Specifically, we search for the best crop parameters that minimize a combined loss of the initial objectives of these networks. To make the optimization table, we propose three strategies: (i) multi-scale bilinear sampling, (ii) annealing the scale of the crop region, therefore effectively reducing the parameter space, (iii) aggregation of multiple optimization results. Through various quantitative and qualitative evaluations, we show that our framework can produce crops that are well-aligned to intended user descriptions and aesthetically pleasing. ",

Open World Detection(OWD) seeks to tackle this problem by generalizing detection performance to seen and unseen class categories. Recent works have seen success in the generation of class-agnostic proposals, which we call Open-World Proposals(OWP), but this comes at the cost of a big drop on the classification task when both tasks are considered in the detection model. These works have investigated two-stage Region Proposal Networks (RPN) by taking advantage of objectness scoring cues; however, for its simplicity, run-time, and decoupling of localization and classification, we investigate OWP through the lens of fully convolutional one-stage detection network, such as FCOS. We show that our architectural and sampling optimizations on FCOS can increase OWP performance by as much as 6% in recall on novel classes, marking the first proposal-free one-stage detection network to achieve comparable performance to RPN-based two-stage networks. Furthermore, we show that the inherent, decoupled architecture of FCOS has benefits to retaining classification performance. While two-stage methods worsen by 6% in recall on novel classes, we show that FCOS only drops 2% when jointly optimizing for OWP and classification. ",

We develop a meta-learning strategy for our budget-aware few-shot learning task, which jointly learns a novel data selection policy based on a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) and an example-based few-shot classifier. Our selection policy computes a context-sensitive representation for each unlabeled data by graph message passing, which is then used to predict an informativeness score for sequential selection. We validate our method by extensive experiments on the mini-ImageNet, tiered-ImageNet and Omniglot datasets. The results show our few-shot learning strategy outperforms baselines by a sizable margin, which demonstrates the efficacy of our method. ",

Specifically, each agent has access only to its own smooth local cost function and can receive information from its neighbors in a time-varying directed communication network. To this end, we propose a distributed gradient play algorithm to compute a NE by utilizing local information exchange among the players. In this algorithm, every agent performs a gradient step to minimize its own cost function while sharing and retrieving information locally among its neighbors. The existing methods impose strong assumptions such as balancedness of the mixing matrices and global knowledge of the network communication structure, including Perron-Frobenius eigenvector of the adjacency matrix and other graph connectivity constants. In contrast, our approach relies only on a reasonable and widely-used assumption of row-stochasticity of the mixing matrices. We analyze the algorithm for time-varying directed graphs and prove its convergence to the NE, when the agents' cost functions are strongly convex and have Lipschitz continuous gradients. Numerical simulations are performed for a Nash-Cournot game to illustrate the efficacy of the proposed algorithm. ",

A number of methods have been recently developed for OOD detection, but there is still room for improvement. We propose the new method iDECODe, leveraging in-distribution equivariance for conformal OOD detection. It relies on a novel base non-conformity measure and a new aggregation method, used in the inductive conformal anomaly detection framework, thereby guaranteeing a bounded false detection rate.

    "abstract": "This study addresses the question whether model knowledge can prevent a defender from being deceived or not in cyber security. As a specific model-based defense scheme, this study treats Bayesian defense mechanism, which monitors the system's behavior, forms a belief on existence of the attacker, and chooses appropriate reactions. Sophisticated attackers aim at achieving her objective while avoiding being detected by deceiving the defender. In this paper, their dynamic decision making is formulated as a stochastic signaling game. It is revealed that the belief on the true scenario has a limit in a stochastic sense at an equilibrium based on martingale analysis. This fact implies that there are only two possible cases: the defender asymptotically detects the attack with a firm belief or the attacker takes actions such that the system's behavior becomes nominal after a certain finite time step. Consequently, if the dynamics admits no stealthy attacks, the system is guaranteed to be secure in an asymptotic manner provided that effective countermeasures are implemented. The result concludes that model knowledge can prevent deception in an asymptotic sense. As an application of the finding, a defensive deception utilizing asymmetric recognition on vulnerabilities exploited by the attacker is analyzed. It is shown that, the attacker possibly stops the attack even if the defender is unaware of the vulnerabilities as long as the defender's unawareness is concealed by the defensive deception. Those results indicate the powerful defense capability achieved by model knowledge. ",

Various deep learning models have been proposed, achieving state-of-the-art performance on motion prediction. However, existing methods typically focus on modeling temporal dynamics in the pose space. Unfortunately, the complicated and high dimensionality nature of human motion brings inherent challenges for dynamic context capturing. Therefore, we move away from the conventional pose based representation and present a novel approach employing a phase space trajectory representation of individual joints. Moreover, current methods tend to only consider the dependencies between physically connected joints. In this paper, we introduce a novel convolutional neural model to effectively leverage explicit prior knowledge of motion anatomy, and simultaneously capture both spatial and temporal information of joint trajectory dynamics. We then propose a global optimization module that learns the implicit relationships between individual joint features. Empirically, our method is evaluated on large-scale 3D human motion benchmark datasets (i.e., Human3.6M, CMU MoCap).

Locating epistatic interactions is a computationally expensive challenge that involves analyzing an exponentially growing number of combinations. Authors in this field have resorted to a multitude of hardware architectures in order to speed up the search, but little to no attention has been paid to the vector instructions that current CPUs include in their instruction sets.

Results using the GCC and the Intel compiler show that the 512-bit explicit vector implementation proposed here performs the best out of all of the other implementations evaluated.

This algorithm is tested with online gambling data that have the form of time series, which can be efficiently processed by recurrent neural networks. To evaluate the performances of the trained models, standard machine learning metrics were used, such as accuracy, precision and recall. For this problem in particular, the conducted experiments allowed to assess that the choice of a specific architecture depends on the metric which is given the greatest importance. Architectures using nBRC favour precision, those using LSTM give better recall, while GRU-based architectures allow a higher accuracy and balance two other metrics. Moreover, further experiments showed that using only the more recent time-series histories to train the networks decreases the quality of the results. We also study the performances of models learned at a specific instant $t$, at other times $t^{\\prime} > t$. The results show that the performances of the models learned at time $t$ remain good at the following instants $t^{\\prime} > t$, suggesting that there is no need to refresh the models at a high rate. However, the performances of the models were subject to noticeable variance due to one-off events impacting the data. ",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in deep learning have led to a paradigm shift in reversible steganography. A fundamental pillar of reversible steganography is predictive modelling which can be realised via deep neural networks. However, non-trivial errors exist in inferences about some out-of-distribution and noisy data. In view of this issue, we propose to consider uncertainty in predictive models based upon a theoretical framework of Bayesian deep learning. Bayesian neural networks can be regarded as self-aware machinery; that is, a machine that knows its own limitations. To quantify uncertainty, we approximate the posterior predictive distribution through Monte Carlo sampling with stochastic forward passes. We further show that predictive uncertainty can be disentangled into aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties and these quantities can be learnt in an unsupervised manner. Experimental results demonstrate an improvement delivered by Bayesian uncertainty analysis upon steganographic capacity-distortion performance. ",

Specifically, we explore the semantic consistency between the visual information and text information of videos, for the self-supervised pretraining of a multimodal encoder on a newly-collected dataset of video-text pairs. Additionally, we introduce a progressive video summarization method, where the important content in a video is pinpointed progressively to generate better summaries. Finally, an objective evaluation framework is proposed to measure the quality of video summaries based on video classification.

    "abstract": "It is known that neural networks are subject to attacks through adversarial perturbations, i.e., inputs which are maliciously crafted through perturbations to induce wrong predictions. Furthermore, such attacks are impossible to eliminate, i.e., the adversarial perturbation is still possible after applying mitigation methods such as adversarial training. Multiple approaches have been developed to detect and reject such adversarial inputs, mostly in the image domain. Rejecting suspicious inputs however may not be always feasible or ideal. First, normal inputs may be rejected due to false alarms generated by the detection algorithm. Second, denial-of-service attacks may be conducted by feeding such systems with adversarial inputs. To address the gap, in this work, we propose an approach to automatically repair adversarial texts at runtime. Given a text which is suspected to be adversarial, we novelly apply multiple adversarial perturbation methods in a positive way to identify a repair, i.e., a slightly mutated but semantically equivalent text that the neural network correctly classifies. Our approach has been experimented with multiple models trained for natural language processing tasks and the results show that our approach is effective, i.e., it successfully repairs about 80\\% of the adversarial texts. Furthermore, depending on the applied perturbation method, an adversarial text could be repaired in as short as one second on average. ",

    "abstract": "We introduce a novel backbone architecture to improve target-perception ability of feature representation for tracking. Specifically, having observed that de facto frameworks perform feature matching simply using the outputs from backbone for target localization, there is no direct feedback from the matching module to the backbone network, especially the shallow layers. More concretely, only the matching module can directly access the target information (in the reference frame), while the representation learning of candidate frame is blind to the reference target. As a consequence, the accumulation effect of target-irrelevant interference in the shallow stages may degrade the feature quality of deeper layers. In this paper, we approach the problem from a different angle by conducting multiple branch-wise interactions inside the Siamese-like backbone networks (InBN). At the core of InBN is a general interaction modeler (GIM) that injects the prior knowledge of reference image to different stages of the backbone network, leading to better target-perception and robust distractor-resistance of candidate feature representation with negligible computation cost. The proposed GIM module and InBN mechanism are general and applicable to different backbone types including CNN and Transformer for improvements, as evidenced by our extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks. In particular, the CNN version (based on SiamCAR) improves the baseline with 3.2/6.9 absolute gains of SUC on LaSOT/TNL2K, respectively. The Transformer version obtains SUC scores of 65.7/52.0 on LaSOT/TNL2K, which are on par with recent state of the arts. Code and models will be released. ",

Using a multi-stage approach extending neural radiance fields, we first infer the surface geometry and refine the coarsely estimated initial camera parameters, while leveraging coarse foreground object masks to improve the training efficiency and geometry quality. We also introduce a robust normal estimation technique which eliminates the effect of geometric noise while retaining crucial details. Lastly, we extract surface material properties and ambient illumination, represented in spherical harmonics with extensions that handle transient elements, e.g. sharp shadows. The union of these components results in a highly modular and efficient object acquisition framework.

First, we find that masking a high ratio of the input graph structure, e.g., $70\\%$, yields a nontrivial and meaningful self-supervisory task that benefits downstream applications. Second, we employ a graph neural network (GNN) as an encoder to perform message propagation on the partially-masked graph. To reconstruct the large number of masked edges, a tailored cross-correlation decoder is proposed. It could capture the cross-correlation between the head and tail nodes of anchor edge in multi-granularity. Coupling these two designs enables MGAE to be trained efficiently and effectively. Extensive experiments on multiple open datasets (Planetoid and OGB benchmarks) demonstrate that MGAE generally performs better than state-of-the-art unsupervised learning competitors on link prediction and node classification.

In this work, we propose a methodology to augment the monolingual data for artificially generating spoken CS text to improve different speech modules.

Previous work introduced \\textit{risk-based active learning}, an online approach for the development of statistical classifiers that takes into account the decision-support context in which they are applied. Decision-making is considered by preferentially querying data labels according to \\textit{expected value of perfect information} (EVPI). Although several benefits are gained by adopting a risk-based active learning approach, including improved decision-making performance, the algorithms suffer from issues relating to sampling bias as a result of the guided querying process. This sampling bias ultimately manifests as a decline in decision-making performance during the later stages of active learning, which in turn corresponds to lost resource/utility. The current paper proposes two novel approaches to counteract the effects of sampling bias: \\textit{semi-supervised learning}, and \\textit{discriminative classification models}. These approaches are first visualised using a synthetic dataset, then subsequently applied to an experimental case study, specifically, the Z24 Bridge dataset. The semi-supervised learning approach is shown to have variable performance; with robustness to sampling bias dependent on the suitability of the generative distributions selected for the model with respect to each dataset. In contrast, the discriminative classifiers are shown to have excellent robustness to the effects of sampling bias. Moreover, it was found that the number of inspections made during a monitoring campaign, and therefore resource expenditure, could be reduced with the careful selection of the statistical classifiers used within a decision-supporting monitoring system.

This may be related to the ability of human pilots to select task-relevant visual information effectively. This work investigates whether neural networks capable of imitating human eye gaze behavior and attention can improve neural network performance for the challenging task of vision-based autonomous drone racing. We hypothesize that gaze-based attention prediction can be an efficient mechanism for visual information selection and decision making in a simulator-based drone racing task. We test this hypothesis using eye gaze and flight trajectory data from 18 human drone pilots to train a visual attention prediction model. We then use this visual attention prediction model to train an end-to-end controller for vision-based autonomous drone racing using imitation learning. We compare the drone racing performance of the attention-prediction controller to those using raw image inputs and image-based abstractions (i.e., feature tracks). Our results show that attention-prediction based controllers outperform the baselines and are able to complete a challenging race track consistently with up to 88% success rate. Furthermore, visual attention-prediction and feature-track based models showed better generalization performance than image-based models when evaluated on hold-out reference trajectories. Our results demonstrate that human visual attention prediction improves the performance of autonomous vision-based drone racing agents and provides an essential step towards vision-based, fast, and agile autonomous flight that eventually can reach and even exceed human performances.

    "abstract": "This paper presents FogAdapt, a novel approach for domain adaptation of semantic segmentation for dense foggy scenes. Although significant research has been directed to reduce the domain shift in semantic segmentation, adaptation to scenes with adverse weather conditions remains an open question. Large variations in the visibility of the scene due to weather conditions, such as fog, smog, and haze, exacerbate the domain shift, thus making unsupervised adaptation in such scenarios challenging. We propose a self-entropy and multi-scale information augmented self-supervised domain adaptation method (FogAdapt) to minimize the domain shift in foggy scenes segmentation. Supported by the empirical evidence that an increase in fog density results in high self-entropy for segmentation probabilities, we introduce a self-entropy based loss function to guide the adaptation method. Furthermore, inferences obtained at different image scales are combined and weighted by the uncertainty to generate scale-invariant pseudo-labels for the target domain. These scale-invariant pseudo-labels are robust to visibility and scale variations. We evaluate the proposed model on real clear-weather scenes to real foggy scenes adaptation and synthetic non-foggy images to real foggy scenes adaptation scenarios. Our experiments demonstrate that FogAdapt significantly outperforms the current state-of-the-art in semantic segmentation of foggy images. Specifically, by considering the standard settings compared to state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, FogAdapt gains 3.8% on Foggy Zurich, 6.0% on Foggy Driving-dense, and 3.6% on Foggy Driving in mIoU when adapted from Cityscapes to Foggy Zurich.

    "abstract": "Despite the recent success of long-tailed object detection, almost all long-tailed object detectors are developed based on the two-stage paradigm. In practice, one-stage detectors are more prevalent in the industry because they have a simple and fast pipeline that is easy to deploy. However, in the long-tailed scenario, this line of work has not been explored so far. In this paper, we investigate whether one-stage detectors can perform well in this case. We discover the primary obstacle that prevents one-stage detectors from achieving excellent performance is: categories suffer from different degrees of positive-negative imbalance problems under the long-tailed data distribution. The conventional focal loss balances the training process with the same modulating factor for all categories, thus failing to handle the long-tailed problem. To address this issue, we propose the Equalized Focal Loss (EFL) that rebalances the loss contribution of positive and negative samples of different categories independently according to their imbalance degrees. Specifically, EFL adopts a category-relevant modulating factor which can be adjusted dynamically by the training status of different categories. Extensive experiments conducted on the challenging LVIS v1 benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method. With an end-to-end training pipeline, EFL achieves 29.2% in terms of overall AP and obtains significant performance improvements on rare categories, surpassing all existing state-of-the-art methods.

Our method demonstrates the best registration performance on our and a public multi-modal dataset in comparison to competing methods. ",

    "title": "PWM2Vec: An Efficient Embedding Approach for Viral Host Specification  from Coronavirus Spike Sequences",
    "abstract": "COVID-19 pandemic, is still unknown and is an important open question. There are speculations that bats are a possible origin. Likewise, there are many closely related (corona-) viruses, such as SARS, which was found to be transmitted through civets. The study of the different hosts which can be potential carriers and transmitters of deadly viruses to humans is crucial to understanding, mitigating and preventing current and future pandemics. In coronaviruses, the surface (S) protein, or spike protein, is an important part of determining host specificity since it is the point of contact between the virus and the host cell membrane. In this paper, we classify the hosts of over five thousand coronaviruses from their spike protein sequences, segregating them into clusters of distinct hosts among avians, bats, camels, swines, humans and weasels, to name a few. We propose a feature embedding based on the well-known position-weight matrix (PWM), which we call PWM2Vec, and use to generate feature vectors from the spike protein sequences of these coronaviruses. While our embedding is inspired by the success of PWMs in biological applications such as determining protein function, or identifying transcription factor binding sites, we are the first (to the best of our knowledge) to use PWMs in the context of host classification from viral sequences to generate a fixed-length feature vector representation. The results on the real world data show that in using PWM2Vec, we are able to perform comparably well as compared to baseline models. We also measure the importance of different amino acids using information gain to show the amino acids which are important for predicting the host of a given coronavirus. ",

    "abstract": "We develop the \"generalized consistent weighted sampling\" (GCWS) for hashing the \"powered-GMM\" (pGMM) kernel (with a tuning parameter $p$). It turns out that GCWS provides a numerically stable scheme for applying power transformation on the original data, regardless of the magnitude of $p$ and the data. The power transformation is often effective for boosting the performance, in many cases considerably so. We feed the hashed data to neural networks on a variety of public classification datasets and name our method ``GCWSNet''. Our extensive experiments show that GCWSNet often improves the classification accuracy. Furthermore, it is evident from the experiments that GCWSNet converges substantially faster. In fact, GCWS often reaches a reasonable accuracy with merely (less than) one epoch of the training process. This property is much desired because many applications, such as advertisement click-through rate (CTR) prediction models, or data streams (i.e., data seen only once), often train just one epoch. Another beneficial side effect is that the computations of the first layer of the neural networks become additions instead of multiplications because the input data become binary (and highly sparse). Empirical comparisons with (normalized) random Fourier features (NRFF) are provided. We also propose to reduce the model size of GCWSNet by count-sketch and develop the theory for analyzing the impact of using count-sketch on the accuracy of GCWS. Our analysis shows that an ``8-bit'' strategy should work well in that we can always apply an 8-bit count-sketch hashing on the output of GCWS hashing without hurting the accuracy much. There are many other ways to take advantage of GCWS when training deep neural networks. For example, one can apply GCWS on the outputs of the last layer to boost the accuracy of trained deep neural networks. ",

Our implementation divides the sinograms and reconstructs the CT images pitch by pitch. By utilizing the periodic properties of the parameters of the Katsevich algorithm, our method only needs to calculate these parameters once for all the pitches and so has lower GPU-memory burdens and is very suitable for deep learning. By embedding our implementation into the network, we propose an end-to-end deep network for the high pitch helical CT reconstruction with sparse detectors. Since our network utilizes the features extracted from both sinograms and CT images, it can simultaneously reduce the streak artifacts caused by the sparsity of sinograms and preserve fine details in the CT images. Experiments show that our network outperforms the related methods both in subjective and objective evaluations. ",

    "abstract": "Image restoration algorithms such as super resolution (SR) are indispensable pre-processing modules for object detection in degraded images. However, most of these algorithms assume the degradation is fixed and known a priori. When the real degradation is unknown or differs from assumption, both the pre-processing module and the consequent high-level task such as object detection would fail. Here, we propose a novel framework, RestoreDet, to detect objects in degraded low resolution images. RestoreDet utilizes the downsampling degradation as a kind of transformation for self-supervised signals to explore the equivariant representation against various resolutions and other degradation conditions. Specifically, we learn this intrinsic visual structure by encoding and decoding the degradation transformation from a pair of original and randomly degraded images. The framework could further take the advantage of advanced SR architectures with an arbitrary resolution restoring decoder to reconstruct the original correspondence from the degraded input image. Both the representation learning and object detection are optimized jointly in an end-to-end training fashion. RestoreDet is a generic framework that could be implemented on any mainstream object detection architectures. The extensive experiment shows that our framework based on CenterNet has achieved superior performance compared with existing methods when facing variant degradation situations. Our code would be released soon. ",

    "abstract": "In time series data analysis, detecting change points on a real-time basis (online) is of great interest in many areas, such as finance, environmental monitoring, and medicine. One promising means to achieve this is the Bayesian online change point detection (BOCPD) algorithm, which has been successfully adopted in particular cases in which the time series of interest has a fixed baseline. However, we have found that the algorithm struggles when the baseline irreversibly shifts from its initial state. This is because with the original BOCPD algorithm, the sensitivity with which a change point can be detected is degraded if the data points are fluctuating at locations relatively far from the original baseline. In this paper, we not only extend the original BOCPD algorithm to be applicable to a time series whose baseline is constantly shifting toward unknown values but also visualize why the proposed extension works. To demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed algorithm compared to the original one, we examine these algorithms on two real-world data sets and six synthetic data sets. ",

We address this issue by introducing a shortwave-infrared (SWIR) band where clouds are highly reflective, and snow is absorptive. As SWIR is typically of a lower resolution compared to VNIR, this study proposes a multiresolution fully convolutional neural network (FCN) that can effectively detect clouds and snow in VNIR images. We fuse the multiresolution bands within a deep FCN and perform semantic segmentation at the higher, VNIR resolution. Such a fusion-based classifier, trained in an end-to-end manner, achieved 94.31% overall accuracy and an F1 score of 97.67% for clouds on Resourcesat-2 data captured over the state of Uttarakhand, India. These scores were found to be 30% higher than a Random Forest classifier, and 10% higher than a standalone single-resolution FCN. Apart from being useful for cloud detection purposes, the study also highlights the potential of convolutional neural networks for multi-sensor fusion problems. ",

    "abstract": "Recently, various view synthesis distortion estimation models have been studied to better serve for 3-D video coding. However, they can hardly model the relationship quantitatively among different levels of depth changes, texture degeneration, and the view synthesis distortion (VSD), which is crucial for rate-distortion optimization and rate allocation. In this paper, an auto-weighted layer representation based view synthesis distortion estimation model is developed. Firstly, the sub-VSD (S-VSD) is defined according to the level of depth changes and their associated texture degeneration. After that, a set of theoretical derivations demonstrate that the VSD can be approximately decomposed into the S-VSDs multiplied by their associated weights. To obtain the S-VSDs, a layer-based representation of S-VSD is developed, where all the pixels with the same level of depth changes are represented with a layer to enable efficient S-VSD calculation at the layer level. Meanwhile, a nonlinear mapping function is learnt to accurately represent the relationship between the VSD and S-VSDs, automatically providing weights for S-VSDs during the VSD estimation. To learn such function, a dataset of VSD and its associated S-VSDs are built. Experimental results show that the VSD can be accurately estimated with the weights learnt by the nonlinear mapping function once its associated S-VSDs are available. The proposed method outperforms the relevant state-of-the-art methods in both accuracy and efficiency. The dataset and source code of the proposed method will be available at https://github.com/jianjin008/. ",

The existing deep learning models for this task are trained on simulated datasets, which poses the domain shift challenge when applied to realistic scenarios. In this paper, we propose a spatiotemporal inception network (STIN) for photon-efficient imaging, which is able to precisely predict the depth from a sparse and high-noise photon counting histogram by fully exploiting spatial and temporal information. Then the domain adversarial adaptation frameworks, including domain-adversarial neural network and adversarial discriminative domain adaptation, are effectively applied to STIN to alleviate the domain shift problem for realistic applications. Comprehensive experiments on the simulated data generated from the NYU~v2 and the Middlebury datasets demonstrate that STIN outperforms the state-of-the-art models at low signal-to-background ratios from 2:10 to 2:100. Moreover, experimental results on the real-world dataset captured by the single-photon imaging prototype show that the STIN with domain adversarial training achieves better generalization performance compared with the state-of-the-arts as well as the baseline STIN trained by simulated data.

Despite the ubiquity of supervised and adversarial deep latent factor models, these methods should demonstrate improvement over simpler linear approaches to be preferred in practice. This necessitates a reproducible linear analog that still adheres to an augmenting supervised or adversarial objective. We address this methodological gap by presenting methods that augment the principal component analysis (PCA) objective with either a supervised or an adversarial objective and provide analytic and reproducible solutions. We implement these methods in an open-source Python package, AugmentedPCA, that can produce excellent real-world baselines. We demonstrate the utility of these factor models on an open-source, RNA-seq cancer gene expression dataset, showing that augmenting with a supervised objective results in improved downstream classification performance, produces principal components with greater class fidelity, and facilitates identification of genes aligned with the principal axes of data variance with implications to development of specific types of cancer.
