    "title": "Self-Supervised Beat Tracking in Musical Signals with Polyphonic  Contrastive Learning",
    "abstract": "Annotating musical beats is a very long in tedious process. In order to combat this problem, we present a new self-supervised learning pretext task for beat tracking and downbeat estimation. This task makes use of Spleeter, an audio source separation model, to separate a song's drums from the rest of its signal. The first set of signals are used as positives, and by extension negatives, for contrastive learning pre-training. The drum-less signals, on the other hand, are used as anchors. When pre-training a fully-convolutional and recurrent model using this pretext task, an onset function is learned. In some cases, this function was found to be mapped to periodic elements in a song. We found that pre-trained models outperformed randomly initialized models when a beat tracking training set was extremely small (less than 10 examples). When that was not the case, pre-training led to a learning speed-up that caused the model to overfit to the training set. More generally, this work defines new perspectives in the realm of musical self-supervised learning. It is notably one of the first works to use audio source separation as a fundamental component of self-supervision. ",

    "abstract": "Over the year, people have been using deep learning to tackle inversion problems, and we see the framework has been applied to build relationship between recording wavefield and velocity (Yang et al., 2016). Here we will extend the work from 2 perspectives, one is deriving a more appropriate loss function, as we now, pixel-2-pixel comparison might not be the best choice to characterize image structure, and we will elaborate on how to construct cost function to capture high level feature to enhance the model performance. Another dimension is searching for the more appropriate neural architecture, which is a subset of an even bigger picture, the automatic machine learning, or AutoML. There are several famous networks, U-net, ResNet (He et al., 2016) and DenseNet (Huang et al., 2017), and they achieve phenomenal results for certain problems, yet it's hard to argue they are the best for inversion problems without thoroughly searching within certain space. Here we will be showing our architecture search results for inversion. ",

    "abstract": "Automated scoring of free drawings or images as responses has yet to be utilized in large-scale assessments of student achievement. In this study, we propose artificial neural networks to classify these types of graphical responses from a computer based international mathematics and science assessment. We are comparing classification accuracy of convolutional and feedforward approaches. Our results show that convolutional neural networks (CNNs) outperform feedforward neural networks in both loss and accuracy. The CNN models classified up to 97.71% of the image responses into the appropriate scoring category, which is comparable to, if not more accurate, than typical human raters. These findings were further strengthened by the observation that the most accurate CNN models correctly classified some image responses that had been incorrectly scored by the human raters. As an additional innovation, we outline a method to select human rated responses for the training sample based on an application of the expected response function derived from item response theory. This paper argues that CNN-based automated scoring of image responses is a highly accurate procedure that could potentially replace the workload and cost of second human raters for large scale assessments, while improving the validity and comparability of scoring complex constructed-response items.

Randomized control trials (RCT) are expensive and inaccessible to most researchers, while expert-designed simulators fail to capture complex behaviors in real networks. We present CausalSim, a data-driven simulator for network protocols that addresses this challenge. Learning network behavior from observational data is complicated due to the bias introduced by the protocols used during data collection. CausalSim uses traces from an initial RCT under a set of protocols to learn a causal network model, effectively removing the biases present in the data. Using this model, CausalSim can then simulate any protocol over the same traces (i.e., for counterfactual predictions). Key to CausalSim is the novel use of adversarial neural network training that exploits distributional invariances that are present due to the training data coming from an RCT. Our extensive evaluation of CausalSim on both real and synthetic datasets and two use cases, including more than nine months of real data from the Puffer video streaming system, shows that it provides accurate counterfactual predictions, reducing prediction error by 44% and 53% on average compared to expert-designed and standard supervised learning baselines.

    "abstract": "Several studies have reported the importance of optimally operating the absorption column in a post-combustion CO2 capture (PCC) plant. It has been demonstrated in our previous work how economic Model Predictive Control (EMPC) has a great potential to improve the operation of the PCC plant. However, the use of a general economic objective such as maximizing the absorption efficiency of the column can cause EMPC to drive the state of the system close to the constraints. This may often than not lead to solvent overcirculation and flooding which are undesirable. In this work, we present an EMPC with zone tracking algorithm as an effective means to address this problem. The proposed control algorithm incorporates a zone tracking objective and an economic objective to form a multi-objective optimal control problem. To ensure that the zone tracking objective is achieved in the presence of model uncertainties and time-varying flue gas flow rate, we propose a method to modify the original target zone with a control invariant set. The zone modification method combines both ellipsoidal control invariant set techniques and a back-off strategy. The use of ellipsoidal control invariant sets ensure that the method is applicable to large scale systems such as the absorption column. We present several simulation case studies that demonstrate the effectiveness and applicability of the proposed control algorithm to the absorption column in a post-combustion CO2 capture plant. ",

However, the scale and utility of neural networks is still greatly limited by the current hardware used to train them. These concerns have become increasingly pressing as conventional computers quickly approach physical limitations that will slow performance improvements in years to come. For these reasons, scientists have begun to explore alternative computing platforms, like quantum computers, for training neural networks. In recent years, variational quantum circuits have emerged as one of the most successful approaches to quantum deep learning on noisy intermediate scale quantum devices. We propose a hybrid quantum-classical neural network architecture where each neuron is a variational quantum circuit. We empirically analyze the performance of this hybrid neural network on a series of binary classification data sets using a simulated universal quantum computer and a state of the art universal quantum computer. On simulated hardware, we observe that the hybrid neural network achieves roughly 10% higher classification accuracy and 20% better minimization of cost than an individual variational quantum circuit. On quantum hardware, we observe that each model only performs well when the qubit and gate count is sufficiently small. ",

This paper presents an extensive evaluation of the robustness of semantic segmentation models when attacked with different types of adversarial patches, including digital, simulated, and physical ones. A novel loss function is proposed to improve the capabilities of attackers in inducing a misclassification of pixels. Also, a novel attack strategy is presented to improve the Expectation Over Transformation method for placing a patch in the scene. Finally, a state-of-the-art method for detecting adversarial patch is first extended to cope with semantic segmentation models, then improved to obtain real-time performance, and eventually evaluated in real-world scenarios. Experimental results reveal that, even though the adversarial effect is visible with both digital and real-world attacks, its impact is often spatially confined to areas of the image around the patch. This opens to further questions about the spatial robustness of real-time semantic segmentation models. ",

    "abstract": "As the network slicing is one of the critical enablers in communication networks, one anomalous physical node (PN) or physical link (PL) in substrate networks that carries multiple virtual network elements can cause significant performance degradation of multiple network slices. To recover the substrate networks from anomaly within a short time, rapid and accurate identification of whether or not the anomaly exists in PNs and PLs is vital. Online anomaly detection methods that can analyze system data in real-time are preferred. Besides, as virtual nodes and links mapped to PNs and PLs are scattered in multiple slices, the distributed detection modes are required to adapt to the virtualized environment. According to those requirements, in this paper, we first propose a distributed online PN anomaly detection algorithm based on a decentralized one-class support vector machine (OCSVM), which is realized through analyzing real-time measurements of virtual nodes mapped to PNs in a distributed manner. Specifically, to decouple the OCSVM objective function, we transform the original problem to a group of decentralized quadratic programming problems by introducing the consensus constraints. The alternating direction method of multipliers is adopted to achieve the solution for the distributed online PN anomaly detection. Next, by utilizing the correlation of measurements between neighbor virtual nodes, another distributed online PL anomaly detection algorithm based on the canonical correlation analysis is proposed. The network only needs to store covariance matrices and mean vectors of current data to calculate the canonical correlation vectors for real-time PL anomaly analysis. The simulation results on both synthetic and real-world network datasets show the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed distributed online anomaly detection algorithms. ",

For the UDA-based cross-domain object detection methods, the majority of them alleviate the domain bias by inducing the domain-invariant feature generation via adversarial learning strategy. However, their domain discriminators have limited classification ability due to the unstable adversarial training process. Therefore, the extracted features induced by them cannot be perfectly domain-invariant and still contain domain-private factors, bringing obstacles to further alleviate the cross-domain discrepancy. To tackle this issue, we design a Domain Disentanglement Faster-RCNN (DDF) to eliminate the source-specific information in the features for detection task learning. Our DDF method facilitates the feature disentanglement at the global and local stages, with a Global Triplet Disentanglement (GTD) module and an Instance Similarity Disentanglement (ISD) module, respectively. By outperforming state-of-the-art methods on four benchmark UDA object detection tasks, our DDF method is demonstrated to be effective with wide applicability. ",

    "abstract": "This paper proposes an efficient approach to learning disentangled representations with causal mechanisms based on the difference of conditional probabilities in original and new distributions. We approximate the difference with models' generalization abilities so that it fits in the standard machine learning framework and can be efficiently computed. In contrast to the state-of-the-art approach, which relies on the learner's adaptation speed to new distribution, the proposed approach only requires evaluating the model's generalization ability. We provide a theoretical explanation for the advantage of the proposed method, and our experiments show that the proposed technique is 1.9--11.0$\\times$ more sample efficient and 9.4--32.4 times quicker than the previous method on various tasks.

    "abstract": "The non-convexity of the artificial neural network (ANN) training landscape brings inherent optimization difficulties. While the traditional back-propagation stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithm and its variants are effective in certain cases, they can become stuck at spurious local minima and are sensitive to initializations and hyperparameters. Recent work has shown that the training of an ANN with ReLU activations can be reformulated as a convex program, bringing hope to globally optimizing interpretable ANNs. However, naively solving the convex training formulation has an exponential complexity, and even an approximation heuristic requires cubic time. In this work, we characterize the quality of this approximation and develop two efficient algorithms that train ANNs with global convergence guarantees. The first algorithm is based on the alternating direction method of multiplier (ADMM). It solves both the exact convex formulation and the approximate counterpart. Linear global convergence is achieved, and the initial several iterations often yield a solution with high prediction accuracy. When solving the approximate formulation, the per-iteration time complexity is quadratic. The second algorithm, based on the \"sampled convex programs\" theory, is simpler to implement. It solves unconstrained convex formulations and converges to an approximately globally optimal classifier. The non-convexity of the ANN training landscape exacerbates when adversarial training is considered. We apply the robust convex optimization theory to convex training and develop convex formulations that train ANNs robust to adversarial inputs. Our analysis explicitly focuses on one-hidden-layer fully connected ANNs, but can extend to more sophisticated architectures. ",

    "abstract": "Although point-based networks are demonstrated to be accurate for 3D point cloud modeling, they are still falling behind their voxel-based competitors in 3D detection. We observe that the prevailing set abstraction design for down-sampling points may maintain too much unimportant background information that can affect feature learning for detecting objects. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel set abstraction method named Semantics-Augmented Set Abstraction (SASA). Technically, we first add a binary segmentation module as the side output to help identify foreground points. Based on the estimated point-wise foreground scores, we then propose a semantics-guided point sampling algorithm to help retain more important foreground points during down-sampling. In practice, SASA shows to be effective in identifying valuable points related to foreground objects and improving feature learning for point-based 3D detection. Additionally, it is an easy-to-plug-in module and able to boost various point-based detectors, including single-stage and two-stage ones. Extensive experiments on the popular KITTI and nuScenes datasets validate the superiority of SASA, lifting point-based detection models to reach comparable performance to state-of-the-art voxel-based methods.

Unfortunately, it is now well known that convolutional networks often produce erroneous results - for example, minor perturbations of the inputs of these networks can result in severe classification errors. Numerous verification approaches have been proposed in recent years to prove the absence of such errors, but these are typically geared for fully connected networks and suffer from exacerbated scalability issues when applied to convolutional networks. To address this gap, we present here the Cnn-Abs framework, which is particularly aimed at the verification of convolutional networks. The core of Cnn-Abs is an abstraction-refinement technique, which simplifies the verification problem through the removal of convolutional connections in a way that soundly creates an over-approximation of the original problem; and which restores these connections if the resulting problem becomes too abstract. Cnn-Abs is designed to use existing verification engines as a backend, and our evaluation demonstrates that it can significantly boost the performance of a state-of-the-art DNN verification engine, reducing runtime by 15.7% on average.

    "abstract": "The user-centric cooperative transmission provides a compelling way to alleviate frequent handovers caused by an ever-increasing number of randomly deployed base stations (BSs) in ultra-dense networks (UDNs). This paper proposes a new user-centric cooperative transmissions-based handover scheme, i.e., the group-cell handover (GCHO) scheme, with the aim of reducing the handover rate in UDNs. In the proposed scheme, the boundary of the cooperating cluster depends on the distance among the user equipment (UE) and cooperating BSs. The new scheme captures the dynamicity and irregularity of the cooperating cluster topology resulting from randomly distributed BSs. Based on stochastic-geometry tools where BSs locations are modeled as the Poison point process (PPP), we derive an analytical expression of the handover rate for the UE with an arbitrary movement trajectory. Furthermore, a GCHO skipping (GCHO-S) scheme is proposed to minimize the handover cost, i.e., the percentage of time wasted in handover signaling in user-centric cooperative transmissions scenarios. The numerical results show that the GCHO scheme decreases the handover rate by 42.3% and 72.7% compared with the traditional single BS association and fixed-region cooperative network topology handover approaches, respectively. Moreover, under the same group-cell size and constant velocity, the GCHO-S scheme diminishes the handover cost by 50% against the GCHO scheme. ",

Centralized methods for fake news detection, however, cannot effectively protect user privacy during the process of centralized data collection for training models.

To overcome these challenges, this paper proposed a novel decentralized method, Human-in-the-loop Based Swarm Learning (HBSL), to integrate user feedback into the loop of learning and inference for recognizing fake news without violating user privacy in a decentralized manner. It consists of distributed nodes that are able to independently learn and detect fake news on local data. Furthermore, detection models trained on these nodes can be enhanced through decentralized model merging. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art decentralized method in regard of detecting fake news on a benchmark dataset. ",

However, the great variety of classic object detection frameworks and training strategies makes performance comparison between methods difficult. In particular, for attention-based FSOD methods, it is laborious to compare the impact of the different attention mechanisms on performance. This paper aims at filling this shortcoming. To do so, a flexible framework is proposed to allow the implementation of most of the attention techniques available in the literature.

However, previous algorithms, with or without learning strategies, usually suffer from the degradation of the optimality with the increment of the problem size. In this paper, we propose a learnable linear assignment solver based on deep graph networks. Specifically, we first transform the cost matrix to a bipartite graph and convert the assignment task to the problem of selecting reliable edges from the constructed graph. Subsequently, a deep graph network is developed to aggregate and update the features of nodes and edges. Finally, the network predicts a label for each edge that indicates the assignment relationship. The experimental results on a synthetic dataset reveal that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and achieves consistently high accuracy with the increment of the problem size. Furthermore, we also embed the proposed solver, in comparison with state-of-the-art baseline solvers, into a popular multi-object tracking (MOT) framework to train the tracker in an end-to-end manner. The experimental results on MOT benchmarks illustrate that the proposed LAP solver improves the tracker by the largest margin. ",

Service Function Chaining (SFC) plays a critical role in delivering sophisticated service per slice and enables traffic traversal through a set of ordered Service Functions (SFs). In fully symmetric SFCs, the uplink and downlink traffic traverse the same SFs, while in asymmetric SFC, the reverse-path may not necessarily cross the same SFs in the reverse order. Proposed approaches in the literature support either full symmetry or no symmetry. In this paper, we discuss the partial symmetry concept, that enforces the reverse path to traverse the SFs only when needed. Our contribution is threefold. First, we propose a novel SFC framework with an abstraction layer that can dynamically create partial or full symmetric SFCs across multiple administrative and technological cloud/edge domains. According to the Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and desired objectives specified at the network slice intent request, the abstraction layer would automatise different SFC operations, but specifically generating partial or full symmetric SFCs. Second, we propose an algorithm to dynamically calculate the reverse path for an SFC by including only SFs requiring symmetry. Third, we implement a prototype application to test the performance of the partial symmetry algorithm. The obtained results show the advantages of partial symmetry in reducing both the SFC delivery time and the load on VNFs. ",

We propose to integrate the grant-free non-orthogonal multiple access (GF-NOMA) paradigm with the emerging orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) modulation to accommodate the massive IoT access, and mitigate the long round-trip latency and severe Doppler effect of terrestrial-satellite links (TSLs). On this basis, we put forward a two-stage successive active terminal identification (ATI) and channel estimation (CE) scheme as well as a low-complexity multi-user signal detection (SD) method. Specifically, at the first stage, the proposed training sequence aided OTFS (TS-OTFS) data frame structure facilitates the joint ATI and coarse CE, whereby both the traffic sparsity of terrestrial IoT terminals and the sparse channel impulse response are leveraged for enhanced performance. Moreover, based on the single Doppler shift property for each TSL and sparsity of delay-Doppler domain channel, we develop a parametric approach to further refine the CE performance. Finally, a least square based parallel time domain SD method is developed to detect the OTFS signals with relatively low complexity. Simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed methods over the state-of-the-art solutions in terms of ATI, CE, and SD performance confronted with the long round-trip latency and severe Doppler effect.

    "abstract": "Traditional recommender systems aim to estimate a user's rating to an item based on observed ratings from the population. As with all observational studies, hidden confounders, which are factors that affect both item exposures and user ratings, lead to a systematic bias in the estimation. Consequently, a new trend in recommender system research is to negate the influence of confounders from a causal perspective. Observing that confounders in recommendations are usually shared among items and are therefore multi-cause confounders, we model the recommendation as a multi-cause multi-outcome (MCMO) inference problem. Specifically, to remedy confounding bias, we estimate user-specific latent variables that render the item exposures independent Bernoulli trials. The generative distribution is parameterized by a DNN with factorized logistic likelihood and the intractable posteriors are estimated by variational inference. Controlling these factors as substitute confounders, under mild assumptions, can eliminate the bias incurred by multi-cause confounders. Furthermore, we show that MCMO modeling may lead to high variance due to scarce observations associated with the high-dimensional causal space. Fortunately, we theoretically demonstrate that introducing user features as pre-treatment variables can substantially improve sample efficiency and alleviate overfitting. Empirical studies on simulated and real-world datasets show that the proposed deep causal recommender shows more robustness to unobserved confounders than state-of-the-art causal recommenders.

We generalise this result to near-shortest paths, i.e. $\\kappa$-straight paths, as we show how to compute a $(1+\\varepsilon)$-approximation between a $\\kappa$-straight path $P$ and any walk $Q$ in $O(|G| \\log |G| / \\sqrt{\\varepsilon} + |P| + \\frac{\\kappa|Q|}{\\varepsilon } )$ time. Our algorithmic results hold for both the strong and the weak discrete Fr\\'{e}chet distance over the shortest path metric in $G$. Finally, we show that additional assumptions on the input, such as our assumption on path straightness, are indeed necessary to obtain truly subquadratic running time. We provide a conditional lower bound showing that the Fr\\'{e}chet distance, or even its $1.01$-approximation, between arbitrary \\emph{paths} in a weighted planar graph cannot be computed in $O((|P|\\cdot|Q|)^{1-\\delta})$ time for any $\\delta > 0$ unless the Orthogonal Vector Hypothesis fails. For walks, this lower bound holds even when $G$ is planar, unit-weight and has $O(1)$ vertices. ",

    "abstract": "Social Media usage has increased to an all-time high level in today's digital world. The majority of the population uses social media tools (like Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, etc.) to share their thoughts and experiences with the community. Analysing the sentiments and opinions of the common public is very important for both the government and the business people. This is the reason behind the activeness of many media agencies during the election time for performing various kinds of opinion polls. In this paper, we have worked towards analysing the sentiments of the people of India during the Lok Sabha election of 2019 using the Twitter data of that duration. We have built an automatic tweet analyser using the Transfer Learning technique to handle the unsupervised nature of this problem. We have used the Linear Support Vector Classifiers method in our Machine Learning model, also, the Term Frequency Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) methodology for handling the textual data of tweets. Further, we have increased the capability of the model to address the sarcastic tweets posted by some of the users, which has not been yet considered by the researchers in this domain. ",

Another note-worthy contribution of this implementation is its non-blocking client-server communication architecture among its distributed graph servers. A non-bottlenecking partitioning scheme based on duplication of nodes is also implemented ensuring minimal communications using distributed filtering on geo-spatial, random and explicit sharding choices. Finally, an efficient re-balancing algorithm followed by a distributed shortest path solver will be demonstrated with examples from both geo-spatial and social networks. ",

Different from prior approaches that synthesize EM structures from target circuit component values and target topologies, our proposed approach achieves the direct synthesis of the passive network given the network topology from desired performance values as input. We showcase the proposed synthesis Neural Network (NN) model on an on-chip 1:1 transformer-based impedance matching network. By leveraging parameter sharing, the synthesis NN model successfully extracts relevant features from the input impedance and load capacitors, and predict the transformer 3D EM geometry in a 45nm SOI process that will match the standard 50$\\Omega$ load to the target input impedance while absorbing the two loading capacitors. As a proof-of-concept, several example transformer geometries were synthesized, and verified in Ansys HFSS to provide the desired input impedance. ",

    "abstract": "Classification of long sequential data is an important Machine Learning task and appears in many application scenarios. Recurrent Neural Networks, Transformers, and Convolutional Neural Networks are three major techniques for learning from sequential data. Among these methods, Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCNs) which are scalable to very long sequences have achieved remarkable progress in time series regression. However, the performance of TCNs for sequence classification is not satisfactory because they use a skewed connection protocol and output classes at the last position. Such asymmetry restricts their performance for classification which depends on the whole sequence. In this work, we propose a symmetric multi-scale architecture called Circular Dilated Convolutional Neural Network (CDIL-CNN), where every position has an equal chance to receive information from other positions at the previous layers. Our model gives classification logits in all positions, and we can apply a simple ensemble learning to achieve a better decision. We have tested CDIL-CNN on various long sequential datasets. The experimental results show that our method has superior performance over many state-of-the-art approaches. ",

A wearable sensor garment that fits many robots is needed in many applications. This article presents an affordable wearable sensor vest, and an open-source software architecture with the Internet of Things (IoT) for social humanoid robots. The vest consists of touch, temperature, gesture, distance, vision sensors, and a wireless communication module. The IoT feature allows the robot to interact with humans locally and over the Internet. The designed architecture works for any social robot that has a general-purpose graphics processing unit (GPGPU), I2C/SPI buses, Internet connection, and the Robotics Operating System (ROS). The modular design of this architecture enables developers to easily add/remove/update complex behaviors. The proposed software architecture provides IoT technology, GPGPU nodes, I2C and SPI bus mangers, audio-visual interaction nodes (speech to text, text to speech, and image understanding), and isolation between behavior nodes and other nodes. The proposed IoT solution consists of related nodes in the robot, a RESTful web service, and user interfaces. We used the HTTP protocol as a means of two-way communication with the social robot over the Internet. Developers can easily edit or add nodes in C, C++, and Python programming languages. Our architecture can be used for designing more sophisticated behaviors for social humanoid robots. ",

Here, we introduce a quantum capsule network (dubbed QCapsNet) together with a quantum dynamic routing algorithm. Our model enjoys an exponential speedup in the dynamic routing process and exhibits an enhanced representation power. To benchmark the performance of the QCapsNet, we carry out extensive numerical simulations on the classification of handwritten digits and symmetry-protected topological phases, and show that the QCapsNet can achieve the state-of-the-art accuracy and outperforms conventional quantum classifiers evidently. We further unpack the output capsule state and find that a particular subspace may correspond to a human-understandable feature of the input data, which indicates the potential explainability of such networks. Our work reveals an intriguing prospect of quantum capsule networks in quantum machine learning, which may provide a valuable guide towards explainable quantum artificial intelligence. ",

    "abstract": "The problem of linear predictions has been extensively studied for the past century under pretty generalized frameworks. Recent advances in the robust statistics literature allow us to analyze robust versions of classical linear models through the prism of Median of Means (MoM). Combining these approaches in a piecemeal way might lead to ad-hoc procedures, and the restricted theoretical conclusions that underpin each individual contribution may no longer be valid. To meet these challenges coherently, in this study, we offer a unified robust framework that includes a broad variety of linear prediction problems on a Hilbert space, coupled with a generic class of loss functions. Notably, we do not require any assumptions on the distribution of the outlying data points ($\\mathcal{O}$) nor the compactness of the support of the inlying ones ($\\mathcal{I}$). Under mild conditions on the dual norm, we show that for misspecification level $\\epsilon$, these estimators achieve an error rate of $O(\\max\\left\\{|\\mathcal{O}|^{1/2}n^{-1/2}, |\\mathcal{I}|^{1/2}n^{-1} \\right\\}+\\epsilon)$, matching the best-known rates in literature. This rate is slightly slower than the classical rates of $O(n^{-1/2})$, indicating that we need to pay a price in terms of error rates to obtain robust estimates. Additionally, we show that this rate can be improved to achieve so-called ``fast rates\" under additional assumptions. ",

We show that in this setting there exist adjustment sets that are minimum cost optimal, in the sense that they yield non-parametric estimators of the interventional mean with the smallest asymptotic variance among those that control for observable adjustment sets that have minimum cost. Our results are based on the construction of a special flow network associated with the original causal graph. We show that a minimum cost optimal adjustment set can be found by computing a maximum flow on the network, and then finding the set of vertices that are reachable from the source by augmenting paths.

While a detailed understanding of the dynamics of linear autoencoders has recently been obtained, the study of non-linear autoencoders has been hindered by the technical difficulty of handling training data with non-trivial correlations - a fundamental prerequisite for feature extraction. Here, we study the dynamics of feature learning in non-linear, shallow autoencoders. We derive a set of asymptotically exact equations that describe the generalisation dynamics of autoencoders trained with stochastic gradient descent (SGD) in the limit of high-dimensional inputs. These equations reveal that autoencoders learn the leading principal components of their inputs sequentially. An analysis of the long-time dynamics explains the failure of sigmoidal autoencoders to learn with tied weights, and highlights the importance of training the bias in ReLU autoencoders. Building on previous results for linear networks, we analyse a modification of the vanilla SGD algorithm which allows learning of the exact principal components. Finally, we show that our equations accurately describe the generalisation dynamics of non-linear autoencoders on realistic datasets such as CIFAR10. ",
