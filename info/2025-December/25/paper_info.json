    "title": "Uncovering Patterns of Brain Activity from EEG Data Consistently Associated with Cybersickness Using Neural Network Interpretability Maps",
    "abstract": "           Cybersickness poses a serious challenge for users of virtual reality (VR) technology. Consequently, there has been significant effort to track its occurrence during VR use with brain activity through electroencephalography (EEG). However, a significant confound in current methods for detecting sickness from EEG is they do not account for the simultaneous processing of the sickening visual stimulus that is present in the brain data from VR. Using event-related potentials (ERPs) from an auditory stimulus shown to reflect cybersickness impacts, we can more precisely target EEG cybersickness features and use those to achieve better performance in online cybersickness classification. In this article, we introduce a method utilizing trained convolutional neural networks and transformer models and plot interpretability maps from integrated gradients and class activation to give a visual representation of what the model determined was most useful in sickness classification from an EEG dataset consisting of ERPs recorded during the elicitation of cybersickness. Across 12 runs of our method with three different neural networks, the models consistently pointed to a surprising finding: that amplitudes recorded at an electrode placed on the scalp near the left prefrontal cortex were important in the classification of cybersickness. These results help clarify a hidden pattern in other related research and point to exciting opportunities for future investigation: that this scalp location could be used as a tagged feature for better real-time cybersickness classification with EEG.

    "title": "How Feasible are Passive Network Attacks on 5G Networks and Beyond? A Survey",
    "abstract": "           Privacy concerns around 5G, the latest generation of mobile networks, are growing, with fears that its deployment may increase exposure to privacy risks. This perception is largely driven by the use of denser deployments of small antenna systems, which enable highly accurate data collection at higher speeds and closer proximity to mobile users. At the same time, 5G's unique radio communication features can make the reproduction of known network attacks more challenging. In particular, passive network attacks, which do not involve direct interaction with the target network and are therefore nearly impossible to detect, remain a pressing concern. Such attacks can reveal sensitive information about users, their devices, and active applications, which may then be exploited through known vulnerabilities or spear-phishing schemes. This survey examines the feasibility of passive network attacks in 5G and beyond (B5G/6G) networks, with emphasis on two major categories: information extraction (system identification, website and application fingerprinting) and geolocation (user identification and position tracking). These attacks are well documented and reproducible in existing wireless and mobile systems, including short-range networks (IEEE 802.11) and, to a lesser extent, LTE. Current evidence suggests that while such attacks remain theoretically possible in 5G, their practical execution is significantly constrained by directional beamforming, high-frequency propagation characteristics, and encryption mechanisms. For B5G and early 6G networks, the lack of public tools and high hardware cost currently renders these attacks infeasible in practice, which highlights a critical gap in our understanding of future network threat models.

    "abstract": "           This study introduces a quantum inspired framework for optimizing the exploration exploitation tradeoff in multiagent reinforcement learning, applied to UAVassisted 6G network deployment. We consider a cooperative scenario where ten intelligent UAVs autonomously coordinate to maximize signal coverage and support efficient network expansion under partial observability and dynamic conditions. The proposed approach integrates classical MARL algorithms with quantum-inspired optimization techniques, leveraging variational quantum circuits VQCs as the core structure and employing the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm QAOA as a representative VQC based method for combinatorial optimization. Complementary probabilistic modeling is incorporated through Bayesian inference, Gaussian processes, and variational inference to capture latent environmental dynamics. A centralized training with decentralized execution CTDE paradigm is adopted, where shared memory and local view grids enhance local observability among agents. Comprehensive experiments including scalability tests, sensitivity analysis, and comparisons with PPO and DDPG baselines demonstrate that the proposed framework improves sample efficiency, accelerates convergence, and enhances coverage performance while maintaining robustness. Radar chart and convergence analyses further show that QI MARL achieves a superior balance between exploration and exploitation compared to classical methods.

    "abstract": "           Accurate prediction of treatment outcomes in lung cancer remains challenging due to the sparsity, heterogeneity, and contextual overload of real-world electronic health data. Traditional models often fail to capture semantic information across multimodal streams, while large-scale fine-tuning approaches are impractical in clinical workflows. We introduce a framework that uses Large Language Models (LLMs) as Goal-oriented Knowledge Curators (GKC) to convert laboratory, genomic, and medication data into high-fidelity, task-aligned features. Unlike generic embeddings, GKC produces representations tailored to the prediction objective and operates as an offline preprocessing step that integrates naturally into hospital informatics pipelines. Using a lung cancer cohort (N=184), we benchmarked GKC against expert-engineered features, direct text embeddings, and an end-to-end transformer. Our approach achieved a mean AUROC of 0.803 (95% CI: 0.799-0.807) and outperformed all baselines. An ablation study further confirmed the complementary value of combining all three modalities. These results show that the quality of semantic representation is a key determinant of predictive accuracy in sparse clinical data settings. By reframing LLMs as knowledge curation engines rather than black-box predictors, this work demonstrates a scalable, interpretable, and workflow-compatible pathway for advancing AI-driven decision support in oncology.

    "abstract": "           Catastrophic forgetting remains a fundamental challenge in continual learning for large language models. Recent work revealed that performance degradation may stem from spurious forgetting caused by task alignment disruption rather than true knowledge loss. However, this work only qualitatively describes alignment, relies on post-hoc analysis, and lacks automatic distinction mechanisms. We introduce the shallow versus deep alignment framework, providing the first quantitative characterization of alignment depth. We identify that current task alignment approaches suffer from shallow alignment - maintained only over the first few output tokens (approximately 3-5) - making models vulnerable to forgetting. This explains why spurious forgetting occurs, why it is reversible, and why fine-tuning attacks are effective. We propose a comprehensive framework addressing all gaps: (1) quantitative metrics (0-1 scale) to measure alignment depth across token positions; (2) real-time detection methods for identifying shallow alignment during training; (3) specialized analysis tools for visualization and recovery prediction; and (4) adaptive mitigation strategies that automatically distinguish forgetting types and promote deep alignment. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets and model architectures (Qwen2.5-3B to Qwen2.5-32B) demonstrate 86.2-90.6% identification accuracy and show that promoting deep alignment improves robustness against forgetting by 3.3-7.1% over baselines.

Large-scale monitoring using WSNs incurs high costs due to the deployment of sensor nodes in the target deployment area. In this paper, we address the challenge of prohibitive deployment costs by proposing an integrated mixed-Integer linear programming (MILP) framework that strategically combines static and mobile Zigbee nodes. Our network planning approach introduces three novel formulations, including boundary-optimized static node placement (MILP-Static), mobile path planning for coverage maximization (MILP-Cov), and movement minimization (MILP-Mov) of the mobile nodes. We validated our framework with extensive simulations and experimental measurements of Zigbee power constraints. Our results show that boundary-optimized static placement (MILP-Static) achieves 53.06% coverage compared with 33.42% of the random approach. In addition, MILP-Cov for path planning reaches 97.95% coverage, while movement minimization (MILP-Mov) reduces traversal cost by 40%. Our proposed framework outperforms the benchmark approaches to provide a foundational solution for cost-effective global IoT deployment in resource constrained environments.         ",

In addition, an essential component of our analysis involves determining the forecasting breakdown point, which is the smallest possible amount of training data our models need to predict future, unseen data accurately.

In this paper, we introduce the mathematical paradigm of DRQC into classical models by proposing a quantum-inspired data re-uploading network (Q-RUN), which retains the Fourier-expressive advantages of quantum models without any quantum hardware. Experimental results demonstrate that Q-RUN delivers superior performance across both data modeling and predictive modeling tasks.

Notably, Q-RUN can serve as a drop-in replacement for standard fully connected layers, improving the performance of a wide range of neural architectures.

    "abstract": "           The source detection problem arises when an epidemic process unfolds over a contact network, and the objective is to identify its point of origin, i.e., the source node. Research on this problem began with the seminal work of Shah and Zaman in 2010, who formally defined it and introduced the notion of rumor centrality. With the emergence of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), several studies have proposed GNN-based approaches to source detection. However, some of these works lack methodological clarity and/or are hard to reproduce. As a result, it remains unclear (to us, at least) whether GNNs truly outperform more traditional source detection methods across comparable settings. In this paper, we first review existing GNN-based methods for source detection, clearly outlining the specific settings each addresses and the models they employ. Building on this research, we propose a principled GNN architecture tailored to the source detection task. We also systematically investigate key questions surrounding this problem. Most importantly, we aim to provide a definitive assessment of how GNNs perform relative to other source detection methods. Our experiments show that GNNs substantially outperform all other methods we test across a variety of network types. Although we initially set out to challenge the notion of GNNs as a solution to source detection, our results instead demonstrate their remarkable effectiveness for this task. We discuss possible reasons for this strong performance. To ensure full reproducibility, we release all code and data on GitHub. Finally, we argue that epidemic source detection should serve as a benchmark task for evaluating GNN architectures.         ",

By analyzing their attention distributions, we observe that existing models tend to allocate attention primarily to common words, overlooking less popular yet highly task-relevant terms, which significantly impairs overall performance. To address this issue, we propose an Adversarial Feedback for Attention(AFA) training mechanism that enables the model to automatically redistribute attention weights to appropriate focal points without requiring manual annotations. This mechanism incorporates a dynamic masking strategy that attempts to mask various words to deceive a discriminator, while the discriminator strives to detect significant differences induced by these masks. Additionally, leveraging the sensitivity of Transformer models to token-level perturbations, we employ a policy gradient approach to optimize attention distributions, which facilitates efficient and rapid convergence. Experiments on three public datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art results. Furthermore, applying this training mechanism to enhance attention in large language models yields a further performance improvement of 12.6%         ",

To address this, we propose the Dynamic Conflict-Consensus Framework (DCCF), an inconsistency-seeking paradigm designed to amplify rather than suppress contradictions. First, DCCF decouples inputs into independent Fact and Sentiment spaces to distinguish objective mismatches from emotional dissonance. Second, we employ physics-inspired feature dynamics to iteratively polarize these representations, actively extracting maximally informative conflicts.

This paper introduces an automated red-teaming framework that systematically generates, executes, and evaluates adversarial prompts to uncover security vulnerabilities in LLMs. Our framework integrates meta-prompting-based attack synthesis, multi-modal vulnerability detection, and standardized evaluation protocols spanning six major threat categories -- reward hacking, deceptive alignment, data exfiltration, sandbagging, inappropriate tool use, and chain-of-thought manipulation.

    "abstract": "           Radio frequency (RF) based systems are increasingly used to detect drones by analyzing their RF signal patterns, converting them into spectrogram images which are processed by object detection models. Existing RF attacks against image based models alter digital features, making over-the-air (OTA) implementation difficult due to the challenge of converting digital perturbations to transmittable waveforms that may introduce synchronization errors and interference, and encounter hardware limitations. We present the first physical attack on RF image based drone detectors, optimizing class-specific universal complex baseband (I/Q) perturbation waveforms that are transmitted alongside legitimate communications. We evaluated the attack using RF recordings and OTA experiments with four types of drones. Our results show that modest, structured I/Q perturbations are compatible with standard RF chains and reliably reduce target drone detection while preserving detection of legitimate drones.

Cognitive Radio Networks CCNs help in alleviating the problem of spectrum scarcity, but classical sensing and allocation are still energy-consumption intensive, and sensitive to rapid spectrum variations. Our framework which centers on AI driven green CRN aims at integrating deep reinforcement learning (DRL) with transfer learning, energy harvesting (EH), reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) with other light-weight genetic refinement operations that optimally combine sensing timelines, transmit power, bandwidth distribution and RIS phase selection. Compared to two baselines, the utilization of MATLAB + NS-3 under dense loads, a traditional CRN with energy sensing under fixed policies, and a hybrid CRN with cooperative sensing under heuristic distribution of resource, there are (25-30%) fewer energy reserves used, sensing AUC greater than 0.90 and +6-13 p.p. higher PDR. The integrated framework is easily scalable to large IoT and vehicular applications, and it provides a feasible and sustainable roadmap to 6G CRNs.

The proposed method constructs a Once-for-All-style ResDets supernet and performs iterative evolutionary search that alternates between backbone and neck/head optimization, supported by a population passthrough mechanism and an accuracy predictor to reduce search cost and improve stability. This framework yields a family of deployment-ready detectors, termed TrashDets. On a five-class TACO subset (paper, plastic, bottle, can, cigarette), the strongest variant, TrashDet-l, achieves 19.5 mAP50 with 30.5M parameters, improving accuracy by up to 3.6 mAP50 over prior detectors while using substantially fewer parameters. The TrashDet family spans 1.2M to 30.5M parameters with mAP50 values between 11.4 and 19.5, providing scalable detector options for diverse TinyML deployment budgets on resource-constrained hardware. On the MAX78002 microcontroller with the TrashNet dataset, two specialized variants, TrashDet-ResNet and TrashDet-MBNet, jointly dominate the ai87-fpndetector baseline, with TrashDet-ResNet achieving 7525~$\\mu$J energy per inference at 26.7 ms latency and 37.45 FPS, and TrashDet-MBNet improving mAP50 by 10.2%; together they reduce energy consumption by up to 88%, latency by up to 78%, and average power by up to 53% compared to existing TinyML detectors.

In this work, we define a robustness property tailored to early exit architectures and show how off-the-shelf solvers can be used to assess it. We present a baseline algorithm, enhanced with an early stopping strategy and heuristic optimizations that maintain soundness and completeness. Experiments on multiple benchmarks validate our framework's effectiveness and demonstrate the performance gains of the improved algorithm. Alongside the natural inference acceleration provided by early exits, we show that they also enhance verifiability, enabling more queries to be solved in less time compared to standard networks.

    "abstract": "           Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a promising paradigm for post-training large language models (LLMs) on complex reasoning tasks. Yet, the conditions under which RLVR yields robust generalization remain poorly understood. This paper provides an empirical study of RLVR generalization in the setting of probabilistic inference over causal graphical models. This setting offers two natural axes along which to examine generalization: (i) the level of the probabilistic query -- associational, interventional, or counterfactual -- and (ii) the structural complexity of the query, measured by the size of its relevant subgraph. We construct datasets of causal graphs and queries spanning these difficulty axes and fine-tune Qwen-2.5-Instruct models using RLVR or supervised fine-tuning (SFT). We vary both the model scale (3B-32B) and the query level included in training. We find that RLVR yields stronger within-level and across-level generalization than SFT, but only for specific combinations of model size and training query level. Further analysis shows that RLVR's effectiveness depends on the model's initial reasoning competence. With sufficient initial competence, RLVR improves an LLM's marginalization strategy and reduces errors in intermediate probability calculations, producing substantial accuracy gains, particularly on more complex queries. These findings show that RLVR can improve specific causal reasoning subskills, with its benefits emerging only when the model has sufficient initial competence.         ",

A key property of effective simulators is their ability to expose failure modes of the systems they evaluate. We present an adversarial training framework that iteratively improves user simulator realism through a competitive dynamic between a generator (user simulator) and a discriminator. Applied to mental health support chatbots, our approach demonstrates that fine-tuned simulators dramatically outperform zero-shot base models at surfacing system issues, and adversarial training further enhances diversity, distributional alignment, and predictive validity. The resulting simulator achieves a strong correlation between simulated and real failure occurrence rates across diverse chatbot configurations while maintaining low distributional divergence of failure modes. Discriminator accuracy decreases drastically after three adversarial iterations, suggesting improved realism. These results provide evidence that adversarial training is a promising approach for creating realistic user simulators in mental health support TOD domains, enabling rapid, reliable, and cost-effective system evaluation before deployment.

    "abstract": "           As wildfires increasingly evolve into urban conflagrations, traditional risk models that treat structures as isolated assets fail to capture the non-linear contagion dynamics characteristic of the wildland urban interface (WUI). This research bridges the gap between mechanistic physics and data driven learning by establishing a novel dual specialist ensemble framework that disentangles vulnerability into two distinct vectors, environmental contagion and structural fragility. The architecture integrates two specialized predictive streams, an environmental specialist, implemented as a graph neural network (GNN) that operationalizes the community as a directed contagion graph weighted by physics informed convection, radiation, and ember probabilities, and enriched with high dimensional Google AlphaEarth Foundation embeddings, and a Structural Specialist, implemented via XGBoost to isolate granular asset level resilience. Applied to the 2025 Eaton Fire, the framework reveals a critical dichotomy in risk drivers. The GNN demonstrates that neighborhood scale environmental pressure overwhelmingly dominates intrinsic structural features in defining propagation pathways, while the XGBoost model identifies eaves as the primary micro scale ingress vector. By synthesizing these divergent signals through logistic stacking, the ensemble achieves robust classification and generates a diagnostic risk topology. This capability empowers decision makers to move beyond binary loss prediction and precisely target mitigation prioritizing vegetation management for high connectivity clusters and structural hardening for architecturally vulnerable nodes thereby operationalizing a proactive, data driven approach to community resilience.

The core idea of \\texttt{FedMPDD} is to encode each client's high-dimensional gradient by computing its directional derivatives along multiple random vectors. This compresses the gradient into a much smaller message, significantly reducing uplink communication costs from $\\mathcal{O}(d)$ to $\\mathcal{O}(m)$, where $m \\ll d$. The server then decodes the aggregated information by projecting it back onto the same random vectors. Our key insight is that averaging multiple projections overcomes the dimension-dependent convergence limitations of a single projection. We provide a rigorous theoretical analysis, establishing that \\texttt{FedMPDD} converges at a rate of $\\mathcal{O}(1/\\sqrt{K})$, matching the performance of FedSGD. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our method provides some inherent privacy against gradient inversion attacks due to the geometric properties of low-rank projections, offering a tunable privacy-utility trade-off controlled by the number of projections.

They can create adversarial perturbations, which are imperceptible to humans' eyes but have the ability to cause misclassification during inference. Moreover, they can poison the training data to harm the model's performance or they can query the model to steal its sensitive information. In this paper, we propose a defense system, which devises an adversarial training module within mixture-of-experts architecture to enhance its robustness against adversarial threats.

During end-to-end training, the parameters of expert models and gating mechanism are jointly updated allowing further optimization of the experts.

    "abstract": "           The increasing use of machine learning in safety-critical domains amplifies the risk of adversarial threats, especially data poisoning attacks that corrupt training data to degrade performance or induce unsafe behavior. Most existing defenses lack formal guarantees or rely on restrictive assumptions about the model class, attack type, extent of poisoning, or point-wise certification, limiting their practical reliability. This paper introduces a principled formal robustness certification framework that models gradient-based training as a discrete-time dynamical system (dt-DS) and formulates poisoning robustness as a formal safety verification problem. By adapting the concept of barrier certificates (BCs) from control theory, we introduce sufficient conditions to certify a robust radius ensuring that the terminal model remains safe under worst-case ${\\ell}_p$-norm based poisoning. To make this practical, we parameterize BCs as neural networks trained on finite sets of poisoned trajectories. We further derive probably approximately correct (PAC) bounds by solving a scenario convex program (SCP), which yields a confidence lower bound on the certified robustness radius generalizing beyond the training set. Importantly, our framework also extends to certification against test-time attacks, making it the first unified framework to provide formal guarantees in both training and test-time attack settings. Experiments on MNIST, SVHN, and CIFAR-10 show that our approach certifies non-trivial perturbation budgets while being model-agnostic and requiring no prior knowledge of the attack or contamination level.

However, progress in this direction is hindered by the lack of large-scale, high-quality Android-specific FCG datasets. Existing datasets are often outdated, dominated by small or redundant graphs resulting from app repackaging, and fail to reflect the diversity of real-world malware. These limitations lead to overfitting and unreliable evaluation of graph-based classification methods. To address this gap, we introduce Better Call Graphs (BCG), a comprehensive dataset of large and unique FCGs extracted from recent Android application packages (APKs).

    "abstract": "           Evaluating startups is inherently challenging in entrepreneurial finance, where investors confront severe information asymmetry and limited quantitative data. Leveraging a novel expert network call data, we develop an LLM-Bayesian model that analyzes these conversations at the question-answer turn level, extracting semantic and evaluative signals via large language models (LLMs) and aggregating them in a sequential Bayesian architecture. The model dynamically updates beliefs as additional expert calls occur and attenuates contradictory assessments, which are absent from existing text-based screening tools. Empirically, our model outperforms state-of-the-art benchmarks by 6.691% in F1-score and increases portfolio-level Return on Investment by 15.255%. Attention and ablation analyses reveal that conversational cues are particularly informative for technologically complex startups, young firms, diverse founding teams, and firms with low public visibility. By converting expert dialogue into continually updated probabilities, our model advances research in entrepreneurial finance and information systems and offers policy implications for improving funding outcomes for informationally disadvantaged startups.

In this paper, considering the time-varying task criticality characteristics of diverse WBAN users and the dual mobility between WBAN users and UAV, we investigate the dynamic task offloading and UAV flight trajectory optimization problem to minimize the weighted average task completion time of all the WBAN users, under the constraint of UAV energy consumption. To tackle the problem, an embodied AI-enhanced IoMT edge computing framework is established. Specifically, we propose a novel hierarchical multi-scale Transformer-based user trajectory prediction model based on the users' historical trajectory traces captured by the embodied AI agent (i.e., UAV). Afterwards, a prediction-enhanced deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm that integrates predicted users' mobility information is designed for intelligently optimizing UAV flight trajectory and task offloading decisions. Real-word movement traces and simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed methods in comparison with the existing benchmarks.         ",

    "abstract": "           This study introduces GCO-HPIF, a general machine-learning-based framework to predict and explain the computational hardness of combinatorial optimization problems that can be represented on graphs. The framework consists of two stages. In the first stage, a dataset is created comprising problem-agnostic graph features and hardness classifications of problem instances. Machine-learning-based classification algorithms are trained to map graph features to hardness categories. In the second stage, the framework explains the predictions using an association rule mining algorithm. Additionally, machine-learning-based regression models are trained to predict algorithmic computation times. The GCO-HPIF framework was applied to a dataset of 3287 maximum clique problem instances compiled from the COLLAB, IMDB, and TWITTER graph datasets using five state-of-the-art algorithms, namely three exact branch-and-bound-based algorithms (Gurobi, CliSAT, and MOMC) and two graph-neural-network-based algorithms (EGN and HGS). The framework demonstrated excellent performance in predicting instance hardness, achieving a weighted F1 score of 0.9921, a minority-class F1 score of 0.878, and an ROC-AUC score of 0.9083 using only three graph features. The best association rule found by the FP-Growth algorithm for explaining the hardness predictions had a support of 0.8829 for hard instances and an overall accuracy of 87.64 percent, underscoring the framework's usefulness for both prediction and explanation. Furthermore, the best-performing regression model for predicting computation times achieved a percentage RMSE of 5.12 and an R2 value of 0.991.         ",

Unlike task-specific techniques that primarily focus on consolidating inter-modal information, general image fusion needs to address a wide range of tasks while improving performance without increasing complexity. To achieve this, we propose SMC-Mamba, a Self-supervised Multiplex Consensus Mamba framework for general image fusion. Specifically, the Modality-Agnostic Feature Enhancement (MAFE) module preserves fine details through adaptive gating and enhances global representations via spatial-channel and frequency-rotational scanning. The Multiplex Consensus Cross-modal Mamba (MCCM) module enables dynamic collaboration among experts, reaching a consensus to efficiently integrate complementary information from multiple modalities. The cross-modal scanning within MCCM further strengthens feature interactions across modalities, facilitating seamless integration of critical information from both sources. Additionally, we introduce a Bi-level Self-supervised Contrastive Learning Loss (BSCL), which preserves high-frequency information without increasing computational overhead while simultaneously boosting performance in downstream tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) image fusion algorithms in tasks such as infrared-visible, medical, multi-focus, and multi-exposure fusion, as well as downstream visual tasks.

    "abstract": "           Recent advancements in computer vision have successfully extended Open-vocabulary segmentation (OVS) to the 3D domain by leveraging 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS). Despite this progress, efficiently rendering the high-dimensional features required for open-vocabulary queries poses a significant challenge. Existing methods employ codebooks or feature compression, causing information loss, thereby degrading segmentation quality. To address this limitation, we introduce Quantile Rendering (Q-Render), a novel rendering strategy for 3D Gaussians that efficiently handles high-dimensional features while maintaining high fidelity. Unlike conventional volume rendering, which densely samples all 3D Gaussians intersecting each ray, Q-Render sparsely samples only those with dominant influence along the ray. By integrating Q-Render into a generalizable 3D neural network, we also propose Gaussian Splatting Network (GS-Net), which predicts Gaussian features in a generalizable manner. Extensive experiments on ScanNet and LeRF demonstrate that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods, while enabling real-time rendering with an approximate ~43.7x speedup on 512-D feature maps.

    "abstract": "           The rapid progress of generative models has intensified the need for reliable and robust detection under real-world conditions. However, existing detectors often overfit to generator-specific artifacts and remain highly sensitive to real-world degradations. As generative architectures evolve and images undergo multi-round cross-platform sharing and post-processing (chain degradations), these artifact cues become obsolete and harder to detect. To address this, we propose Real-centric Envelope Modeling (REM), a new paradigm that shifts detection from learning generator artifacts to modeling the robust distribution of real images. REM introduces feature-level perturbations in self-reconstruction to generate near-real samples, and employs an envelope estimator with cross-domain consistency to learn a boundary enclosing the real image manifold. We further build RealChain, a comprehensive benchmark covering both open-source and commercial generators with simulated real-world degradation. Across eight benchmark evaluations, REM achieves an average improvement of 7.5% over state-of-the-art methods, and notably maintains exceptional generalization on the severely degraded RealChain benchmark, establishing a solid foundation for synthetic image detection under real-world conditions. The code and the RealChain benchmark will be made publicly available upon acceptance of the paper.         ",

However, powerful AI models typically have large model sizes, resulting in excessive end-to-end (E2E) downloading-and-inference (DAI) latency. To address this issue, we propose a simultaneous model downloading and inference (SLIDE) framework, which allows users to perform inference with downloaded layers while simultaneously receiving the remaining layers of the model. To this end, we formulate a task throughput maximization problem by jointly optimizing model provisioning, spectrum bandwidth allocation, and computing resource allocation for multi-user downlink systems. Unlike traditional DAI frameworks, SLIDE introduces recursive dependencies across layers, where inference latency depends recursively on the downloading bandwidth and computing resource allocation for each of the preceding layers. To solve this challenging problem, we design an efficient algorithm that acquires the optimal solution with polynomial-time complexity. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed SLIDE framework significantly improves task throughput under latency and communication resource constraints compared with the conventional model downloading schemes.

In this paper, we present a comprehensive analysis of the challenges involved in implementing 3D parallelism in such environments, addressing critical issues such as the need for symmetric tensor parallelism, efficient gradient synchronization in asymmetric pipeline parallelism, and the trade-offs between memory utilization and computational efficiency. Building upon these insights, we introduce AutoHet, a novel system that automatically identifies the optimal parallelism plan for distributed training on heterogeneous GPUs. AutoHet supports asymmetric 3D parallelism structures and facilitates fine-grained workload distribution. We propose a theoretical model that frames the device grouping and load balancing as an optimization problem to minimize per-iteration training time, thus effectively balancing computing power and memory usage across GPUs with diverse capabilities. To enable elastic training upon spot instance preemption, AutoHet presents an efficient recovery strategy that prioritizes to retrieve training states from local nodes, and only downloads the missing checkpoints from the cloud storage. Our extensive evaluation, conducted on three large-scale models and utilizing combinations of three different GPU types, demonstrates that AutoHet outperforms existing DNN training systems, achieving up to a 1.79$\\times$ speedup in training throughput compared with Megatron-LM and Whale, and a 4.38$\\times$ speedup of recovery speed compared to a spot instance baseline.

Furthermore, we validate these theoretical findings on real-world unconditional and text-to-image diffusion models, demonstrating that the same representation structures emerge in deep generative models with significant practical implications. Building on these insights, we propose a representation-based method for detecting memorization and a training-free editing technique that allows precise control via representation steering.

To address this, this paper proposes TSA-LLM, a large language model (LLM)-based universal framework that models multi-variate transient dynamics prediction as a univariate generative task with three key innovations: First, a novel data processing pipeline featuring channel independence decomposition to resolve dimensional heterogeneity, sample-wise normalization to eliminate separate stable or unstable pipelines, and temporal patching for efficient long-sequence modeling; Second, a parameter-efficient freeze-and-finetune strategy that augments the LLM's architecture with dedicated input embedding and output projection layers while freezing core transformer blocks to preserve generic feature extraction capabilities; Third, a two-stage fine-tuning scheme that combines teacher forcing, which feeds the model ground-truth data during initial training, with scheduled sampling, which gradually shifts to leveraging model-generated predictions, to mitigate cumulative errors in long-horizon iterative prediction. Comprehensive testing demonstrates the framework's universality, as TSA-LLM trained solely on the New England 39-bus system achieves zero-shot generalization to mixed stability conditions and unseen faults, and matches expert performance on the larger Iceland 189-bus system with only 5% fine-tuning data. This multi-scenario versatility validates a universal framework that eliminates scenario-specific retraining and achieves scalability via large-scale parameters and cross-scenario training data.

By coupling the VDB structure with a submap-based organization, the framework reduces computational load and enables efficient incremental mapping on a large scale. To mitigate discontinuities across submaps, we introduce a distillation-based overlap alignment strategy, in which preceding submaps supervise subsequent ones to ensure consistency in overlapping regions.

    "abstract": "           The Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) requires networks that deliver ultra-low latency, high reliability, and cost efficiency, which traditional optimization methods and deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based approaches struggle to provide under dynamic and heterogeneous workloads. To address this gap, large language model (LLM)-empowered agentic AI has emerged as a promising paradigm, integrating reasoning, planning, and adaptation to enable QoE-aware network management. In this paper, we explore the integration of agentic AI into QoE-aware network slicing for IIoT. We first review the network slicing management architecture, QoE metrics for IIoT applications, and the challenges of dynamically managing heterogeneous network slices, while highlighting the motivations and advantages of adopting agentic AI. We then present the workflow of agentic AI-based slicing management, illustrating the full lifecycle of AI agents from processing slice requests to constructing slice instances and performing dynamic adjustments. Furthermore, we propose an LLM-empowered agentic AI approach for slicing management, which integrates a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) module for semantic intent inference, a DRL-based orchestrator for slicing configuration, and an incremental memory mechanism for continual learning and adaptation. Through a case study on heterogeneous slice management, we demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly outperforms other baselines in balancing latency, reliability, and cost, and achieves up to a 19% improvement in slice availability ratio.

    "abstract": "           Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures have advanced the scaling of Large Language Models (LLMs) by activating only a sparse subset of parameters per input, enabling state-of-the-art performance with reduced computational cost. As these models are increasingly deployed in critical domains, understanding and strengthening their alignment mechanisms is essential to prevent harmful outputs. However, existing LLM safety research has focused almost exclusively on dense architectures, leaving the unique safety properties of MoEs largely unexamined. The modular, sparsely-activated design of MoEs suggests that safety mechanisms may operate differently than in dense models, raising questions about their robustness. In this paper, we present GateBreaker, the first training-free, lightweight, and architecture-agnostic attack framework that compromises the safety alignment of modern MoE LLMs at inference time. GateBreaker operates in three stages: (i) gate-level profiling, which identifies safety experts disproportionately routed on harmful inputs, (ii) expert-level localization, which localizes the safety structure within safety experts, and (iii) targeted safety removal, which disables the identified safety structure to compromise the safety alignment. Our study shows that MoE safety concentrates within a small subset of neurons coordinated by sparse routing. Selective disabling of these neurons, approximately 3% of neurons in the targeted expert layers, significantly increases the averaged attack success rate (ASR) from 7.4% to 64.9% against the eight latest aligned MoE LLMs with limited utility degradation. These safety neurons transfer across models within the same family, raising ASR from 17.9% to 67.7% with one-shot transfer attack. Furthermore, GateBreaker generalizes to five MoE vision language models (VLMs) with 60.9% ASR on unsafe image inputs.         ",

Analyzing hypergraph properties such as triad counts is essential, as hypergraphs can reveal intricate group interaction patterns that conventional graphs fail to capture. In real-world scenarios, these networks are often large and dynamic, introducing significant computational challenges. Due to the absence of specialized software packages and data structures, the analysis of large dynamic hypergraphs remains largely unexplored. Motivated by this gap, we propose ESCHER, a GPU-centric parallel data structure for Efficient and Scalable Hypergraph Evolution Representation, designed to manage large scale hypergraph dynamics efficiently. We also design a hypergraph triad-count update framework that minimizes redundant computation while fully leveraging the capabilities of ESCHER for dynamic operations. We validate the efficacy of our approach across multiple categories of hypergraph triad counting, including hyperedge-based, incident-vertex-based, and temporal triads. Empirical results on both large real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, achieving speedups of up to 104.5x, 473.7x, and 112.5x for hyperedge-based, incident-vertex-based, and temporal triad types, respectively.

We propose Granular-ball Guided Masking (GBGM), a structure-aware augmentation strategy guided by Granular-ball Computing (GBC). GBGM adaptively preserves semantically rich, structurally important regions while suppressing redundant areas through a coarse-to-fine hierarchical masking process, producing augmentations that are both representative and discriminative. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements in classification accuracy and masked image reconstruction, confirming the effectiveness and broad applicability of the proposed method.

This capability raises significant privacy concerns regarding malicious misuse of personal portraits. However, no efficient defense framework exists to protect such videos against 3D-field TFG methods. While image-based defenses could apply per-frame 2D perturbations, they incur prohibitive computational costs, severe video quality degradation, failing to disrupt 3D information for video protection. To address this, we propose a novel and efficient video defense framework against 3D-field TFG methods, which protects portrait video by perturbing the 3D information acquisition process while maintain high-fidelity video quality. Specifically, our method introduces: (1) a similarity-guided parameter sharing mechanism for computational efficiency, and (2) a multi-scale dual-domain attention module to jointly optimize spatial-frequency perturbations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed framework exhibits strong defense capability and achieves a 47x acceleration over the fastest baseline while maintaining high fidelity. Moreover, it remains robust against scaling operations and state-of-the-art purification attacks, and the effectiveness of our design choices is further validated through ablation studies.

To address this, we introduce Next-Scale Prediction (NSP), a novel self-supervised paradigm that decouples noise decorrelation from detail preservation. NSP constructs cross-scale training pairs, where BSN takes low-resolution, fully decorrelated sub-images as input to predict high-resolution targets that retain fine details. As a by-product, NSP naturally supports super-resolution of noisy images without retraining or modification. Extensive experiments demonstrate that NSP achieves state-of-the-art self-supervised denoising performance on real-world benchmarks, significantly alleviating the long-standing conflict between noise decorrelation and detail preservation.

We present zkFL-Health, an architecture that combines FL with zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) and Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) to deliver privacy-preserving, verifiably correct collaborative training for medical AI.

Verifier nodes validate the proof and record cryptographic commitments on-chain, providing an immutable audit trail and removing the need to trust any single party. We outline system and threat models tailored to healthcare, the zkFL-Health protocol, security/privacy guarantees, and a performance evaluation plan spanning accuracy, privacy risk, latency, and cost.

    "abstract": "           The empirical success of deep learning is often attributed to scaling laws that predict consistent gains as model, data, and compute grow; however, large models can exhibit training instability and diminishing returns, suggesting that scaling laws describe what success looks like but not when and why scaling succeeds or fails. A central obstacle is the lack of a rigorous understanding of feature learning at large depth. While muP characterizes feature-learning dynamics in the infinite-width limit and enables hyperparameter transfer across width, its depth extension (depth-muP) breaks down for residual blocks with more than one internal layer. We derive Neural Feature Dynamics (NFD) for ResNets with single-layer residual blocks, characterizing feature learning via a coupled forward-backward stochastic system in the joint infinite-width and infinite-depth limit. In this regime, NFD identifies when scaling-law trends persist and explains diminishing returns. It also reveals a vanishing mechanism induced by the 1/sqrt(depth) residual scaling under which the gradient-independence assumption (GIA), known to fail during training at finite depth, becomes provably valid again at infinite depth, yielding an analytically tractable regime for end-to-end feature learning. Motivated by this insight, we study two-layer residual blocks and show that the same mechanism causes feature-learning collapse in the first internal layer at large depth, providing a structural explanation for the empirical failure of depth-muP. Based on this diagnosis, we propose a depth-aware learning-rate correction that counteracts the collapse and empirically restores depth-wise hyperparameter transfer, yielding stronger performance in deeper ResNets.

The method builds a shared encoding structure to represent diverse monitoring indicators in a unified manner and employs a state fusion mechanism to capture trend changes and local disturbances across different time scales. A cross-task structural propagation module is introduced to model potential dependencies among nodes, enabling the model to understand complex structural patterns formed by resource contention, link interactions, and changes in service topology. To enhance adaptability to non-stationary behaviors, the framework incorporates a dynamic adjustment mechanism that automatically regulates internal feature flows according to system state changes, ensuring stable predictions in the presence of sudden load shifts, topology drift, and resource jitter. The experimental evaluation compares multiple models across various metrics and verifies the effectiveness of the framework through analyses of hyperparameter sensitivity, environmental sensitivity, and data sensitivity. The results show that the proposed method achieves superior performance on several error metrics and provides more accurate representations of future states under different operating conditions. Overall, the unified forecasting framework offers reliable predictive capability for high-dimensional, multi-task, and strongly dynamic environments in cloud native systems and provides essential technical support for intelligent backend management.

However, most existing methods address this challenge from the model side by incrementally injecting new inductive biases, which remains fundamentally limited given the open-ended diversity of real-world graphs. In this work, we take a data-centric perspective and treat node semantics as a task-adaptive variable. We propose a Data-Adaptive Semantic Refinement framework DAS for graph representation learning, which couples a fixed graph neural network (GNN) and a large language model (LLM) in a closed feedback loop.

One common way it is applied in practice is through Model Predictive Control (MPC), which uses repeated rollouts of the simulator to optimize future actions and generate responsive control policies in real time. To make this process more accessible, the open source library MuJoCo MPC (MJPC) provides ready-to-use MPC algorithms and implementations built directly on top of the MuJoCo simulator. However, MJPC relies on finite differencing (FD) to compute derivatives through the underlying MuJoCo simulator, which is often a key bottleneck that can make it prohibitively costly for time-sensitive tasks, especially in high-DOF systems or complex scenes. In this paper, we introduce the use of Web of Affine Spaces (WASP) derivatives within MJPC as a drop-in replacement for FD. WASP is a recently developed approach for efficiently computing sequences of accurate derivative approximations. By reusing information from prior, related derivative calculations, WASP accelerates and stabilizes the computation of new derivatives, making it especially well suited for MPC's iterative, fine-grained updates over time. We evaluate WASP across a diverse suite of MJPC tasks spanning multiple robot embodiments. Our results suggest that WASP derivatives are particularly effective in MJPC: it integrates seamlessly across tasks, delivers consistently robust performance, and achieves up to a 2$\\mathsf{x}$ speedup compared to an FD backend when used with derivative-based planners, such as iLQG. In addition, WASP-based MPC outperforms MJPC's stochastic sampling-based planners on our evaluation tasks, offering both greater efficiency and reliability. To support adoption and future research, we release an open-source implementation of MJPC with WASP derivatives fully integrated.         ",

    "abstract": "           We propose using confusion hypergraphs (hyperconfusions) as a model of information. In contrast to the conventional approach using random variables, we can now perform conjunction, disjunction and implication of information, forming a Heyting algebra. Using the connection between Heyting algebra and intuitionistic logic, we can express the requirements of a communication network (e.g., network coding, index coding, Slepian-Wolf coding) as a logical formula, allowing us to use the hypergraph Heyting algebra to directly compute the optimal coding scheme. The optimal communication cost is simply given by the entropy of the hypergraph (within a logarithmic gap). This gives a surprising correspondence between coding settings and logical formulae, similar to the Curry-Howard correspondence between proofs and computer programs.         ",

They are both APX-hard in general graphs. However, this hardness does not carry over to the planar setting, which is not well understood, except for very small values of k. One main obstacle in using standard decomposition techniques for planar graphs, like Baker's technique and extensions thereof, is that connectivity requirements are global (rather than local) properties that are not captured by existing frameworks. We present a novel, and arguably clean, decomposition technique for such classical connectivity problems on planar graphs. This technique immediately implies PTASs for the problems of finding a smallest k-edge-connected or k-vertex-connected spanning subgraph of a planar graph for arbitrary k. By leveraging structural results for minimally k-edge-connected graphs, we further obtain a PTAS for planar k-connectivity augmentation for any constant k. We complement this with an NP-hardness result, showing that our results are essentially optimal.         ",

Notably, prior work has demonstrated that security is often overlooked, exposing that LLMs are prone to generating code with security vulnerabilities. These insights were enabled by specialized benchmarks, crafted through significant manual effort by security experts. However, relying on manually-crafted benchmarks is insufficient in the long term, because benchmarks (i) naturally end up contaminating training data, (ii) must extend to new tasks to provide a more complete picture, and (iii) must increase in difficulty to challenge more capable LLMs. In this work, we address these challenges and present AutoBaxBuilder, a framework that generates tasks and tests for code security benchmarking from scratch. We introduce a robust pipeline with fine-grained plausibility checks, leveraging the code understanding capabilities of LLMs to construct functionality tests and end-to-end security-probing exploits. To confirm the quality of the generated benchmark, we conduct both a qualitative analysis and perform quantitative experiments, comparing it against tasks constructed by human experts. We use AutoBaxBuilder to construct entirely new tasks and release them to the public as AutoBaxBench, together with a thorough evaluation of the security capabilities of LLMs on these tasks. We find that a new task can be generated in under 2 hours, costing less than USD 10.         ",

    "abstract": "           Multi-agent trajectory generation is a core problem for autonomous driving and intelligent transportation systems. However, efficiently modeling the dynamic interactions between numerous road users and infrastructures in complex scenes remains an open problem. Existing methods typically employ distance-based or fully connected dense graph structures to capture interaction information, which not only introduces a large number of redundant edges but also requires complex and heavily parameterized networks for encoding, thereby resulting in low training and inference efficiency, limiting scalability to large and complex traffic scenes. To overcome the limitations of existing methods, we propose SparScene, a sparse graph learning framework designed for efficient and scalable traffic scene representation. Instead of relying on distance thresholds, SparScene leverages the lane graph topology to construct structure-aware sparse connections between agents and lanes, enabling efficient yet informative scene graph representation. SparScene adopts a lightweight graph encoder that efficiently aggregates agent-map and agent-agent interactions, yielding compact scene representations with substantially improved efficiency and scalability. On the motion prediction benchmark of the Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD), SparScene achieves competitive performance with remarkable efficiency. It generates trajectories for more than 200 agents in a scene within 5 ms and scales to more than 5,000 agents and 17,000 lanes with merely 54 ms of inference time with a GPU memory of 2.9 GB, highlighting its superior scalability for large-scale traffic scenes.

    "abstract": "           Understanding how emotions diffuse through social networks is central to computational social science. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have been increasingly used to simulate social media interactions, raising the question of whether LLM-generated data can realistically reproduce emotion diffusion patterns observed in real online communities. In this study, we conduct a systematic comparison between emotion diffusion in real-world social graphs and in LLM-simulated interaction networks. We construct diffusion graphs from Reddit discussion data and compare them with synthetic social graphs generated through LLM-driven conversational simulations. Emotion states are inferred using established sentiment analysis pipelines, and both real and simulated graphs are analyzed from structural, behavioral, and predictive perspectives. Our results reveal substantial structural and dynamic discrepancies between real and simulated diffusion processes. Real-world emotion diffusion exhibits dense connectivity, repeated interactions, sentiment shifts, and emergent community structures, whereas LLM-simulated graphs largely consist of isolated linear chains with monotonic emotional trajectories. These structural limitations significantly affect downstream tasks such as graph-based emotion prediction, leading to reduced emotional diversity and class imbalance in simulated settings. Our findings highlight current limitations of LLM-based social simulation in capturing the interactive complexity and emotional heterogeneity of real social networks. This work provides empirical evidence for the cautious use of LLM-generated data in social science research and suggests directions for improving future simulation frameworks.         ",

    "abstract": "           The proliferation of Internet-of-things (IoT) infrastructures and the widespread adoption of traffic encryption present significant challenges, particularly in environments characterized by dynamic traffic patterns, constrained computational capabilities, and strict latency constraints. In this paper, we propose DMLITE, a diffusion model and large language model (LLM) integrated traffic embedding framework for network traffic detection within resource-limited IoT environments. The DMLITE overcomes these challenges through a tri-phase architecture including traffic visual preprocessing, diffusion-based multi-level feature extraction, and LLM-guided feature optimization. Specifically, the framework utilizes self-supervised diffusion models to capture both fine-grained and abstract patterns in encrypted traffic through multi-level feature fusion and contrastive learning with representative sample selection, thus enabling rapid adaptation to new traffic patterns with minimal labeled data. Furthermore, DMLITE incorporates LLMs to dynamically adjust particle swarm optimization parameters for intelligent feature selection by implementing a dual objective function that minimizes both classification error and variance across data distributions. Comprehensive experimental validation on benchmark datasets confirms the effectiveness of DMLITE, achieving classification accuracies of 98.87\\%, 92.61\\%, and 99.83\\% on USTC-TFC, ISCX-VPN, and Edge-IIoTset datasets, respectively. This improves classification accuracy by an average of 3.7\\% and reduces training time by an average of 41.9\\% compared to the representative deep learning model.         ",

This is mainly because existing GNNs tend to focus on learning local node representations, making it difficult to effectively capture structural relationships between node pairs. Furthermore, excessive reliance on local neighborhood information can lead to over-smoothing. Prior studies have shown that introducing global structural encoding can partially alleviate this issue. To address these limitations, we propose a Community-Enhanced Link Prediction (CELP) framework that incorporates community structure to jointly model local and global graph topology. Specifically, CELP enhances the graph via community-aware, confidence-guided edge completion and pruning, while integrating multi-scale structural features to achieve more accurate link prediction. Experimental results across multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that CELP achieves superior performance, validating the crucial role of community structure in improving link prediction accuracy.

To achieve this, we propose a novel parametric activation-induced hierarchical implicit representation framework, referred to as NAME, based on Implicit Neural Representations (INRs). Our method introduces a hierarchical temporal encoding mechanism that extracts features from motion sequences at multiple temporal scales, enabling effective capture of intricate temporal patterns. Additionally, we integrate a custom parametric activation function, powered by Fourier transformations, into the MLP-based decoder to enhance the expressiveness of the continuous representation. This parametric formulation significantly augments the model's ability to represent complex motion behaviors with high accuracy.

To address this gap, this paper introduces SpidR-Adapt for rapid adaptation to new languages using minimal unlabeled data. We cast such low-resource speech representation learning as a meta-learning problem and construct a multi-task adaptive pre-training (MAdaPT) protocol which formulates the adaptation process as a bi-level optimization framework. To enable scalable meta-training under this framework, we propose a novel heuristic solution, first-order bi-level optimization (FOBLO), avoiding heavy computation costs. Finally, we stabilize meta-training by using a robust initialization through interleaved supervision which alternates self-supervised and supervised objectives. Empirically, SpidR-Adapt achieves rapid gains in phonemic discriminability (ABX) and spoken language modeling (sWUGGY, sBLIMP, tSC), improving over in-domain language models after training on less than 1h of target-language audio, over $100\\times$ more data-efficient than standard training.

However, its application is often hindered by the difficulty of collecting large-scale real-world robotic tactile data. In this study, we propose to collect low-cost human manipulation data using haptic gloves for tactile-based robotic policy learning. The misalignment between human and robotic tactile data makes it challenging to transfer policies learned from human data to robots. To bridge this gap, we propose UniTacHand, a unified representation to align robotic tactile information captured by dexterous hands with human hand touch obtained from gloves. First, we project tactile signals from both human hands and robotic hands onto a morphologically consistent 2D surface space of the MANO hand model. This unification standardizes the heterogeneous data structures and inherently embeds the tactile signals with spatial context. Then, we introduce a contrastive learning method to align them into a unified latent space, trained on only 10 minutes of paired data from our data collection system. Our approach enables zero-shot tactile-based policy transfer from humans to a real robot, generalizing to objects unseen in the pre-training data. We also demonstrate that co-training on mixed data, including both human and robotic demonstrations via UniTacHand, yields better performance and data efficiency compared with using only robotic data. UniTacHand paves a path toward general, scalable, and data-efficient learning for tactile-based dexterous hands.         ",

We provide a theoretical analysis of its convergence behavior, showing that ARS-OPT enables more accurate directional updates and achieves faster, more stable optimization. To further accelerate convergence, we incorporate surrogate-model priors into ARS-OPT's gradient estimation, resulting in PARS-OPT with enhanced performance. The superiority of our approach is supported by theoretical guarantees under standard assumptions.

To successfully complete tasks, the LLM must be grounded in the environment in which the robot operates. One solution is to use a scene graph that contains all the necessary information. Modern methods rely on prebuilt scene graphs and assume that all task-relevant information is available at the start of planning. However, these approaches do not account for changes in the environment that may occur between the graph construction and the task execution. We propose LookPlanGraph - a method that leverages a scene graph composed of static assets and object priors. During plan execution, LookPlanGraph continuously updates the graph with relevant objects, either by verifying existing priors or discovering new entities. This is achieved by processing the agents egocentric camera view using a Vision Language Model. We conducted experiments with changed object positions VirtualHome and OmniGibson simulated environments, demonstrating that LookPlanGraph outperforms methods based on predefined static scene graphs.

Existing single-class or multi-class anomaly detection (AD) models typically rely on fixed modality configurations, require repetitive training, or fail to generalize to unseen modality combinations, limiting their clinical scalability. In this work, we present a unified Any-Modality AD framework that performs robust anomaly detection and localization under arbitrary MRI modality availability. The framework integrates a dual-pathway DINOv2 encoder with a feature distribution alignment mechanism that statistically aligns incomplete-modality features with full-modality representations, enabling stable inference even with severe modality dropout. To further enhance semantic consistency, we introduce an Intrinsic Normal Prototypes (INPs) extractor and an INP-guided decoder that reconstruct only normal anatomical patterns while naturally amplifying abnormal deviations. Through randomized modality masking and indirect feature completion during training, the model learns to adapt to all modality configurations without re-training.

We present a novel, mesh-free formulation that learns a local update operator conditioned on neural (local) shape attributes, enabling surface PDEs to be solved directly where the (neural) data lives. The operator integrates naturally with prevalent neural surface representations, is trained once on a single representative shape, and generalizes across shape and topology variations, enabling accurate, fast inference without explicit meshing or per-instance optimization while preserving differentiability. Across analytic benchmarks (heat equation and Poisson solve on sphere) and real neural assets across different representations, our method slightly outperforms CPM while remaining reasonably close to FEM, and, to our knowledge, delivers the first end-to-end pipeline that solves surface PDEs on both neural and classical surface representations. Code will be released on acceptance.         ",

    "abstract": "           Minimizing PDE-residual losses is a common strategy to promote physical consistency in neural operators. However, standard formulations often lack variational correctness, meaning that small residuals do not guarantee small solution errors due to the use of non-compliant norms or ad hoc penalty terms for boundary conditions. This work develops a variationally correct operator learning framework by constructing first-order system least-squares (FOSLS) objectives whose values are provably equivalent to the solution error in PDE-induced norms. We demonstrate this framework on stationary diffusion and linear elasticity, incorporating mixed Dirichlet-Neumann boundary conditions via variational lifts to preserve norm equivalence without inconsistent penalties. To ensure the function space conformity required by the FOSLS loss, we propose a Reduced Basis Neural Operator (RBNO). The RBNO predicts coefficients for a pre-computed, conforming reduced basis, thereby ensuring variational stability by design while enabling efficient training. We provide a rigorous convergence analysis that bounds the total error by the sum of finite element discretization bias, reduced basis truncation error, neural network approximation error, and statistical estimation errors arising from finite sampling and optimization. Numerical benchmarks validate these theoretical bounds and demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves superior accuracy in PDE-compliant norms compared to standard baselines, while the residual loss serves as a reliable, computable a posteriori error estimator.

We introduce TICON, a transformer-based tile representation contextualizer that produces rich, contextualized embeddings for ''any'' application in computational pathology. Standard tile encoder-based pipelines, which extract embeddings of tiles stripped from their context, fail to model the rich slide-level information essential for both local and global tasks. Furthermore, different tile-encoders excel at different downstream tasks. Therefore, a unified model is needed to contextualize embeddings derived from ''any'' tile-level foundation model. TICON addresses this need with a single, shared encoder, pretrained using a masked modeling objective to simultaneously unify and contextualize representations from diverse tile-level pathology foundation models. Our experiments demonstrate that TICON-contextualized embeddings significantly improve performance across many different tasks, establishing new state-of-the-art results on tile-level benchmarks (i.e., HEST-Bench, THUNDER, CATCH) and slide-level benchmarks (i.e., Patho-Bench).

    "abstract": "           Conventional mobile networks, including both localized cell-centric and cooperative cell-free networks (CCN/CFN), are built upon rigid network topologies. However, neither architecture is adequate to flexibly support distributed integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) services, due to the increasing difficulty of aligning spatiotemporally distributed heterogeneous service demands with available radio resources. In this paper, we propose an elastic network topology (ENT) for distributed ISAC service provisioning, where multiple co-existing localized CCNs can be dynamically aggregated into CFNs with expanded boundaries for federated network operation. This topology elastically orchestrates localized CCN and federated CFN boundaries to balance signaling overhead and distributed resource utilization, thereby enabling efficient ISAC service provisioning. A two-phase operation protocol is then developed. In Phase I, each CCN autonomously classifies ISAC services as either local or federated and partitions its resources into dedicated and shared segments. In Phase II, each CCN employs its dedicated resources for local ISAC services, while the aggregated CFN consolidates shared resources from its constituent CCNs to cooperatively deliver federated services. Furthermore, we design a utility-to-signaling ratio (USR) to quantify the tradeoff between sensing/communication utility and signaling overhead. Consequently, a USR maximization problem is formulated by jointly optimizing the network topology (i.e., service classification and CCN aggregation) and the allocation of dedicated and shared resources. However, this problem is challenging due to its distributed optimization nature and the absence of complete channel state information. To address this problem efficiently, we propose a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) framework with centralized training and decentralized execution.         ",

    "abstract": "           Solar active regions (ARs) do not appear randomly but cluster along longitudinally warped toroidal bands ('toroids') that encode information about magnetic structures in the tachocline, where global-scale organization likely originates. Global MagnetoHydroDynamic Shallow-Water Tachocline (MHD-SWT) models have shown potential to simulate such toroids, matching observations qualitatively. For week-scale early prediction of flare-producing AR emergence, forward-integration of these toroids is necessary. This requires model initialization with a dynamically self-consistent MHD state-vector that includes magnetic, flow fields, and shell-thickness variations. However, synoptic magnetograms provide only geometric shape of toroids, not the state-vector needed to initialize MHD-SWT models. To address this challenging task, we develop PINNBARDS, a novel Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN)-Based AR Distribution Simulator, that uses observational toroids and MHD-SWT equations to derive initial state-vector. Using Feb-14-2024 SDO/HMI synoptic map, we show that PINN converges to physically consistent, predominantly antisymmetric toroids, matching observed ones. Although surface data provides north and south toroids' central latitudes, and their latitudinal widths, they cannot determine tachocline field strengths, connected to AR emergence. We explore here solutions across a broad parameter range, finding hydrodynamically-dominated structures for weak fields (~2 kG) and overly rigid behavior for strong fields (~100 kG). We obtain best agreement with observations for 20-30 kG toroidal fields, and ~10 degree bandwidth, consistent with low-order longitudinal mode excitation. To our knowledge, PINNBARDS serves as the first method for reconstructing state-vectors for hidden tachocline magnetic structures from surface patterns; potentially leading to weeks ahead prediction of flare-producing AR-emergence.

We propose a new weighted Pearson-Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) for binary classification as well as weighted versions of related multiclass measures. The weighted MCC varies between $-1$ and $1$. But crucially, the weighted MCC values are higher for classifiers that perform better on highly weighted observations, and hence is able to distinguish them from classifiers that have a similar overall performance and ones that perform better on the lowly weighted observations. Furthermore, we prove that the weighted measures are robust with respect to the choice of weights in a precise manner: if the weights are changed by at most $\\epsilon$, the value of the weighted measure changes at most by a factor of $\\epsilon$ in the binary case and by a factor of $\\epsilon^2$ in the multiclass case. Our computations demonstrate that the weighted measures clearly identify classifiers that perform better on higher weighted observations, while the unweighted measures remain completely indifferent to the choices of weights.

We further introduce H2, a path-centric dual representation derived from the same underlying allele-haplotype incidence information that restores explicit haplotype ordering while remaining exactly equivalent in information content. Using real human genome data, we show that this representation yields substantial compression gains, particularly for structural variants, while remaining equivalent in information content to pangenome graphs.

For example, it is known to hold for a broad range of variational problems with random input. Much less is known about the algorithmic universality of specific methods for solving such variational problems. Namely, whether algorithms tuned to specific variational tasks produce the same asymptotic behavior across different input distributions with matching moments. In this paper, we establish algorithmic universality for a class of models, which includes spin glass models and constraint satisfaction problems on sparse graphs, provided that an algorithm can be coded as a low-degree polynomial (LDP). We illustrate this specifically for the case of the Max-Cut problem in sparse Erd\u00f6s-R\u00e9nyi graph $\\mathbb{G}(n,d/n)$. We use the fact that the Approximate Message Passing (AMP) algorithm, which is an effective algorithm for finding near-ground states of the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick (SK) model, is well approximated by an LDP. We then establish our main universality result: the performance of the LDP based algorithms exhibiting a certain connectivity property, is the same in the mean-field (SK) and in the random graph $\\mathbb{G}(n,d/n)$ setting, up to an appropriate rescaling. The main technical challenge we address in this paper is showing that the output of an LDP algorithm on $\\mathbb{G}(n,d/n)$ is truly discrete, namely, that it is close to the set of points in the binary cube. This is achieved by establishing universality of coordinate-wise statistics of the LDP output across disorder ensembles, which implies that proximity to the cube transfers from the Gaussian to the sparse graph setting.

    "abstract": "           Conformal prediction quantifies the uncertainty of machine learning models by augmenting point predictions with valid prediction sets. For complex scenarios involving multiple trials, models, or data sources, conformal prediction sets can be aggregated to create a prediction set that captures the overall uncertainty, often improving precision. However, aggregating multiple prediction sets with individual $1-\\alpha$ coverage inevitably weakens the overall guarantee, typically resulting in $1-2\\alpha$ worst-case coverage. In this work, we propose a framework for the weighted aggregation of prediction sets, where weights are assigned to each prediction set based on their contribution. Our framework offers flexible control over how the sets are aggregated, achieving tighter coverage bounds that interpolate between the $1-2\\alpha$ guarantee of the combined models and the $1-\\alpha$ guarantee of an individual model depending on the distribution of weights. Importantly, our framework generalizes to data-dependent weights, as we derive a procedure for weighted aggregation that maintains finite-sample validity even when the weights depend on the data. This extension makes our framework broadly applicable to settings where weights are learned, such as mixture-of-experts (MoE), and we demonstrate through experiments in the MoE setting that our methods achieve adaptive coverage.

Existing environmental models encode extensive knowledge of individual systems, yet much of this information remains isolated within domain-specific formulations and data structures. This paper introduces a unified modeling framework that formalizes information from existing process models by asserting real-world physical relationships onto their underlying mathematical representations. By integrating Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) with Hetero-functional Graph Theory (HFGT), the framework establishes a consistent ontology that explicitly defines system structure and behavior. Illustrative hydrological examples demonstrate implementation of the methodology, showing how relationships embedded in conventional process models can be made explicit and scalable. While simplified, these examples provide a first step toward applying the approach to complex environmental systems. More broadly, the methodology offers a foundation for future modeling of systems of systems within a shared computational architecture.         ",

    "abstract": "           What features neural networks learn, and how, remains an open question. In this paper, we introduce Alternating Gradient Flows (AGF), an algorithmic framework that describes the dynamics of feature learning in two-layer networks trained from small initialization. Prior works have shown that gradient flow in this regime exhibits a staircase-like loss curve, alternating between plateaus where neurons slowly align to useful directions and sharp drops where neurons rapidly grow in norm. AGF approximates this behavior as an alternating two-step process: maximizing a utility function over dormant neurons and minimizing a cost function over active ones. AGF begins with all neurons dormant. At each iteration, a dormant neuron activates, triggering the acquisition of a feature and a drop in the loss. AGF quantifies the order, timing, and magnitude of these drops, matching experiments across several commonly studied architectures. We show that AGF unifies and extends existing saddle-to-saddle analyses in fully connected linear networks and attention-only linear transformers, where the learned features are singular modes and principal components, respectively. In diagonal linear networks, we prove AGF converges to gradient flow in the limit of vanishing initialization. Applying AGF to quadratic networks trained to perform modular addition, we give the first complete characterization of the training dynamics, revealing that networks learn Fourier features in decreasing order of coefficient magnitude. Altogether, AGF offers a promising step towards understanding feature learning in neural networks.         ",

    "abstract": "           Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are increasingly deployed in real-world applications, making ownership verification critical to protect their intellectual property against model theft. Fingerprinting and black-box watermarking are two main methods. However, the former relies on determining model similarity, which is computationally expensive and prone to ownership collisions after model post-processing. The latter embeds backdoors, exposing watermarked models to the risk of backdoor attacks. Moreover, both previous methods enable ownership verification but do not convey additional information about the copy model. If the owner has multiple models, each model requires a distinct trigger graph. To address these challenges, this paper proposes WGLE, a novel black-box watermarking paradigm for GNNs that enables embedding the multi-bit string in GNN models without using backdoors. WGLE builds on a key insight we term Layer-wise Distance Difference on an Edge (LDDE), which quantifies the difference between the feature distance and the prediction distance of two connected nodes in a graph. By assigning unique LDDE values to the edges and employing the LDDE sequence as the watermark, WGLE supports multi-bit capacity without relying on backdoor mechanisms. We evaluate WGLE on six public datasets across six mainstream GNN architectures, and compare WGLE with state-of-the-art GNN watermarking and fingerprinting methods. WGLE achieves 100% ownership verification accuracy, with an average fidelity degradation of only 1.41%. Additionally, WGLE exhibits robust resilience against potential attacks.

However, complex AI model architectures pose high computational complexity to obtain the optimal model splitting.

To solve the problem, we propose a fast DAG-based model splitting algorithm, which restructures the DAG to enable the optimal model splitting identification via a maximum flow method. Theoretical analysis indicates that the proposed algorithm is optimal. Furthermore, considering AI models with block structures, we propose a block-wise model splitting algorithm to reduce computational complexity. The algorithm abstracts each block, i.e., a component consisting of multiple layers, into a single vertex, thereby obtaining the optimal model splitting via a simplified DAG. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithms can determine the optimal model splitting within milliseconds, as well as reduce training delay by 24.62%-38.95% in dynamic edge networks as compared to the state-of-the-art benchmarks.

    "abstract": "           In real-world clinical practice, electrocardiograms (ECGs) are often captured and shared as photographs. However, publicly available ECG data, and thus most related research, relies on digital signals. This has led to a disconnect in which computer assisted interpretation of ECG cannot easily be applied to ECG images. The emergence of high-fidelity synthetic data generators has introduced practical alternatives by producing realistic, photo-like, ECG images derived from the digital signal that could help narrow this divide. To address this, we propose a novel knowledge augmentation framework that uses synthetic data generated from multiple sources to provide generalisable and accurate interpretation of ECG photographs. Our framework features two key contributions. First, we introduce a robust pre-processing pipeline designed to remove background artifacts and reduces visual differences between images. Second, we implement a two-stage training strategy: a Morphology Learning Stage, where the model captures broad morphological features from visually different, scan-like synthetic data, followed by a Task-Specific Adaptation Stage, where the model is fine-tuned on the photo-like target data. We tested the model on the British Heart Foundation Challenge dataset, to classify five common ECG findings: myocardial infarction (MI), atrial fibrillation, hypertrophy, conduction disturbance, and ST/T changes. Our approach, built upon the ConvNeXt backbone, outperforms a single-source training baseline and achieved \\textbf{1st} place in the challenge with an macro-AUROC of \\textbf{0.9677}. These results suggest that incorporating morphology learning from heterogeneous sources offers a more robust and generalizable paradigm than conventional single-source training.         ",

    "abstract": "           Adept manipulation of articulated objects is essential for robots to operate successfully in human environments. Such manipulation requires both effectiveness--reliable operation despite uncertain object structures--and efficiency--swift execution with minimal redundant steps and smooth actions. Existing approaches struggle to achieve both objectives simultaneously: methods relying on predefined kinematic models lack effectiveness when encountering structural variations, while tactile-informed approaches achieve robust manipulation without kinematic priors but compromise efficiency through reactive, step-by-step exploration-compensation cycles. This paper introduces TacMan-Turbo, a novel proactive tactile control framework for articulated object manipulation that mitigates this fundamental trade-off. Unlike previous approaches that treat tactile contact deviations merely as error signals requiring compensation, our method interprets these deviations as rich sources of local kinematic information. This new perspective enables our controller to predict optimal future interactions and make proactive adjustments, significantly enhancing manipulation efficiency. In comprehensive evaluations across 200 diverse simulated articulated objects and real-world experiments, our approach maintains a 100% success rate while significantly outperforming the previous tactile-informed method in time efficiency, action efficiency, and trajectory smoothness (all p-values < 0.0001). These results demonstrate that the long-standing trade-off between effectiveness and efficiency in articulated object manipulation can be successfully resolved without relying on prior kinematic knowledge.

    "abstract": "           Existing Causal-Why Video Question Answering (VideoQA) models often struggle with higher-order reasoning, relying on opaque, monolithic pipelines that entangle video understanding, causal inference, and answer generation. These black-box approaches offer limited interpretability and tend to depend on shallow heuristics. We propose a novel, modular paradigm that explicitly decouples causal reasoning from answer generation, introducing natural language causal chains as interpretable intermediate representations. Inspired by human cognitive models, these structured cause-effect sequences bridge low-level video content with high-level causal reasoning, enabling transparent and logically coherent inference. Our two-stage architecture comprises a Causal Chain Extractor (CCE) that generates causal chains from video-question pairs, and a Causal Chain-Driven Answerer (CCDA) that derives answers grounded in these chains. To address the lack of annotated reasoning traces, we introduce a scalable method for generating accurate causal chains from existing datasets. We construct human verified causal chains for 46K samples. We also propose CauCo, a new evaluation metric for causality-oriented captioning. Experiments on three large-scale benchmarks demonstrate that our approach not only outperforms state-of-the-art models, but also yields substantial gains in explainability, user trust, and generalization -- positioning the CCE as a reusable causal reasoning engine across diverse domains.

However, they often fail to utilize visual evidence adequately, either depending on linguistic priors in vision-centric tasks or resorting to textual shortcuts during reasoning. Although reinforcement learning (RL) can align models with desired behaviors, its application to VLMs has been hindered by the lack of scalable and reliable reward mechanisms. To overcome this challenge, we propose SSL4RL, a novel framework that leverages self-supervised learning (SSL) tasks as a source of verifiable rewards for RL-based fine-tuning. Our approach reformulates SSL objectives-such as predicting image rotation or reconstructing masked patches-into dense, automatic reward signals, eliminating the need for human preference data or unreliable AI evaluators. Experiments show that SSL4RL substantially improves performance on both vision-centric and vision-language reasoning benchmarks. Furthermore, through systematic ablations, we identify key factors-such as task difficulty, model scale, and semantic alignment with the target domain-that influence the effectiveness of SSL4RL tasks, offering new design principles for future work. We also demonstrate the framework's generality by applying it to graph learning, where it yields significant gains.

To counter such high-performance transformer-based classification models, we in this paper propose a novel and effective \\underline{adv}ersarial \\underline{traffic}-generating approach (AdvTraffic\\footnote{The code and data are available at: this https URL}). Our approach has two key innovations: (i) a pre-padding strategy is proposed to modify packets, which effectively overcomes the limitations of existing research against transformer-based models for network traffic classification; and (ii) a reinforcement learning model is employed to optimize network traffic perturbations, aiming to maximize adversarial effectiveness against transformer-based classification models. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to apply adversarial perturbation techniques to defend against transformer-based traffic classifiers. Furthermore, our method can be easily deployed into practical network environments. Finally, multi-faceted experiments are conducted across several real-world datasets, and the experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method can effectively undermine transformer-based classifiers, significantly reducing classification accuracy from 99\\% to as low as 25.68\\%.

While existing fair learning models aim to mitigate bias, achieving an optimal trade-off between fairness and accuracy remains a challenge. Moreover, the reliance on black-box models hinders interpretability, limiting their applicability in socially sensitive domains. To circumvent these issues, we propose integrating Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) within a fair adversarial learning framework. Leveraging the adversarial robustness and interpretability of KANs, our approach facilitates stable adversarial learning. We derive theoretical insights into the spline-based KAN architecture that ensure stability during adversarial optimization. Additionally, an adaptive fairness penalty update mechanism is proposed to strike a balance between fairness and accuracy.

We adapt these arguments but for complex VAEs with a complex latent stage. We show that complex VAEs reveal to some level K\u00e4hler geometric structure. Our methods will be tailored for decoder geometry. We derive the Fisher information metric in the complex case under a latent complex Gaussian with trivial relation matrix. It is well known from statistical information theory that the Fisher information coincides with the Hessian of the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence. Thus, the metric K\u00e4hler potential relation is exactly achieved under relative entropy. We propose a K\u00e4hler potential derivative of complex Gaussian mixtures that acts as a rough proxy to the Fisher information metric while still being faithful to the underlying K\u00e4hler geometry. Computation of the metric via this potential is efficient, and through our potential, valid as a plurisubharmonic (PSH) function, large scale computational burden of automatic differentiation is displaced to small scale. Our methods leverage the law of total covariance to bridge behavior between our potential and the Fisher metric. We show that we can regularize the latent space with decoder geometry, and that we can sample in accordance with a weighted complex volume element. We demonstrate these strategies, at the exchange of sample variation, yield consistently smoother representations and fewer semantic outliers.         ",

    "abstract": "           Text representation plays a critical role in tasks like clustering, retrieval, and other downstream applications. With the emergence of large language models (LLMs), there is increasing interest in harnessing their capabilities for this purpose. However, most of the LLMs are inherently causal and optimized for next-token prediction, making them suboptimal for producing holistic representations. To address this, recent studies introduced pretext tasks to adapt LLMs for text representation. Most of these tasks, however, rely on token-level prediction objectives, such as the masked next-token prediction (MNTP) used in LLM2Vec. In this work, we explore the untapped potential of context compression as a pretext task for unsupervised adaptation of LLMs. During compression pre-training, the model learns to generate compact memory tokens, which substitute the whole context for downstream sequence prediction. Experiments demonstrate that a well-designed compression objective can significantly enhance LLM-based text representations, outperforming models trained with token-level pretext tasks. Further improvements through contrastive learning produce a strong representation model (LLM2Comp) that outperforms contemporary LLM-based text encoders on a wide range of tasks while being more sample-efficient, requiring significantly less training data.

    "abstract": "           Code generation has emerged as a critical research area at the intersection of Software Engineering (SE) and Artificial Intelligence (AI), attracting significant attention from both academia and industry. Within this broader landscape, Verilog, as a representative hardware description language (HDL), plays a fundamental role in digital circuit design and verification, making its automated generation particularly significant for Electronic Design Automation (EDA). Consequently, recent research has increasingly focused on applying Large Language Models (LLMs) to Verilog code generation, particularly at the Register Transfer Level (RTL), exploring how these AI-driven techniques can be effectively integrated into hardware design workflows. Despite substantial research efforts have explored LLM applications in this domain, a comprehensive survey synthesizing these developments remains absent from the literature. This review fill addresses this gap by providing a systematic literature review of LLM-based methods for Verilog code generation, examining their effectiveness, limitations, and potential for advancing automated hardware design. The review encompasses research work from conferences and journals in the fields of SE, AI, and EDA, encompassing 70 papers published on venues, along with 32 high-quality preprint papers, bringing the total to 102 papers. By answering four key research questions, we aim to (1) identify the LLMs used for Verilog generation, (2) examine the datasets and metrics employed in evaluation, (3) categorize the techniques proposed for Verilog generation, and (4) analyze LLM alignment approaches for Verilog generation. Based on our findings, we have identified a series of limitations of existing studies. Finally, we have outlined a roadmap highlighting potential opportunities for future research endeavors in LLM-assisted hardware design.         ",

    "abstract": "           Causal reasoning in Large Language Models spanning association, intervention, and counterfactual inference is essential for reliable decision making in high stakes settings. As deployment shifts toward edge and resource constrained environments, quantized models such as INT8 and NF4 are becoming standard. Yet the impact of precision reduction on formal causal reasoning is poorly understood. To our knowledge, this is the first study to systematically evaluate quantization effects across all three levels of Pearls Causal Ladder. Using a 3000 sample stratified CLadder benchmark, we find that rung level accuracy in Llama 3 8B remains broadly stable under quantization, with NF4 showing less than one percent overall degradation. Interventional queries at rung 2 are the most sensitive to precision loss, whereas counterfactual reasoning at rung 3 is comparatively stable but exhibits heterogeneous weaknesses across query types such as collider bias and backdoor adjustment. Experiments on the CRASS benchmark show near identical performance across precisions, indicating that existing commonsense counterfactual datasets lack the structural sensitivity needed to reveal quantization induced reasoning drift. We further evaluate Graph Retrieval Augmented Generation using ground truth causal graphs and observe a consistent improvement in NF4 interventional accuracy of plus 1.7 percent, partially offsetting compression related degradation. These results suggest that causal reasoning is unexpectedly robust to four bit quantization, graph structured augmentation can selectively reinforce interventional reasoning, and current counterfactual benchmarks fail to capture deeper causal brittleness. This work provides an initial empirical map of compressed causal reasoning and practical guidance for deploying efficient and structurally supported causal AI systems.         ",

However, domain shift often reduces the detector's ability to maintain strong object-focused representations, causing high-confidence activations over background clutter. This weak object focus results in unreliable pseudo-labels from the detection head. While prior works mainly refine these pseudo-labels, they overlook the underlying need to strengthen the feature space itself. We propose FALCON-SFOD (Foundation-Aligned Learning with Clutter suppression and Noise robustness), a framework designed to enhance object-focused adaptation under domain shift. It consists of two complementary components. SPAR (Spatial Prior-Aware Regularization) leverages the generalization strength of vision foundation models to regularize the detector's feature space. Using class-agnostic binary masks derived from OV-SAM, SPAR promotes structured and foreground-focused activations by guiding the network toward object regions. IRPL (Imbalance-aware Noise Robust Pseudo-Labeling) complements SPAR by promoting balanced and noise-tolerant learning under severe foreground-background imbalance. Guided by a theoretical analysis that connects these designs to tighter localization and classification error bounds, FALCON-SFOD achieves competitive performance across SFOD benchmarks.         ",

This paper proposes a data-centric approach, analyzing the SDD data landscape from two practical perspectives: constructing a single dataset and aggregating multiple datasets. To address the first perspective, we conduct a large-scale empirical study to characterize the data scaling laws for SDD, quantifying the impact of source and generator diversity. To address the second, we propose the Diversity-Optimized Sampling Strategy (DOSS), a principled framework for mixing heterogeneous data with two implementations: DOSS-Select (pruning) and DOSS-Weight (re-weighting). Our experiments show that DOSS-Select outperforms the naive aggregation baseline while using only 3% of the total available data. Furthermore, our final model, trained on a 12k-hour curated data pool using the optimal DOSS-Weight strategy, achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming large-scale baselines with greater data and model efficiency on both public benchmarks and a new challenge set of various commercial APIs.

However, most existing code documentation datasets are constructed through large scale scraping of public repositories with limited quality control. As a result, they often contain noisy documentation, extensive duplication, and increasing contamination from AI generated content. These issues weaken the supervision signal available to learning-based models and complicate evaluation. We introduce Code2Doc, a quality-first curated dataset for function-level code documentation generation. Code2Doc consists of 13,358 high-quality function-documentation pairs extracted from widely used open-source repositories spanning five programming languages: Python, Java, TypeScript, JavaScript, and C++. The dataset is constructed using a four-stage curation pipeline that enforces documentation completeness and clarity, filters functions based on structural and complexity criteria, removes exact and near-duplicate code, and identifies documentation likely to be AI generated. Starting from 52,069 extracted candidates, only 25.6% satisfy all quality constraints. We provide a detailed analysis of the resulting dataset, which achieves a mean documentation quality score of 6.93 out of 10. Overall, 86.9% of samples contain explicit type annotations, and only 2.9% are flagged as potentially AI generated. Baseline experiments show that fine-tuning a large language model on Code2Doc yields relative improvements of 29.47% in BLEU and 24.04% in ROUGE-L over zero shot performance, despite the modest dataset size.

    "abstract": "           Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved impressive progress in natural image reasoning, yet their potential in medical imaging remains underexplored, especially in clinical anatomical surgical images. Anatomy understanding tasks demand precise understanding and clinically coherent answers, which are difficult to achieve due to the complexity of medical data and the scarcity of high-quality expert annotations. These challenges limit the effectiveness of conventional Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) strategies. While recent work has demonstrated that Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) can enhance reasoning in MLLMs without relying on large amounts of data, we find two weaknesses that hinder GRPO's reasoning performance in anatomy recognition: 1) knowledge cannot be effectively shared between different anatomical structures, resulting in uneven information gain and preventing the model from converging, and 2) the model quickly converges to a single reasoning path, suppressing the exploration of diverse strategies. To overcome these challenges, we propose two novel methods. First, we implement a progressive learning strategy called Anatomical Similarity Curriculum Learning by controlling question difficulty via the similarity of answer choices, enabling the model to master complex problems incrementally. Second, we utilize question augmentation referred to as Group Diversity Question Augmentation to expand the model's search space for difficult queries, mitigating the tendency to produce uniform responses. Comprehensive experiments on the SGG-VQA and OmniMedVQA benchmarks show our method achieves a significant improvement across the two benchmarks, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing the medical reasoning capabilities of MLLMs. The code can be found in this https URL ",

Although large language models (LLMs) show promise in predicting outcomes from structured medical data, their predictions may exhibit demographic biases related to sex, age, and race, limiting their trustworthy use in clinical practice. Existing debiasing methods often reduce predictive performance, making it difficult to jointly optimize fairness and accuracy. In this study, we systematically examine bias in LLM-based ICU mortality prediction and propose a training-free, clinically adaptive prompting framework to simultaneously improve fairness and performance. We first develop a multi-dimensional bias assessment scheme for comprehensive model diagnosis. Building on this analysis, we introduce CAse Prompting (CAP), a novel prompting framework that integrates conventional debiasing prompts with case-based reasoning. CAP guides the model to learn from similar historical misprediction cases and their correct outcomes, enabling correction of biased reasoning patterns. Experiments on the MIMIC-IV dataset show that CAP substantially improves both predictive accuracy and fairness. CAP increases AUROC from 0.806 to 0.873 and AUPRC from 0.497 to 0.694, while reducing sex- and race-related disparities by over 90%. Feature reliance analysis further indicates highly consistent attention patterns across demographic groups, with similarity scores exceeding 0.98. These results demonstrate that LLMs exhibit measurable bias in ICU mortality prediction, and that a carefully designed prompting framework can effectively co-optimize fairness and performance without retraining, offering a transferable paradigm for equitable clinical decision support.

Due to its unique nature, general methods, such as convolutional neural network (CNN), are difficult to be directly applied. As such, we propose DKN, that is able to i) adapt to low sample size limitation, ii) provide desired model interpretation, and iii) achieve the prediction power as CNN. The DKN is general in the sense that it not only works for both matrix and (high-order) tensor represented image data, but also could be applied to both discrete and continuous outcomes. The DKN is built on a Kronecker product structure and implicitly imposes a piecewise smooth property on coefficients. Moreover, the Kronecker structure can be written into a convolutional form, so DKN also resembles a CNN, particularly, a fully convolutional network (FCN). Furthermore, we prove that with an alternating minimization algorithm, the solutions of DKN are guaranteed to converge to the truth geometrically even if the objective function is highly nonconvex. Interestingly, the DKN is also highly connected to the tensor regression framework proposed by Zhou et al. (2010), where a CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP) low-rank structure is imposed on tensor coefficients. Finally, we conduct both classification and regression analyses using real MRI data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) to demonstrate the effectiveness of DKN.         ",

This paper introduces novel model selection frameworks for CRO that unify robustness control with decision risk minimization. We first propose Conformalized Robust Optimization with Model Selection (CROMS), a framework that selects the model to approximately minimize the averaged decision risk in CRO solutions. Given the target robustness level 1-\\alpha, we present a computationally efficient algorithm called E-CROMS, which achieves asymptotic robustness control and decision optimality. To correct the control bias in finite samples, we further develop two algorithms: F-CROMS, which ensures a 1-\\alpha robustness but requires searching the label space; and J-CROMS, which offers lower computational cost while achieving a 1-2\\alpha robustness. Furthermore, we extend the CROMS framework to the individualized setting, where model selection is performed by minimizing the conditional decision risk given the covariates of the test data. This framework advances conformal prediction methodology by enabling covariate-aware model selection.

While social learning is known to facilitate this balance, how the range of information sharing shapes group-level outcomes remains unclear. Here, we develop a minimal collective foraging model in which individuals combine independent exploration, local exploitation, and socially guided movement. We show that foraging efficiency is maximized at an intermediate social learning range, where groups exploit discovered resources without suppressing independent discovery. This optimal regime also minimizes temporal burstiness in resource intake, reducing starvation risk. Increasing social learning range further improves equity among individuals but degrades efficiency through redundant exploitation. Introducing risky (negative) targets shifts the optimal range upward; in contrast, when penalties are ignored, randomly distributed negative cues can further enhance efficiency by constraining unproductive exploration. Together, these results reveal how local information rules regulate a fundamental trade-off between efficiency, stability, and equity, providing design principles for biological foraging systems and engineered collectives.

    "title": "Awesome graph parameters",
    "abstract": "           For a graph $G$, we denote by $\\alpha(G)$ the size of a maximum independent set and by $\\omega(G)$ the size of a maximum clique in $G$. Our paper lies on the edge of two lines of research, related to $\\alpha$ and $\\omega$, respectively. One of them studies $\\alpha$-variants of graph parameters, such as $\\alpha$-treewidth or $\\alpha$-degeneracy. The second line deals with graph classes where some parameters are bounded by a function of $\\omega(G)$. A famous example of this type is the family of $\\chi$-bounded classes, where the chromatic number $\\chi(G)$ is bounded by a function of $\\omega(G)$. A Ramsey-type argument implies that if the $\\alpha$-variant of a graph parameter $\\rho$ is bounded by a constant in a class $\\mathcal{G}$, then $\\rho$ is bounded by a function of $\\omega$ in $\\mathcal{G}$. If the reverse implication also holds, we say that $\\rho$ is awesome. Otherwise, we say that $\\rho$ is awful. In the present paper, we identify a number of awesome and awful graph parameters, derive some algorithmic applications of awesomeness, and propose a number of open problems related to these notions.
