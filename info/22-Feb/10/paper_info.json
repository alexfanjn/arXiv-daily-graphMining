    "title": "Joint-bone Fusion Graph Convolutional Network for Semi-supervised  Skeleton Action Recognition",
    "abstract": "In recent years, graph convolutional networks (GCNs) play an increasingly critical role in skeleton-based human action recognition. However, most GCN-based methods still have two main limitations: 1) They only consider the motion information of the joints or process the joints and bones separately, which are unable to fully explore the latent functional correlation between joints and bones for action recognition. 2) Most of these works are performed in the supervised learning way, which heavily relies on massive labeled training data. To address these issues, we propose a semi-supervised skeleton-based action recognition method which has been rarely exploited before. We design a novel correlation-driven joint-bone fusion graph convolutional network (CD-JBF-GCN) as an encoder and use a pose prediction head as a decoder to achieve semi-supervised learning. Specifically, the CD-JBF-GC can explore the motion transmission between the joint stream and the bone stream, so that promoting both streams to learn more discriminative feature representations. The pose prediction based auto-encoder in the self-supervised training stage allows the network to learn motion representation from unlabeled data, which is essential for action recognition. Extensive experiments on two popular datasets, i.e. NTU-RGB+D and Kinetics-Skeleton, demonstrate that our model achieves the state-of-the-art performance for semi-supervised skeleton-based action recognition and is also useful for fully-supervised methods.

    "abstract": "Leveraging machine learning to optimize the optimization process is an emerging field which holds the promise to bypass the fundamental computational bottleneck caused by traditional iterative solvers in critical applications requiring near-real-time optimization. The majority of existing approaches focus on learning data-driven optimizers that lead to fewer iterations in solving an optimization. In this paper, we take a different approach and propose to replace the iterative solvers altogether with a trainable parametric set function that outputs the optimal arguments/parameters of an optimization problem in a single feed-forward. We denote our method as, Learning to Optimize the Optimization Process (LOOP). We show the feasibility of learning such parametric (set) functions to solve various classic optimization problems, including linear/nonlinear regression, principal component analysis, transport-based core-set, and quadratic programming in supply management applications. In addition, we propose two alternative approaches for learning such parametric functions, with and without a solver in the-LOOP. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach through various numerical experiments. ",

    "abstract": "Salient object detection has been long studied to identify the most visually attractive objects in images/videos. Recently, a growing amount of approaches have been proposed all of which rely on the contour/edge information to improve detection performance. The edge labels are either put into the loss directly or used as extra supervision. The edge and body can also be learned separately and then fused afterward. Both methods either lead to high prediction errors near the edge or cannot be trained in an end-to-end manner. Another problem is that existing methods may fail to detect objects of various sizes due to the lack of efficient and effective feature fusion mechanisms. In this work, we propose to decompose the saliency detection task into two cascaded sub-tasks, \\emph{i.e.}, detail modeling and body filling. Specifically, the detail modeling focuses on capturing the object edges by supervision of explicitly decomposed detail label that consists of the pixels that are nested on the edge and near the edge. Then the body filling learns the body part which will be filled into the detail map to generate more accurate saliency map. To effectively fuse the features and handle objects at different scales, we have also proposed two novel multi-scale detail attention and body attention blocks for precise detail and body modeling. Experimental results show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performances on six public datasets. ",

    "abstract": "Interaction between devices, people, and the Internet has given birth to a new digital communication model, the Internet of Things (IoT). The seamless network of these smart devices is the core of this IoT model. However, on the other hand, integrating smart devices to constitute a network introduces many security challenges. These connected devices have created a security blind spot, where cybercriminals can easily launch an attack to compromise the devices using malware proliferation techniques. Therefore, malware detection is considered a lifeline for the survival of IoT devices against cyberattacks. This study proposes a novel IoT Malware Detection Architecture (iMDA) using squeezing and boosting dilated convolutional neural network (CNN). The proposed architecture exploits the concepts of edge and smoothing, multi-path dilated convolutional operations, channel squeezing, and boosting in CNN. Edge and smoothing operations are employed with split-transform-merge (STM) blocks to extract local structure and minor contrast variation in the malware images. STM blocks performed multi-path dilated convolutional operations, which helped recognize the global structure of malware patterns. Additionally, channel squeezing and merging helped to get the prominent reduced and diverse feature maps, respectively. Channel squeezing and boosting are applied with the help of STM block at the initial, middle and final levels to capture the texture variation along with the depth for the sake of malware pattern hunting. The proposed architecture has shown substantial performance compared with the customized CNN models. The proposed iMDA has achieved Accuracy: 97.93%, F1-Score: 0.9394, Precision: 0.9864, MCC: 0. 8796, Recall: 0.8873, AUC-PR: 0.9689 and AUC-ROC: 0.9938. ",

    "abstract": "Optical wireless communication (OWC) has the potential to provide high communication speeds that support the massive use of the Internet that is expected in the near future. In OWC, optical access points (APs) are deployed on the celling to serve multiple users. In this context, efficient multiple access schemes are required to share the resources among the users and align multi-user interference. Recently, non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) has been studied to serve multiple users simultaneously using the same resources, while a different power level is allocated to each user. Despite the acceptable performance of NOMA, users might experience a high packet loss due to high noise, which results from the use of successive interference cancelation (SIC). In this work, random linear network coding (RLNC) is proposed to enhance the performance of NOMA in an optical wireless network where users are divided into multicast groups, and each group contains users that slightly differ in their channel gains. Moreover, a fixed power allocation (FPA) strategy is considered among these groups to avoid complexity. The performance of the proposed scheme is evaluated in terms of total packet success probability. The results show that the proposed scheme is more suitable for the network considered compared to other benchmark schemes such as traditional NOMA and orthogonal transmission schemes. Moreover, the total packet success probability is highly affected by the level of power allocated to each group in all the scenarios. ",

    "abstract": "The training of deep neural networks (DNNs) is currently predominantly done using first-order methods. Some of these methods (e.g., Adam, AdaGrad, and RMSprop, and their variants) incorporate a small amount of curvature information by using a diagonal matrix to precondition the stochastic gradient. Recently, effective second-order methods, such as KFAC, K-BFGS, Shampoo, and TNT, have been developed for training DNNs, by preconditioning the stochastic gradient by layer-wise block-diagonal matrices. Here we propose and analyze the convergence of an approximate natural gradient method, mini-block Fisher (MBF), that lies in between these two classes of methods. Specifically, our method uses a block-diagonal approximation to the Fisher matrix, where for each layer in the DNN, whether it is convolutional or feed-forward and fully connected, the associated diagonal block is also block-diagonal and is composed of a large number of mini-blocks of modest size. Our novel approach utilizes the parallelism of GPUs to efficiently perform computations on the large number of matrices in each layer. Consequently, MBF's per-iteration computational cost is only slightly higher than it is for first-order methods. Finally, the performance of our proposed method is compared to that of several baseline methods, on both Auto-encoder and CNN problems, to validate its effectiveness both in terms of time efficiency and generalization power.

    "abstract": "Structural magnetic resonance imaging studies have shown that brain anatomical abnormalities are associated with cognitive deficits in preterm infants. Brain maturation and geometric features can be used with machine learning models for predicting later neurodevelopmental deficits. However, traditional machine learning models would suffer from a large feature-to-instance ratio (i.e., a large number of features but a small number of instances/samples). Ensemble learning is a paradigm that strategically generates and integrates a library of machine learning classifiers and has been successfully used on a wide variety of predictive modeling problems to boost model performance. Attribute (i.e., feature) bagging method is the most commonly used feature partitioning scheme, which randomly and repeatedly draws feature subsets from the entire feature set. Although attribute bagging method can effectively reduce feature dimensionality to handle the large feature-to-instance ratio, it lacks consideration of domain knowledge and latent relationship among features. In this study, we proposed a novel Ontology-guided Attribute Partitioning (OAP) method to better draw feature subsets by considering domain-specific relationship among features. With the better partitioned feature subsets, we developed an ensemble learning framework, which is referred to as OAP Ensemble Learning (OAP-EL). We applied the OAP-EL to predict cognitive deficits at 2 year of age using quantitative brain maturation and geometric features obtained at term equivalent age in very preterm infants. We demonstrated that the proposed OAP-EL approach significantly outperformed the peer ensemble learning and traditional machine learning approaches. ",

    "abstract": "Graph convolutional networks (GCNs) (Kipf & Welling, 2017) attempt to extend the success of deep learning in modeling image and text data to graphs. However, like other deep models, GCNs comprise repeated nonlinear transformations of inputs and are therefore time and memory intensive to train. Recent work has shown that a much simpler and faster model, Simple Graph Convolution (SGC) (Wu et al., 2019), is competitive with GCNs in common graph machine learning benchmarks. The use of graph data in SGC implicitly assumes the common but not universal graph characteristic of homophily, wherein nodes link to nodes which are similar. Here we show that SGC is indeed ineffective for heterophilous (i.e., non-homophilous) graphs via experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets. We propose Adaptive Simple Graph Convolution (ASGC), which we show can adapt to both homophilous and heterophilous graph structure. Like SGC, ASGC is not a deep model, and hence is fast, scalable, and interpretable. We find that our non-deep method often outperforms state-of-the-art deep models at node classification on a benchmark of real-world datasets. The SGC paper questioned whether the complexity of graph neural networks is warranted for common graph problems involving homophilous networks; our results suggest that this question is still open even for more complicated problems involving heterophilous networks.

Once the IT department detects the attack from the hacker, it will immediately re-set the blockchain, rendering all previous efforts of the hacker in vain. The hacker will not stop until the blockchain is dysfunctional. For arbitrary distributions of the hacking times and detecting times, we derive the limiting functional probability, instantaneous functional probability, and mean functional time of the blockchain.

To resolve this issue unsupervised methods are used for training with limited data. In this report, we describe the unsupervised semantic feature learning approach for recognition of the geometric transformation applied to the input data. The basic concept of our approach is that if someone is unaware of the objects in the images, he/she would not be able to quantitatively predict the geometric transformation that was applied to them. This self supervised scheme is based on pretext task and the downstream task. The pretext classification task to quantify the geometric transformations should force the CNN to learn high-level salient features of objects useful for image classification. In our baseline model, we define image rotations by multiples of 90 degrees. The CNN trained on this pretext task will be used for the classification of images in the CIFAR-10 dataset as a downstream task. we run the baseline method using various models, including ResNet, DenseNet, VGG-16, and NIN with a varied number of rotations in feature extracting and fine-tuning settings. In extension of this baseline model we experiment with transformations other than rotation in pretext task. We compare performance of selected models in various settings with different transformations applied to images,various data augmentation techniques as well as using different optimizers. This series of different type of experiments will help us demonstrate the recognition accuracy of our self-supervised model when applied to a downstream task of classification. ",

    "abstract": "Fault diagnosis plays an essential role in reducing the maintenance costs of rotating machinery manufacturing systems. In many real applications of fault detection and diagnosis, data tend to be imbalanced, meaning that the number of samples for some fault classes is much less than the normal data samples. At the same time, in an industrial condition, accelerometers encounter high levels of disruptive signals and the collected samples turn out to be heavily noisy. As a consequence, many traditional Fault Detection and Diagnosis (FDD) frameworks get poor classification performances when dealing with real-world circumstances. Three main solutions have been proposed in the literature to cope with this problem: (1) the implementation of generative algorithms to increase the amount of under-represented input samples, (2) the employment of a classifier being powerful to learn from imbalanced and noisy data, (3) the development of an efficient data pre-processing including feature extraction and data augmentation. This paper proposes a hybrid framework which uses the three aforementioned components to achieve an effective signal-based FDD system for imbalanced conditions. Specifically, it first extracts the fault features, using Fourier and wavelet transforms to make full use of the signals. Then, it employs Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Networks (WGAN) to generate synthetic samples to populate the rare fault class and enhance the training set. Moreover, to achieve a higher performance a novel combination of Convolutional Long Short-term Memory (CLSTM) and Weighted Extreme Learning Machine (WELM) is proposed. To verify the effectiveness of the developed framework, different datasets settings on different imbalance severities and noise degrees were used. The comparative results demonstrate that in different scenarios GAN-CLSTM-ELM outperforms the other state-of-the-art FDD frameworks. ",

Our application of maritime vessel detection and tracking requires a process that can identify features and output a confidence score representing the likelihood that the feature was produced by a vessel, which may trigger a subsequent alert or activate a classification system. However, the maritime environment presents unique challenges such as the tendency of waves to produce the majority of events, demanding the majority of computational processing and producing false positive detections. By filtering redundant events and analyzing the movement of each event cluster, we can identify and track vessels while ignoring shorter lived and erratic features such as those produced by waves. ",

    "abstract": "Existing image recognition techniques based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) basically assume that the training and test datasets are sampled from i.i.d distributions. However, this assumption is easily broken in the real world because of the distribution shift that occurs when the co-occurrence relations between objects and backgrounds in input images change. Under this type of distribution shift, CNNs learn to focus on features that are not task-relevant, such as backgrounds from the training data, and degrade their accuracy on the test data. To tackle this problem, we propose relevant feature focusing (ReFF). ReFF detects task-relevant features and regularizes CNNs via explanation outputs (e.g., Grad-CAM). Since ReFF is composed of post-hoc explanation modules, it can be easily applied to off-the-shelf CNNs. Furthermore, ReFF requires no additional inference cost at test time because it is only used for regularization while training. We demonstrate that CNNs trained with ReFF focus on features relevant to the target task and that ReFF improves the test-time accuracy. ",

    "abstract": "In presenting an irrigation detection methodology that leverages multiscale satellite imagery of vegetation abundance, this paper introduces a process to supplement limited ground-collected labels and ensure classifier applicability in an area of interest. Spatiotemporal analysis of MODIS 250m Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) timeseries characterizes native vegetation phenologies at regional scale to provide the basis for a continuous phenology map that guides supplementary label collection over irrigated and non-irrigated agriculture. Subsequently, validated dry season greening and senescence cycles observed in 10m Sentinel-2 imagery are used to train a suite of classifiers for automated detection of potential smallholder irrigation. Strategies to improve model robustness are demonstrated, including a method of data augmentation that randomly shifts training samples; and an assessment of classifier types that produce the best performance in withheld target regions. The methodology is applied to detect smallholder irrigation in two states in the Ethiopian highlands, Tigray and Amhara. Results show that a transformer-based neural network architecture allows for the most robust prediction performance in withheld regions, followed closely by a CatBoost random forest model. Over withheld ground-collection survey labels, the transformer-based model achieves 96.7% accuracy over non-irrigated samples and 95.9% accuracy over irrigated samples. Over a larger set of samples independently collected via the introduced method of label supplementation, non-irrigated and irrigated labels are predicted with 98.3% and 95.5% accuracy, respectively. The detection model is then deployed over Tigray and Amhara, revealing crop rotation patterns and year-over-year irrigated area change. Predictions suggest that irrigated area in these two states has decreased by approximately 40% from 2020 to 2021. ",

Human beings understand the 3D world by extracting two levels of information and establishing the relationship between them. One is the global shape of an object, and the other is the local structures of it. However, few existing studies in point cloud representation learning explored how to learn both global shapes and local-to-global relationships without a specified network architecture. Inspired by how human beings understand the world, we utilize knowledge distillation to learn both global shape information and the relationship between global shape and local structures. At the same time, we combine contrastive learning with knowledge distillation to make the teacher network be better updated. Our method achieves the state-of-the-art performance on linear classification and multiple other downstream tasks. Especially, we develop a variant of ViT for 3D point cloud feature extraction, which also achieves comparable results with existing backbones when combined with our framework, and visualization of the attention maps show that our model does understand the point cloud by combining the global shape information and multiple local structural information, which is consistent with the inspiration of our representation learning method.

Although the monitoring of the station behaviors can be realized by anomaly detection on multivariate time series, due to complex correlations and various temporal patterns of multivariate series in large-scale stations, building a general unsupervised anomaly detection model with a higher F1-score remains a challenging task. In this paper, we propose a General representation of multivariate time series for Anomaly Detection(GenAD). First, we pre-train a general model on large-scale wireless base stations with self-supervision, which can be easily transferred to a specific station anomaly detection with a small amount of training data. Second, we employ Multi-Correlation Attention and Time-Series Attention to represent the correlations and temporal patterns of the stations. With the above innovations, GenAD increases F1-score by total 9% on real-world datasets in China Mobile, while the performance does not significantly degrade on public datasets with only 10% of the training data.

    "abstract": "In conventional object detection frameworks, a backbone body inherited from image recognition models extracts deep latent features and then a neck module fuses these latent features to capture information at different scales. As the resolution in object detection is much larger than in image recognition, the computational cost of the backbone often dominates the total inference cost. This heavy-backbone design paradigm is mostly due to the historical legacy when transferring image recognition models to object detection rather than an end-to-end optimized design for object detection. In this work, we show that such paradigm indeed leads to sub-optimal object detection models. To this end, we propose a novel heavy-neck paradigm, GiraffeDet, a giraffe-like network for efficient object detection. The GiraffeDet uses an extremely lightweight backbone and a very deep and large neck module which encourages dense information exchange among different spatial scales as well as different levels of latent semantics simultaneously. This design paradigm allows detectors to process the high-level semantic information and low-level spatial information at the same priority even in the early stage of the network, making it more effective in detection tasks. Numerical evaluations on multiple popular object detection benchmarks show that GiraffeDet consistently outperforms previous SOTA models across a wide spectrum of resource constraints. ",

In this work, we propose a model independent adversarial detection method using a simple energy function to distinguish between adversarial and natural inputs. We train a standalone detector independent of the underlying model, with sequential layer-wise training to increase the energy separation corresponding to natural and adversarial inputs. With this, we perform energy distribution-based adversarial detection. Our method achieves state-of-the-art detection performance (ROC-AUC > 0.9) across a wide range of gradient, score and decision-based adversarial attacks on CIFAR10, CIFAR100 and TinyImagenet datasets. Compared to prior approaches, our method requires ~10-100x less number of operations and parameters for adversarial detection. Further, we show that our detection method is transferable across different datasets and adversarial attacks. For reproducibility, we provide code in the supplementary material. ",

To achieve a profound understanding of how far we are from solving the problem of log-based anomaly detection, in this paper, we conduct an in-depth analysis of five state-of-the-art deep learning-based models for detecting system anomalies on four public log datasets. Our experiments focus on several aspects of model evaluation, including training data selection, data grouping, class distribution, data noise, and early detection ability. Our results point out that all these aspects have significant impact on the evaluation, and that all the studied models do not always work well.

These methods omit to consider the correlation of graph structure among multiple modalities; (2) most existing CMH methods ignores considering the fusion affinity among multi-modalities data; (3) most existing CMH methods relax the discrete constraints to solve the optimization objective, significantly degrading the retrieval performance. To solve the above limitations, we propose a novel Anchor Graph Structure Fusion Hashing (AGSFH). AGSFH constructs the anchor graph structure fusion matrix from different anchor graphs of multiple modalities with the Hadamard product, which can fully exploit the geometric property of underlying data structure. Based on the anchor graph structure fusion matrix, AGSFH attempts to directly learn an intrinsic anchor graph, where the structure of the intrinsic anchor graph is adaptively tuned so that the number of components of the intrinsic graph is exactly equal to the number of clusters. Besides, AGSFH preserves the anchor fusion affinity into the common binary Hamming space. Furthermore, a discrete optimization framework is designed to learn the unified binary codes. Extensive experimental results on three public social datasets demonstrate the superiority of AGSFH. ",

    "abstract": "With the prevalence of live broadcast business nowadays, a new type of recommendation service, called live broadcast recommendation, is widely used in many mobile e-commerce Apps. Different from classical item recommendation, live broadcast recommendation is to automatically recommend user anchors instead of items considering the interactions among triple-objects (i.e., users, anchors, items) rather than binary interactions between users and items. Existing methods based on binary objects, ranging from early matrix factorization to recently emerged deep learning, obtain objects' embeddings by mapping from pre-existing features. Directly applying these techniques would lead to limited performance, as they are failing to encode collaborative signals among triple-objects. In this paper, we propose a novel TWo-side Interactive NetworkS (TWINS) for live broadcast recommendation. In order to fully use both static and dynamic information on user and anchor sides, we combine a product-based neural network with a recurrent neural network to learn the embedding of each object. In addition, instead of directly measuring the similarity, TWINS effectively injects the collaborative effects into the embedding process in an explicit manner by modeling interactive patterns between the user's browsing history and the anchor's broadcast history in both item and anchor aspects. Furthermore, we design a novel co-retrieval technique to select key items among massive historic records efficiently. Offline experiments on real large-scale data show the superior performance of the proposed TWINS, compared to representative methods; and further results of online experiments on Diantao App show that TWINS gains average performance improvement of around 8% on ACTR metric, 3% on UCTR metric, 3.5% on UCVR metric.

    "abstract": "As an important task for the management of bike sharing systems, accurate forecast of travel demand could facilitate dispatch and relocation of bicycles to improve user satisfaction. In recent years, many deep learning algorithms have been introduced to improve bicycle usage forecast. A typical practice is to integrate convolutional (CNN) and recurrent neural network (RNN) to capture spatial-temporal dependency in historical travel demand. For typical CNN, the convolution operation is conducted through a kernel that moves across a \"matrix-format\" city to extract features over spatially adjacent urban areas. This practice assumes that areas close to each other could provide useful information that improves prediction accuracy. However, bicycle usage in neighboring areas might not always be similar, given spatial variations in built environment characteristics and travel behavior that affect cycling activities. Yet, areas that are far apart can be relatively more similar in temporal usage patterns. To utilize the hidden linkage among these distant urban areas, the study proposes an irregular convolutional Long-Short Term Memory model (IrConv+LSTM) to improve short-term bike sharing demand forecast. The model modifies traditional CNN with irregular convolutional architecture to extract dependency among \"semantic neighbors\". The proposed model is evaluated with a set of benchmark models in five study sites, which include one dockless bike sharing system in Singapore, and four station-based systems in Chicago, Washington, D.C., New York, and London. We find that IrConv+LSTM outperforms other benchmark models in the five cities. The model also achieves superior performance in areas with varying levels of bicycle usage and during peak periods. The findings suggest that \"thinking beyond spatial neighbors\" can further improve short-term travel demand prediction of urban bike sharing systems. ",

    "abstract": "The construction of polar codes with code length $n=2^m$ involves $m$ layers of polar transforms. In this paper, we observe that after each layer of polar transforms, one can swap certain pairs of adjacent bits to accelerate the polarization process. More precisely, if the previous bit is more reliable than its next bit under the successive decoder, then switching the decoding order of these two adjacent bits will make the reliable bit even more reliable and the noisy bit even noisier. Based on this observation, we propose a new family of codes called the Adjacent-Bits-Swapped (ABS) polar codes. We add a permutation layer after each polar transform layer in the construction of the ABS polar codes. In order to choose which pairs of adjacent bits to swap in the permutation layers, we rely on a new polar transform that combines two independent channels with $4$-ary inputs. This new polar transform allows us to track the evolution of every pair of adjacent bits through different layers of polar transforms, and it also plays an essential role in the Successive Cancellation List (SCL) decoder for the ABS polar codes. Extensive simulation results show that ABS polar codes consistently outperform standard polar codes by 0.15dB -- 0.6dB when we use CRC-aided SCL decoder with list size $32$ for both codes.

Therefore, we introduce a multi-task recurrent neural network to predict grid maps providing occupancies, velocity estimates, semantic information and the driveable area.

We introduce a new measure of dissatisfaction of an agent by counting the number of non-assigned items which are approved of by the agent and for which no more preferred item is allocated to the agent. Considering two problem variants, we seek an allocation of the items to the agents in a way that minimizes (i) the total dissatisfaction over all agents or (ii) the maximum dissatisfaction among the agents. For both optimization problems we study the status of computational complexity and obtain NP-hardness results as well as polynomial algorithms with respect to natural underlying graph structures, such as stars, trees, paths, and matchings. We also analyze the parameterized complexity of the two problems with respect to various parameters related to the number of agents, the dissatisfaction threshold, the vertex degrees of the preference graphs, and the treewidth.

Not all directed graphs contain kernels, and computing a kernel or deciding that none exist is NP-complete even on low-degree planar digraphs. The existing polynomial-time algorithms for this problem all restrict both the undirected structure and the edge orientations of the input: for example, to chordal graphs without bidirectional edges (Pass-Lanneau, Igarashi and Meunier, Discrete Appl Math 2020) or to permutation graphs where each clique has a sink (Abbas and Saoula, 4OR 2005). By contrast, we count the kernels of a fuzzy circular interval graph in polynomial time, regardless of its edge orientations, and return a kernel when one exists. (Fuzzy circular graphs were introduced by Chudnovsky and Seymour in their structure theorem for claw-free graphs.) We also consider kernels on cographs, where we establish NP-hardness in general but linear running times on the subclass of threshold graphs. ",

We demonstrate such an adversary's ability to assume control of the model by injecting \"backdoor\" attack samples to commonly used generative replay and regularization based continual learning approaches using continual learning benchmark variants of MNIST, as well as the more challenging SVHN and CIFAR 10 datasets. Perhaps most damaging, we show this vulnerability to be very acute and exceptionally effective: the backdoor pattern in our attack model can be imperceptible to human eye, can be provided at any point in time, can be added into the training data of even a single possibly unrelated task and can be achieved with as few as just 1\\% of total training dataset of a single task.

Current state-of-the-art vehicle prediction models heavily rely on map information. In reality, however, this information is not always available. We therefore propose CRAT-Pred, a multi-modal and non-rasterization-based trajectory prediction model, specifically designed to effectively model social interactions between vehicles, without relying on map information. CRAT-Pred applies a graph convolution method originating from the field of material science to vehicle prediction, allowing to efficiently leverage edge features, and combines it with multi-head self-attention. Compared to other map-free approaches, the model achieves state-of-the-art performance with a significantly lower number of model parameters. In addition to that, we quantitatively show that the self-attention mechanism is able to learn social interactions between vehicles, with the weights representing a measurable interaction score.

Counterfactual fairness describes an individualized notion of fairness but is even more challenging to evaluate after deployment. We present prediction sensitivity, an approach for continual audit of counterfactual fairness in deployed classifiers. Prediction sensitivity helps answer the question: would this prediction have been different, if this individual had belonged to a different demographic group -- for every prediction made by the deployed model. Prediction sensitivity can leverage correlations between protected status and other features and does not require protected status information at prediction time. Our empirical results demonstrate that prediction sensitivity is effective for detecting violations of counterfactual fairness. ",

    "abstract": "Machine-learning based recommender systems(RSs) has become an effective means to help people automatically discover their interests. Existing models often represent the rich information for recommendation, such as items, users, and contexts, as embedding vectors and leverage them to predict users' feedback. In the view of causal analysis, the associations between these embedding vectors and users' feedback are a mixture of the causal part that describes why an item is preferred by a user, and the non-causal part that merely reflects the statistical dependencies between users and items, for example, the exposure mechanism, public opinions, display position, etc. However, existing RSs mostly ignored the striking differences between the causal parts and non-causal parts when using these embedding vectors. In this paper, we propose a model-agnostic framework named IV4Rec that can effectively decompose the embedding vectors into these two parts, hence enhancing recommendation results. Specifically, we jointly consider users' behaviors in search scenarios and recommendation scenarios. Adopting the concepts in causal analysis, we embed users' search behaviors as instrumental variables (IVs), to help decompose original embedding vectors in recommendation, i.e., treatments. IV4Rec then combines the two parts through deep neural networks and uses the combined results for recommendation. IV4Rec is model-agnostic and can be applied to a number of existing RSs such as DIN and NRHUB. Experimental results on both public and proprietary industrial datasets demonstrate that IV4Rec consistently enhances RSs and outperforms a framework that jointly considers search and recommendation.

This builds on a state-of-the-art CCA-GNN that aims to learn representative embeddings by maximizing the correlation between pairs of augmented views of the same input while decorrelating disconnected features. The key idea of the conventional CCA-GNN involves discarding augmentation-variant information and preserving augmentation-invariant information whilst preventing capturing of redundant information. Our proposed AV CCA-GNN model is designed to deal with the challenging multimodal representation learning context. Specifically, our model improves contextual AV speech processing by maximizing canonical correlation from augmented views of the same channel, as well as canonical correlation from audio and visual embeddings. In addition, we propose a positional encoding of the nodes that considers a prior-frame sequence distance instead of a feature-space representation while computing the node's nearest neighbors. This serves to introduce temporal information in the embeddings through the neighborhood's connectivity. Experiments conducted with the benchmark ChiME3 dataset show that our proposed prior frame-based AV CCA-GNN reinforces better feature learning in the temporal context, leading to more energy-efficient speech reconstruction compared to state-of-the-art CCA-GNN and multi-layer perceptron models. The results demonstrate the potential of our proposed approach for exploitation in future assistive technology and energy-efficient multimodal devices. ",

Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) implicitly assume a graph with a trivial underlying sheaf. This choice is reflected in the structure of the graph Laplacian operator, the properties of the associated diffusion equation, and the characteristics of the convolutional models that discretise this equation. In this paper, we use cellular sheaf theory to show that the underlying geometry of the graph is deeply linked with the performance of GNNs in heterophilic settings and their oversmoothing behaviour. By considering a hierarchy of increasingly general sheaves, we study how the ability of the sheaf diffusion process to achieve linear separation of the classes in the infinite time limit expands. At the same time, we prove that when the sheaf is non-trivial, discretised parametric diffusion processes have greater control than GNNs over their asymptotic behaviour. On the practical side, we study how sheaves can be learned from data. The resulting sheaf diffusion models have many desirable properties that address the limitations of classical graph diffusion equations (and corresponding GNN models) and obtain state-of-the-art results in heterophilic settings. Overall, our work provides new connections between GNNs and algebraic topology and would be of interest to both fields. ",

Indeed, previous research has shown that developers often miss even popular and easy-to-detect vulnerabilities during code review. Initial evidence suggests that a significant cause may lie in the reviewers' mental attitude and common practices. In this study, we investigate whether and how explicitly asking developers to focus on security during a code review affects the detection of vulnerabilities. Furthermore, we evaluate the effect of providing a security checklist to guide the security review. To this aim, we conduct an online experiment with 150 participants, of which 71% report to have three or more years of professional development experience. Our results show that simply asking reviewers to focus on security during the code review increases eight times the probability of vulnerability detection. The presence of a security checklist does not significantly improve the outcome further, even when the checklist is tailored to the change under review and the existing vulnerabilities in the change. These results provide evidence supporting the mental attitude hypothesis and call for further work on security checklists' effectiveness and design.

The event occurrence at one device triggers an action in another device, which may eventually contribute to the creation of a chain of events in a network. Adversaries exploit the chain effect to compromise IoT devices and trigger actions of interest remotely just by injecting malicious events into the chain. To address security vulnerabilities caused by trigger-action scenarios, existing research efforts focus on the validation of the security properties of devices or verification of the occurrence of certain events based on their physical fingerprints on a device. We propose IoTMonitor, a security analysis system that discerns the underlying chain of event occurrences with the highest probability by observing a chain of physical evidence collected by sensors. We use the Baum-Welch algorithm to estimate transition and emission probabilities and the Viterbi algorithm to discern the event sequence. We can then identify the crucial nodes in the trigger-action sequence whose compromise allows attackers to reach their final goals. The experiment results of our designed system upon the PEEVES datasets show that we can rebuild the event occurrence sequence with high accuracy from the observations and identify the crucial nodes on the attack paths.

In this paper, we propose a deterministic and computationally cheap tool to alleviate randomized acquisition design, prior to survey deployment and large-scale optimization. We consider universal and deterministic matrix completion results in the context of seismology, where a bipartite graph representation of the source-receiver layout allows for the respective spectral gap to act as a quality metric for wavefield reconstruction. We provide realistic survey design scenarios to demonstrate the utility of the spectral gap for successful seismic data acquisition via low-rank and sparse signal recovery. ",

    "abstract": "Autoencoders are a type of unsupervised neural networks, which can be used to solve various tasks, e.g., dimensionality reduction, image compression, and image denoising. An AE has two goals: (i) compress the original input to a low-dimensional space at the bottleneck of the network topology using an encoder, (ii) reconstruct the input from the representation at the bottleneck using a decoder. Both encoder and decoder are optimized jointly by minimizing a distortion-based loss which implicitly forces the model to keep only those variations of input data that are required to reconstruct the and to reduce redundancies. In this paper, we propose a scheme to explicitly penalize feature redundancies in the bottleneck representation. To this end, we propose an additional loss term, based on the pair-wise correlation of the neurons, which complements the standard reconstruction loss forcing the encoder to learn a more diverse and richer representation of the input. We tested our approach across different tasks: dimensionality reduction using three different dataset, image compression using the MNIST dataset, and image denoising using fashion MNIST. The experimental results show that the proposed loss leads consistently to superior performance compared to the standard AE loss. ",

While accurate localization favors models that operate at the pixel- or point-level, correct recognition typically relies on a more holistic, region-level view of objects. Incorporating this perspective in pre-training, our approach performs contrastive learning by directly sampling individual point pairs from different regions. Compared to an aggregated representation per region, our approach is more robust to the change in input region quality, and further enables us to implicitly improve initial region assignments via online knowledge distillation during training. Both advantages are important when dealing with imperfect regions encountered in the unsupervised setting. Experiments show point-level region contrast improves on state-of-the-art pre-training methods for object detection and segmentation across multiple tasks and datasets, and we provide extensive ablation studies and visualizations to aid understanding.

This paper studies theoretical properties of orthogonal convolutional layers. We establish necessary and sufficient conditions on the layer architecture guaranteeing the existence of an orthogonal convolutional transform. The conditions prove that orthogonal convolutional transforms exist for almost all architectures used in practice for 'circular' padding.We also exhibit limitations with 'valid' boundary condition and 'same' boundary condition with zero padding. Recently, a regularization term imposing the orthogonality of convolutional layers has been proposed, and impressive empirical results have been obtained in different applications (Wang et al. 2020).The second motivation of the present paper is to specify the theory behind this.We make the link between this regularization term and orthogonality measures. In doing so, we show that this regularization strategy is stable with respect to numerical and optimization errors and that, in the presence of small errors and when the size of the signal/image is large, the convolutional layers remain close to isometric.The theoretical results are confirmed with experiments, the landscape of the regularization term is studied and the regularization strategy is validated on real datasets. Altogether, the study guarantees that the regularization with L_{orth} (Wang et al. 2020) is an efficient, flexible and stable numerical strategy to learn orthogonal convolutional layers. ",

Although the identifiability is appealing, the objective function of iVAE does not enforce the inverse relation between encoders and decoders. Without the inverse relation, representations from the encoder in iVAE may not reconstruct observations,i.e., representations lose information in observations. To overcome this limitation, we develop a new approach, covariate-informed identifiable VAE (CI-iVAE). Different from previous iVAE implementations, our method critically leverages the posterior distribution of latent variables conditioned only on observations. In doing so, the objective function enforces the inverse relation, and learned representation contains more information of observations. Furthermore, CI-iVAE extends the original iVAE objective function to a larger class and finds the optimal one among them, thus providing a better fit to the data. Theoretically, our method has tighter evidence lower bounds (ELBOs) than the original iVAE. We demonstrate that our approach can more reliably learn features of various synthetic datasets, two benchmark image datasets (EMNIST and Fashion MNIST), and a large-scale brain imaging dataset for adolescent mental health research.

    "title": "Evaluating Causal Inference Methods",
    "abstract": "The fundamental challenge of drawing causal inference is that counterfactual outcomes are not fully observed for any unit. Furthermore, in observational studies, treatment assignment is likely to be confounded. Many statistical methods have emerged for causal inference under unconfoundedness conditions given pre-treatment covariates, including propensity score-based methods, prognostic score-based methods, and doubly robust methods. Unfortunately for applied researchers, there is no `one-size-fits-all' causal method that can perform optimally universally. In practice, causal methods are primarily evaluated quantitatively on handcrafted simulated data. Such data-generative procedures can be of limited value because they are typically stylized models of reality. They are simplified for tractability and lack the complexities of real-world data. For applied researchers, it is critical to understand how well a method performs for the data at hand. Our work introduces a deep generative model-based framework, Credence, to validate causal inference methods. The framework's novelty stems from its ability to generate synthetic data anchored at the empirical distribution for the observed sample, and therefore virtually indistinguishable from the latter. The approach allows the user to specify ground truth for the form and magnitude of causal effects and confounding bias as functions of covariates. Thus simulated data sets are used to evaluate the potential performance of various causal estimation methods when applied to data similar to the observed sample. We demonstrate Credence's ability to accurately assess the relative performance of causal estimation techniques in an extensive simulation study and two real-world data applications from Lalonde and Project STAR studies.

In particular, precision-related errors can accumulate in the quantities of interest when the simulations are performed using low-precision 16-bit floating-point arithmetic compared to an equivalent 64-bit simulation. Here, low-precision computation requires much lower resources than high-precision computation. Several machine learning (ML) techniques proposed recently have been successful in correcting the errors arising from spatial discretization. In this work, we extend these techniques to improve Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations performed using low numerical precision. We first quantify the precision related errors accumulated in a Kolmogorov forced turbulence test case. Subsequently, we employ a Convolutional Neural Network together with a fully differentiable numerical solver performing 16-bit arithmetic to learn a tightly-coupled ML-CFD hybrid solver. Compared to the 16-bit solver, we demonstrate the efficacy of the ML-CFD hybrid solver towards reducing the error accumulation in the velocity field and improving the kinetic energy spectrum at higher frequencies.

    "abstract": "t-Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) is a non-parametric data visualization method in classical machine learning. It maps the data from the high-dimensional space into a low-dimensional space, especially a two-dimensional plane, while maintaining the relationship, or similarities, between the surrounding points. In t-SNE, the initial position of the low-dimensional data is randomly determined, and the visualization is achieved by moving the low-dimensional data to minimize a cost function. Its variant called parametric t-SNE uses neural networks for this mapping. In this paper, we propose to use quantum neural networks for parametric t-SNE to reflect the characteristics of high-dimensional quantum data on low-dimensional data. We use fidelity-based metrics instead of Euclidean distance in calculating high-dimensional data similarity. We visualize both classical (Iris dataset) and quantum (time-depending Hamiltonian dynamics) data for classification tasks. Since this method allows us to represent a quantum dataset in a higher dimensional Hilbert space by a quantum dataset in a lower dimension while keeping their similarity, the proposed method can also be used to compress quantum data for further quantum machine learning.

Compared with the Wasserstein robust test, the corresponding least favorable distributions are supported beyond the training samples, which provides a more flexible detector. Various numerical experiments are conducted on both synthetic and real datasets to validate the competitive performances of our proposed method. ",

However, its kernel function is non-linear, elusive, and complex to opt bandwidth, the predictive power could also be improved. Consequently, a novel technique, Geographical Neural Network Weighted Regression (GNNWR), has been applied to improve the accuracy of real estate appraisal with the help of neural networks. Based on Shenzhen house price dataset, this work conspicuously captures the weight distribution of different variants at Shenzhen real estate market, which GWR is difficult to materialize. Moreover, we focus on the performance of GNNWR, verify its robustness and superiority, refine the experiment process with 10-fold cross-validation, extend its application area from natural to socioeconomic geospatial data. It's a practical and trenchant way to assess house price, and we demonstrate the effectiveness of GNNWR on a complex socioeconomic dataset. ",

Power system data are often corrupted with outliers caused by fault conditions, power outages, and extreme weather, to name a few. The proposed emulator bounds the influence of the outliers using weights calculated based on projection statistics, which are robust distances of the data points associated with the rows vectors of the factor space. Specifically, the developed estimator is robust to vertical outliers and bad leverage points while retaining good leverage points in the measurements of the training dataset. The proposed method is demonstrated on an unbalanced radial IEEE 33-Bus system heavily integrated with renewable energy sources. ",

These latter are incorporated into the model by taking advantage of the spectral decomposition of the operator that rules the linear evolution across the processing network. Non-linear terms act for a transient and allow to disentangle the data supplied as initial condition to the discrete dynamical system, shaping the boundaries of different attractors. The network can be equipped with several memory kernels which can be sequentially activated for serial datasets handling. Our novel approach to classification, that we here term Recurrent Spectral Network (RSN), is successfully challenged against a simple test-bed model, created for illustrative purposes, as well as a standard dataset for image processing training.

The algorithm, named PFJet-SSD performs simultaneous localization, classification and regression tasks to cluster jets and reconstruct their features. This all-in-one single feed-forward pass gives advantages in terms of execution time and an improved accuracy w.r.t. traditional rule-based methods. A further gain is obtained from network slimming, homogeneous quantization, and optimized runtime for meeting memory and latency constraints of a typical real-time processing environment. We experiment with 8-bit and ternary quantization, benchmarking their accuracy and inference latency against a single-precision floating-point. We show that the ternary network closely matches the performance of its full-precision equivalent and outperforms the state-of-the-art rule-based algorithm. Finally, we report the inference latency on different hardware platforms and discuss future applications. ",

For instance, in laparoscopic surgery, the acquired video data suffers from different kinds of distortion that not only hinder surgery performance but also affect the execution of subsequent tasks in surgical navigation and robotic surgeries. For this reason, we propose in this paper neural network-based approaches for distortion classification as well as quality prediction. More precisely, a Residual Network (ResNet) based approach is firstly developed for simultaneous ranking and classification task. Then, this architecture is extended to make it appropriate for the quality prediction task by using an additional Fully Connected Neural Network (FCNN). To train the overall architecture (ResNet and FCNN models), transfer learning and end-to-end learning approaches are investigated. Experimental results, carried out on a new laparoscopic video quality database, have shown the efficiency of the proposed methods compared to recent conventional and deep learning based approaches.

    "abstract": "This paper is concerned with the stability analysis of the recurrent neural networks (RNNs) by means of the integral quadratic constraint (IQC) framework. The rectified linear unit (ReLU) is typically employed as the activation function of the RNN, and the ReLU has specific nonnegativity properties regarding its input and output signals. Therefore, it is effective if we can derive IQC-based stability conditions with multipliers taking care of such nonnegativity properties. However, such nonnegativity (linear) properties are hardly captured by the existing multipliers defined on the positive semidefinite cone. To get around this difficulty, we loosen the standard positive semidefinite cone to the copositive cone, and employ copositive multipliers to capture the nonnegativity properties. We show that, within the framework of the IQC, we can employ copositive multipliers (or their inner approximation) together with existing multipliers such as Zames-Falb multipliers and polytopic bounding multipliers, and this directly enables us to ensure that the introduction of the copositive multipliers leads to better (no more conservative) results. We finally illustrate the effectiveness of the IQC-based stability conditions with the copositive multipliers by numerical examples. ",

In this paper, we explore the structural sparsity in neural image compression network to obtain real-time acceleration without any specialized hardware design or algorithm. We propose a simple plug-in adaptive binary channel masking(ABCM) to judge the importance of each convolution channel and introduce sparsity during training. During inference, the unimportant channels are pruned to obtain slimmer network and less computation. We implement our method into three neural image compression networks with different entropy models to verify its effectiveness and generalization, the experiment results show that up to 7x computation reduction and 3x acceleration can be achieved with negligible performance drop.
