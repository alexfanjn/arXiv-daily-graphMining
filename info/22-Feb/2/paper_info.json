    "abstract": "Deep machine learning models are increasingly deployedin the wild for providing services to users. Adversaries maysteal the knowledge of these valuable models by trainingsubstitute models according to the inference results of thetargeted deployed models. Recent data-free model stealingmethods are shown effective to extract the knowledge of thetarget model without using real query examples, but they as-sume rich inference information, e.g., class probabilities andlogits. However, they are all based on competing generator-substitute networks and hence encounter training instability.In this paper we propose a data-free model stealing frame-work,MEGA, which is based on collaborative generator-substitute networks and only requires the target model toprovide label prediction for synthetic query examples. Thecore of our method is a model stealing optimization con-sisting of two collaborative models (i) the substitute modelwhich imitates the target model through the synthetic queryexamples and their inferred labels and (ii) the generatorwhich synthesizes images such that the confidence of thesubstitute model over each query example is maximized. Wepropose a novel coordinate descent training procedure andanalyze its convergence. We also empirically evaluate thetrained substitute model on three datasets and its applicationon black-box adversarial attacks. Our results show that theaccuracy of our trained substitute model and the adversarialattack success rate over it can be up to 33% and 40% higherthan state-of-the-art data-free black-box attacks. ",

    "title": "AVTPnet: Convolutional Autoencoder for AVTP anomaly detection in  Automotive Ethernet Networks",
    "abstract": "Network Intrusion Detection Systems are well considered as efficient tools for securing in-vehicle networks against diverse cyberattacks. However, since cyberattack are always evolving, signature-based intrusion detection systems are no longer adopted. An alternative solution can be the deployment of deep learning based intrusion detection system (IDS) which play an important role in detecting unknown attack patterns in network traffic. To our knowledge, no previous research work has been done to detect anomalies on automotive ethernet based in-vehicle networks using anomaly based approaches. Hence, in this paper, we propose a convolutional autoencoder (CAE) for offline detection of anomalies on the Audio Video Transport Protocol (AVTP), an application layer protocol implemented in the recent in-vehicle network Automotive Ethernet. The CAE consists of an encoder and a decoder with CNN structures that are asymmetrical. Anomalies in AVTP packet stream, which may lead to critical interruption of media streams, are therefore detected by measuring the reconstruction error of each sliding window of AVTP packets. Our proposed approach is evaluated on the recently published \"Automotive Ethernet Intrusion Dataset\", and is also compared with other state-of-the art traditional anomaly detection and signature based models in machine learning. The numerical results show that our proposed model outperfoms the other methods and excel at predicting unknown in-vehicle intrusions, with 0.94 accuracy. Moreover, our model has a low level of false alarm and miss detection rates for different AVTP attack types. ",

    "abstract": "This paper is on face/head reenactment where the goal is to transfer the facial pose (3D head orientation and expression) of a target face to a source face. Previous methods focus on learning embedding networks for identity and pose disentanglement which proves to be a rather hard task, degrading the quality of the generated images. We take a different approach, bypassing the training of such networks, by using (fine-tuned) pre-trained GANs which have been shown capable of producing high-quality facial images. Because GANs are characterized by weak controllability, the core of our approach is a method to discover which directions in latent GAN space are responsible for controlling facial pose and expression variations. We present a simple pipeline to learn such directions with the aid of a 3D shape model which, by construction, already captures disentangled directions for facial pose, identity and expression. Moreover, we show that by embedding real images in the GAN latent space, our method can be successfully used for the reenactment of real-world faces. Our method features several favorable properties including using a single source image (one-shot) and enabling cross-person reenactment. Our qualitative and quantitative results show that our approach often produces reenacted faces of significantly higher quality than those produced by state-of-the-art methods for the standard benchmarks of VoxCeleb1 & 2.

    "abstract": "Social media plays a significant role in sharing essential information, which helps humanitarian organizations in rescue operations during and after disaster incidents. However, developing an efficient method that can provide rapid analysis of social media images in the early hours of disasters is still largely an open problem, mainly due to the lack of suitable datasets and the sheer complexity of this task. In addition, supervised methods can not generalize well to novel disaster incidents. In this paper, inspired by the success of Knowledge Distillation (KD) methods, we propose an unsupervised deep neural network to detect and localize damages in social media images. Our proposed KD architecture is a feature-based distillation approach that comprises a pre-trained teacher and a smaller student network, with both networks having similar GAN architecture containing a generator and a discriminator. The student network is trained to emulate the behavior of the teacher on training input samples, which, in turn, contain images that do not include any damaged regions. Therefore, the student network only learns the distribution of no damage data and would have different behavior from the teacher network-facing damages. To detect damage, we utilize the difference between features generated by two networks using a defined score function that demonstrates the probability of damages occurring. Our experimental results on the benchmark dataset confirm that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in detecting and localizing the damaged areas, especially for novel disaster types. ",

    "abstract": "An autonomous airborne network (AN) consists of multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), which can self-configure to provide seamless, low-cost and secure connectivity. AN is preferred for applications in civilian and military sectors because it can improve the network reliability and fault tolerance, reduce mission completion time through collaboration, and adapt to dynamic mission requirements. However, facilitating seamless communication in such ANs is a challenging task due to their fast node mobility, which results in frequent link disruptions. Many existing AN-specific mobility-aware schemes restrictively assume that UAVs fly in straight lines, to reduce the high uncertainty in the mobility pattern and simplify the calculation of link lifetime (LLT). Here, LLT represents the duration after which the link between a node pair terminates. However, the application of such schemes is severely limited, which makes them unsuitable for practical autonomous ANs. In this report, a mathematical framework is described to accurately compute the \\textit{LLT} value for a UAV node pair, where each node flies independently in a randomly selected smooth trajectory. In addition, the impact of random trajectory changes on LLT accuracy is also discussed. ",

In the context of social behaviors, sentiments characterize the states of the system. Affect Control Theory (ACT) uses sentiments to manifest potential interaction. ACT is a generative theory of culture and behavior based on a three-dimensional sentiment lexicon. Traditionally, the sentiments are quantified using survey data which is fed into a regression model to explain social behavior. The lexicons used in the survey are limited due to prohibitive cost. This paper uses a fine-tuned Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) model to develop a replacement for these surveys.

Changes in data distribution, also known as concept drift, cause the existing classification models to rapidly lose their effectiveness. To assist the classifiers, we propose a novel algorithm called Label Dependency Drift Detector (LD3), an implicit (unsupervised) concept drift detector using label dependencies within the data for multi-label data streams. Our study exploits the dynamic temporal dependencies between labels using a label influence ranking method, which leverages a data fusion algorithm and uses the produced ranking to detect concept drift. LD3 is the first unsupervised concept drift detection algorithm in the multi-label classification problem area. In this study, we perform an extensive evaluation of LD3 by comparing it with 14 prevalent supervised concept drift detection algorithms that we adapt to the problem area using 12 datasets and a baseline classifier. The results show that LD3 provides between 19.8\\% and 68.6\\% better predictive performance than comparable detectors on both real-world and synthetic data streams. ",

The recent development of likelihood-informed subspace (LIS) methods offer a viable route to designing efficient MCMC methods for exploring high-dimensional posterior distributions via exploiting the intrinsic low-dimensional structure of the underlying inverse problem. However, existing LIS methods and the associated performance analysis often assume that the prior distribution is Gaussian. This assumption is limited for inverse problems aiming to promote sparsity in the parameter estimation, as heavy-tailed priors, e.g., Laplace distribution or the elastic net commonly used in Bayesian LASSO, are often needed in this case. To overcome this limitation, we consider a prior normalization technique that transforms any non-Gaussian (e.g. heavy-tailed) priors into standard Gaussian distributions, which make it possible to implement LIS methods to accelerate MCMC sampling via such transformations. We also rigorously investigate the integration of such transformations with several MCMC methods for high-dimensional problems. Finally, we demonstrate various aspects of our theoretical claims on two nonlinear inverse problems. ",

To improve this state of affairs, this work proposes efficient subgraph-level training via resource-aware graph partitioning (SUGAR). SUGAR first partitions the initial graph into a set of disjoint subgraphs and then performs local training at the subgraph-level. We provide a theoretical analysis and conduct extensive experiments on five graph benchmarks to verify its efficacy in practice. Our results show that SUGAR can achieve up to 33 times runtime speedup and 3.8 times memory reduction on large-scale graphs. We believe SUGAR opens a new research direction towards developing GNN methods that are resource-efficient, hence suitable for IoT deployment. ",

We introduce the K-Heterogeneous Markov Decision Process (K-Hetero MDP) to address sequential decision problems with population heterogeneity. We propose the Auto-Clustered Policy Evaluation (ACPE) for estimating the value of a given policy, and the Auto-Clustered Policy Iteration (ACPI) for estimating the optimal policy in a given policy class. Our auto-clustered algorithms can automatically detect and identify homogeneous sub-populations, while estimating the Q function and the optimal policy for each sub-population. We establish convergence rates and construct confidence intervals for the estimators obtained by the ACPE and ACPI. We present simulations to support our theoretical findings, and we conduct an empirical study on the standard MIMIC-III dataset. The latter analysis shows evidence of value heterogeneity and confirms the advantages of our new method. ",

    "abstract": "Despite our best efforts, deep learning models remain highly vulnerable to even tiny adversarial perturbations applied to the inputs. The ability to extract information from solely the output of a machine learning model to craft adversarial perturbations to black-box models is a practical threat against real-world systems, such as autonomous cars or machine learning models exposed as a service (MLaaS). Of particular interest are sparse attacks. The realization of sparse attacks in black-box models demonstrates that machine learning models are more vulnerable than we believe. Because these attacks aim to minimize the number of perturbed pixels measured by l_0 norm-required to mislead a model by solely observing the decision (the predicted label) returned to a model query; the so-called decision-based attack setting. But, such an attack leads to an NP-hard optimization problem. We develop an evolution-based algorithm-SparseEvo-for the problem and evaluate against both convolutional deep neural networks and vision transformers. Notably, vision transformers are yet to be investigated under a decision-based attack setting. SparseEvo requires significantly fewer model queries than the state-of-the-art sparse attack Pointwise for both untargeted and targeted attacks. The attack algorithm, although conceptually simple, is also competitive with only a limited query budget against the state-of-the-art gradient-based whitebox attacks in standard computer vision tasks such as ImageNet. Importantly, the query efficient SparseEvo, along with decision-based attacks, in general, raise new questions regarding the safety of deployed systems and poses new directions to study and understand the robustness of machine learning models.

Each hinges on an assumption about how credibility flows in different kinds of information diffusion networks: the retweet network captures the spread of misinformation among accounts, the account-source bipartite network focuses on the credibility of the sources shared by an account, and the news co-sharing network considers the similarity between content shared by different accounts. We apply or extend several network centrality and embedding algorithms to calculate account credibility. We then systematically evaluate these methods on empirical networks constructed from Twitter data. We find that some of our proposed extensions of centrality measures work well for retweet and bipartite networks. Graph embedding can be applied to retweet and co-sharing networks, where it outperforms centrality-based methods at the cost of higher complexity and lower transparency. ",

However, the amount of data needed to train models and the privacy concerns of such scenarios limit the applicability of centralized ML/DL-based approaches. Federated learning (FL) addresses these limitations by creating federated and privacy-preserving models. However, FL is vulnerable to malicious participants, and the impact of adversarial attacks on federated models detecting spectrum sensing data falsification (SSDF) attacks on spectrum sensors has not been studied. To address this challenge, the first contribution of this work is the creation of a novel dataset suitable for FL and modeling the behavior (usage of CPU, memory, or file system, among others) of resource-constrained spectrum sensors affected by different SSDF attacks. The second contribution is a pool of experiments analyzing and comparing the robustness of federated models according to i) three families of spectrum sensors, ii) eight SSDF attacks, iii) four scenarios dealing with unsupervised (anomaly detection) and supervised (binary classification) federated models, iv) up to 33% of malicious participants implementing data and model poisoning attacks, and v) four aggregation functions acting as anti-adversarial mechanisms to increase the models robustness.

We introduce \"forget-and-relearn\" as a powerful paradigm for shaping the learning trajectories of artificial neural networks. In this process, the forgetting step selectively removes undesirable information from the model, and the relearning step reinforces features that are consistently useful under different conditions. The forget-and-relearn framework unifies many existing iterative training algorithms in the image classification and language emergence literature, and allows us to understand the success of these algorithms in terms of the disproportionate forgetting of undesirable information. We leverage this understanding to improve upon existing algorithms by designing more targeted forgetting operations. Insights from our analysis provide a coherent view on the dynamics of iterative training in neural networks and offer a clear path towards performance improvements. ",

    "abstract": "Camera calibration is a crucial technique which significantly influences the performance of many robotic systems. Robustness and high precision have always been the pursuit of diverse calibration methods. State-of-the-art calibration techniques based on classical Zhang's method, however, still suffer from environmental noise, radial lens distortion and sub-optimal parameter estimation. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a hybrid camera calibration framework which combines learning-based approaches with traditional methods to handle these bottlenecks. In particular, this framework leverages learning-based approaches to perform efficient distortion correction and robust chessboard corner coordinate encoding. For sub-pixel accuracy of corner detection, a specially-designed coordinate decoding algorithm with embed outlier rejection mechanism is proposed. To avoid sub-optimal estimation results, we improve the traditional parameter estimation by RANSAC algorithm and achieve stable results. Compared with two widely-used camera calibration toolboxes, experiment results on both real and synthetic datasets manifest the better robustness and higher precision of the proposed framework. The massive synthetic dataset is the basis of our framework's decent performance and will be publicly available along with the code at https://github.com/Easonyesheng/CCS. ",

It is shown that the dynamic model of the compliant robot includes not only matched but also mismatched disturbances that act on the system through a different channel from the control input. To tackle this complex robust control problem, the unified robust motion controller is synthesised by employing a second-order Disturbance Observer (DOb), which allows us to estimate not only disturbances but also their first and second order derivatives, and a novel controller design approach in state space. By using the Brunovsky canonical form transformation and the estimations of disturbances and their first and second order derivatives, the dynamic model of the robot is reconstructed so that a new system model that includes only matched disturbances is obtained for compliant robots driven by SEAs. The robust position and force controllers are simply designed by eliminating the matched disturbances of the reconstructed system model via the conventional DOb-based robust control method. The stability and performance of the proposed robust motion controllers are verified by simulations. ",

During inference, it only takes a few RGB views (i.e., few-shot) of an unseen 3D object instance within the known category to infer the object part segmentation and the neural radiance field. Given an articulated pose as input, CLA-NeRF can perform articulation-aware volume rendering to generate the corresponding RGB image at any camera pose. Moreover, the articulated pose of an object can be estimated via inverse rendering. In our experiments, we evaluate the framework across five categories on both synthetic and real-world data. In all cases, our method shows realistic deformation results and accurate articulated pose estimation. We believe that both few-shot articulated object rendering and articulated pose estimation open doors for robots to perceive and interact with unseen articulated objects. ",

Instead, we propose leveraging large amounts of unlabeled point cloud videos by semi-supervised learning of 3D object detectors via temporal graph neural networks. Our insight is that temporal smoothing can create more accurate detection results on unlabeled data, and these smoothed detections can then be used to retrain the detector. We learn to perform this temporal reasoning with a graph neural network, where edges represent the relationship between candidate detections in different time frames. After semi-supervised learning, our method achieves state-of-the-art detection performance on the challenging nuScenes and H3D benchmarks, compared to baselines trained on the same amount of labeled data.

Pairwise comparisons corresponding to matches in a competition can naturally be construed as edges in a directed graph (digraph), whose nodes represent competitors with an unknown rank or skill strength.

Hence, we propose to augment an algorithm with neural network, in particular graph neural network (GNN) for its coherence to the problem at hand. In this paper, we introduce GNNRank, a modeling framework that is compatible with any GNN capable of learning digraph embeddings, and we devise trainable objectives to encode ranking upsets/violations. This framework includes a ranking score estimation approach, and adds a useful inductive bias by unfolding the Fiedler vector computation of the graph constructed from a learnable similarity matrix. Experimental results on a wide range of data sets show that our methods attain competitive and often superior performance compared with existing approaches. It also shows promising transfer ability to new data based on the trained GNN model. ",

At its core, VGAIfO-SO seeks to address sample inefficiency using a novel, self-supervised state observer, which provides estimates of lower-dimensional proprioceptive state representations from high-dimensional images. We show experimentally in several continuous control environments that VGAIfO-SO is more sample efficient than other IfO algorithms at learning from video-only demonstrations and can sometimes even achieve performance close to the Generative Adversarial Imitation from Observation (GAIfO) algorithm that has privileged access to the demonstrator's proprioceptive state information.

This way, we can leverage a gain in error-correcting performance using an ensemble of identical BP decoders, without increasing the worst-case decoding latency. The proposed method is demonstrated using LDPC codes from the CCSDS, 802.11n and 5G standards and produces gains of 0.2 to 0.3 dB over conventional BP decoding. ",

Therefore, such network topologies are optimized for the worst-case traffic scenarios and can't take advantage of changing demand patterns when such exist. However, recent optical switching technologies enable the concept of dynamically reconfiguring circuit-switched topologies in real-time. This capability opens the door for the design of self-adjusting networks: networks with demand-aware and dynamic topologies in which links between nodes can be established and re-adjusted online and respond to evolving traffic patterns. This paper studies a recently proposed model for optical leaf-spine reconfigurable networks. We present a novel algorithm, GreedyEgoTrees, that dynamically changes the network topology. The algorithm greedily builds ego trees for nodes in the network, where nodes cooperate to help each other, taking into account the global needs of the network. We show that GreedyEgoTrees has nice theoretical properties, outperforms other possible algorithms (like static expander and greedy dynamic matching) and can significantly improve the average path length for real DC and HPC traces.

In particular, we combine conservation of mass and momentum for an isentropic macroscopic model with a kinetic representation of the microscopic behaviour. After introducing a small scale of interest, we compute the complex stress tensor by means of Irving-Kirkwood formula. The latter requires an expansion of kinetic distribution around an equilibrium state and a successive homogenization over the fast in time and small in space scale dynamics. For a new hybrid continuum-kinetic model the results of linear stability analysis indicates a conditional stability in the relevant low-speed regimes and instability for high speed regimes for higher modes. Extensive numerical experiments confirm that the proposed multiscale model can reflect new phenomena of complex fluids not being present in standard Newtonian fluids. Consequently, the proposed general technique can be successfully used to derive new interesting systems combining the macro and micro structure of a given physical problem. ",

Many software researchers have attempted to improve sparsity through pruning, for reduction on weight storage and computation workload, while hardware architects are working on how to skip redundant computations for higher energy efciency, but there always exists overhead, causing many architectures suffering from only minor proft. Therefrom, systolic array becomes a promising candidate for the advantages of low fanout and high throughput. However, sparsity is irregular, making it tricky to ft in with the rigid systolic tempo. Thus, this paper proposed a systolic-based architecture, called Sense, for both sparse input feature map(IFM) and weight processing, achieving large performance improvement with relatively small resource and power consumption. Meanwhile, we applied channel rearrangement to gather IFMs with approximate sparsity and co-designed an adaptive weight training method to keep the sparsity ratio(zero element percentage) of each kernel at 1/2, with little accuracy loss. This treatment can effectively reduce the irregularity of sparsity and help better ft with systolic dataflow. Additionally, a dataflow called Partition Reuse is mapped to our architecture, enhancing data reuse, lowering 1.9x-2.6x DRAM access reduction compared with Eyeriss and further reducing system energy consumption. The whole design is implemented on ZynqZCU102 and performs at a peak throughput of 409.6 GOP/s, with power consumption of 11.2W; compared with previous sparse NN accelerators based on FPGA, Sense takes up 1/5 less LUTs and 3/4 less BRAMs, reaches 2.1x peak energy efciency and achieves 1.15x-1.49x speedup.

We propose a simple and direct Bayes error estimator, where we just take the mean of the labels that show \\emph{uncertainty} of the classes. Our flexible approach enables us to perform Bayes error estimation even for weakly supervised data. In contrast to others, our method is model-free and even instance-free. Moreover, it has no hyperparameters and gives a more accurate estimate of the Bayes error than classifier-based baselines. Experiments using our method suggest that a recently proposed classifier, the Vision Transformer, may have already reached the Bayes error for certain benchmark datasets. ",

They are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, where manipulated input samples fool the ASR system's recognition. While adversarial examples for various English ASR systems have already been analyzed, there exists no inter-language comparative vulnerability analysis. We compare the attackability of a German and an English ASR system, taking Deepspeech as an example. We investigate if one of the language models is more susceptible to manipulations than the other. The results of our experiments suggest statistically significant differences between English and German in terms of computational effort necessary for the successful generation of adversarial examples.

While GNNs often show remarkable performance on public datasets, they can struggle to learn long-range dependencies in the data due to over-smoothing and over-squashing tendencies. To alleviate this challenge, we propose PCAPass, a method which combines Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and message passing for generating node embeddings in an unsupervised manner and leverages gradient boosted decision trees for classification tasks. We show empirically that this approach provides competitive performance compared to popular GNNs on node classification benchmarks, while gathering information from longer distance neighborhoods.

Motivated by classical causal principles, we articulate the central question of CCR and draw parallels between human subjects in observational studies and natural languages to adopt CCR to the potential-outcomes framework, which is the first such attempt for commonsense tasks. We propose a novel framework, ROCK, to Reason O(A)bout Commonsense K(C)ausality, which utilizes temporal signals as incidental supervision, and balances confounding effects using temporal propensities that are analogous to propensity scores.

    "abstract": "Deep multi-task methods, where several tasks are learned within a single network, have recently attracted increasing attention. Burning point of this attention is their capacity to capture inter-task relationships. Current approaches either only rely on weight sharing, or add explicit dependency modelling by decomposing the task joint distribution using Bayes chain rule. If the latter strategy yields comprehensive inter-task relationships modelling, it requires imposing an arbitrary order into an unordered task set. Most importantly, this sequence ordering choice has been identified as a critical source of performance variations. In this paper, we present Multi-Order Network (MONET), a multi-task learning method with joint task order optimization. MONET uses a differentiable order selection based on soft order modelling inside Birkhoff's polytope to jointly learn task-wise recurrent modules with their optimal chaining order. Furthermore, we introduce warm up and order dropout to enhance order selection by encouraging order exploration. Experimentally, we first validate MONET capacity to retrieve the optimal order in a toy environment. Second, we use an attribute detection scenario to show that MONET outperforms existing multi-task baselines on a wide range of dependency settings. Finally, we demonstrate that MONET significantly extends state-of-the-art performance in Facial Action Unit detection. ",

Most existing methods are in the form of scene-level prediction, without returning the object classes of different keypoints. In this paper, we propose the object-centric formulation, which, beyond the conventional setting, requires further identifying which object each interest point belongs to. With such fine-grained information, our framework enables more downstream potentials, such as object-level matching and pose estimation in a clustered environment. To get around the difficulty of label collection in the real world, we develop a sim2real contrastive learning mechanism that can generalize the model trained in simulation to real-world applications. The novelties of our training method are three-fold: (i) we integrate the uncertainty into the learning framework to improve feature description of hard cases, e.g., less-textured or symmetric patches; (ii) we decouple the object descriptor into two output branches -- intra-object salience and inter-object distinctness, resulting in a better pixel-wise description; (iii) we enforce cross-view semantic consistency for enhanced robustness in representation learning. Comprehensive experiments on image matching and 6D pose estimation verify the encouraging generalization ability of our method from simulation to reality. Particularly for 6D pose estimation, our method significantly outperforms typical unsupervised/sim2real methods, achieving a closer gap with the fully supervised counterpart. ",

However, the semantical information in language instructions is usually entangled with task-specific state information, which hampers the learning of semantically invariant and reusable representations. In this paper, we propose a method to learn such representations called element randomization, which extracts task-relevant but environment-agnostic semantics from instructions using a set of environments with randomized elements, e.g., topological structures or textures, yet the same language instruction. We theoretically prove the feasibility of learning semantically invariant representations through randomization. In practice, we accordingly develop a hierarchy of policies, where a high-level policy is designed to modulate the behavior of a goal-conditioned low-level policy by proposing subgoals as semantically invariant representations. Experiments on challenging long-horizon tasks show that (1) our low-level policy reliably generalizes to tasks against environment changes; (2) our hierarchical policy exhibits extensible generalization in unseen new tasks that can be decomposed into several solvable sub-tasks; and (3) by storing and replaying language trajectories as succinct policy representations, the agent can complete tasks in a one-shot fashion, i.e., once one successful trajectory has been attained.

AI/NLP models, when trained on the racially biased dataset, AI/NLP models instigate poor model explainability, influence user experience during decision making and thus further magnifies societal biases, raising profound ethical implications for society. The motivation of the study is to investigate how AI systems imbibe bias from data and produce unexplainable discriminatory outcomes and influence an individual's articulateness of system outcome due to the presence of racial bias features in datasets. The design of the experiment involves studying the counterfactual impact of racial bias features present in language datasets and its associated effect on the model outcome. A mixed research methodology is adopted to investigate the cross implication of biased model outcome on user experience, effect on decision-making through controlled lab experimentation. The findings provide foundation support for correlating the implication of carry-over an artificial intelligence model solving NLP task due to biased concept presented in the dataset. Further, the research outcomes justify the negative influence on users' persuasiveness that leads to alter the decision-making quotient of an individual when trying to rely on the model outcome to act. The paper bridges the gap across the harm caused in establishing poor customer trustworthiness due to an inequitable system design and provides strong support for researchers, policymakers, and data scientists to build responsible AI frameworks within organizations.

Here we attempt to combine the advantages of these two directions while mitigating their drawbacks.

We use a transformer-based architecture to guide an enumerative search, and show that this reduces the number of steps that need to be explored before a rule is found. Further, we show that without training the synthesis algorithm on the specific domain, our synthesized rules achieve state-of-the-art performance on the 1-shot scenario of a task that focuses on few-shot learning for relation classification, and competitive performance in the 5-shot scenario.

One of the means of expressing the thoughts of society is social media. Determining the time intervals during which anti-vaccination increases in social media can help institutions determine the strategy to be used in combating anti-vaccination. Recording and tracking every tweet entered with human labor would be inefficient, so various automation solutions are needed. In this study, The Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) model, which is a deep learning-based natural language processing (NLP) model, was used. In a dataset of 1506 tweets divided into four different categories as news, irrelevant, anti-vaccine, and vaccine supporters, the model was trained with a learning rate of 5e-6 for 25 epochs. To determine the intervals in which anti-vaccine tweets are concentrated, the categories to which 652840 tweets belong were determined by using the trained model. The change of the determined categories overtime was visualized and the events that could cause the change were determined. As a result of model training, in the test dataset, the f-score of 0.81 and AUC values for different classes were obtained as 0.99,0.91, 0.92, 0.92, respectively. In this model, unlike the studies in the literature, an auxiliary system is designed that provides data that institutions can use when determining their strategy by measuring and visualizing the frequency of anti-vaccine tweets in a time interval, different from detecting and censoring such tweets.

For example, if word embeddings of similar words contain similar values, word similarity can be readily assessed, whereas judging that from their spelling is often impossible (e.g. cat /feline) and to predetermine and store similarities between all words is prohibitively time-consuming, memory intensive and subjective. We focus on word embeddings learned from text corpora and knowledge graphs. Several well-known algorithms learn word embeddings from text on an unsupervised basis by learning to predict those words that occur around each word, e.g. word2vec and GloVe. Parameters of such word embeddings are known to reflect word co-occurrence statistics, but how they capture semantic meaning has been unclear. Knowledge graph representation models learn representations both of entities (words, people, places, etc.) and relations between them, typically by training a model to predict known facts in a supervised manner. Despite steady improvements in fact prediction accuracy, little is understood of the latent structure that enables this. The limited understanding of how latent semantic structure is encoded in the geometry of word embeddings and knowledge graph representations makes a principled means of improving their performance, reliability or interpretability unclear. To address this: 1. we theoretically justify the empirical observation that particular geometric relationships between word embeddings learned by algorithms such as word2vec and GloVe correspond to semantic relations between words; and 2. we extend this correspondence between semantics and geometry to the entities and relations of knowledge graphs, providing a model for the latent structure of knowledge graph representation linked to that of word embeddings.

However, labeling, storing, and processing a large number of textual data points, e.g., tweets, has remained challenging. On top of that, in applications such as hate speech detection, labeling a sufficiently large dataset containing offensive content can be mentally and emotionally taxing for human annotators. Thus, NLP methods that can make the best use of significantly less labeled data points are of great interest. In this paper, we present a novel pool-based active learning method that can be used for the training of large unlabeled corpus with minimum annotation cost. For that, we propose to find the dominant sets of local clusters in the feature space. These sets represent maximally cohesive structures in the data. Then, the samples that do not belong to any of the dominant sets are selected to be used to train the model, as they represent the boundaries of the local clusters and are more challenging to classify. Our proposed method does not have any parameters to be tuned, making it dataset-independent, and it can approximately achieve the same classification accuracy as full training data, with significantly fewer data points. Additionally, our method achieves a higher performance in comparison to the state-of-the-art active learning strategies. Furthermore, our proposed algorithm is able to incorporate conventional active learning scores, such as uncertainty-based scores, into its selection criteria. We show the effectiveness of our method on different datasets and using different neural network architectures. ",

However, this result cannot explain the behavior of deep networks, since it generally does not hold if depth and width tend to infinity simultaneously. In this paper, we study the NTK of fully-connected ReLU networks with depth comparable to width. We prove that the NTK properties depend significantly on the depth-to-width ratio and the distribution of parameters at initialization. In fact, our results indicate the importance of the three phases in the hyperparameter space identified in (Poole et al., 2016): ordered, chaotic and the edge of chaos (EOC). We derive exact expressions for the NTK dispersion in the infinite-depth-and-width limit in all three phases and conclude that the NTK variability grows exponentially with depth at the EOC and in the chaotic phase but not in the ordered phase. We also show that the NTK of deep networks may stay constant during training only in the ordered phase and discuss how the structure of the NTK matrix changes during training. ",

    "abstract": "The field of social robotics will likely need to depart from a paradigm of designed behaviours and imitation learning and adopt modern reinforcement learning (RL) methods to enable robots to interact fluidly and efficaciously with humans. In this paper, we present the Social Reward Function as a mechanism to provide (1) a real-time, dense reward function necessary for the deployment of RL agents in social robotics, and (2) a standardised objective metric for comparing the efficacy of different social robots. The Social Reward Function is designed to closely mimic those genetically endowed social perception capabilities of humans in an effort to provide a simple, stable and culture-agnostic reward function. Presently, datasets used in social robotics are either small or significantly out-of-domain with respect to social robotics. The use of the Social Reward Function will allow larger in-domain datasets to be collected close to the behaviour policy of social robots, which will allow both further improvements to reward functions and to the behaviour policies of social robots. We believe this will be the key enabler to developing efficacious social robots in the future. ",

    "title": "Differentially Private Community Detection for Stochastic Block Models",
    "abstract": "The goal of community detection over graphs is to recover underlying labels/attributes of users (e.g., political affiliation) given the connectivity between users (represented by adjacency matrix of a graph). There has been significant recent progress on understanding the fundamental limits of community detection when the graph is generated from a stochastic block model (SBM). Specifically, sharp information theoretic limits and efficient algorithms have been obtained for SBMs as a function of $p$ and $q$, which represent the intra-community and inter-community connection probabilities. In this paper, we study the community detection problem while preserving the privacy of the individual connections (edges) between the vertices. Focusing on the notion of $(\\epsilon, \\delta)$-edge differential privacy (DP), we seek to understand the fundamental tradeoffs between $(p, q)$, DP budget $(\\epsilon, \\delta)$, and computational efficiency for exact recovery of the community labels. To this end, we present and analyze the associated information-theoretic tradeoffs for three broad classes of differentially private community recovery mechanisms: a) stability based mechanism; b) sampling based mechanisms; and c) graph perturbation mechanisms. Our main findings are that stability and sampling based mechanisms lead to a superior tradeoff between $(p,q)$ and the privacy budget $(\\epsilon, \\delta)$; however this comes at the expense of higher computational complexity. On the other hand, albeit low complexity, graph perturbation mechanisms require the privacy budget $\\epsilon$ to scale as $\\Omega(\\log(n))$ for exact recovery. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to study the impact of privacy constraints on the fundamental limits for community detection. ",

    "abstract": "Recommender systems typically suggest to users content similar to what they consumed in the past. If a user happens to be exposed to strongly polarized content, she might subsequently receive recommendations which may steer her towards more and more radicalized content, eventually being trapped in what we call a \"radicalization pathway\". In this paper, we study the problem of mitigating radicalization pathways using a graph-based approach. Specifically, we model the set of recommendations of a \"what-to-watch-next\" recommender as a d-regular directed graph where nodes correspond to content items, links to recommendations, and paths to possible user sessions. We measure the \"segregation\" score of a node representing radicalized content as the expected length of a random walk from that node to any node representing non-radicalized content. High segregation scores are associated to larger chances to get users trapped in radicalization pathways. Hence, we define the problem of reducing the prevalence of radicalization pathways by selecting a small number of edges to \"rewire\", so to minimize the maximum of segregation scores among all radicalized nodes, while maintaining the relevance of the recommendations. We prove that the problem of finding the optimal set of recommendations to rewire is NP-hard and NP-hard to approximate within any factor. Therefore, we turn our attention to heuristics, and propose an efficient yet effective greedy algorithm based on the absorbing random walk theory. Our experiments on real-world datasets in the context of video and news recommendations confirm the effectiveness of our proposal. ",

    "abstract": "Over the years various methods have been proposed for the problem of object detection. Recently, we have witnessed great strides in this domain owing to the emergence of powerful deep neural networks. However, there are typically two main assumptions common among these approaches. First, the model is trained on a fixed training set and is evaluated on a pre-recorded test set. Second, the model is kept frozen after the training phase, so no further updates are performed after the training is finished. These two assumptions limit the applicability of these methods to real-world settings. In this paper, we propose Interactron, a method for adaptive object detection in an interactive setting, where the goal is to perform object detection in images observed by an embodied agent navigating in different environments. Our idea is to continue training during inference and adapt the model at test time without any explicit supervision via interacting with the environment. Our adaptive object detection model provides a 11.8 point improvement in AP (and 19.1 points in AP50) over DETR, a recent, high-performance object detector. Moreover, we show that our object detection model adapts to environments with completely different appearance characteristics, and its performance is on par with a model trained with full supervision for those environments.

Two methods for finding flat minima stand out: 1. Averaging methods (i.e., Stochastic Weight Averaging, SWA), and 2. Minimax methods (i.e., Sharpness Aware Minimization, SAM). However, despite similar motivations, there has been limited investigation into their properties and no comprehensive comparison between them. In this work, we investigate the loss surfaces from a systematic benchmarking of these approaches across computer vision, natural language processing, and graph learning tasks. This leads us to a hypothesis: since both approaches find flat solutions in orthogonal ways, combining them should improve generalization even further. We verify this improves over either flat-minima approach in 39 out of 42 cases. When it does not, we provide potential explanations. We hope our results across image, graph, and text data will help researchers to improve deep learning optimizers, and practitioners to pinpoint the optimizer for the problem at hand. ",

Despite the publication of many research papers reporting CPI predictors in the recent years, we have observed a number of fundamental issues in experiment design that lead to over optimistic estimates of model performance. Results: In this paper, we analyze the impact of several important factors affecting generalization perfor-mance of CPI predictors that are overlooked in existing work: 1. Similarity between training and test examples in cross-validation 2. The strategy for generating negative examples, in the absence of experimentally verified negative examples. 3. Choice of evaluation protocols and performance metrics and their alignment with real-world use of CPI predictors in screening large compound libraries. Using both an existing state-of-the-art method (CPI-NN) and a proposed kernel based approach, we have found that assessment of predictive performance of CPI predictors requires careful con-trol over similarity between training and test examples. We also show that random pairing for gen-erating synthetic negative examples for training and performance evaluation results in models with better generalization performance in comparison to more sophisticated strategies used in existing studies. Furthermore, we have found that our kernel based approach, despite its simple design, exceeds the prediction performance of CPI-NN. We have used the proposed model for compound screening of several proteins including SARS-CoV-2 Spike and Human ACE2 proteins and found strong evidence in support of its top hits.

    "abstract": "Airway segmentation is critical for virtual bronchoscopy and computer-aided pulmonary disease analysis. In recent years, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been widely used to delineate the bronchial tree. However, the segmentation results of the CNN-based methods usually include many discontinuous branches, which need manual repair in clinical use. A major reason for the breakages is that the appearance of the airway wall can be affected by the lung disease as well as the adjacency of the vessels, while the network tends to overfit to these special patterns in the training set. To learn robust features for these areas, we design a multi-branch framework that adopts the geodesic distance transform to capture the intensity changes between airway lumen and wall. Another reason for the breakages is the intra-class imbalance. Since the volume of the peripheral bronchi may be much smaller than the large branches in an input patch, the common segmentation loss is not sensitive to the breakages among the distal branches. Therefore, in this paper, a breakage-sensitive regularization term is designed and can be easily combined with other loss functions. Extensive experiments are conducted on publicly available datasets. Compared with state-of-the-art methods, our framework can detect more branches while maintaining competitive segmentation performance. ",

    "abstract": "The characterization of an exoplanet's interior is an inverse problem, which requires statistical methods such as Bayesian inference in order to be solved. Current methods employ Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling to infer the posterior probability of planetary structure parameters for a given exoplanet. These methods are time consuming since they require the calculation of a large number of planetary structure models. To speed up the inference process when characterizing an exoplanet, we propose to use conditional invertible neural networks (cINNs) to calculate the posterior probability of the internal structure parameters. cINNs are a special type of neural network which excel in solving inverse problems. We constructed a cINN using FrEIA, which was then trained on a database of $5.6\\cdot 10^6$ internal structure models to recover the inverse mapping between internal structure parameters and observable features (i.e., planetary mass, planetary radius and composition of the host star). The cINN method was compared to a Metropolis-Hastings MCMC. For that we repeated the characterization of the exoplanet K2-111 b, using both the MCMC method and the trained cINN. We show that the inferred posterior probability of the internal structure parameters from both methods are very similar, with the biggest differences seen in the exoplanet's water content. Thus cINNs are a possible alternative to the standard time-consuming sampling methods. Indeed, using cINNs allows for orders of magnitude faster inference of an exoplanet's composition than what is possible using an MCMC method, however, it still requires the computation of a large database of internal structures to train the cINN. Since this database is only computed once, we found that using a cINN is more efficient than an MCMC, when more than 10 exoplanets are characterized using the same cINN. ",

The process we model is complex, with a progression from initial void nucleation, to saturation, and ultimately failure. The objective of predicting failure locations presents an extreme case of class imbalance since most of the material in the specimens do not fail. In response to this challenge, we develop and demonstrate the effectiveness of data- and loss-based regularization methods. Since there is considerable sensitivity of the failure location to the particular configuration of voids, we also use variational inference to provide uncertainties for the neural network predictions. We connect the deterministic and Bayesian convolutional neural networks at a theoretical level to explain how variational inference regularizes the training and predictions. We demonstrate that the resulting predicted variances are effective in ranking the locations that are most likely to fail in any given specimen. ",

We model the problem as a bi-level optimization problem. In the inner level, given a tentative travel demand, we solve a dynamic traffic assignment problem to decide the routing of the users between their origins and destinations. In the outer level, we adjust the number of trips and their origins and destinations, aiming at minimizing the discrepancy between the consequent counters generated in the inner level and the given vehicle counts measured by sensors in the traffic network. We solve the dynamic traffic assignment problem employing a mesoscopic model implemented by the traffic simulator SUMO. Thus, the outer problem becomes an optimization problem that minimizes a black-box objective function determined by the results of the simulation, which is a costly computation. We study different approaches to the outer level problem categorized as gradient-based and derivative-free approaches. Among the gradient-based approaches, we study an assignment matrix-based approach and an assignment matrix-free approach that uses the Simultaneous Perturbation Stochastic Approximation (SPSA) algorithm. Among the derivative-free approaches, we study machine learning algorithms to learn a model of the simulator that can then be used as a surrogated objective function in the optimization problem. We compare these approaches computationally on an artificial network. The gradient-based approaches perform the best in terms of archived solution quality and computational requirements, while the results obtained by the machine learning approach are currently less satisfactory but provide an interesting avenue of future research.

We designed the ISNet for high flexibility and performance: it allows virtually any classification neural network architecture to analyze a common image as if it had been previously segmented. Furthermore, in relation to the original classifier, the ISNet does not cause any increment in computational cost or architectural changes at run-time. To accomplish this, we introduce the concept of optimizing DNNs for relevance segmentation in heatmaps created by Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP), which proves to be equivalent to the classification of previously segmented images. We apply an ISNet based on a DenseNet121 classifier to solve the task of COVID-19 detection in chest X-rays. We compare the model to a U-net (performing lung segmentation) followed by a DenseNet121, and to a standalone DenseNet121. Due to the implicit segmentation, the ISNet precisely ignored the X-ray regions outside of the lungs; it achieved 94.5 +/-4.1% mean accuracy with an external database, showing strong generalization capability and surpassing the other models' performances by 6 to 7.9%. ISNet presents a fast and light methodology to perform classification preceded by segmentation, while also being more accurate than standard pipelines. ",

    "abstract": "Despite the non-convex optimization landscape, over-parametrized shallow networks are able to achieve global convergence under gradient descent. The picture can be radically different for narrow networks, which tend to get stuck in badly-generalizing local minima. Here we investigate the cross-over between these two regimes in the high-dimensional setting, and in particular investigate the connection between the so-called mean-field/hydrodynamic regime and the seminal approach of Saad & Solla. Focusing on the case of Gaussian data, we study the interplay between the learning rate, the time scale, and the number of hidden units in the high-dimensional dynamics of stochastic gradient descent (SGD). Our work builds on a deterministic description of SGD in high-dimensions from statistical physics, which we extend and for which we provide rigorous convergence rates. ",

We tackle Limited Angle Tomography by completing the set of acquisitions using a generative model and prior-knowledge about the scanned object. Using a Generative Adversarial Network as model and Computer-Assisted Design data as shape prior, we demonstrate a quantitative and qualitative advantage of our technique over other state-of-the-art methods. Inferring a substantial number of consecutive missing measurements, we offer an alternative to other image inpainting techniques that fall short of providing a satisfying answer to our research question: can X-Ray exposition be reduced by using generative models to infer lacking measurements?

    "abstract": "Signal-background classification is a central problem in High-Energy Physics, that plays a major role for the discovery of new fundamental particles. A recent method -- the Parametric Neural Network (pNN) -- leverages multiple signal mass hypotheses as an additional input feature to effectively replace a whole set of individual classifier, each providing (in principle) the best response for a single mass hypothesis. In this work we aim at deepening the understanding of pNNs in light of real-world usage. We discovered several peculiarities of parametric networks, providing intuition, metrics, and guidelines to them. We further propose an alternative parametrization scheme, resulting in a new parametrized neural network architecture: the AffinePNN; along with many other generally applicable improvements. Finally, we extensively evaluate our models on the HEPMASS dataset, along its imbalanced version (called HEPMASS-IMB) we provide here for the first time to further validate our approach. Provided results are in terms of the impact of the proposed design decisions, classification performance, and interpolation capability as well. ",

Here we introduce a new computational paradigm based on Group Equivariant Non-Expansive Operators, that can be regarded as the product of a rising mathematical theory of information-processing observers. This approach, that can be adjusted to different situations, may have many advantages over other common tools, like Neural Networks, such as: knowledge injection and information engineering, selection of relevant features, small number of parameters and higher transparency. We chose to test our method, called GENEOnet, on a key problem in drug design: detecting pockets on the surface of proteins that can host ligands. Experimental results confirmed that our method works well even with a quite small training set, providing thus a great computational advantage, while the final comparison with other state-of-the-art methods shows that GENEOnet provides better or comparable results in terms of accuracy.

By using Optimal Transport, we augment the ECG disease data from normal ECG beats to balance the data among different categories. We build a Multi-Feature Transformer (MF-Transformer) as our classification model, where different features are extracted from both time and frequency domains to diagnose various heart conditions. Learning from 12-lead ECG signals, our model is able to distinguish five categories of cardiac conditions. Our results demonstrate 1) the classification models' ability to make competitive predictions on five ECG categories; 2) improvements in accuracy and robustness reflecting the effectiveness of our data augmentation method.

    "abstract": "Guided wave testing is a popular approach for monitoring the structural integrity of infrastructures. We focus on the primary task of damage detection, where signal processing techniques are commonly employed. The detection performance is affected by a mismatch between the wave propagation model and experimental wave data. External variations, such as temperature, which are difficult to model, also affect the performance. While deep learning models can be an alternative detection method, there is often a lack of real-world training datasets. In this work, we counter this challenge by training an ensemble of variational autoencoders only on simulation data with a wave physics-guided adversarial component. We set up an experiment with non-uniform temperature variations to test the robustness of the methods. We compare our scheme with existing deep learning detection schemes and observe superior performance on experimental data. ",
