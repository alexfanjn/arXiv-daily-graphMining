    "abstract": "Deep-learning-based intelligent services have become prevalent in cyber-physical applications including smart cities and health-care. Collaborative end-edge-cloud computing for deep learning provides a range of performance and efficiency that can address application requirements through computation offloading. The decision to offload computation is a communication-computation co-optimization problem that varies with both system parameters (e.g., network condition) and workload characteristics (e.g., inputs). Identifying optimal orchestration considering the cross-layer opportunities and requirements in the face of varying system dynamics is a challenging multi-dimensional problem. While Reinforcement Learning (RL) approaches have been proposed earlier, they suffer from a large number of trial-and-errors during the learning process resulting in excessive time and resource consumption. We present a Hybrid Learning orchestration framework that reduces the number of interactions with the system environment by combining model-based and model-free reinforcement learning. Our Deep Learning inference orchestration strategy employs reinforcement learning to find the optimal orchestration policy. Furthermore, we deploy Hybrid Learning (HL) to accelerate the RL learning process and reduce the number of direct samplings. We demonstrate efficacy of our HL strategy through experimental comparison with state-of-the-art RL-based inference orchestration, demonstrating that our HL strategy accelerates the learning process by up to 166.6x.

    "abstract": "Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) is a weakly supervised learning problem where the aim is to assign labels to sets or bags of instances, as opposed to traditional supervised learning where each instance is assumed to be independent and identically distributed (IID) and is to be labeled individually. Recent work has shown promising results for neural network models in the MIL setting. Instead of focusing on each instance, these models are trained in an end-to-end fashion to learn effective bag-level representations by suitably combining permutation invariant pooling techniques with neural architectures. In this paper, we consider modelling the interactions between bags using a graph and employ Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to facilitate end-to-end learning. Since a meaningful graph representing dependencies between bags is rarely available, we propose to use a Bayesian GNN framework that can generate a likely graph structure for scenarios where there is uncertainty in the graph or when no graph is available. Empirical results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed technique for several MIL benchmark tasks and a distribution regression task. ",

    "abstract": "Introduction: Active commuting has been recommended as a method to increase population physical activity, but evidence is mixed. Social norms related to travel behaviour may influence the uptake of active commuting interventions but are rarely considered in the design and evaluation of interventions. Methods: We developed an agent-based model that incorporates social norms related to travel behaviour and demonstrate the utility of this through implementing car-free Wednesdays. A synthetic population of Waltham Forest, London, UK was generated using a microsimulation approach with data from the UK Census 2011 and UK HLS datasets. An agent-based model was created using this synthetic population which modelled how the actions of peers and neighbours, subculture, habit, weather, bicycle ownership, car ownership, environmental supportiveness, and congestion affect the decision to travel between four modes: walking, cycling, driving, and taking public transport. Results: In the control scenario, the odds of active travel were plausible at 0.091 (89% HPDI: [0.091, 0.091]). Compared to the control scenario, the odds of active travel were increased by 70.3% (89% HPDI: [70.3%, 70.3%]), in the intervention scenario, on non-car-free days; the effect of the intervention is sustained to non-car-free days. Discussion: While these results demonstrate the utility of our agent-based model, rather than aim to make accurate predictions, they do suggest that by there being a 'nudge' of car-free days, there may be a sustained change in active commuting behaviour. The model is a useful tool for investigating the effect of how social networks and social norms influence the effectiveness of various interventions. If configured using real-world built environment data, it may be useful for investigating how social norms interact with the built environment to cause the emergence of commuting conventions. ",

We focus on performing activity detection via subspace methods under a setup where the data and pilot spreading signatures are of different lengths, and consider a realistic frame-structure similar to existing mobile networks. We investigate the impact of channel correlation on the activity detection performance; first, we consider the case where the channel exhibits high correlation in time and frequency and show how it can heavily deteriorate the performance. To tackle that, we propose to apply user-specific masking sequences overlaid on top of the pilot signatures. Second, we consider the other extreme with the channel being highly selective, and show that it can also negatively impact the performance. We investigate possible pilots' reallocation strategies that can help reduce its impact. ",

The hippocampal-entorhinal complex is thought to support domain-general representation and processing of structural knowledge of arbitrary state, feature and concept spaces. In particular, it enables the formation of cognitive maps, and navigation on these maps, thereby broadly contributing to cognition. It has been proposed that the concept of multi-scale successor representations provides an explanation of the underlying computations performed by place and grid cells. Here, we present a neural network based approach to learn such representations, and its application to different scenarios: a spatial exploration task based on supervised learning, a spatial navigation task based on reinforcement learning, and a non-spatial task where linguistic constructions have to be inferred by observing sample sentences. In all scenarios, the neural network correctly learns and approximates the underlying structure by building successor representations. Furthermore, the resulting neural firing patterns are strikingly similar to experimentally observed place and grid cell firing patterns. We conclude that cognitive maps and neural network-based successor representations of structured knowledge provide a promising way to overcome some of the short comings of deep learning towards artificial general intelligence.

However, FL is susceptible to backdoor attacks where a small fraction of malicious agents inject a targeted misclassification behavior in the global model by uploading polluted model updates to the server. In this work, we propose DifFense, an automated defense framework to protect an FL system from backdoor attacks by leveraging differential testing and two-step MAD outlier detection, without requiring any previous knowledge of attack scenarios or direct access to local model parameters. We empirically show that our detection method prevents a various number of potential attackers while consistently achieving the convergence of the global model comparable to that trained under federated averaging (FedAvg). We further corroborate the effectiveness and generalizability of our method against prior defense techniques, such as Multi-Krum and coordinate-wise median aggregation. Our detection method reduces the average backdoor accuracy of the global model to below 4% and achieves a false negative rate of zero. ",

    "abstract": "Deep neural networks (DNNs) are increasingly being used in a variety of traditional radiofrequency (RF) problems. Previous work has shown that while DNN classifiers are typically more accurate than traditional signal processing algorithms, they are vulnerable to intentionally crafted adversarial perturbations which can deceive the DNN classifiers and significantly reduce their accuracy. Such intentional adversarial perturbations can be used by RF communications systems to avoid reactive-jammers and interception systems which rely on DNN classifiers to identify their target modulation scheme. While previous research on RF adversarial perturbations has established the theoretical feasibility of such attacks using simulation studies, critical questions concerning real-world implementation and viability remain unanswered. This work attempts to bridge this gap by defining class-specific and sample-independent adversarial perturbations which are shown to be effective yet computationally feasible in real-time and time-invariant. We demonstrate the effectiveness of these attacks over-the-air across a physical channel using software-defined radios (SDRs). Finally, we demonstrate that these adversarial perturbations can be emitted from a source other than the communications device, making these attacks practical for devices that cannot manipulate their transmitted signals at the physical layer.

This paper is the first to consider indiscriminate data poisoning attacks on contrastive learning, demonstrating the feasibility of such attacks, and their differences from indiscriminate poisoning of supervised learning. We also highlight differences between contrastive learning algorithms, and show that some algorithms (e.g., SimCLR) are more vulnerable than others (e.g., MoCo). We differentiate between two types of data poisoning attacks: sample-wise attacks, which add specific noise to each image, cause the largest drop in accuracy, but do not transfer well across SimCLR, MoCo, and BYOL. In contrast, attacks that use class-wise noise, though cause a smaller drop in accuracy, transfer well across different CL algorithms. Finally, we show that a new data augmentation based on matrix completion can be highly effective in countering data poisoning attacks on unsupervised contrastive learning. ",

    "title": "Label-Smoothed Backdoor Attack",
    "abstract": "By injecting a small number of poisoned samples into the training set, backdoor attacks aim to make the victim model produce designed outputs on any input injected with pre-designed backdoors. In order to achieve a high attack success rate using as few poisoned training samples as possible, most existing attack methods change the labels of the poisoned samples to the target class. This practice often results in severe over-fitting of the victim model over the backdoors, making the attack quite effective in output control but easier to be identified by human inspection or automatic defense algorithms. In this work, we proposed a label-smoothing strategy to overcome the over-fitting problem of these attack methods, obtaining a \\textit{Label-Smoothed Backdoor Attack} (LSBA). In the LSBA, the label of the poisoned sample $\\bm{x}$ will be changed to the target class with a probability of $p_n(\\bm{x})$ instead of 100\\%, and the value of $p_n(\\bm{x})$ is specifically designed to make the prediction probability the target class be only slightly greater than those of the other classes. Empirical studies on several existing backdoor attacks show that our strategy can considerably improve the stealthiness of these attacks and, at the same time, achieve a high attack success rate. In addition, our strategy makes it able to manually control the prediction probability of the design output through manipulating the applied and activated number of LSBAs\\footnote{Source code will be published at \\url{https://github.com/v-mipeng/LabelSmoothedAttack.git}}.

    "abstract": "In 5G and beyond, the newly emerging services, such as edge computing/intelligence services, may demand the provision of heterogeneous communications, computing, and storage (CCS) resources on and across network entities multihop apart. In such cases, traditional resource-oriented auction schemes, where buyers place bids on resources, may not be effective in providing end-to-end (E2E) quality-of-service (QoS) guarantees. To overcome these limitations, in this article, we coin the concept of E2E service auction where the auction commodities are E2E services rather than certain resource. Under this framework, buyers simply bid for services with E2E QoS requirements without having to know the inner working (which resources are behind). To guarantee E2E QoS for winning bids while ensuring essential economic properties, E2E service auction requires addressing the joint problem of network optimization and auction design with both economical and QoS constraints. To substantiate the mechanism design, we illustrate how to devise E2E service auctions for edge computing systems under various scenarios. We also identify the research opportunities on E2E service auction mechanism design for other critical use cases, including edge intelligence. ",

In contrast, we propose an end-to-end trainable architecture based on Detection using Transformers (DETR), that outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods in arbitrary-shaped text detection. At its core, our proposed method leverages a bounding box loss function that accurately measures the arbitrary detected text regions' changes in scale and aspect ratio. This is possible due to a hybrid shape representation made from Bezier curves, that are further split into piece-wise polygons. The proposed loss function is then a combination of a generalized-split-intersection-over-union loss defined over the piece-wise polygons and regularized by a Smooth-$\\ln$ regression over the Bezier curve's control points. We evaluate our proposed model using Total-Text and CTW-1500 datasets for curved text, and MSRA-TD500 and ICDAR15 datasets for multi-oriented text, and show that the proposed method outperforms the previous state-of-the-art methods in arbitrary-shape text detection tasks.

    "abstract": "Out-of-distribution detection is an important capability that has long eluded vanilla neural networks. Deep Neural networks (DNNs) tend to generate over-confident predictions when presented with inputs that are significantly out-of-distribution (OOD). This can be dangerous when employing machine learning systems in the wild as detecting attacks can thus be difficult. Recent advances inference-time out-of-distribution detection help mitigate some of these problems. However, existing methods can be restrictive as they are often computationally expensive. Additionally, these methods require training of a downstream detector model which learns to detect OOD inputs from in-distribution ones. This, therefore, adds latency during inference. Here, we offer an information theoretic perspective on why neural networks are inherently incapable of OOD detection. We attempt to mitigate these flaws by converting a trained model into a an OOD detector using a handful of steps of gradient descent. Our work can be employed as a post-processing method whereby an inference-time ML system can convert a trained model into an OOD detector. Experimentally, we show how our method consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art in detection accuracy on popular image datasets while also reducing computational complexity. ",

To achieve this, automated vehicles are now equipped with multiple sensors (e.g., camera, Lidar, etc.), enabling them to exploit complementary environmental context by fusing data from different sensing modalities. With the success of Deep Convolutional Neural Network(DCNN), the fusion between DCNNs has been proved as a promising strategy to achieve satisfactory perception accuracy. However, mainstream existing DCNN fusion schemes conduct fusion by directly element-wisely adding feature maps extracted from different modalities together at various stages, failing to consider whether the features being fused are matched or not. Therefore, we first propose a feature disparity metric to quantitatively measure the degree of feature disparity between the feature maps being fused. We then propose Fusion-filter as a feature-matching techniques to tackle the feature-mismatching issue. We also propose a Layer-sharing technique in the deep layer that can achieve better accuracy with less computational overhead. Together with the help of the feature disparity to be an additional loss, our proposed technologies enable DCNN to learn corresponding feature maps with similar characteristics and complementary visual context from different modalities to achieve better accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed fusion technique can achieve better accuracy on KITTI dataset with less computational resources demand. ",

Firstly, the gap between the low-level vision task represented by rain removal and the high-level vision task represented by object detection is significant, and the low-level vision task can hardly contribute to the high-level vision task. Secondly, the quality of the deraining dataset needs to be improved. In fact, the rain lines in many baselines have a large gap with the real rain lines, and the resolution of the deraining dataset images is generally not ideally. Meanwhile, there are few common datasets for both the low-level vision task and the high-level vision task. In this paper, we explore the combination of the low-level vision task with the high-level vision task. Specifically, we propose an end-to-end object detection network for reducing the impact of rainfall, which consists of two cascaded networks, an improved image deraining network and an object detection network, respectively. We also design the components of the loss function to accommodate the characteristics of the different sub-networks. We then propose a dataset based on the KITTI dataset for rainfall removal and object detection, on which our network surpasses the state-of-the-art with a significant improvement in metrics. Besides, our proposed network is measured on driving videos collected by self-driving vehicles and shows positive results for rain removal and object detection. ",

Neural GARCH is a neural network adaptation of the GARCH 1,1 model in the univariate case, and the diagonal BEKK 1,1 model in the multivariate case. We allow the coefficients of a GARCH model to be time varying in order to reflect the constantly changing dynamics of financial markets. The time varying coefficients are parameterised by a recurrent neural network that is trained with stochastic gradient variational Bayes. We propose two variants of our model, one with normal innovations and the other with Students t innovations.

Granger causality is a popular framework to infer potential causal mechanisms between different time series. The original definition of Granger causality is restricted to linear processes and leads to spurious conclusions in the presence of a latent confounder. In this work, we harness the expressive power of recurrent neural networks and propose a deep learning-based approach to model non-linear Granger causality by directly accounting for latent confounders. Our approach leverages multiple recurrent neural networks to parameterise predictive distributions and we propose the novel use of a dual-decoder setup to conduct the Granger tests.

This increases the importance of robust training of 3D models in the face of adversarial attacks. Based on our analysis on the performance of existing adversarial attacks, more adversarial perturbations are found in the mid and high-frequency components of input data. Therefore, by suppressing the high-frequency content in the training phase, the models robustness against adversarial examples is improved. Experiments showed that the proposed defense method decreases the success rate of six attacks on PointNet, PointNet++ ,, and DGCNN models. In particular, improvements are achieved with an average increase of classification accuracy by 3.8 % on drop100 attack and 4.26 % on drop200 attack compared to the state-of-the-art methods.

The trained GCN model was able to achieve 88.5% classification accuracy on the test set i.e., it was able to find the correct matching part from the dataset of 866 parts despite significant variation from the baseline part.

This directed the efforts to developing many state-of-the-art systems, creating challenging datasets, and introducing rigorous metrics to measure SLAM system performance. However, the link between datasets and performance in the robustness/resilience context has rarely been explored. In order to fill this void, characterization the operating conditions of SLAM systems is essential in order to provide an environment for quantitative measurement of robustness and resilience. In this paper, we argue that for proper evaluation of SLAM performance, the characterization of SLAM datasets serves as a critical first step. The study starts by reviewing previous efforts for quantitative characterization of SLAM datasets. Then, the problem of perturbations characterization is discussed and the linkage to SLAM robustness/resilience is established. After that, we propose a novel, generic and extendable framework for quantitative analysis and comparison of SLAM datasets. Additionally, a description of different characterization parameters is provided. Finally, we demonstrate the application of our framework by presenting the characterization results of three SLAM datasets: KITTI, EuroC-MAV, and TUM-VI highlighting the level of insights achieved by the proposed framework.

Fairness concerns gradually emerge in many applications, such as face recognition and mobile medical. One fundamental question arises: what will be the fairest neural architecture for edge devices? By examining the existing neural networks, we observe that larger networks typically are fairer. But, edge devices call for smaller neural architectures to meet hardware specifications. To address this challenge, this work proposes a novel Fairness- and Hardware-aware Neural architecture search framework, namely FaHaNa. Coupled with a model freezing approach, FaHaNa can efficiently search for neural networks with balanced fairness and accuracy, while guaranteed to meet hardware specifications. Results show that FaHaNa can identify a series of neural networks with higher fairness and accuracy on a dermatology dataset. Target edge devices, FaHaNa finds a neural architecture with slightly higher accuracy, 5.28x smaller size, 15.14% higher fairness score, compared with MobileNetV2; meanwhile, on Raspberry PI and Odroid XU-4, it achieves 5.75x and 5.79x speedup.

    "abstract": "Accurate recommendation and reliable explanation are two key issues for modern recommender systems. However, most recommendation benchmarks only concern the prediction of user-item ratings while omitting the underlying causes behind the ratings. For example, the widely-used Yahoo!R3 dataset contains little information on the causes of the user-movie ratings. A solution could be to conduct surveys and require the users to provide such information. In practice, the user surveys can hardly avoid compliance issues and sparse user responses, which greatly hinders the exploration of causality-based recommendation. To better support the studies of causal inference and further explanations in recommender systems, we propose a novel semi-synthetic data generation framework for recommender systems where causal graphical models with missingness are employed to describe the causal mechanism of practical recommendation scenarios. To illustrate the use of our framework, we construct a semi-synthetic dataset with Causal Tags And Ratings (CTAR), based on the movies as well as their descriptive tags and rating information collected from a famous movie rating website. Using the collected data and the causal graph, the user-item-ratings and their corresponding user-item-tags are automatically generated, which provides the reasons (selected tags) why the user rates the items. Descriptive statistics and baseline results regarding the CTAR dataset are also reported. The proposed data generation framework is not limited to recommendation, and the released APIs can be used to generate customized datasets for other research tasks. ",

Therefore, anomaly detection in citation networks is of significant importance to identify manipulation and inflation of citations. To address this open issue, we propose a novel deep graph learning model, namely GLAD (Graph Learning for Anomaly Detection), to identify anomalies in citation networks. GLAD incorporates text semantic mining to network representation learning by adding both node attributes and link attributes via graph neural networks. It exploits not only the relevance of citation contents but also hidden relationships between papers. Within the GLAD framework, we propose an algorithm called CPU (Citation PUrpose) to discover the purpose of citation based on citation texts. The performance of GLAD is validated through a simulated anomalous citation dataset. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of GLAD on the anomalous citation detection task. ",

Previous approaches achieve improvement by fusing the modalities of the skeleton sequence and RGB video. However, such methods have a dilemma between the accuracy and efficiency for the high complexity of the RGB video network. To solve the problem, we propose a multi-modality feature fusion network to combine the modalities of the skeleton sequence and RGB frame instead of the RGB video, as the key information contained by the combination of skeleton sequence and RGB frame is close to that of the skeleton sequence and RGB video. In this way, the complementary information is retained while the complexity is reduced by a large margin. To better explore the correspondence of the two modalities, a two-stage fusion framework is introduced in the network. In the early fusion stage, we introduce a skeleton attention module that projects the skeleton sequence on the single RGB frame to help the RGB frame focus on the limb movement regions. In the late fusion stage, we propose a cross-attention module to fuse the skeleton feature and the RGB feature by exploiting the correlation. Experiments on two benchmarks NTU RGB+D and SYSU show that the proposed model achieves competitive performance compared with the state-of-the-art methods while reduces the complexity of the network.

Existing approaches to improve traffic flow, widely known as automatic intersection management systems, are mostly based on non-learning reservation schemes or optimization algorithms. Machine learning-based techniques show promising results in planning for a single ego vehicle. This work proposes to leverage machine learning algorithms to optimize traffic flow at urban intersections by jointly planning for multiple vehicles. Learning-based behavior planning poses several challenges, demanding for a suited input and output representation as well as large amounts of ground-truth data. We address the former issue by using a flexible graph-based input representation accompanied by a graph neural network. This allows to efficiently encode the scene and inherently provide individual outputs for all involved vehicles. To learn a sensible policy, without relying on the imitation of expert demonstrations, the cooperative planning task is phrased as a reinforcement learning problem. We train and evaluate the proposed method in an open-source simulation environment for decision making in automated driving. Compared to a first-in-first-out scheme and traffic governed by static priority rules, the learned planner shows a significant gain in flow rate, while reducing the number of induced stops. In addition to synthetic simulations, the approach is also evaluated based on real-world traffic data taken from the publicly available inD dataset. ",

However, the majority of such methods are developed under the assumption that a large amount of labelled training examples is available for all concepts-of-interest. Robots, on the other hand, operate in constantly changing unstructured environments, and need to adapt to novel action categories from very few samples. Methods for data-efficient recognition from body poses increasingly leverage skeleton sequences structured as image-like arrays and then used as input to convolutional neural networks. We look at this paradigm from the perspective of transformer networks, for the first time exploring visual transformers as data-efficient encoders of skeleton movement. In our pipeline, body pose sequences cast as image-like representations are converted into patch embeddings and then passed to a visual transformer backbone optimized with deep metric learning. Inspired by recent success of feature enhancement methods in semi-supervised learning, we further introduce ProFormer -- an improved training strategy which uses soft-attention applied on iteratively estimated action category prototypes used to augment the embeddings and compute an auxiliary consistency loss. Extensive experiments consistently demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach for one-shot recognition from body poses, achieving state-of-the-art results on multiple datasets and surpassing the best published approach on the challenging NTU-120 one-shot benchmark by 1.84%.

    "title": "Multi-view Intent Disentangle Graph Networks for Bundle Recommendation",
    "abstract": "Bundle recommendation aims to recommend the user a bundle of items as a whole. Nevertheless, they usually neglect the diversity of the user's intents on adopting items and fail to disentangle the user's intents in representations. In the real scenario of bundle recommendation, a user's intent may be naturally distributed in the different bundles of that user (Global view), while a bundle may contain multiple intents of a user (Local view). Each view has its advantages for intent disentangling: 1) From the global view, more items are involved to present each intent, which can demonstrate the user's preference under each intent more clearly. 2) From the local view, it can reveal the association among items under each intent since items within the same bundle are highly correlated to each other. To this end, we propose a novel model named Multi-view Intent Disentangle Graph Networks (MIDGN), which is capable of precisely and comprehensively capturing the diversity of the user's intent and items' associations at the finer granularity. Specifically, MIDGN disentangles the user's intents from two different perspectives, respectively: 1) In the global level, MIDGN disentangles the user's intent coupled with inter-bundle items; 2) In the Local level, MIDGN disentangles the user's intent coupled with items within each bundle. Meanwhile, we compare the user's intents disentangled from different views under the contrast learning framework to improve the learned intents. Extensive experiments conducted on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that MIDGN outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by over 10.7% and 26.8%, respectively. ",

    "abstract": "Due to the availability of multi-modal remote sensing (RS) image archives, one of the most important research topics is the development of cross-modal RS image retrieval (CM-RSIR) methods that search semantically similar images across different modalities. Existing CM-RSIR methods require annotated training images (which is time-consuming, costly and not feasible to gather in large-scale applications) and do not concurrently address intra- and inter-modal similarity preservation and inter-modal discrepancy elimination. In this paper, we introduce a novel self-supervised cross-modal image retrieval method that aims to: i) model mutual-information between different modalities in a self-supervised manner; ii) retain the distributions of modal-specific feature spaces similar; and iii) define most similar images within each modality without requiring any annotated training images. To this end, we propose a novel objective including three loss functions that simultaneously: i) maximize mutual information of different modalities for inter-modal similarity preservation; ii) minimize the angular distance of multi-modal image tuples for the elimination of inter-modal discrepancies; and iii) increase cosine similarity of most similar images within each modality for the characterization of intra-modal similarities. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed method compared to state-of-the-art methods.

    "abstract": "Ego-pose estimation and dynamic object tracking are two key issues in an autonomous driving system. Two assumptions are often made for them, i.e. the static world assumption of simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) and the exact ego-pose assumption of object tracking, respectively. However, these assumptions are difficult to hold in highly dynamic road scenarios where SLAM and object tracking become correlated and mutually beneficial. In this paper, DL-SLOT, a dynamic Lidar SLAM and object tracking method is proposed. This method integrates the state estimations of both the ego vehicle and the static and dynamic objects in the environment into a unified optimization framework, to realize SLAM and object tracking (SLOT) simultaneously. Firstly, we implement object detection to remove all the points that belong to potential dynamic objects. Then, LiDAR odometry is conducted using the filtered point cloud. At the same time, detected objects are associated with the history object trajectories based on the time-series information in a sliding window. The states of the static and dynamic objects and ego vehicle in the sliding window are integrated into a unified local optimization framework. We perform SLAM and object tracking simultaneously in this framework, which significantly improves the robustness and accuracy of SLAM in highly dynamic road scenarios and the accuracy of objects' states estimation. Experiments on public datasets have shown that our method achieves better accuracy than A-LOAM. ",

    "abstract": "The Dynamic Mode Decomposition has proved to be a very efficient technique to study dynamic data. This is entirely a data-driven approach that extracts all necessary information from data snapshots which are commonly supposed to be sampled from measurement. The application of this approach becomes problematic if the available data is incomplete because some dimensions of smaller scale either missing or unmeasured. Such setting occurs very often in modeling complex dynamical systems such as power grids, in particular with reduced-order modeling. To take into account the effect of unresolved variables the optimal prediction approach based on the Mori-Zwanzig formalism can be applied to obtain the most expected prediction under existing uncertainties. This effectively leads to the development of a time-predictive model accounting for the impact of missing data. In the present paper we provide a detailed derivation of the considered method from the Liouville equation and finalize it with the optimization problem that defines the optimal transition operator corresponding to the observed data. In contrast to the existing approach, we consider a first-order approximation of the Mori-Zwanzig decomposition, state the corresponding optimization problem and solve it with the gradient-based optimization method. The gradient of the obtained objective function is computed precisely through the automatic differentiation technique. The numerical experiments illustrate that the considered approach gives practically the same dynamics as the exact Mori-Zwanzig decomposition, but is less computationally intensive. ",

However, despite the progress made in device-heterogeneous federated learning scenarios, the heterogeneity in the bitwidth specifications in the hardware has been mostly overlooked. We introduce a pragmatic FL scenario with bitwidth heterogeneity across the participating devices, dubbed as Bitwidth Heterogeneous Federated Learning (BHFL). BHFL brings in a new challenge, that the aggregation of model parameters with different bitwidths could result in severe performance degeneration, especially for high-bitwidth models. To tackle this problem, we propose ProWD framework, which has a trainable weight dequantizer at the central server that progressively reconstructs the low-bitwidth weights into higher bitwidth weights, and finally into full-precision weights. ProWD further selectively aggregates the model parameters to maximize the compatibility across bit-heterogeneous weights. We validate ProWD against relevant FL baselines on the benchmark datasets, using clients with varying bitwidths. Our ProWD largely outperforms the baseline FL algorithms as well as naive approaches (e.g. grouped averaging) under the proposed BHFL scenario. ",

Attackers dictating the GNSS receiver position and time solution are a significant risk, especially due to the inherent vulnerability of GNSS systems. A first line of defense, for a large number of receivers, is to rely on additional information obtained through the rich connectivity of GNSS enabled platforms. Network time can be used for direct validation of the GNSS receiver time; but this depends on network availability. To allow attack detection even when there are prolonged network disconnections, we present a method based on on-board ensemble of reference clocks. This allows the receiver to detect sophisticated attacks affecting the GNSS time solution, independently of the specific attack methodology. Results obtained with Chip-Scale Oven Compensated Oscillators (CS-OCXO) are promising and demonstrate the potential of embedded ensembles of reference clocks, detecting attacks causing modifications of the receiver time offset as low as 0.3us, with half the detection latency compared to related literature.

    "abstract": "Neural networks often encounter various stringent resource constraints while deploying on edge devices. To tackle these problems with less human efforts, automated machine learning becomes popular in finding various neural architectures that fit diverse Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT) scenarios. Recently, to prevent the leakage of private information while enable automated machine intelligence, there is an emerging trend to integrate federated learning and neural architecture search (NAS). Although promising as it may seem, the coupling of difficulties from both tenets makes the algorithm development quite challenging. In particular, how to efficiently search the optimal neural architecture directly from massive non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data among AIoT devices in a federated manner is a hard nut to crack. In this paper, to tackle this challenge, by leveraging the advances in ProxylessNAS, we propose a Federated Direct Neural Architecture Search (FDNAS) framework that allows for hardware-friendly NAS from non- IID data across devices. To further adapt to both various data distributions and different types of devices with heterogeneous embedded hardware platforms, inspired by meta-learning, a Cluster Federated Direct Neural Architecture Search (CFDNAS) framework is proposed to achieve device-aware NAS, in the sense that each device can learn a tailored deep learning model for its particular data distribution and hardware constraint. Extensive experiments on non-IID datasets have shown the state-of-the-art accuracy-efficiency trade-offs achieved by the proposed solution in the presence of both data and device heterogeneity. ",

To ensure the freshness of the content, the platform needs to release a large number of new videos every day, which makes the conventional click-through rate (CTR) prediction model suffer from the severe item cold-start problem. In this paper, we propose GIFT, an efficient Graph-guIded Feature Transfer system, to fully take advantages of the rich information of warmed-up videos that related to the cold-start video. More specifically, we conduct feature transfer from warmed-up videos to those cold-start ones by involving the physical and semantic linkages into a heterogeneous graph. The former linkages consist of those explicit relationships (e.g., sharing the same category, under the same authorship etc.), while the latter measure the proximity of multimodal representations of two videos. In practice, the style, content, and even the recommendation pattern are pretty similar among those physically or semantically related videos. Besides, in order to provide the robust id representations and historical statistics obtained from warmed-up neighbors that cold-start videos covet most, we elaborately design the transfer function to make aware of different transferred features from different types of nodes and edges along the metapath on the graph. Extensive experiments on a large real-world dataset show that our GIFT system outperforms SOTA methods significantly and brings a 6.82% lift on click-through rate (CTR) in the homepage of Taobao App. ",

In this paper, we demonstrate a graph-based approach that uses the self-supervised transformer features to discover an object from an image. Visual tokens are viewed as nodes in a weighted graph with edges representing a connectivity score based on the similarity of tokens. Foreground objects can then be segmented using a normalized graph-cut to group self-similar regions. We solve the graph-cut problem using spectral clustering with generalized eigen-decomposition and show that the second smallest eigenvector provides a cutting solution since its absolute value indicates the likelihood that a token belongs to a foreground object. Despite its simplicity, this approach significantly boosts the performance of unsupervised object discovery: we improve over the recent state of the art LOST by a margin of 6.9%, 8.1%, and 8.1% respectively on the VOC07, VOC12, and COCO20K. The performance can be further improved by adding a second stage class-agnostic detector (CAD). Our proposed method can be easily extended to unsupervised saliency detection and weakly supervised object detection. For unsupervised saliency detection, we improve IoU for 4.9%, 5.2%, 12.9% on ECSSD, DUTS, DUT-OMRON respectively compared to previous state of the art.

Using path-preserving temporal networks, we evaluate the effect of spatial pods (social distancing pods) and temporal pods (meetings' rate reduction) on the spread of the disease. We use our interaction-driven contagion model, instantiated for COVID-19, over history-maintaining random temporal networks as well as over real-world contacts. We find that temporal pods significantly reduce the overall number of infected individuals and slow the spread of the disease. This result is robust under changing initial conditions, such as initial patients' numbers and locations. Social distancing (spatial) pods perform well only at the initial phase of the disease, i.e., with a minimal number of initial patients. Using real-life contact information and extending our interaction-driven model to consider the exposures, we demonstrate the beneficial effect of reducing the temporal density on overall infection rates. We further show that slow-spreading pathogens spread almost as fast-spreading pathogens in dense topologies. Our results show that given the same transmission level, there is a decrease in the disease's rate and spread in less dense networks. Thus, reducing the rate of encounters is more effective than social distancing. ",

There are optimal algorithms for trees and worst-case optimal algorithms for outerplanar graphs, 2-trees, and planar 3-trees. It is known that every cubic triconnected planar $n$-vertex graph (except $K_4$) has segment number $n/2+3$, which is the only known universal lower bound for a meaningful class of planar graphs. We show that every triconnected planar 4-regular graph can be drawn using at most $n+3$ segments. This bound is tight up to an additive constant, improves a previous upper bound of $7n/4+2$ implied by a more general result of Dujmovi\\'c et al., and supplements the result for cubic graphs. We also give a simple optimal algorithm for cactus graphs, generalizing the above-mentioned result for trees. We prove the first linear universal lower bounds for outerpaths, maximal outerplanar graphs, 2-trees, and planar 3-trees.

SDR has been applied to various real-world datasets, such as human activity sensory data and astronomical datasets. However, manually labeling the samples from the generated projection are expensive. To address this problem, we propose here to use clustering methods such as k-means, Hierarchical Clustering, Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN), and Spectral Clustering to easily label the 2D projections of high-dimensional data. We test our pipeline of SDR and the clustering methods on a range of synthetic and real-world datasets, including two different public human activity datasets extracted from smartphone accelerometer or gyroscope recordings of various movements. We apply clustering to assess the visual cluster separation of SDR, both qualitatively and quantitatively. We conclude that clustering SDR results yields better labeling results than clustering plain DR, and that k-means is the recommended clustering method for SDR in terms of clustering accuracy, ease-of-use, and computational scalability.

    "abstract": "Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) combine the expressive power of deep learning with the advantages of Bayesian formalism. In recent years, the analysis of wide, deep BNNs has provided theoretical insight into their priors and posteriors. However, we have no analogous insight into their posteriors under approximate inference. In this work, we show that mean-field variational inference entirely fails to model the data when the network width is large and the activation function is odd. Specifically, for fully-connected BNNs with odd activation functions and a homoscedastic Gaussian likelihood, we show that the optimal mean-field variational posterior predictive (i.e., function space) distribution converges to the prior predictive distribution as the width tends to infinity. We generalize aspects of this result to other likelihoods. Our theoretical results are suggestive of underfitting behavior previously observered in BNNs. While our convergence bounds are non-asymptotic and constants in our analysis can be computed, they are currently too loose to be applicable in standard training regimes. Finally, we show that the optimal approximate posterior need not tend to the prior if the activation function is not odd, showing that our statements cannot be generalized arbitrarily. ",

It has become so widespread that we require algorithmic assistance utilising machine learning to detect such content. Training these machine learning models require datasets of sufficient scale, diversity and quality. However, datasets in the field of automatic misinformation detection are predominantly monolingual, include a limited amount of modalities and are not of sufficient scale and quality. Addressing this, we develop a data collection and linking system (MuMiN-trawl), to build a public misinformation graph dataset (MuMiN), containing rich social media data (tweets, replies, users, images, articles, hashtags) spanning 21 million tweets belonging to 26 thousand Twitter threads, each of which have been semantically linked to 13 thousand fact-checked claims across dozens of topics, events and domains, in 41 different languages, spanning more than a decade. The dataset is made available as a heterogeneous graph via a Python package (mumin). We provide baseline results for two node classification tasks related to the veracity of a claim involving social media, and demonstrate that these are challenging tasks, with the highest macro-average F1-score being 62.55% and 61.45% for the two tasks, respectively.

However, the regions on which the networks are distributed are typically either squares or disks in existing works, which seriously limits the usage in real-life applications. In this article, we consider a convex region (i.e., a generalisation of squares and disks) on which wireless nodes are uniformly distributed. We have investigated two types of critical transmission radii, defined in terms of k-connectivity and the minimum vertex degree, respectively, and have also established their precise asymptotic distributions. These make the previous results obtained under the circumstance of squares or disks special cases of this work. More importantly, our results reveal how the region shape impacts on the critical transmission ranges: it is the length of the boundary of the (fixed-area) region that completely determines the transmission ranges. Furthermore, by isodiametric inequality, the smallest critical transmission ranges are achieved when regions are disks only. ",

However, two main challenges exist: 1) the selection of the optimal number of devices for improving the spectral efficiency, and 2) improving the physical layer security of such a communication system. The optimal device improves the secrecy capacity, and the selection of optimal devices enhances the physical layer security. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a double threshold-based optimal device selection (ODS) scheme for a cooperative wireless network with amplify and forward (AF) protocol in the presence and absence of an eavesdropper to enhance the physical layer security for the D2D network. The proposed scheme is analyzed with different distance cases, device scenarios, and modulation schemes. The bit error rate (BER) performance analysis concludes that a performance gain of more than 4 dB is achieved at the BER of 0:004 for the proposed double threshold-based ODS scheme compared to the existing ODS scheme at a high signal to noise ratio (SNR). Furthermore, the proposed scheme enhances the physical layer security. ",

Often, instantaneous values of some of these factors can be measured, and they provide useful information about the instantaneous rate achieved. For example, higher interference implies a lower rate. In this work, we treat any such measurable quality that has a non-zero correlation with the rate achieved as side-information and study how it can be exploited to quickly learn the channel that offers higher throughput (reward). When the mean value of the side-information is known, using control variate theory we develop algorithms that require fewer samples to learn the parameters and can improve the learning rate compared to cases where side-information is ignored. Specifically, we incorporate side-information in the classical Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithm and quantify the gain achieved in the regret performance. We show that the gain is proportional to the amount of the correlation between the reward and associated side-information. We discuss in detail various side-information that can be exploited in cognitive radio and air-to-ground communication in $L-$band. We demonstrate that correlation between the reward and side-information is often strong in practice and exploiting it improves the throughput significantly. ",

The a priori knowledge assumed consists of broad parameter bounds obtained from the literature and specification sheets of typical network components, and the physics-based model of the simulator. Accurate estimation of the physical layer parameters is demonstrated with a signal to noise ratio penalty of 1~dB or greater, using only 3 simulated measurements.

    "abstract": "Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) often process vectors as quantities having no direction like colors in images. This study investigates the effect of treating vectors as geometrical objects in terms of super-resolution of velocity on two-dimensional fluids. Vector is distinguished from scalar by the transformation law associated with a change in basis, which can be incorporated as the prior knowledge using the equivariant deep learning. We convert existing CNNs into equivariant ones by making each layer equivariant with respect to rotation and translation. The training data in the low- and high-resolution are generated with the downsampling or the spectral nudging. When the data inherit the rotational symmetry, the equivariant CNNs show comparable accuracy with the non-equivariant ones. Since the number of parameters is smaller in the equivariant CNNs, these models are trainable with a smaller size of the data. In this case, the transformation law of vector should be incorporated as the prior knowledge, where vector is explicitly treated as a quantity having direction. Two examples demonstrate that the symmetry of the data can be broken. In the first case, a downsampling method makes the correspondence between low- and high-resolution patterns dependent on the orientation. In the second case, the input data are insufficient to recognize the rotation of coordinates in the experiment with the spectral nudging. In both cases, the accuracy of the CNNs deteriorates if the equivariance is forced to be imposed, and the usage of conventional CNNs may be justified even though vector is processed as a quantity having no direction.

We perform empirical tests of this analytic description and quantitatively show the dependence of the effective field theory parameters on hyperparameters of the neural network.

    "abstract": "Many supervised machine learning frameworks have been proposed for disease classification using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data, producing important biomarkers. More recently, data pooling has flourished, making the result generalizable across a large population. But, this success depends on the population diversity and variability introduced due to the pooling of the data that is not a primary research interest. Here, we look at hierarchical Sparse Connectivity Patterns (hSCPs) as biomarkers for major depressive disorder (MDD). We propose a novel model based on hSCPs to predict MDD patients from functional connectivity matrices extracted from resting-state fMRI data. Our model consists of three coupled terms. The first term decomposes connectivity matrices into hierarchical low-rank sparse components corresponding to synchronous patterns across the human brain. These components are then combined via patient-specific weights capturing heterogeneity in the data. The second term is a classification loss that uses the patient-specific weights to classify MDD patients from healthy ones. Both of these terms are combined with the third term, a robustness loss function to improve the reproducibility of hSCPs. This reduces the variability introduced due to site and population diversity (age and sex) on the predictive accuracy and pattern stability in a large dataset pooled from five different sites. Our results show the impact of diversity on prediction performance. Our model can reduce diversity and improve the predictive and generalizing capability of the components. Finally, our results show that our proposed model can robustly identify clinically relevant patterns characteristic of MDD with high reproducibility. ",

QDL takes computational gains by replacing deep learning computations on local devices and servers with quantum deep learning.

Although many attempts have been made to confirm and demonstrate these various possibilities, QDDL research is still in its infancy.

In particular, we find that a feedforward convolutional network with a Densenet architecture is able to outperform a convolutional LSTM in terms of predictive skill. Next, we go on to consider a probabilistic formulation of the same network based on Stein variational gradient descent and find that in addition to providing useful measures of predictive uncertainty, the probabilistic (Bayesian) version improves on its deterministic counterpart in terms of predictive skill.

That makes the design of LPCNet-based systems more complicated, while adding the constraint that the input features must represent a clean speech spectrum. We propose an end-to-end version of LPCNet that lifts these limitations by learning to infer the LP coefficients in the frame rate network from the input features.

    "title": "Improving fairness in speaker verification via Group-adapted Fusion  Network",
    "abstract": "Modern speaker verification models use deep neural networks to encode utterance audio into discriminative embedding vectors. During the training process, these networks are typically optimized to differentiate arbitrary speakers. This learning process biases the learning of fine voice characteristics towards dominant demographic groups, which can lead to an unfair performance disparity across different groups. This is observed especially with underrepresented demographic groups sharing similar voice characteristics. In this work, we investigate the fairness of speaker verification models on controlled datasets with imbalanced gender distributions, providing direct evidence that model performance suffers for underrepresented groups. To mitigate this disparity we propose the group-adapted fusion network (GFN) architecture, a modular architecture based on group embedding adaptation and score fusion. We show that our method alleviates model unfairness by improving speaker verification both overall and for individual groups. Given imbalanced group representation in training, our proposed method achieves overall equal error rate (EER) reduction of 9.6% to 29.0% relative, reduces minority group EER by 13.7% to 18.6%, and results in 20.0% to 25.4% less EER disparity, compared to baselines. The approach is applicable to other types of training data skew in speaker recognition systems. ",

    "abstract": "Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have the potential for making various clinical procedures more time-efficient by automating medical image segmentation. Due to their strong, in some cases human-level, performance, they have become the standard approach in this field. The design of the best possible medical image segmentation DNNs, however, is task-specific. Neural Architecture Search (NAS), i.e., the automation of neural network design, has been shown to have the capability to outperform manually designed networks for various tasks. However, the existing NAS methods for medical image segmentation have explored a quite limited range of types of DNN architectures that can be discovered. In this work, we propose a novel NAS search space for medical image segmentation networks. This search space combines the strength of a generalised encoder-decoder structure, well known from U-Net, with network blocks that have proven to have a strong performance in image classification tasks. The search is performed by looking for the best topology of multiple cells simultaneously with the configuration of each cell within, allowing for interactions between topology and cell-level attributes. From experiments on two publicly available datasets, we find that the networks discovered by our proposed NAS method have better performance than well-known handcrafted segmentation networks, and outperform networks found with other NAS approaches that perform only topology search, and topology-level search followed by cell-level search.

However, even the most advanced methods require a huge and diverse amount of data to generalize. Because in realistic clinical scenarios, data acquisition and annotation is expensive, deep learning models trained on small and unrepresentative data tend to outperform when deployed in data that differs from the one used for training (e.g data from different scanners). In this work, we proposed a domain adaptation methodology to alleviate this problem in segmentation models. Our approach takes advantage of the properties of adversarial domain adaptation and consistency training to achieve more robust adaptation. Using two datasets with white matter hyperintensities (WMH) annotations, we demonstrated that the proposed method improves model generalization even in corner cases where individual strategies tend to fail.

We start by noticing that several classical metric learning formulations from the literature can be viewed as modified covariance matrix estimation problems. Leveraging this point of view, a general approach, called Robust Geometric Metric Learning (RGML), is then studied. This method aims at simultaneously estimating the covariance matrix of each class while shrinking them towards their (unknown) barycenter. We focus on two specific costs functions: one associated with the Gaussian likelihood (RGML Gaussian), and one with Tyler's M -estimator (RGML Tyler). In both, the barycenter is defined with the Riemannian distance, which enjoys nice properties of geodesic convexity and affine invariance. The optimization is performed using the Riemannian geometry of symmetric positive definite matrices and its submanifold of unit determinant. Finally, the performance of RGML is asserted on real datasets. Strong performance is exhibited while being robust to mislabeled data. ",

Given two graphs $G$ and $H$ and a graph product $\\star$, we address the question: is the twin-width of $G\\star H$ bounded by a function of the twin-widths of $G$ and $H$ and their maximum degrees? It is known that a bound of this type holds for strong products (Bonnet, Geniet, Kim, Thomass\\'{e} & Watrigant; SODA 2021). We show that bounds of the same form hold for Cartesian, tensor/direct, rooted, replacement, and zig-zag products. For the lexicographical product we prove that the twin-width of the product of two graphs is exactly the maximum of the twin-widths of the individual graphs. In contrast, for the modular product we show that no bound can hold. In addition, we provide examples showing many of our bounds are tight, and give improved bounds for certain classes of graphs. ",

The former task aims to approximate a quantum state by sampling from a prior distribution and querying a quantum channel. The latter task aims to extract uniform and independent randomness against quantum adversaries. For both tasks, we use trace distance to measure the closeness between the processed state and the ideal target state. We show that the minimal amount of samples for achieving an $\\varepsilon$-covering is given by the $(1-\\varepsilon)$-hypothesis testing information (with additional logarithmic additive terms), while the maximal extractable randomness for an $\\varepsilon$-secret extractor is characterized by the conditional $(1-\\varepsilon)$-hypothesis testing entropy. When performing independent and identical repetitions of the tasks, our one-shot characterizations lead to tight asymptotic expansions of the above-mentioned operational quantities. We establish their second-order rates given by the quantum mutual information variance and the quantum conditional information variance, respectively. Moreover, our results extend to the moderate deviation regime, which are the optimal asymptotic rates when the trace distances vanish at sub-exponential speed. Our proof technique is direct analysis of trace distance without smoothing. ",

This is a classical graph problem that is NP-complete even for $k=2$. We introduce a natural generalization, Induced Disjoint Connected Subgraphs: instead of connecting pairs of terminals, we must connect sets of terminals. We give almost-complete dichotomies of the computational complexity of both problems for $H$-free graphs, that is, graphs that do not contain some fixed graph $H$ as an induced subgraph. We also classify the complexity of the second problem (subject to one missing case) if the number of terminal sets is fixed, that is, not part of the input. ",
