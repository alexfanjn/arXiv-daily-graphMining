    "abstract": "Adapting an agent's behaviour to new environments has been one of the primary focus areas of physics based reinforcement learning. Although recent approaches such as universal policy networks partially address this issue by enabling the storage of multiple policies trained in simulation on a wide range of dynamic/latent factors, efficiently identifying the most appropriate policy for a given environment remains a challenge. In this work, we propose a Gaussian Process-based prior learned in simulation, that captures the likely performance of a policy when transferred to a previously unseen environment. We integrate this prior with a Bayesian Optimisation-based policy search process to improve the efficiency of identifying the most appropriate policy from the universal policy network. We empirically evaluate our approach in a range of continuous and discrete control environments, and show that it outperforms other competing baselines. ",

    "title": "Blind leads Blind: A Zero-Knowledge Attack on Federated Learning",
    "abstract": "Attacks on Federated Learning (FL) can severely reduce the quality of the generated models and limit the usefulness of this emerging learning paradigm that enables on-premise decentralized learning. There have been various untargeted attacks on FL, but they are not widely applicable as they i) assume that the attacker knows every update of benign clients, which is indeed sent in encrypted form to the central server, or ii) assume that the attacker has a large dataset and sufficient resources to locally train updates imitating benign parties. In this paper, we design a zero-knowledge untargeted attack (ZKA), which synthesizes malicious data to craft adversarial models without eavesdropping on the transmission of benign clients at all or requiring a large quantity of task-specific training data. To inject malicious input into the FL system by synthetic data, ZKA has two variants. ZKA-R generates adversarial ambiguous data by reversing engineering from the global models. To enable stealthiness, ZKA-G trains the local model on synthetic data from the generator that aims to synthesize images different from a randomly chosen class. Furthermore, we add a novel distance-based regularization term for both attacks to further enhance stealthiness. Experimental results on Fashion-MNIST and CIFAR-10 show that the ZKA achieves similar or even higher attack success rate than the state-of-the-art untargeted attacks against various defense mechanisms, namely more than 50% for Cifar-10 for all considered defense mechanisms. As expected, ZKA-G is better at circumventing defenses, even showing a defense pass rate of close to 90% when ZKA-R only achieves 70%. Higher data heterogeneity favours ZKA-R since detection becomes harder. ",

Given access to a blackbox control policy (e.g., in the form of a neural network) and a dataset of training environments, we present an approach for synthesizing a failure predictor with guaranteed bounds on false-positive and false-negative errors. In order to achieve this, we utilize techniques from Probably Approximately Correct (PAC)-Bayes generalization theory. In addition, we present novel class-conditional bounds that allow us to tradeoff the relative rates of false-positive vs. false-negative errors. We propose algorithms that train failure predictors (that take as input the history of sensor observations) by minimizing our theoretical error bounds. We demonstrate the resulting approach using extensive simulation and hardware experiments for vision-based navigation with a drone and grasping objects with a robotic manipulator equipped with a wrist-mounted RGB-D camera. These experiments illustrate the ability of our approach to (1) provide strong bounds on failure prediction error rates (that closely match empirical error rates), and (2) improve safety by predicting failures.

The scenario arises naturally in social network analysis, tracking user mobility in wireless networks, and forensics applications, among others. A stochastic growing network generation model -- called the popularity-based model -- is investigated, where the bipartite network is generated iteratively, and in each iteration vertices attract new edges based on their assigned popularity values. It is shown that using the appropriate choice of initial popularity values, the node degree distribution follows a power-law distribution with arbitrary parameter $\\alpha>2$, i.e. fraction of nodes with degree $d$ is proportional to $d^{-\\alpha}$. An active fingerprinting deanonymization attack strategy called the augmented information threshold attack strategy (A-ITS) is proposed which uses the attacker's knowledge of the node degree distribution along with the concept of information values for deanonymization. Sufficient conditions for the success of the A-ITS, based on network parameters, are derived. It is shown through simulations that the proposed attack significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art attack strategies. ",

A novel interference model for the relay-assisted mmWave backhaul network in the dense urban environment is proposed, which demonstrates the limited interference footprint of mmWave directional communications. Moreover, a scheduling algorithm is developed to find the optimal scheduling for tree-style mmWave backhaul networks.

To better understand this empirical observation, we consider the generalization error of two-layer neural networks trained to interpolation by gradient descent on the logistic loss following random initialization. We assume the data comes from well-separated class-conditional log-concave distributions and allow for a constant fraction of the training labels to be corrupted by an adversary. We show that in this setting, neural networks exhibit benign overfitting: they can be driven to zero training error, perfectly fitting any noisy training labels, and simultaneously achieve test error close to the Bayes-optimal error. In contrast to previous work on benign overfitting that require linear or kernel-based predictors, our analysis holds in a setting where both the model and learning dynamics are fundamentally nonlinear.

    "abstract": "Image recognition is an essential task in several mobile applications. For instance, a smartphone can process a landmark photo to gather more information about its location. If the device does not have enough computational resources available, it offloads the processing task to a cloud infrastructure. Although this approach solves resource shortages, it introduces a communication delay. Image-recognition caches on the Internet's edge can mitigate this problem. These caches run on servers close to mobile devices and stores information about previously recognized images. If the server receives a request with a photo stored in its cache, it replies to the device, avoiding cloud offloading. The main challenge for this cache is to verify if the received image matches a stored one. Furthermore, for outdoor photos, it is difficult to compare them if one was taken in the daytime and the other at nighttime. In that case, the cache might wrongly infer that they refer to different places, offloading the processing to the cloud. This work shows that a well-known generative adversarial network, called ToDayGAN, can solve this problem by generating daytime images using nighttime ones. We can thus use this translation to populate a cache with synthetic photos that can help image matching. We show that our solution reduces cloud offloading and, therefore, the application's latency.

Benefiting from research on deep learning, like convolutional neural networks~(CNNs) and generative adversarial networks, the performance in this field has been improved significantly, especially when training and test data are drawn from similar distributions. However, mismatching distributions, i.e., domain shifts, lead to a significant performance drop. In this paper, we build domain-invariant detectors by learning domain classifiers via adversarial training. Based on the previous works that align image and instance level features, we mitigate the domain shift further by introducing a domain adaptation component at the region level within Faster \\mbox{R-CNN}. We embed a domain classification network in the region proposal network~(RPN) using adversarial learning. The RPN can now generate accurate region proposals in different domains by effectively aligning the features between them. To mitigate the unstable convergence during the adversarial learning, we introduce a balanced domain classifier as well as a network learning rate adjustment strategy. We conduct comprehensive experiments using four standard datasets. The results demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our object detection approach in domain shift scenarios. ",

    "abstract": "Open-set recognition and adversarial defense study two key aspects of deep learning that are vital for real-world deployment. The objective of open-set recognition is to identify samples from open-set classes during testing, while adversarial defense aims to robustify the network against images perturbed by imperceptible adversarial noise. This paper demonstrates that open-set recognition systems are vulnerable to adversarial samples. Furthermore, this paper shows that adversarial defense mechanisms trained on known classes are unable to generalize well to open-set samples. Motivated by these observations, we emphasize the necessity of an Open-Set Adversarial Defense (OSAD) mechanism. This paper proposes an Open-Set Defense Network with Clean-Adversarial Mutual Learning (OSDN-CAML) as a solution to the OSAD problem. The proposed network designs an encoder with dual-attentive feature-denoising layers coupled with a classifier to learn a noise-free latent feature representation, which adaptively removes adversarial noise guided by channel and spatial-wise attentive filters. Several techniques are exploited to learn a noise-free and informative latent feature space with the aim of improving the performance of adversarial defense and open-set recognition. First, we incorporate a decoder to ensure that clean images can be well reconstructed from the obtained latent features. Then, self-supervision is used to ensure that the latent features are informative enough to carry out an auxiliary task. Finally, to exploit more complementary knowledge from clean image classification to facilitate feature denoising and search for a more generalized local minimum for open-set recognition, we further propose clean-adversarial mutual learning, where a peer network (classifying clean images) is further introduced to mutually learn with the classifier (classifying adversarial images).

Recently, SSL with deep models has proven to be successful on standard benchmark tasks. However, they are still vulnerable to various robustness threats in real-world applications as these benchmarks provide perfect unlabeled data, while in realistic scenarios, unlabeled data could be corrupted. Many researchers have pointed out that after exploiting corrupted unlabeled data, SSL suffers severe performance degradation problems. Thus, there is an urgent need to develop SSL algorithms that could work robustly with corrupted unlabeled data. To fully understand robust SSL, we conduct a survey study. We first clarify a formal definition of robust SSL from the perspective of machine learning. Then, we classify the robustness threats into three categories: i) distribution corruption, i.e., unlabeled data distribution is mismatched with labeled data; ii) feature corruption, i.e., the features of unlabeled examples are adversarially attacked; and iii) label corruption, i.e., the label distribution of unlabeled data is imbalanced. Under this unified taxonomy, we provide a thorough review and discussion of recent works that focus on these issues. Finally, we propose possible promising directions within robust SSL to provide insights for future research. ",

    "abstract": "Real-time Monte Carlo denoising aims at removing severe noise under low samples per pixel (spp) in a strict time budget. Recently, kernel-prediction methods use a neural network to predict each pixel's filtering kernel and have shown a great potential to remove Monte Carlo noise. However, the heavy computation overhead blocks these methods from real-time applications. This paper expands the kernel-prediction method and proposes a novel approach to denoise very low spp (e.g., 1-spp) Monte Carlo path traced images at real-time frame rates. Instead of using the neural network to directly predict the kernel map, i.e., the complete weights of each per-pixel filtering kernel, we predict an encoding of the kernel map, followed by a high-efficiency decoder with unfolding operations for a high-quality reconstruction of the filtering kernels. The kernel map encoding yields a compact single-channel representation of the kernel map, which can significantly reduce the kernel-prediction network's throughput. In addition, we adopt a scalable kernel fusion module to improve denoising quality. The proposed approach preserves kernel prediction methods' denoising quality while roughly halving its denoising time for 1-spp noisy inputs. In addition, compared with the recent neural bilateral grid-based real-time denoiser, our approach benefits from the high parallelism of kernel-based reconstruction and produces better denoising results at equal time.

For a directed graph $G$, the problem of D-core decomposition aims to compute the non-empty D-cores for all possible values of $k$ and $l$. In the literature, several \\emph{peeling-based} algorithms have been proposed to handle D-core decomposition. However, the peeling-based algorithms that work in a sequential fashion and require global graph information during processing are mainly designed for \\emph{centralized} settings, which cannot handle large-scale graphs efficiently in distributed settings. Motivated by this, we study the \\emph{distributed} D-core decomposition problem in this paper. We start by defining a concept called \\emph{anchored coreness}, based on which we propose a new H-index-based algorithm for distributed D-core decomposition. Furthermore, we devise a novel concept, namely \\emph{skyline coreness}, and show that the D-core decomposition problem is equivalent to the computation of skyline corenesses for all vertices. We design an efficient D-index to compute the skyline corenesses distributedly. We implement the proposed algorithms under both vertex-centric and block-centric distributed graph processing frameworks. Moreover, we theoretically analyze the algorithm and message complexities. Extensive experiments on large real-world graphs with billions of edges demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed algorithms in terms of both the running time and communication overhead. ",

However, despite the success of IL algorithms, they impose the somewhat unrealistic requirement that the expert demonstrations must come from the same domain in which a new imitator policy is to be learned. We consider a practical setting, where (i) state-only expert demonstrations from the real (deployment) environment are given to the learner, (ii) the imitation learner policy is trained in a simulation (training) environment whose transition dynamics is slightly different from the real environment, and (iii) the learner does not have any access to the real environment during the training phase beyond the batch of demonstrations given. Most of the current IL methods, such as generative adversarial imitation learning and its state-only variants, fail to imitate the optimal expert behavior under the above setting. By leveraging insights from the Robust reinforcement learning (RL) literature and building on recent adversarial imitation approaches, we propose a robust IL algorithm to learn policies that can effectively transfer to the real environment without fine-tuning.

This calls for robust solutions to the problem of code authorship attribution. In this paper, we initiate the study on making Deep Learning (DL)-based code authorship attribution robust. We propose an innovative framework called Robust coding style Patterns Generation (RoPGen), which essentially learns authors' unique coding style patterns that are hard for attackers to manipulate or imitate. The key idea is to combine data augmentation and gradient augmentation at the adversarial training phase. This effectively increases the diversity of training examples, generates meaningful perturbations to gradients of deep neural networks, and learns diversified representations of coding styles. We evaluate the effectiveness of RoPGen using four datasets of programs written in C, C++, and Java. Experimental results show that RoPGen can significantly improve the robustness of DL-based code authorship attribution, by respectively reducing 22.8% and 41.0% of the success rate of targeted and untargeted attacks on average.

    "title": "Local Differential Privacy for Federated Learning in Industrial Settings",
    "abstract": "Federated learning (FL) is a collaborative learning approach that has gained much attention due to its inherent privacy preservation capabilities. However, advanced adversarial attacks such as membership inference and model memorization can still make FL vulnerable and potentially leak sensitive private data. Literature shows a few attempts to alleviate this problem by using global (GDP) and local differential privacy (LDP). Compared to GDP, LDP approaches are gaining more popularity due to stronger privacy notions and native support for data distribution. However, DP approaches assume that the server that aggregates the models, to be honest (run the FL protocol honestly) or semi-honest (run the FL protocol honestly while also trying to learn as much information possible), making such approaches unreliable for real-world settings. In real-world industrial environments (e.g. healthcare), the distributed entities (e.g. hospitals) are already composed of locally running machine learning models (e.g. high-performing deep neural networks on local health records). Existing approaches do not provide a scalable mechanism to utilize such settings for privacy-preserving FL. This paper proposes a new local differentially private FL (named LDPFL) protocol for industrial settings. LDPFL avoids the requirement of an honest or a semi-honest server and provides better performance while enforcing stronger privacy levels compared to existing approaches. Our experimental evaluation of LDPFL shows high FL model performance (up to ~98%) under a small privacy budget (e.g. epsilon = 0.5) in comparison to existing methods. ",

However, existing video salient object detection (VSOD) methods only utilize spatiotemporal information and seldom exploit depth information for detection. In this paper, we propose a depth-cooperated trimodal network, called DCTNet for VSOD, which is a pioneering work to incorporate depth information to assist VSOD. To this end, we first generate depth from RGB frames, and then propose an approach to treat the three modalities unequally. Specifically, a multi-modal attention module (MAM) is designed to model multi-modal long-range dependencies between the main modality (RGB) and the two auxiliary modalities (depth, optical flow). We also introduce a refinement fusion module (RFM) to suppress noises in each modality and select useful information dynamically for further feature refinement. Lastly, a progressive fusion strategy is adopted after the refined features to achieve final cross-modal fusion. Experiments on five benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of our depth-cooperated model against 12 state-of-the-art methods, and the necessity of depth is also validated. ",

    "abstract": "User preference modeling is a vital yet challenging problem in personalized product search. In recent years, latent space based methods have achieved state-of-the-art performance by jointly learning semantic representations of products, users, and text tokens. However, existing methods are limited in their ability to model user preferences. They typically represent users by the products they visited in a short span of time using attentive models and lack the ability to exploit relational information such as user-product interactions or item co-occurrence relations. In this work, we propose to address the limitations of prior arts by exploring local and global user behavior patterns on a user successive behavior graph, which is constructed by utilizing short-term actions of all users. To capture implicit user preference signals and collaborative patterns, we use an efficient jumping graph convolution to explore high-order relations to enrich product representations for user preference modeling. Our approach can be seamlessly integrated with existing latent space based methods and be potentially applied in any product retrieval method that uses purchase history to model user preferences. Extensive experiments on eight Amazon benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and potential of our approach. The source code is available at \\url{https://github.com/floatSDSDS/SBG}. ",

We propose EREBA, the first black-box testing method for determining the energy robustness of an AdNN. EREBA explores and infers the relationship between inputs and the energy consumption of AdNNs to generate energy surging samples. Extensive implementation and evaluation using three state-of-the-art AdNNs demonstrate that test inputs generated by EREBA could degrade the performance of the system substantially. The test inputs generated by EREBA can increase the energy consumption of AdNNs by 2,000% compared to the original inputs. Our results also show that test inputs generated via EREBA are valuable in detecting energy surging inputs. ",

In this paper, we present a neural volumography technique called neural volumetric video or NeuVV to support immersive, interactive, and spatial-temporal rendering of volumetric video contents with photo-realism and in real-time. The core of NeuVV is to efficiently encode a dynamic neural radiance field (NeRF) into renderable and editable primitives. We introduce two types of factorization schemes: a hyper-spherical harmonics (HH) decomposition for modeling smooth color variations over space and time and a learnable basis representation for modeling abrupt density and color changes caused by motion. NeuVV factorization can be integrated into a Video Octree (VOctree) analogous to PlenOctree to significantly accelerate training while reducing memory overhead. Real-time NeuVV rendering further enables a class of immersive content editing tools. Specifically, NeuVV treats each VOctree as a primitive and implements volume-based depth ordering and alpha blending to realize spatial-temporal compositions for content re-purposing. For example, we demonstrate positioning varied manifestations of the same performance at different 3D locations with different timing, adjusting color/texture of the performer's clothing, casting spotlight shadows and synthesizing distance falloff lighting, etc, all at an interactive speed. We further develop a hybrid neural-rasterization rendering framework to support consumer-level VR headsets so that the aforementioned volumetric video viewing and editing, for the first time, can be conducted immersively in virtual 3D space.

    "abstract": "The proliferation of deep learning applications in several areas has led to the rapid adoption of such solutions from an ever-growing number of institutions and companies. The deep neural network (DNN) models developed by these entities are often trained on proprietary data. They require powerful computational resources, with the resulting DNN models being incorporated in the company's work pipeline or provided as a service. Being trained on proprietary information, these models provide a competitive edge for the owner company. At the same time, these models can be attractive to competitors (or malicious entities), which can employ state-of-the-art security attacks to steal and use these models for their benefit. As these attacks are hard to prevent, it becomes imperative to have mechanisms that enable an affected entity to verify the ownership of a DNN with high confidence. This paper presents TATTOOED, a robust and efficient DNN watermarking technique based on spread-spectrum channel coding. TATTOOED has a negligible effect on the performance of the DNN model and requires as little as one iteration to watermark a DNN model. We extensively evaluate TATTOOED against several state-of-the-art mechanisms used to remove watermarks from DNNs. Our results show that TATTOOED is robust to such removal techniques even in extreme scenarios. For example, if the removal techniques such as fine-tuning and parameter pruning change as much as 99\\% of the model parameters, the TATTOOED watermark is still present in full in the DNN model, and ensures ownership verification.

    "abstract": "Graph neural networks (GNN) have emerged as a powerful tool for fraud detection tasks, where fraudulent nodes are identified by aggregating neighbor information via different relations. To get around such detection, crafty fraudsters resort to camouflage via connecting to legitimate users (i.e., relation camouflage) or providing seemingly legitimate feedbacks (i.e., feature camouflage). A wide-spread solution reinforces the GNN aggregation process with neighbor selectors according to original node features. This method may carry limitations when identifying fraudsters not only with the relation camouflage, but with the feature camouflage making them hard to distinguish from their legitimate neighbors. In this paper, we propose a Hierarchical Attention-based Graph Neural Network (HA-GNN) for fraud detection, which incorporates weighted adjacency matrices across different relations against camouflage. This is motivated in the Relational Density Theory and is exploited for forming a hierarchical attention-based graph neural network. Specifically, we design a relation attention module to reflect the tie strength between two nodes, while a neighborhood attention module to capture the long-range structural affinity associated with the graph. We generate node embeddings by aggregating information from local/long-range structures and original node features. Experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our model over the state-of-the-arts. ",

We prove this modular network verification procedure is sound and complete with respect to verification over the monolithic network. We implement this procedure as Kirigami, an extension of NV - a network verification language and tool - and evaluate it on industrial topologies with synthesized policies.

    "abstract": "With the increasing demands on e-commerce platforms, numerous user action history is emerging. Those enriched action records are vital to understand users' interests and intents. Recently, prior works for user behavior prediction mainly focus on the interactions with product-side information. However, the interactions with search queries, which usually act as a bridge between users and products, are still under investigated. In this paper, we explore a new problem named temporal event forecasting, a generalized user behavior prediction task in a unified query product evolutionary graph, to embrace both query and product recommendation in a temporal manner. To fulfill this setting, there involves two challenges: (1) the action data for most users is scarce; (2) user preferences are dynamically evolving and shifting over time. To tackle those issues, we propose a novel Retrieval-Enhanced Temporal Event (RETE) forecasting framework. Unlike existing methods that enhance user representations via roughly absorbing information from connected entities in the whole graph, RETE efficiently and dynamically retrieves relevant entities centrally on each user as high-quality subgraphs, preventing the noise propagation from the densely evolutionary graph structures that incorporate abundant search queries. And meanwhile, RETE autoregressively accumulates retrieval-enhanced user representations from each time step, to capture evolutionary patterns for joint query and product prediction. Empirically, extensive experiments on both the public benchmark and four real-world industrial datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed RETE method. ",

Using the robotic hand design from the authors' earlier work, a sensing and control strategy is proposed here to prevent object slippage. The robotic hand is cable-driven, single-actuated, has five fingers, and is capable of replicating most human hand motions. The slip sensing approach utilizes a piezoelectric vibration sensor, namely, polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF), which is a flexible, thin, cheap, and highly sensitive material. The power of the filtered PVDF signal is shown to exhibit identifiable signatures during slip, thus providing a suitable slip detection mechanism. Using the PVDF feedback, an integral controller is implemented to prevent the grasped object from falling and ensure a safe, powerful, and reliable grasp. The extension movement of the robotic hand is controlled using a bend sensor, through a proportional-integral (PI) controller. The robotic hand weights 338 gr. The functionality and robustness of the proposed slip-detection sensory system and control logic implementation are evaluated through experiments. ",

    "abstract": "Software dependency network metrics extracted from the dependency graph of the software modules by the application of Social Network Analysis (SNA metrics) have been shown to improve the performance of the Software Defect prediction (SDP) models. However, the relative effectiveness of these SNA metrics over code metrics in improving the performance of the SDP models has been widely debated with no clear consensus. Furthermore, some of the common SDP scenarios like predicting the number of defects in a module (Defect-count) in Cross-version and Cross-project SDP contexts remain unexplored. Such lack of clear directive on the effectiveness of SNA metrics when compared to the widely used code metrics prevents us from potentially building better performing SDP models. Therefore, through a case study of 9 open source software projects across 30 versions, we study the relative effectiveness of SNA metrics when compared to code metrics across 3 commonly used SDP contexts (Within-project, Cross-version and Cross-project) and scenarios (Defect-count, Defect-classification (classifying if a module is defective) and Effort-aware (ranking the defective modules w.r.t to the involved effort)). We find the SNA metrics by themselves or along with code metrics improve the performance of SDP models over just using code metrics on 5 out of the 9 studied SDP scenarios (three SDP scenarios across three SDP contexts). However, we note that in some cases the improvements afforded by considering SNA metrics over or alongside code metrics might only be marginal, whereas in other cases the improvements could be potentially large. Based on these findings we suggest that the future work should: consider SNA metrics alongside code metrics in their SDP models; as well as consider Ego metrics and Global metrics, the two different types of the SNA metrics separately when training SDP models as they behave differently.

However, this gain requires an appropriate precoder design and a power allocation technique.

Nonetheless, this is an optimistic assumption since real systems only possess partial or imperfect CSI at the transmitter (CSIT). The imperfect CSIT originates residual inter-user interference, which is detrimental for wireless systems. In this paper, two adaptive power allocation algorithms are proposed, which are more robust against CSIT imperfections than conventional techniques.

While all previous works assume known and homogeneous curvature on these loss functions, we study a heterogeneous setting where each function has its own curvature that is only revealed after the learner makes a decision. We develop an efficient algorithm that is able to adapt to the curvature on the fly. Specifically, our algorithm not only recovers or \\emph{even improves} existing results for several homogeneous settings, but also leads to surprising results for some heterogeneous settings -- for example, while Hazan and Levy (2014) showed that $\\widetilde{O}(d^{3/2}\\sqrt{T})$ regret is achievable for a sequence of $T$ smooth and strongly convex $d$-dimensional functions, our algorithm reveals that the same is achievable even if $T^{3/4}$ of them are not strongly convex, and sometimes even if a constant fraction of them are not strongly convex. Our approach is inspired by the framework of Bartlett et al. (2007) who studied a similar heterogeneous setting but with stronger gradient feedback. Extending their framework to the bandit feedback setting requires novel ideas such as lifting the feasible domain and using a logarithmically homogeneous self-concordant barrier regularizer. ",

We achieve this by printing objects from an infrared-transmitting filament, which infrared cameras can see through, and by having air gaps inside for the tag's bits, which appear at a different intensity in the infrared image. We built a user interface that facilitates the integration of common tags (QR codes, ArUco markers) with the object geometry to make them 3D printable as InfraredTags. We also developed a low-cost infrared imaging module that augments existing mobile devices and decodes tags using our image processing pipeline. Our evaluation shows that the tags can be detected with little near-infrared illumination (0.2lux) and from distances as far as 250cm.

    "abstract": "With the field of rigid-body robotics having matured in the last fifty years, routing, planning, and manipulation of deformable objects have emerged in recent years as a more untouched research area in many fields ranging from surgical robotics to industrial assembly and construction. Routing approaches for deformable objects which rely on learned implicit spatial representations (e.g., Learning-from-Demonstration methods) make them vulnerable to changes in the environment and the specific setup. On the other hand, algorithms that entirely separate the spatial representation of the deformable object from the routing and manipulation, often using a representation approach independent of planning, result in slow planning in high dimensional space. This paper proposes a novel approach to spatial representation combined with route planning that allows efficient routing of deformable one-dimensional objects (e.g., wires, cables, ropes, threads). The spatial representation is based on the geometrical decomposition of the space into convex subspaces, which allows an efficient coding of the configuration. Having such a configuration, the routing problem can be solved using a dynamic programming matching method with a quadratic time and space complexity. The proposed method couples the routing and efficient configuration for improved planning time. Our tests and experiments show the method correctly computing the next manipulation action in sub-millisecond time and accomplishing various routing and manipulation tasks. ",

    "title": "Source-Free Progressive Graph Learning for Open-Set Domain Adaptation",
    "abstract": "Open-set domain adaptation (OSDA) has gained considerable attention in many visual recognition tasks. However, most existing OSDA approaches are limited due to three main reasons, including: (1) the lack of essential theoretical analysis of generalization bound, (2) the reliance on the coexistence of source and target data during adaptation, and (3) failing to accurately estimate the uncertainty of model predictions. We propose a Progressive Graph Learning (PGL) framework that decomposes the target hypothesis space into the shared and unknown subspaces, and then progressively pseudo-labels the most confident known samples from the target domain for hypothesis adaptation. Moreover, we tackle a more realistic source-free open-set domain adaptation (SF-OSDA) setting that makes no assumption about the coexistence of source and target domains, and introduce a balanced pseudo-labeling (BP-L) strategy in a two-stage framework, namely SF-PGL. Different from PGL that applies a class-agnostic constant threshold for all target samples for pseudo-labeling, the SF-PGL model uniformly selects the most confident target instances from each category at a fixed ratio. The confidence thresholds in each class are regarded as the 'uncertainty' of learning the semantic information, which are then used to weigh the classification loss in the adaptation step. We conducted unsupervised and semi-supervised OSDA and SF-OSDA experiments on the benchmark image classification and action recognition datasets. Additionally, we find that balanced pseudo-labeling plays a significant role in improving calibration, which makes the trained model less prone to over-confident or under-confident predictions on the target data.

    "title": "Improving Graph Collaborative Filtering with Neighborhood-enriched  Contrastive Learning",
    "abstract": "Recently, graph collaborative filtering methods have been proposed as an effective recommendation approach, which can capture users' preference over items by modeling the user-item interaction graphs. In order to reduce the influence of data sparsity, contrastive learning is adopted in graph collaborative filtering for enhancing the performance. However, these methods typically construct the contrastive pairs by random sampling, which neglect the neighboring relations among users (or items) and fail to fully exploit the potential of contrastive learning for recommendation. To tackle the above issue, we propose a novel contrastive learning approach, named Neighborhood-enriched Contrastive Learning, named NCL, which explicitly incorporates the potential neighbors into contrastive pairs. Specifically, we introduce the neighbors of a user (or an item) from graph structure and semantic space respectively. For the structural neighbors on the interaction graph, we develop a novel structure-contrastive objective that regards users (or items) and their structural neighbors as positive contrastive pairs. In implementation, the representations of users (or items) and neighbors correspond to the outputs of different GNN layers. Furthermore, to excavate the potential neighbor relation in semantic space, we assume that users with similar representations are within the semantic neighborhood, and incorporate these semantic neighbors into the prototype-contrastive objective. The proposed NCL can be optimized with EM algorithm and generalized to apply to graph collaborative filtering methods. Extensive experiments on five public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed NCL, notably with 26% and 17% performance gain over a competitive graph collaborative filtering base model on the Yelp and Amazon-book datasets respectively.

    "abstract": "Embedding based retrieval (EBR) is a fundamental building block in many web applications. However, EBR in sponsored search is distinguished from other generic scenarios and technically challenging due to the need of serving multiple retrieval purposes: firstly, it has to retrieve high-relevance ads, which may exactly serve user's search intent; secondly, it needs to retrieve high-CTR ads so as to maximize the overall user clicks. In this paper, we present a novel representation learning framework Uni-Retriever developed for Bing Search, which unifies two different training modes knowledge distillation and contrastive learning to realize both required objectives. On one hand, the capability of making high-relevance retrieval is established by distilling knowledge from the ``relevance teacher model''. On the other hand, the capability of making high-CTR retrieval is optimized by learning to discriminate user's clicked ads from the entire corpus. The two training modes are jointly performed as a multi-objective learning process, such that the ads of high relevance and CTR can be favored by the generated embeddings. Besides the learning strategy, we also elaborate our solution for EBR serving pipeline built upon the substantially optimized DiskANN, where massive-scale EBR can be performed with competitive time and memory efficiency, and accomplished in high-quality. We make comprehensive offline and online experiments to evaluate the proposed techniques, whose findings may provide useful insights for the future development of EBR systems. Uni-Retriever has been mainstreamed as the major retrieval path in Bing's production thanks to the notable improvements on the representation and EBR serving quality. ",

    "abstract": "In recent years, monitoring hate speech and offensive language on social media platforms has become paramount due to its widespread usage among all age groups, races, and ethnicities. Consequently, there have been substantial research efforts towards automated detection of such content using Natural Language Processing (NLP). While successfully filtering textual data, no research has focused on detecting hateful content in multimedia data. With increased ease of data storage and the exponential growth of social media platforms, multimedia content proliferates the internet as much as text data. Nevertheless, it escapes the automatic filtering systems. Hate speech and offensiveness can be detected in multimedia primarily via three modalities, i.e., visual, acoustic, and verbal. Our preliminary study concluded that the most essential features in classifying hate speech would be the speaker's emotional state and its influence on the spoken words, therefore limiting our current research to these modalities. This paper proposes the first multimodal deep learning framework to combine the auditory features representing emotion and the semantic features to detect hateful content. Our results demonstrate that incorporating emotional attributes leads to significant improvement over text-based models in detecting hateful multimedia content. This paper also presents a new Hate Speech Detection Video Dataset (HSDVD) collected for the purpose of multimodal learning as no such dataset exists today. ",

This problem has crucial applications in various contexts such as viral marketing or controlling the propagation of virus or rumours in real-world networks. Existing approaches for vital node identification mainly focus on capturing the importance of a node through a mathematical expression which directly relates structural properties of the node to its vitality. Although these heuristic approaches have achieved good performance in practice, they have weak adaptability, and their performance is limited to specific settings and certain dynamics. Inspired by the power of machine learning models for efficiently capturing different types of patterns and relations, we propose a machine learning-based, data driven approach for vital node identification. The main idea is to train the model with a small portion of the graph, say 0.5% of the nodes, and do the prediction on the rest of the nodes. The ground-truth vitality for the train data is computed by simulating the SIR diffusion method starting from the train nodes. We use collective feature engineering where each node in the network is represented by incorporating elements of its connectivity, degree and extended coreness. Several machine learning models are trained on the node representations, but the best results are achieved by a Support Vector Regression machine with RBF kernel. The empirical results confirms that the proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art models on a selection of datasets, while it also shows more adaptability to changes in the dynamics parameters. ",

We begin by proving that in general, controlling the spectral norm of the hidden layer weight matrix is insufficient to get uniform convergence guarantees (independent of the network width), while a stronger Frobenius norm control is sufficient, extending and improving on previous work. Motivated by the proof constructions, we identify and analyze two important settings where a mere spectral norm control turns out to be sufficient: First, when the network's activation functions are sufficiently smooth (with the result extending to deeper networks); and second, for certain types of convolutional networks. In the latter setting, we study how the sample complexity is additionally affected by parameters such as the amount of overlap between patches and the overall number of patches. ",

Existing graph representation learning methods (e.g., based on random walk and contrastive learning) are limited to maximizing the local similarity of connected nodes. Such pair-wise learning schemes could fail to capture the global distribution of representations, since it has no explicit constraints on the global geometric properties of representation space. To this end, we propose Geometric Graph Representation Learning (G2R) to learn node representations in an unsupervised manner via maximizing rate reduction. In this way, G2R maps nodes in distinct groups (implicitly stored in the adjacency matrix) into different subspaces, while each subspace is compact and different subspaces are dispersedly distributed. G2R adopts a graph neural network as the encoder and maximizes the rate reduction with the adjacency matrix. Furthermore, we theoretically and empirically demonstrate that rate reduction maximization is equivalent to maximizing the principal angles between different subspaces. Experiments on real-world datasets show that G2R outperforms various baselines on node classification and community detection tasks. ",

First, they are likely to be trained to be excessively powerful, generating even abnormal frames well, which leads to failure in detecting anomalies. Second, they are distracted by the large number of objects captured in both foreground and background. To solve these problems, we propose a novel superpixel-based video data transformation technique named Random Superpixel Erasing on Moving Objects (RandomSEMO) and Moving Object Loss (MOLoss), built on top of a simple lightweight autoencoder. RandomSEMO is applied to the moving object regions by randomly erasing their superpixels. It enforces the network to pay attention to the foreground objects and learn the normal features more effectively, rather than simply predicting the future frame. Moreover, MOLoss urges the model to focus on learning normal objects captured within RandomSEMO by amplifying the loss on the pixels near the moving objects. The experimental results show that our model outperforms state-of-the-arts on three benchmarks. ",

We use the population mobility data between Census Block Groups (CBGs), which is a finer-grained geographic level than community, to build the graph and capture the dependencies between CBGs using graph neural networks (GNNs). To mine as finer-grained patterns as possible for prediction, a spatial weighted aggregation module is introduced to aggregate the embeddings of CBGs to community level based on their geographic affiliation and spatial autocorrelation.

This paper proposes a novel light-weight Transformer network (LighTN) for task-oriented point cloud downsampling, as an end-to-end and plug-and-play solution. In LighTN, a single-head self-correlation module is presented to extract refined global contextual features, where three projection matrices are simultaneously eliminated to save resource overhead, and the output of symmetric matrix satisfies the permutation invariant. Then, we design a novel downsampling loss function to guide LighTN focuses on critical point cloud regions with more uniform distribution and prominent points coverage. Furthermore, We introduce a feed-forward network scaling mechanism to enhance the learnable capacity of LighTN according to the expand-reduce strategy.

The system allows a user to conceal their true voice identity information with no cooperation from the remote voice service: AltVoice re-synthesizes user's spoken audio to sound as if it has been spoken by a different, private identity. The system converts audio to its textual representation at its midpoint, and thus removes any linkage between the user's voice and the generated private voices. We implement AltVoice and we propose six different methods to generate private voice identities, each is based on a user-known secret. We identify the system's trade-offs, and we investigate them for each of the proposed identity generation methods. Specifically, we investigate generated voices' diversity, word error rate, perceived speech quality and the success of attackers under privacy compromise and authentication compromise attack scenarios. Our results show that AltVoice-generated voices are not easily linked to original users, enabling users to protect themselves from voice data leakages and allowing for the revocability of (generated) voice data; akin to using passwords. However the results also show further work is needed on ensuring that the produced audio is natural, and that identities of private voices are distinct from one another. We discuss the future steps into improving AltVoice and the new implications that its existence has for the creations of remotely accessed voice services. ",

    "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable success by extending traditional convolution to learning on non-Euclidean data. The key to the GNNs is adopting the neural message-passing paradigm with two stages: aggregation and update. The current design of GNNs considers the topology information in the aggregation stage. However, in the updating stage, all nodes share the same updating function. The identical updating function treats each node embedding as i.i.d. random variables and thus ignores the implicit relationships between neighborhoods, which limits the capacity of the GNNs. The updating function is usually implemented with a linear transformation followed by a non-linear activation function. To make the updating function topology-aware, we inject the topological information into the non-linear activation function and propose Graph-adaptive Rectified Linear Unit (GReLU), which is a new parametric activation function incorporating the neighborhood information in a novel and efficient way. The parameters of GReLU are obtained from a hyperfunction based on both node features and the corresponding adjacent matrix. To reduce the risk of overfitting and the computational cost, we decompose the hyperfunction as two independent components for nodes and features respectively. We conduct comprehensive experiments to show that our plug-and-play GReLU method is efficient and effective given different GNN backbones and various downstream tasks. ",

However, this is a notoriously ill-posed problem, especially for indoor scenarios, because of the complexity of indoor luminaires and the limited information involved in 2D images. In this paper, we propose a graph learning-based framework for indoor lighting estimation. At its core is a new lighting model (dubbed DSGLight) based on depth-augmented Spherical Gaussians (SG) and a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) that infers the new lighting representation from a single LDR image of limited field-of-view. Our lighting model builds 128 evenly distributed SGs over the indoor panorama, where each SG encoding the lighting and the depth around that node. The proposed GCN then learns the mapping from the input image to DSGLight. Compared with existing lighting models, our DSGLight encodes both direct lighting and indirect environmental lighting more faithfully and compactly. It also makes network training and inference more stable. The estimated depth distribution enables temporally stable shading and shadows under spatially-varying lighting. Through thorough experiments, we show that our method obviously outperforms existing methods both qualitatively and quantitatively. ",

    "abstract": "A query performance predictor estimates the retrieval effectiveness of an IR system for a given query. An important characteristic of QPP evaluation is that, since the ground truth retrieval effectiveness for QPP evaluation can be measured with different metrics, the ground truth itself is not absolute, which is in contrast to other retrieval tasks, such as that of ad-hoc retrieval. Motivated by this argument, the objective of this paper is to investigate how such variances in the ground truth for QPP evaluation can affect the outcomes of QPP experiments. We consider this not only in terms of the absolute values of the evaluation metrics being reported (e.g. Pearson's $r$, Kendall's $\\tau$), but also with respect to the changes in the ranks of different QPP systems when ordered by the QPP metric scores. Our experiments reveal that the observed QPP outcomes can vary considerably, both in terms of the absolute evaluation metric values and also in terms of the relative system ranks. Through our analysis, we report the optimal combinations of QPP evaluation metric and experimental settings that are likely to lead to smaller variations in the observed results. ",

    "abstract": "Recently network embedding has gained increasing attention due to its advantages in facilitating network computation tasks such as link prediction, node classification and node clustering. The objective of network embedding is to represent network nodes in a low-dimensional vector space while retaining as much information as possible from the original network including structural, relational, and semantic information. However, asymmetric nature of directed networks poses many challenges as how to best preserve edge directions in the embedding process. Here, we propose a novel deep asymmetric attributed network embedding model based on convolutional graph neural network, called AAGCN. The main idea is to maximally preserve the asymmetric proximity and asymmetric similarity of directed attributed networks. AAGCN introduces two neighbourhood feature aggregation schemes to separately aggregate the features of a node with the features of its in- and out- neighbours. Then, it learns two embedding vectors for each node, one source embedding vector and one target embedding vector. The final representations are the results of concatenating source and target embedding vectors. We test the performance of AAGCN on three real-world networks for network reconstruction, link prediction, node classification and visualization tasks. The experimental results show the superiority of AAGCN against state-of-the-art embedding methods. ",

Due to the stealthiness of backdoor attacks, it is hard either to detect or erase the backdoor from infected models. In this paper, we propose a new Adversarial Fine-Tuning (AFT) approach to erase backdoor triggers by leveraging adversarial examples of the infected model. For an infected model, we observe that its adversarial examples have similar behaviors as its triggered samples. Based on such observation, we design the AFT to break the foundation of the backdoor attack (i.e., the strong correlation between a trigger and a target label). We empirically show that, against 5 state-of-the-art backdoor attacks, AFT can effectively erase the backdoor triggers without obvious performance degradation on clean samples, which significantly outperforms existing defense methods.

The major limitation of existing solutions is that they highly rely on the deep features, which are overly dependent on data size and hard to generalize on unseen data. How to leverage the open-domain unlabeled traffic data to learn representation with strong generalization ability remains a key challenge. In this paper,we propose a new traffic representation model called Encrypted Traffic Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformer (ET-BERT), which pre-trains deep contextualized datagram-level representation from large-scale unlabeled data. The pre-trained model can be fine-tuned on a small number of task-specific labeled data and achieves state-of-the-art performance across five encrypted traffic classification tasks, remarkably pushing the F1 of ISCX-Tor to 99.2% (4.4% absolute improvement), ISCX-VPN-Service to 98.9% (5.2% absolute improvement), Cross-Platform (Android) to 92.5% (5.4% absolute improvement), CSTNET-TLS 1.3 to 97.4% (10.0% absolute improvement).

Given that there have been many studies focusing on defending against model poisoning attacks, it is necessary to survey the existing work and provide insights to inspire future research. In this paper, we first classify defense mechanisms for model poisoning attacks into two categories: evaluation methods for local model updates and aggregation methods for the global model.

However, they often lead to solutions that lack coherence. In this work, we show that an underlying reason for model degeneration is the anisotropic distribution of token representations. We present a contrastive solution: (i) SimCTG, a contrastive training objective to calibrate the model's representation space, and (ii) a decoding method -- contrastive search -- to encourage diversity while maintaining coherence in the generated text.

In this paper, we propose a two time-scales RAN slicing mechanism to optimize the performance of URLLC and eMBB services. In a large time-scale, an SDN controller allocates radio resources to gNodeBs according to the requirements of the eMBB and URLLC services. In a short time-scale, each gNodeB allocates its available resources to its end-users and requests, if needed, additional resources from adjacent gNodeBs. We formulate this problem as a non-linear binary program and prove its NP-hardness. Next, for each time-scale, we model the problem as a Markov decision process (MDP), where the large-time scale is modeled as a single agent MDP whereas the shorter time-scale is modeled as a multi-agent MDP. We leverage the exponential-weight algorithm for exploration and exploitation (EXP3) to solve the single-agent MDP of the large time-scale MDP and the multi-agent deep Q-learning (DQL) algorithm to solve the multi-agent MDP of the short time-scale resource allocation. Extensive simulations show that our approach is efficient under different network parameters configuration and it outperforms recent benchmark solutions. ",

    "abstract": "Contrastive learning (CL), a self-supervised learning approach, can effectively learn visual representations from unlabeled data. However, CL requires learning on vast quantities of diverse data to achieve good performance, without which the performance of CL will greatly degrade. To tackle this problem, we propose a framework with two approaches to improve the data efficiency of CL training by generating beneficial samples and joint learning. The first approach generates hard samples for the main model. The generator is jointly learned with the main model to dynamically customize hard samples based on the training state of the main model. With the progressively growing knowledge of the main model, the generated samples also become harder to constantly encourage the main model to learn better representations. Besides, a pair of data generators are proposed to generate similar but distinct samples as positive pairs. In joint learning, the hardness of a positive pair is progressively increased by decreasing their similarity. In this way, the main model learns to cluster hard positives by pulling the representations of similar yet distinct samples together, by which the representations of similar samples are well-clustered and better representations can be learned. Comprehensive experiments show superior accuracy and data efficiency of the proposed methods over the state-of-the-art on multiple datasets. For example, about 5% accuracy improvement on ImageNet-100 and CIFAR-10, and more than 6% accuracy improvement on CIFAR-100 are achieved for linear classification. Besides, up to 2x data efficiency for linear classification and up to 5x data efficiency for transfer learning are achieved. ",

This opacity may lead to distrust in their prediction and hamper their wider adoption in safety-critical applications. In recent, the program reduction technique is widely being used to identify key input features in order to explain the prediction of CI models. The approach removes irrelevant parts from an input program and keeps the minimal snippets that a CI model needs to maintain its prediction. However, the state-of-the-art approaches mainly use a syntax-unaware program reduction technique that does not follow the syntax of programs, which adds significant overhead to the reduction of input programs and explainability of models. In this paper, we apply a syntax-guided program reduction technique that follows the syntax of input programs during reduction. Our experiments on multiple models across different types of input programs show that the syntax-guided program reduction technique significantly outperforms the syntax-unaware program reduction technique in reducing the size of input programs. Extracting key input features from reduced programs reveals that the syntax-guided reduced programs contain more label-specific key input features and are more vulnerable to adversarial transformation when renaming the key tokens in programs. These label-specific key input features may help to understand the reasoning of models' prediction from different perspectives and increase the trustworthiness to correct classification given by CI models.

Moreover, we implement a Fast Bitwise Computation Kernel for BiFSMN on ARMv8 devices which fully utilizes registers and increases instruction throughput to push the limit of deployment efficiency. Extensive experiments show that BiFSMN outperforms existing binarization methods by convincing margins on various datasets and is even comparable with the full-precision counterpart (e.g., less than 3% drop on Speech Commands V1-12).

Pruning methods have been considered in adversarial context to reduce model capacity and improve adversarial robustness simultaneously in training. Existing adversarial pruning methods generally mimic the classical pruning methods for natural training, which follow the three-stage 'training-pruning-fine-tuning' pipelines. We observe that such pruning methods do not necessarily preserve the dynamics of dense networks, making it potentially hard to be fine-tuned to compensate the accuracy degradation in pruning. Based on recent works of \\textit{Neural Tangent Kernel} (NTK), we systematically study the dynamics of adversarial training and prove the existence of trainable sparse sub-network at initialization which can be trained to be adversarial robust from scratch. This theoretically verifies the \\textit{lottery ticket hypothesis} in adversarial context and we refer such sub-network structure as \\textit{Adversarial Winning Ticket} (AWT).

Such centralizations of sensitive data demand practical privacy protections. One widely-applied paradigm, Differential Privacy, can provide strong guarantees over sensitive data by adding noises. However, directly applying DP for IoV incurs significant challenges for data utility and effective protection. We observe that the key issue about DP-enabled protection in IoV lies in how to synergistically combine DP with special characteristics of IoV, whose query sequences are usually formed as unbalanced batches due to frequent interactions between centralized servers and edge vehicles. To this end, we propose HUT, a new algorithm to enable High UTility for DP-enabled protection in IoV. Our key insight is to leverage the inherent characteristics in IoV: the unbalanced batches. Our key idea is to aggregate local batches and apply Order Constraints, so that information loss from DP protection can be mitigated.

    "abstract": "Predicting stochastic spreading processes on complex networks is critical in epidemic control, opinion propagation, and viral marketing. We focus on the problem of inferring the time-dependent marginal probabilities of states for each node which collectively quantifies the spreading results. Dynamic Message Passing (DMP) has been developed as an efficient inference algorithm for several spreading models, and it is asymptotically exact on locally tree-like networks. However, DMP can struggle in diffusion networks with lots of local loops. We address this limitation by using Graph Neural Networks (GNN) to learn the dependency amongst messages implicitly. Specifically, we propose a hybrid model in which the GNN module runs jointly with DMP equations. The GNN module refines the aggregated messages in DMP iterations by learning from simulation data. We demonstrate numerically that after training, our model's inference accuracy substantially outperforms DMP in conditions of various network structure and dynamics parameters. Moreover, compared to pure data-driven models, the proposed hybrid model has a better generalization ability for out-of-training cases, profiting from the explicitly utilized dynamics priors in the hybrid model. A PyTorch implementation of our model is at https://github.com/FeiGSSS/NEDMP. ",

In this article, we propose an analytic convolutional neural network learning (ACnnL). Theoretically we show that ACnnL builds a closed-form solution similar to its MLP counterpart, but differs in their regularization constraints. Consequently, we are able to answer to a certain extent why CNNs usually generalize better than MLPs from the implicit regularization point of view. The ACnnL is validated by conducting classification tasks on several benchmark datasets. It is encouraging that the ACnnL trains CNNs in a significantly fast manner with reasonably close prediction accuracies to those using BP. Moreover, our experiments disclose a unique advantage of ACnnL under the small-sample scenario when training data are scarce or expensive. ",

Prototypical learning based adversarial discriminative domain adaptation method is developed to encode the inherent emotion-related semantic structure of EEG data. Pairwise learning with an adaptive pseudo-labeling method is proposed to achieve a reliable and stable model learning with noisy labels. Through domain adaptation, besides aligning the feature representation of the source and the target on a shared feature space, the feature separability of both source and target domains is also considered. The characterized prototypical representations are evident with a high feature concentration within one single emotion category and a high feature separability across different emotion categories. Extensive experiments are conducted on two benchmark databases (SEED and SEED-IV) for recognizing three and four emotion categories using four cross-validation evaluation protocols. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed PR-PL against the state-of-the-art methods on cross-subject cross-session, cross-subject within-session, within-subject cross-session, and within-subject within-session evaluation protocols, which shows the power of PR-PL in dealing with the ambiguity of neurophysiological responses in affective studies.

Well-written code summaries are beneficial for programmers to participate in the software development and maintenance process. To learn the semantic representations of source code, recent efforts focus on incorporating the syntax structure of code into neural networks such as Transformer. Such Transformer-based approaches can better capture the long-range dependencies than other neural networks including Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), however, most of them do not consider the structural relative correlations between tokens, e.g., relative positions in Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs), which is beneficial for code semantics learning. To model the structural dependency, we propose a Structural Relative Position guided Transformer, named SCRIPT. SCRIPT first obtains the structural relative positions between tokens via parsing the ASTs of source code, and then passes them into two types of Transformer encoders. One Transformer directly adjusts the input according to the structural relative distance; and the other Transformer encodes the structural relative positions during computing the self-attention scores. Finally, we stack these two types of Transformer encoders to learn representations of source code. Experimental results show that the proposed SCRIPT outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by at least 1.6%, 1.4% and 2.8% with respect to BLEU, ROUGE-L and METEOR on benchmark datasets, respectively.

    "abstract": "Modern neural networks often have great expressive power and can be trained to overfit the training data, while still achieving a good test performance. This phenomenon is referred to as \"benign overfitting\". Recently, there emerges a line of works studying \"benign overfitting\" from the theoretical perspective. However, they are limited to linear models or kernel/random feature models, and there is still a lack of theoretical understanding about when and how benign overfitting occurs in neural networks. In this paper, we study the benign overfitting phenomenon in training a two-layer convolutional neural network (CNN). We show that when the signal-to-noise ratio satisfies a certain condition, a two-layer CNN trained by gradient descent can achieve arbitrarily small training and test loss. On the other hand, when this condition does not hold, overfitting becomes harmful and the obtained CNN can only achieve constant level test loss. These together demonstrate a sharp phase transition between benign overfitting and harmful overfitting, driven by the signal-to-noise ratio. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that precisely characterizes the conditions under which benign overfitting can occur in training convolutional neural networks. ",

In this work, we show that the success of these attacks is largely due to duplication in commonly used web-scraped training sets. We first show that the rate at which language models regenerate training sequences is superlinearly related to a sequence's count in the training set. For instance, a sequence that is present 10 times in the training data is on average generated ~1000 times more often than a sequence that is present only once. We next show that existing methods for detecting memorized sequences have near-chance accuracy on non-duplicated training sequences. Finally, we find that after applying methods to deduplicate training data, language models are considerably more secure against these types of privacy attacks. Taken together, our results motivate an increased focus on deduplication in privacy-sensitive applications and a reevaluation of the practicality of existing privacy attacks. ",

Such environments are modeled as discrete Markov decision processes with both states and actions represented through a feature vector. The underlying structure of the environments allows the transition dynamics to be factored into two components: one that is environment-specific and another one that is shared. Consider a set of environments that share the laws of motion as an illustrative example. In this setting, the agent can take a finite amount of reward-free interactions from a subset of these environments. The agent then must be able to approximately solve any planning task defined over any environment in the original set, relying on the above interactions only. Can we design a provably efficient algorithm that achieves this ambitious goal of systematic generalization? In this paper, we give a partially positive answer to this question. First, we provide the first tractable formulation of systematic generalization by employing a causal viewpoint. Then, under specific structural assumptions, we provide a simple learning algorithm that allows us to guarantee any desired planning error up to an unavoidable sub-optimality term, while showcasing a polynomial sample complexity.

In earlier access control systems, attackers were able to violate proximity-verification through relay station attacks. However, the vulnerability of Bluetooth against such attacks was yet unclear as existing relay attack strategies are not applicable or can be defeated through wireless distance measurement. In this paper, we design and implement an analog physical-layer relay attack based on low-cost off-the-shelf radio hardware to simultaneously increase the wireless communication range and manipulate distance measurements. Using our setup, we successfully demonstrate relay attacks against Bluetooth-based access control of a car and a smart lock.

We show that Saute MDP satisfies the Bellman equation and moves us closer to solving Safe RL with constraints satisfied almost surely. We argue that Saute MDP allows to view Safe RL problem from a different perspective enabling new features. For instance, our approach has a plug-and-play nature, i.e., any RL algorithm can be \"sauteed\". Additionally, state augmentation allows for policy generalization across safety constraints. We finally show that Saute RL algorithms can outperform their state-of-the-art counterparts when constraint satisfaction is of high importance. ",

Most of the existing deep-learning-based methods constrain the network to generate derained images but few of them explore features from intermediate layers, different levels, and different modules which are beneficial for rain streaks removal. In this paper, we propose a high-order collaborative network with multi-scale compact constraints and a bidirectional scale-content similarity mining module to exploit features from deep networks externally and internally for rain streaks removal. Externally, we design a deraining framework with three sub-networks trained in a collaborative manner, where the bottom network transmits intermediate features to the middle network which also receives shallower rainy features from the top network and sends back features to the bottom network. Internally, we enforce multi-scale compact constraints on the intermediate layers of deep networks to learn useful features via a Laplacian pyramid. Further, we develop a bidirectional scale-content similarity mining module to explore features at different scales in a down-to-up and up-to-down manner. To improve the model performance on real-world images, we propose an online-update learning approach, which uses real-world rainy images to fine-tune the network and update the deraining results in a self-supervised manner.

Almost all existing log parsers follow the general idea of extracting the common part as templates and the dynamic part as parameters. However, these log parsing methods, often neglect the semantic meaning of log messages. Furthermore, high diversity among various log sources also poses an obstacle in the generalization of log parsing across different systems. In this paper, we propose UniParser to capture the common logging behaviours from heterogeneous log data. UniParser utilizes a Token Encoder module and a Context Encoder module to learn the patterns from the log token and its neighbouring context. A Context Similarity module is specially designed to model the commonalities of learned patterns. We have performed extensive experiments on 16 public log datasets and our results show that UniParser outperperforms state-of-the-art log parsers by a large margin. ",

Then, we combine the similarity measure module and the idea of adjacency-wise normalization with node-wise and batch-wise normalization and then propound partial neighborhood normalization methods to overcome the training difficulty while mitigating the impact of too much noise caused by high-density of graph. Finally, we put forward intermediate information supplement to solve the information limitation. Experiments are conducted on Yelp and Amazon datasets.

    "abstract": "This paper presents algorithms for local inversion of maps and shows how several important computational problems such as cryptanalysis of symmetric encryption algorithms, RSA algorithm and solving the elliptic curve discrete log problem (ECDLP) can be addressed as local inversion problems. The methodology is termed as the \\emph{Local Inversion Attack}. It utilizes the concept of \\emph{Linear Complexity} (LC) of a recurrence sequence generated by the map defined by the cryptanalysis problem and the given data. It is shown that when the LC of the recurrence is bounded by a bound of polynomial order in the bit length of the input to the map, the local inversion can be accomplished in polynomial time. Hence an incomplete local inversion algorithm which searches a solution within a specified bound on computation can estimate the density of weak cases of cryptanalysis defined by such data causing low LC. Such cases can happen accidentally but cannot be avoided in practice and are fatal insecurity flaws of cryptographic primitives which are wrongly assumed to be secure on the basis of exponential average case complexity. An incomplete algorithm is proposed for solving problems such as key recovery of symmetric encryption algorithms, decryption of RSA ciphertext without factoring the modulus, decrypting any ciphertext of RSA given one plaintext ciphertext pair created with same private key in chosen ciphertext attack and solving the discrete logarithm on elliptic curves over finite fields (ECDLP) as local inversion problems. It is shown that when the LCs of the respective recurrences for given data are small, solutions of these problems are possible in practically feasible time and memory resources. ",

The network structure, personalization, and complexity are also discussed and compared. Next, we provide benchmarks of the major neural re-ranking models and quantitatively analyze their re-ranking performance. Finally, the review concludes with a discussion on future prospects of this field. A list of papers discussed in this review, the benchmark datasets, our re-ranking library LibRerank, and detailed parameter settings are publicly available at https://github.com/LibRerank-Community/LibRerank.

    "title": "What is Next when Sequential Prediction Meets Implicitly Hard  Interaction?",
    "abstract": "Hard interaction learning between source sequences and their next targets is challenging, which exists in a myriad of sequential prediction tasks. During the training process, most existing methods focus on explicitly hard interactions caused by wrong responses. However, a model might conduct correct responses by capturing a subset of learnable patterns, which results in implicitly hard interactions with some unlearned patterns. As such, its generalization performance is weakened. The problem gets more serious in sequential prediction due to the interference of substantial similar candidate targets. To this end, we propose a Hardness Aware Interaction Learning framework (HAIL) that mainly consists of two base sequential learning networks and mutual exclusivity distillation (MED). The base networks are initialized differently to learn distinctive view patterns, thus gaining different training experiences. The experiences in the form of the unlikelihood of correct responses are drawn from each other by MED, which provides mutual exclusivity knowledge to figure out implicitly hard interactions. Moreover, we deduce that the unlikelihood essentially introduces additional gradients to push the pattern learning of correct responses. Our framework can be easily extended to more peer base networks. Evaluation is conducted on four datasets covering cyber and physical spaces. The experimental results demonstrate that our framework outperforms several state-of-the-art methods in terms of top-k based metrics. ",

    "title": "On the Complexity of Object Detection on Real-world Public  Transportation Images for Social Distancing Measurement",
    "abstract": "Social distancing in public spaces has become an essential aspect in helping to reduce the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Exploiting recent advances in machine learning, there have been many studies in the literature implementing social distancing via object detection through the use of surveillance cameras in public spaces. However, to date, there has been no study of social distance measurement on public transport. The public transport setting has some unique challenges, including some low-resolution images and camera locations that can lead to the partial occlusion of passengers, which make it challenging to perform accurate detection. Thus, in this paper, we investigate the challenges of performing accurate social distance measurement on public transportation. We benchmark several state-of-the-art object detection algorithms using real-world footage taken from the London Underground and bus network. The work highlights the complexity of performing social distancing measurement on images from current public transportation onboard cameras. Further, exploiting domain knowledge of expected passenger behaviour, we attempt to improve the quality of the detections using various strategies and show improvement over using vanilla object detection alone.

    "abstract": "The performance of neural code search is significantly influenced by the quality of the training data from which the neural models are derived. A large corpus of high-quality query and code pairs is demanded to establish a precise mapping from the natural language to the programming language. Due to the limited availability, most widely-used code search datasets are established with compromise, such as using code comments as a replacement of queries. Our empirical study on a famous code search dataset reveals that over one-third of its queries contain noises that make them deviate from natural user queries. Models trained through noisy data are faced with severe performance degradation when applied in real-world scenarios. To improve the dataset quality and make the queries of its samples semantically identical to real user queries is critical for the practical usability of neural code search. In this paper, we propose a data cleaning framework consisting of two subsequent filters: a rule-based syntactic filter and a model-based semantic filter. This is the first framework that applies semantic query cleaning to code search datasets. Experimentally, we evaluated the effectiveness of our framework on two widely-used code search models and three manually-annotated code retrieval benchmarks. Training the popular DeepCS model with the filtered dataset from our framework improves its performance by 19.2% MRR and 21.3% Answer@1, on average with the three validation benchmarks. ",

At the top-most level, approaches are divided into ones that require training - supervised and ones that do not - unsupervised. In this study, we are interested in settings, where for a language under investigation, no training data is available. More specifically, we explore whether pretrained multilingual language models can be employed for zero-shot cross-lingual keyword extraction on low-resource languages with limited or no available labeled training data and whether they outperform state-of-the-art unsupervised keyword extractors. The comparison is conducted on six news article datasets covering two high-resource languages, English and Russian, and four low-resource languages, Croatian, Estonian, Latvian, and Slovenian. We find that the pretrained models fine-tuned on a multilingual corpus covering languages that do not appear in the test set (i.e. in a zero-shot setting), consistently outscore unsupervised models in all six languages.

    "abstract": "Convolutional neural networks have become a popular research in the field of finger vein recognition because of their powerful image feature representation. However, most researchers focus on improving the performance of the network by increasing the CNN depth and width, which often requires high computational effort. Moreover, we can notice that not only the importance of pixels in different channels is different, but also the importance of pixels in different positions of the same channel is different. To reduce the computational effort and to take into account the different importance of pixels, we propose a lightweight convolutional neural network with a convolutional block attention module (CBAM) for finger vein recognition, which can achieve a more accurate capture of visual structures through an attention mechanism. First, image sequences are fed into a lightweight convolutional neural network we designed to improve visual features. Afterwards, it learns to assign feature weights in an adaptive manner with the help of a convolutional block attention module. The experiments are carried out on two publicly available databases and the results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves a stable, highly accurate, and robust performance in multimodal finger recognition.

    "abstract": "We study the problem of extracting accurate correspondences for point cloud registration. Recent keypoint-free methods bypass the detection of repeatable keypoints which is difficult in low-overlap scenarios, showing great potential in registration. They seek correspondences over downsampled superpoints, which are then propagated to dense points. Superpoints are matched based on whether their neighboring patches overlap. Such sparse and loose matching requires contextual features capturing the geometric structure of the point clouds. We propose Geometric Transformer to learn geometric feature for robust superpoint matching. It encodes pair-wise distances and triplet-wise angles, making it robust in low-overlap cases and invariant to rigid transformation. The simplistic design attains surprisingly high matching accuracy such that no RANSAC is required in the estimation of alignment transformation, leading to $100$ times acceleration. Our method improves the inlier ratio by 17\\%$\\sim$30\\% and the registration recall by over 7\\% on the challenging 3DLoMatch benchmark.

    "abstract": "Code completion is an essential feature of IDEs, yet current autocompleters are restricted to either grammar-based or NLP-based single token completions. Both approaches have significant drawbacks: grammar-based autocompletion is restricted in dynamically-typed language environments, whereas NLP-based autocompleters struggle to understand the semantics of the programming language and the developer's code context. In this work, we present CodeFill, a language model for autocompletion that combines learned structure and naming information. Using a parallel Transformer architecture and multi-task learning, CodeFill consumes sequences of source code token names and their equivalent AST token types. Uniquely, CodeFill is trained both for single-token and multi-token (statement) prediction, which enables it to learn long-range dependencies among grammatical and naming elements. We train CodeFill on two datasets, consisting of 29M and 425M lines of code, respectively. To make the evaluation more realistic, we develop a method to automatically infer points in the source code at which completion matters. We compare CodeFill against four baselines and two state-of-the-art models, GPT-C and TravTrans+.CodeFill surpasses all baselines in single token prediction (MRR: 70.9% vs. 66.2% and 67.8%) and outperforms the state of the art for multi-token prediction (ROUGE-L: 63.7% vs. 52.4% and 59.2%, for n=4 tokens).

    "abstract": "News recommendation is critical for personalized news distribution. Federated news recommendation enables collaborative model learning from many clients without sharing their raw data. It is promising for privacy-preserving news recommendation. However, the security of federated news recommendation is still unclear. In this paper, we study this problem by proposing an untargeted attack called UA-FedRec. By exploiting the prior knowledge of news recommendation and federated learning, UA-FedRec can effectively degrade the model performance with a small percentage of malicious clients. First, the effectiveness of news recommendation highly depends on user modeling and news modeling. We design a news similarity perturbation method to make representations of similar news farther and those of dissimilar news closer to interrupt news modeling, and propose a user model perturbation method to make malicious user updates in opposite directions of benign updates to interrupt user modeling. Second, updates from different clients are typically aggregated by weighted-averaging based on their sample sizes. We propose a quantity perturbation method to enlarge sample sizes of malicious clients in a reasonable range to amplify the impact of malicious updates. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets show that UA-FedRec can effectively degrade the accuracy of existing federated news recommendation methods, even when defense is applied. Our study reveals a critical security issue in existing federated news recommendation systems and calls for research efforts to address the issue. ",

    "abstract": "Influenced by deep penetration of the new generation of information technology, power systems have gradually evolved into highly coupled cyber-physical systems (CPS). Among many possible power CPS network attacks, a false data injection attacks (FDIAs) is the most serious. Taking account of the fact that the existing knowledge-driven detection process for FDIAs has been in a passive detection state for a long time and ignores the advantages of data-driven active capture of features, an active and passive hybrid detection method for power CPS FDIAs with improved adaptive Kalman filter (AKF) and convolutional neural networks (CNN) is proposed in this paper. First, we analyze the shortcomings of the traditional AKF algorithm in terms of filtering divergence and calculation speed. The state estimation algorithm based on non-negative positive-definite adaptive Kalman filter (NDAKF) is improved, and a passive detection method of FDIAs is constructed, with similarity Euclidean distance detection and residual detection at its core. Then, combined with the advantages of gate recurrent unit (GRU) and CNN in terms of temporal memory and feature-expression ability, an active detection method of FDIAs based on a GRU-CNN hybrid neural network is proposed. Finally, the results of joint knowledge-driven and data-driven parallel detection are used to define a mixed fixed-calculation formula, and an active and passive hybrid detection method of FDIAs is established, considering the characteristic constraints of the parallel mode. A simulation system example of power CPS FDIAs verifies the effectiveness and accuracy of the method proposed in this paper. ",

    "abstract": "Short-term passenger flow prediction plays an important role in better managing the urban rail transit (URT) systems. Emerging deep learning models provide good insights to improve short-term prediction accuracy. However, a large number of existing prediction models combine diverse neural network layers to improve accuracy, making their model structures extremely complex and difficult to be applied to the real world. Therefore, it is necessary to trade off between the model complexity and prediction performance from the perspective of real-world applications. To this end, we propose a deep learning-based Graph-GAN model with a simple structure and high prediction accuracy to predict short-term passenger flows of the URT network. The Graph-GAN consists of two major parts: (1) a simplified and static version of the graph convolution network (GCN) used to extract network topological information; (2) a generative adversarial network (GAN) used to predict passenger flows, with generators and discriminators in GAN just composed of simple fully connected neural networks. The Graph-GAN is tested on two large-scale real-world datasets from Beijing Subway. A comparison of the prediction performance of Graph-GAN with those of several state-of-the-art models illustrates its superiority and robustness. This study can provide critical experience in conducting short-term passenger flow predictions, especially from the perspective of real-world applications. ",

    "abstract": "Random walks on networks are widely used to model stochastic processes such as search strategies, transportation problems or disease propagation. A prominent biological example of search by random walkers on a network is the guiding of naive T cells by the lymphatic conduits network in the lymph node. Motivated by this case study, we propose a general framework to find network heterogeneities, which we define as connectivity patterns that affect the random walk. We propose to characterize and measure these heterogeneities by i) ranking nodes and ii) detecting communities in a way that is interpretable in terms of random walk, moreover, we propose iii) an approximation to accurately and efficiently compute these quantities on large networks. The ranking parameter we propose is the probability of presence field, and the community detection method adapts previously defined diffusion coordinates. In addition, we propose an interactive data visualization platform to follow the dynamics of the random walks and their characteristics on our datasets, and a ready-to-use pipeline for other datasets upon download. We first showcase the properties of our method on toy models. We highlight this way the efficiency of our methods at contrasting two highly similar networks (identical degree distribution, same number of nodes). Moreover, we show numerically that the ranking and communities defined in this way are not redundant with any other classical methods (centralities, global mean first passage, louvain, node2vec). We then use our methods to characterize the lymph node conduits network. We show that the lymph node conduits network appears homogeneous and therefore has a global structure that promotes a uniform exploration of space by T-cells. ",

    "abstract": "Although deep neural networks have been immensely successful, there is no comprehensive theoretical understanding of how they work or are structured. As a result, deep networks are often seen as black boxes with unclear interpretations and reliability. Understanding the performance of deep neural networks is one of the greatest scientific challenges. This work aims to apply principles and techniques from information theory to deep learning models to increase our theoretical understanding and design better algorithms. We first describe our information-theoretic approach to deep learning. Then, we propose using the Information Bottleneck (IB) theory to explain deep learning systems. The novel paradigm for analyzing networks sheds light on their layered structure, generalization abilities, and learning dynamics. We later discuss one of the most challenging problems of applying the IB to deep neural networks - estimating mutual information. Recent theoretical developments, such as the neural tangent kernel (NTK) framework, are used to investigate generalization signals. In our study, we obtained tractable computations of many information-theoretic quantities and their bounds for infinite ensembles of infinitely wide neural networks. With these derivations, we can determine how compression, generalization, and sample size pertain to the network and how they are related. At the end, we present the dual Information Bottleneck (dualIB). This new information-theoretic framework resolves some of the IB's shortcomings by merely switching terms in the distortion function. The dualIB can account for known data features and use them to make better predictions over unseen examples. The underlying structure and the optimal representations are uncovered through an analytical framework, and a variational framework using deep neural networks optimizes has been used. ",

However, in real scenarios, modeling the environment with high accuracy is often impossible. In this work we aim at developing a control framework for OMAVs for reliable physical interaction tasks with articulated and movable objects in the presence of possibly unforeseen disturbances, and without relying on an accurate model of the environment. Inspired by previous applications of energy-based controllers for physical interaction, we propose a passivity-based impedance and wrench tracking controller in combination with a momentum-based wrench estimator. This is combined with an energy-tank framework to guarantee the stability of the system, while energy and power flow-based adaptation policies are deployed to enable safe interaction with any type of passive environment. The control framework provides formal guarantees of stability, which is validated in practice considering the challenging task of pushing a cart of unknown mass, moving on a surface of unknown friction, as well as subjected to unknown disturbances. For this scenario, we present, evaluate and discuss three different policies. ",

Besides, the method has very good properties with respect to the distribution of mesh points, thus no mesh smoothing or regularization technique is required. A generalization of the introduced scheme to the case of anisotropic surface energies and non-neutral external boundaries is also considered. Numerical results are presented for the evolution of two-dimensional curve networks and three-dimensional surface clusters in the cases of both isotropic and anisotropic surface energies. ",

While this approach has found considerable success in the forecasting domain, it has not been explored earlier for any natural language processing task. The method relies on creating and learning an underlying graph from the raw data and thereby using the adjacency matrix to shift to the graph Fourier domain. Subsequently, Fourier transform is used to switch to the frequency (spectral) domain where new features are created. These series of transformation proved to be extremely efficient in learning the right representation as we have found that our model achieves the best result on both the SemEval-2014 datasets, i.e., \"Laptop\" and \"Restaurants\" domain.

This is the first approximation algorithm for the problem that achieves a subpolynomial in $n$ approximation factor (albeit only in graphs whose maximum vertex degree is subpolynomial in $n$). In order to achieve this approximation factor, we design a new algorithm for a closely related problem called Crossing Number with Rotation System, in which, for every vertex $v\\in V(G)$, the circular ordering, in which the images of the edges incident to $v$ must enter the image of $v$ in the drawing is fixed as part of the input. Combining this result with the recent reduction of [Chuzhoy, Mahabadi, Tan '20] immediately yields the improved approximation algorithm for Minimum Crossing Number. We introduce several new technical tools, that we hope will be helpful in obtaining better algorithms for the problem in the future. ",

In this paper, we focus on Sequential Pattern Mining (SPM), a fundamental topic in knowledge discovery that faces a well-known memory bottleneck.

In particular, we develop trie-based dataset models and associated mining algorithms that can represent as well as effectively mine orders of magnitude larger datasets compared to the state of the art.

    "abstract": "Recently, many pre-trained language models for source code have been proposed to model the context of code and serve as a basis for downstream code intelligence tasks such as code completion, code search, and code summarization. These models leverage masked pre-training and Transformer and have achieved promising results. However, currently there is still little progress regarding interpretability of existing pre-trained code models. It is not clear why these models work and what feature correlations they can capture. In this paper, we conduct a thorough structural analysis aiming to provide an interpretation of pre-trained language models for source code (e.g., CodeBERT, and GraphCodeBERT) from three distinctive perspectives: (1) attention analysis, (2) probing on the word embedding, and (3) syntax tree induction. Through comprehensive analysis, this paper reveals several insightful findings that may inspire future studies: (1) Attention aligns strongly with the syntax structure of code. (2) Pre-training language models of code can preserve the syntax structure of code in the intermediate representations of each Transformer layer. (3) The pre-trained models of code have the ability of inducing syntax trees of code. Theses findings suggest that it may be helpful to incorporate the syntax structure of code into the process of pre-training for better code representations. ",

For graph learning, points in hyperbolic space have been used successfully as signals in deep neural networks: e.g. hyperbolic graph convolutional networks (GCN) can outperform vanilla GCN. However, existing hyperbolic networks are computationally expensive and can be numerically unstable, and cannot scale to large graphs due to these shortcomings. In this paper, we propose HyLa, a completely different approach to using hyperbolic space in graph learning: HyLa maps once from a learned hyperbolic-space embedding to Euclidean space via the eigenfunctions of the Laplacian operator in the hyperbolic space. Our method is inspired by the random Fourier feature methodology, which uses the eigenfunctions of the Laplacian in Euclidean space. We evaluate HyLa on downstream tasks including node classification and text classification, where HyLa shows significant improvements over hyperbolic GCN and other baselines. ",

Inspired by the defense in depth principle, we propose AnoMili, a novel protection system for the MIL-STD-1553 bus, which consists of: (i) a physical intrusion detection mechanism that detects unauthorized devices connected to the 1553 bus, even if they are passive (sniffing), (ii) a device fingerprinting mechanism that protects against spoofing attacks (two approaches are proposed: prevention and detection), (iii) a context-based anomaly detection mechanism, and (iv) an anomaly explanation engine responsible for explaining the detected anomalies in real time. We evaluate AnoMili's effectiveness and practicability in two real 1553 hardware-based testbeds. The effectiveness of the anomaly explanation engine is also demonstrated. All of the detection and prevention mechanisms employed had high detection rates (over 99.45%) with low false positive rates.

We describe the implementation of DeCorus an online log anomaly detection tool for network device syslog messages deployed at a cloud service provider. We use real-world data sets that consist of $1.5$ billion network device syslog messages and hundreds of incident tickets to characterize the performance of DeCorus and compare its ability to detect incidents with five alternative anomaly detectors.

    "title": "A Generic Self-Supervised Framework of Learning Invariant Discriminative  Features",
    "abstract": "Self-supervised learning (SSL) has become a popular method for generating invariant representations without the need for human annotations. Nonetheless, the desired invariant representation is achieved by utilising prior online transformation functions on the input data. As a result, each SSL framework is customised for a particular data type, e.g., visual data, and further modifications are required if it is used for other dataset types. On the other hand, autoencoder (AE), which is a generic and widely applicable framework, mainly focuses on dimension reduction and is not suited for learning invariant representation. This paper proposes a generic SSL framework based on a constrained self-labelling assignment process that prevents degenerate solutions. Specifically, the prior transformation functions are replaced with a self-transformation mechanism, derived through an unsupervised training process of adversarial training, for imposing invariant representations. Via the self-transformation mechanism, pairs of augmented instances can be generated from the same input data. Finally, a training objective based on contrastive learning is designed by leveraging both the self-labelling assignment and the self-transformation mechanism. Despite the fact that the self-transformation process is very generic, the proposed training strategy outperforms a majority of state-of-the-art representation learning methods based on AE structures. To validate the performance of our method, we conduct experiments on four types of data, namely visual, audio, text, and mass spectrometry data, and compare them in terms of four quantitative metrics. Our comparison results indicate that the proposed method demonstrate robustness and successfully identify patterns within the datasets. ",

In this work, we show that these attacks presented in the literature are impractical in real FL use-cases and provide a new baseline attack that works for more realistic scenarios where the clients' training involves updating the Batch Normalization (BN) statistics. Furthermore, we present new ways to measure and visualize potential data leakage in FL. Our work is a step towards establishing reproducible methods of measuring data leakage in FL and could help determine the optimal tradeoffs between privacy-preserving techniques, such as differential privacy, and model accuracy based on quantifiable metrics.

Moreover, the detection accuracy can be further increased with a slicing aided fine-tuning, resulting in a cumulative increase of 12.7%, 13.4% and 14.5% AP in the same order.

For nowcasting activities, this is currently a tedious and manual process. Focusing on the main driver of geomagnetic disturbances, the twisted internal magnetic field of interplanetary coronal mass ejections (ICMEs), we explore a convolutional neural network's (CNN) ability to predict the embedded magnetic flux rope's orientation once it has been identified from in situ solar wind observations. Our work uses CNNs trained with magnetic field vectors from analytical flux rope data. The simulated flux ropes span many possible spacecraft trajectories and flux rope orientations. We train CNNs first with full duration flux ropes and then again with partial duration flux ropes. The former provides us with a baseline of how well CNNs can predict flux rope orientation while the latter provides insights into real-time forecasting by exploring how accuracy is affected by percentage of flux rope observed. The process of casting the physics problem as a machine learning problem is discussed as well as the impacts of different factors on prediction accuracy such as flux rope fluctuations and different neural network topologies. Finally, results from evaluating the trained network against observed ICMEs from Wind during 1995-2015 are presented. ",

In this paper, we propose a novel index, called local superiority index (LSI), to identify central nodes. In the process of expansion, we apply the fitness function to estimate the quality of provisional communities and ensure that all provisional communities must be weak communities. Evaluation based on the normalized mutual information suggests: (1) LSI is superior to the global maximal degree index and the local maximal degree index on most considered networks; (2) The greedy algorithm based on LSI is better than the classical fast algorithm on most considered networks.

In developing such prostheses, the precise detection of brain motor actions is imperative for the Grasp-and-Lift (GAL) tasks. Because of the low-cost and non-invasive essence of Electroencephalography (EEG), it is widely preferred for detecting motor actions during the controls of prosthetic tools. This article has automated the hand movement activity viz GAL detection method from the 32-channel EEG signals. The proposed pipeline essentially combines preprocessing and end-to-end detection steps, eliminating the requirement of hand-crafted feature engineering. Preprocessing action consists of raw signal denoising, using either Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) or highpass or bandpass filtering and data standardization. The detection step consists of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)- or Long Short Term Memory (LSTM)-based model. All the investigations utilize the publicly available WAY-EEG-GAL dataset, having six different GAL events. The best experiment reveals that the proposed framework achieves an average area under the ROC curve of 0.944, employing the DWT-based denoising filter, data standardization, and CNN-based detection model. The obtained outcome designates an excellent achievement of the introduced method in detecting GAL events from the EEG signals, turning it applicable to prosthetic appliances, brain-computer interfaces, robotic arms, etc. ",

Therefore, predicting behaviour from neural population recordings has been shown to be most effective when using latent variable models. Over time however, the activity of single neurons can drift, and different neurons will be recorded due to movement of implanted neural probes. This means that a decoder trained to predict behaviour on one day performs worse when tested on a different day. On the other hand, evidence suggests that the latent dynamics underlying behaviour may be stable even over months and years. Based on this idea, we introduce a model capable of inferring behaviourally relevant latent dynamics from previously unseen data recorded from the same animal, without any need for decoder recalibration. We show that unsupervised domain adaptation combined with a sequential variational autoencoder, trained on several sessions, can achieve good generalisation to unseen data and correctly predict behaviour where conventional methods fail. Our results further support the hypothesis that behaviour-related neural dynamics are low-dimensional and stable over time, and will enable more effective and flexible use of brain computer interface technologies.

To solve the problem, in this paper we propose an end-to-end chorus detection model DeepChorus, reducing the engineering effort and the need for prior knowledge. The proposed model includes two main structures: i) a Multi-Scale Network to derive preliminary representations of chorus segments, and ii) a Self-Attention Convolution Network to further process the features into probability curves representing chorus presence. To obtain the final results, we apply an adaptive threshold to binarize the original curve. The experimental results show that DeepChorus outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in most cases.

Next, a tensor in which all elements were independently sampled from Beta distribution was used to mix the image patches.

Finally, the new data was used to train the model which could be used to segment glioma. The experimental results show that the mean accuracy of Dice scores are 91.32%, 85.67%, and 82.20% respectively on the whole tumor, tumor core, and enhancing tumor segmentation, which proves that the proposed TensorMixup is feasible and effective for brain tumor segmentation.

    "abstract": "This paper presents a novel data augmentation technique for text-to-speech (TTS), that allows to generate new (text, audio) training examples without requiring any additional data. Our goal is to increase diversity of text conditionings available during training. This helps to reduce overfitting, especially in low-resource settings. Our method relies on substituting text and audio fragments in a way that preserves syntactical correctness. We take additional measures to ensure that synthesized speech does not contain artifacts caused by combining inconsistent audio samples. The perceptual evaluations show that our method improves speech quality over a number of datasets, speakers, and TTS architectures. We also demonstrate that it greatly improves robustness of attention-based TTS models. ",

    "abstract": "Hyperspectral imagery is rich in spatial and spectral information. Using 3D-CNN can simultaneously acquire features of spatial and spectral dimensions to facilitate classification of features, but hyperspectral image information spectral dimensional information redundancy. The use of continuous 3D-CNN will result in a high amount of parameters, and the computational power requirements of the device are high, and the training takes too long. This letter designed the Faster selective kernel mechanism network (FSKNet), FSKNet can balance this problem. It designs 3D-CNN and 2D-CNN conversion modules, using 3D-CNN to complete feature extraction while reducing the dimensionality of spatial and spectrum. However, such a model is not lightweight enough. In the converted 2D-CNN, a selective kernel mechanism is proposed, which allows each neuron to adjust the receptive field size based on the two-way input information scale. Under the Selective kernel mechanism, it mainly includes two components, se module and variable convolution. Se acquires channel dimensional attention and variable convolution to obtain spatial dimension deformation information of ground objects. The model is more accurate, faster, and less computationally intensive. FSKNet achieves high accuracy on the IN, UP, Salinas, and Botswana data sets with very small parameters. ",

    "title": "High-Dimensional Dynamic Stochastic Model Representation",
    "abstract": "We propose a scalable method for computing global solutions of nonlinear, high-dimensional dynamic stochastic economic models. First, within a time iteration framework, we approximate economic policy functions using an adaptive, high-dimensional model representation scheme, combined with adaptive sparse grids to address the ubiquitous challenge of the curse of dimensionality. Moreover, the adaptivity within the individual component functions increases sparsity since grid points are added only where they are most needed, that is, in regions with steep gradients or at nondifferentiabilities. Second, we introduce a performant vectorization scheme for the interpolation compute kernel. Third, the algorithm is hybrid parallelized, leveraging both distributed- and shared-memory architectures. We observe significant speedups over the state-of-the-art techniques, and almost ideal strong scaling up to at least $1,000$ compute nodes of a Cray XC$50$ system at the Swiss National Supercomputing Center. Finally, to demonstrate our method's broad applicability, we compute global solutions to two variates of a high-dimensional international real business cycle model up to $300$ continuous state variables. In addition, we highlight a complementary advantage of the framework, which allows for a priori analysis of the model complexity. ",

    "abstract": "In this work we aim to develop a unified mathematical framework and a reliable computational approach to model the brittle fracture in heterogeneous materials with variability in material microstructures, and to provide statistic metrics for quantities of interest, such as the fracture toughness. To depict the material responses and naturally describe the nucleation and growth of fractures, we consider the peridynamics model. In particular, a stochastic state-based peridynamic model is developed, where the micromechanical parameters are modeled by a finite-dimensional random vector, or a combination of random variables truncating the Karhunen-Lo\\`{e}ve decomposition or the principle component analysis (PCA). To solve this stochastic peridynamic problem, probabilistic collocation method (PCM) is employed to sample the random field representing the micromechanical parameters. For each sample, the deterministic peridynamic problem is discretized with an optimization-based meshfree quadrature rule. We present rigorous analysis for the proposed scheme and demonstrate its convergence for a number of benchmark problems, showing that it sustains the asymptotic compatibility spatially and achieves an algebraic or sub-exponential convergence rate in the random space as the number of collocation points grows. Finally, to validate the applicability of this approach on real-world fracture problems, we consider the problem of crystallization toughening in glass-ceramic materials, in which the material at the microstructural scale contains both amorphous glass and crystalline phases. The proposed stochastic peridynamic solver is employed to capture the crack initiation and growth for glass-ceramics with different crystal volume fractions, and the averaged fracture toughness are calculated. The numerical estimates of fracture toughness show good consistency with experimental measurements. ",

    "abstract": "The past few years have witnessed the significant advances of speech synthesis and voice conversion technologies. However, such technologies can undermine the robustness of broadly implemented biometric identification models and can be harnessed by in-the-wild attackers for illegal uses. The ASVspoof challenge mainly focuses on synthesized audios by advanced speech synthesis and voice conversion models, and replay attacks. Recently, the first Audio Deep Synthesis Detection challenge (ADD 2022) extends the attack scenarios into more aspects. Also ADD 2022 is the first challenge to propose the partially fake audio detection task. Such brand new attacks are dangerous and how to tackle such attacks remains an open question. Thus, we propose a novel framework by introducing the question-answering (fake span discovery) strategy with the self-attention mechanism to detect partially fake audios. The proposed fake span detection module tasks the anti-spoofing model to predict the start and end positions of the fake clip within the partially fake audio, address the model's attention into discovering the fake spans rather than other shortcuts with less generalization, and finally equips the model with the discrimination capacity between real and partially fake audios. Our submission ranked second in the partially fake audio detection track of ADD 2022. ",

    "abstract": "Battery discharge capacity forecasting is critically essential for the applications of lithium-ion batteries. The capacity degeneration can be treated as the memory of the initial battery state of charge from the data point of view. The streaming sensor data collected by battery management systems (BMS) reflect the usable battery capacity degradation rates under various operational working conditions. The battery capacity in different cycles can be measured with the temporal patterns extracted from the streaming sensor data based on the attention mechanism. The attention-based similarity regarding the first cycle can describe the battery capacity degradation in the following cycles. The deep degradation network (DDN) is developed with the attention mechanism to measure similarity and predict battery capacity. The DDN model can extract the degeneration-related temporal patterns from the streaming sensor data and perform the battery capacity prediction efficiently online in real-time. Based on the MIT-Stanford open-access battery aging dataset, the root-mean-square error of the capacity estimation is 1.3 mAh. The mean absolute percentage error of the proposed DDN model is 0.06{\\%}. The DDN model also performance well in the Oxford Battery Degradation Dataset with dynamic load profiles. Therefore, the high accuracy and strong robustness of the proposed algorithm are verified. ",

A simple characterization of endomorphism-transitive generalized Petersen graphs follows. This extends the characterization of vertex-transitive generalized Petersen graphs due to Frucht, Graver, and Watkins and solves a problem of Fan and Xie. Moreover, we study generalized Petersen graphs that are (underlying graphs of) Cayley graphs of monoids. We show that this is the case for the Petersen graph, answering a recent mathoverflow question, for the Desargues graphs, and for the dodecahedron -- answering a question of Knauer and Knauer. Moreover, we characterize the infinite family of generalized Petersen graphs that are Cayley graph of a monoid with generating connection set of size two. This extends Nedela and \\v{S}koviera's characterization of generalized Petersen graphs that are group Cayley graphs and complements results of Hao, Gao, and Luo. ",

In absence thereof, different models may be observationally indistinguishable while yielding representations that are nontrivially related to one another, thus making the recovery of a ground truth generative model fundamentally impossible, as often shown through suitably constructed counterexamples. In this note, we discuss one such construction, illustrating a potential failure case of an identifiability result presented in \"Desiderata for Representation Learning: A Causal Perspective\" by Wang & Jordan (2021). The construction is based on the theory of nonlinear independent component analysis. We comment on implications of this and other counterexamples for identifiable representation learning. ",

It is well known that $N$ weakly converges to the Poisson distribution with mean ${d^3}/{6}$ as $n\\rightarrow \\infty$. We address the upper tail problem for $N,$ namely, we investigate how fast $k$ must grow, so that the probability of $\\{N\\ge k\\}$ is not well approximated anymore by the tail of the corresponding Poisson variable. Proving that the tail exhibits a sharp phase transition, we essentially show that the upper tail is governed by Poisson behavior only when $k^{1/3} \\log k< (\\frac{3}{\\sqrt{2}})^{2/3} \\log n$ (sub-critical regime) as well as pin down the tail behavior when $k^{1/3} \\log k> (\\frac{3}{\\sqrt{2}})^{2/3} \\log n$ (super-critical regime). We further prove a structure theorem, showing that the sub-critical upper tail behavior is dictated by the appearance of almost $k$ vertex-disjoint triangles whereas in the supercritical regime, the excess triangles arise from a clique like structure of size approximately $(6k)^{1/3}$. This settles the long-standing upper-tail problem in this case, answering a question of Aldous, complementing a long sequence of works, spanning multiple decades, culminating in (Harel, Moussat, Samotij,'19) which analyzed the problem only in the regime $p\\gg \\frac{1}{n}.$ The proofs rely on several novel graph theoretical results which could have other applications.
