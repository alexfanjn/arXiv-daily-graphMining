    "abstract": "This paper aims to provide a comprehensive critical overview on how entities and their interactions in Complex Networked Systems (CNS) are modelled across disciplines as they approach their ultimate goal of creating a Digital Twin (DT) that perfectly matches the reality. We propose a new framework to conceptually compare diverse existing modelling paradigms from different perspectives and create unified assessment criteria to assess their respective capabilities of reaching such an ultimate goal. Using the proposed criteria, we also appraise how far the reviewed current state-of-the-art approaches are from the idealised DTs. We also identify and propose potential directions and ways of building a DT-orientated CNS based on the convergence and integration of CNS and DT utilising a variety of cross-disciplinary techniques.

    "abstract": "Most efforts in interpretability in deep learning have focused on (1) extracting explanations of a specific downstream task in relation to the input features and (2) imposing constraints on the model, often at the expense of predictive performance. New advances in (unsupervised) representation learning and transfer learning, however, raise the need for an explanatory framework for networks that are trained without a specific downstream task. We address these challenges by showing how explainability can be an aid, rather than an obstacle, towards better and more efficient representations. Specifically, we propose a natural aggregation method generalizing attribution maps between any two (convolutional) layers of a neural network. Additionally, we employ such attributions to define two novel scores for evaluating the informativeness and the disentanglement of latent embeddings. Extensive experiments show that the proposed scores do correlate with the desired properties. We also confirm and extend previously known results concerning the independence of some common saliency strategies from the model parameters. Finally, we show that adopting our proposed scores as constraints during the training of a representation learning task improves the downstream performance of the model. ",

    "abstract": "Automated fact-checking is a needed technology to curtail the spread of online misinformation. One current framework for such solutions proposes to verify claims by retrieving supporting or refuting evidence from related textual sources. However, the realistic use cases for fact-checkers will require verifying claims against evidence sources that could be affected by the same misinformation. Furthermore, the development of modern NLP tools that can produce coherent, fabricated content would allow malicious actors to systematically generate adversarial disinformation for fact-checkers. In this work, we explore the sensitivity of automated fact-checkers to synthetic adversarial evidence in two simulated settings: AdversarialAddition, where we fabricate documents and add them to the evidence repository available to the fact-checking system, and AdversarialModification, where existing evidence source documents in the repository are automatically altered. Our study across multiple models on three benchmarks demonstrates that these systems suffer significant performance drops against these attacks. Finally, we discuss the growing threat of modern NLG systems as generators of disinformation in the context of the challenges they pose to automated fact-checkers. ",

Under such scenarios, exploiting GNN's vulnerabilities and further downgrade its classification performance become highly incentive for adversaries. Previous attackers mainly focus on structural perturbations of existing graphs. Although they deliver promising results, the actual implementation needs capability of manipulating the graph connectivity, which is impractical in some circumstances. In this work, we study the possibility of injecting nodes to evade the victim GNN model, and unlike previous related works with white-box setting, we significantly restrict the amount of accessible knowledge and explore the black-box setting. Specifically, we model the node injection attack as a Markov decision process and propose GA2C, a graph reinforcement learning framework in the fashion of advantage actor critic, to generate realistic features for injected nodes and seamlessly merge them into the original graph following the same topology characteristics. Through our extensive experiments on multiple acknowledged benchmark datasets, we demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed GA2C over existing state-of-the-art methods.

A key reason why Transporter Net is so sample efficient is that the model incorporates rotational equivariance into the pick module, i.e. the model immediately generalizes learned pick knowledge to objects presented in different orientations. This paper proposes a novel version of Transporter Net that is equivariant to both pick and place orientation. As a result, our model immediately generalizes place knowledge to different place orientations in addition to generalizing pick knowledge as before. Ultimately, our new model is more sample efficient and achieves better pick and place success rates than the baseline Transporter Net model. ",

Since the principal providers of ancillary services are being phased out, new flexibility and reserve providers are needed. The proliferation of Distributed Energy Resources (DERs) in modern distribution networks has opened new possibilities for distribution system operators, enabling them to fill the market gap by harnessing the DER flexibility. This paper introduces a novel centralized MPC-based controller that enables the concurrent provision of voltage support, primary and secondary frequency control by adjusting the setpoints of a heterogeneous group of DERs in active distribution grids. The input-multirate control framework is used to accommodate the distinct timescales and provision requirements of each ancillary service and to ensure that the available resources are properly allocated. Furthermore, an efficient way for incorporating network constraints in the formulation is proposed, where network decomposition is applied to a linear power flow formulation together with network reduction. In addition, different timescale dynamics of the employed DERs and their capability curves are included. The performance of the proposed controller is evaluated on several case studies via dynamic simulations of the IEEE 33-bus system. ",

    "abstract": "Contact tracing has been proven an effective approach to mitigate the virus spread in pandemics like COVID-19. As an emerging powerful decentralized data sharing and storage technique, blockchain has been explored to ensure data privacy and security in contact tracing processes. Existing work mostly treats blockchain as a separate storage system requiring third-party servers to perform data collection and computation, and avoids revealing detailed interior design of blockchain storage. However, blockchain system is capable to work as a fully automatic distributed contact tracing system without any third-party server by tackling the following challenges: 1) how to ensure the contact tracing correctness without compromising privacy; 2) how to design efficient and effective consensus mechanism to ensure the system security and robustness; 3) how to design an incentive mechanism to motivate people to behave honestly. In this article, we present the Blockchain Based Contact Tracing Framework for the contact tracing problem. In the framework, RSA encryption based transaction verification algorithm (RSA-TVA) is proposed to ensure contact tracing correctness, which can achieve more than 97% contact case recording accuracy even when each person has 60% chance of failing to verify the contact information. Reputation Corrected Delegated Proof of Stack (RC-DPoS) consensus mechanism is applied to jointly work with the proposed incentive mechanism, which can ensure timeliness of reporting contact cases and meanwhile balance the reward gained by different people. A novel contact tracing simulation environment is created in the simulation part, which considers three different contact scenarios. The simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness, robustness and attack resistance of RSA-TVA and RC-DPoS in the proposed Blockchain Based Contact Tracing Framework. ",

As we approach the limits of Moore's law, there is now a need to explore ways of solving such problems with special-purpose hardware such as quantum computers or quantum-inspired accelerators. In this work, we experiment with solving the graph partitioning on the Fujitsu Digital Annealer (a special-purpose hardware designed for solving combinatorial optimization problems) and compare it with the existing top solvers. We demonstrate limitations of existing solvers on many dense graphs as well as those of the Digital Annealer on sparse graphs which opens an avenue to hybridize these approaches. ",

In this work, we propose an algorithm that combines adversarial training and group distribution robust optimization to improve robust representation learning.

Examples include control-flow graphs in programs and semantic scene graphs in images. Identifying subgraph patterns in graphs is an important approach to understanding their structural properties. We propose a visual analytics system GraphQ to support human-in-the-loop, example-based, subgraph pattern search in a database containing many individual graphs. To support fast, interactive queries, we use graph neural networks (GNNs) to encode a graph as fixed-length latent vector representation, and perform subgraph matching in the latent space. Due to the complexity of the problem, it is still difficult to obtain accurate one-to-one node correspondences in the matching results that are crucial for visualization and interpretation. We, therefore, propose a novel GNN for node-alignment called NeuroAlign, to facilitate easy validation and interpretation of the query results. GraphQ provides a visual query interface with a query editor and a multi-scale visualization of the results, as well as a user feedback mechanism for refining the results with additional constraints. We demonstrate GraphQ through two example usage scenarios: analyzing reusable subroutines in program workflows and semantic scene graph search in images. Quantitative experiments show that NeuroAlign achieves 19-29% improvement in node-alignment accuracy compared to baseline GNN and provides up to 100x speedup compared to combinatorial algorithms. Our qualitative study with domain experts confirms the effectiveness for both usage scenarios. ",

Recent advances in edge intelligence require CNN inference on edge network to increase throughput and reduce latency. To provide flexibility, dynamic parameter allocation to different mobile devices is required to implement either a predefined or defined on-the-fly CNN architecture. In this study, we present novel methodologies for dynamically streaming the model parameters at run-time to implement a traditional CNN architecture. We further propose a library-based approach to design scalable and dynamic distributed CNN inference on the fly leveraging partial-reconfiguration techniques, which is particularly suitable for resource-constrained edge devices.

This introduces important challenges for knowledge representation learning since such temporal KGs change over time. In this work, we strive to move beyond the complex or hypercomplex space for KGE and propose a novel geometric algebra based embedding approach, GeomE, which uses multivector representations and the geometric product to model entities and relations. GeomE subsumes several state-of-the-art KGE models and is able to model diverse relations patterns. On top of this, we extend GeomE to TGeomE for temporal KGE, which performs 4th-order tensor factorization of a temporal KG and devises a new linear temporal regularization for time representation learning. Moreover, we study the effect of time granularity on the performance of TGeomE models. Experimental results show that our proposed models achieve the state-of-the-art performances on link prediction over four commonly-used static KG datasets and four well-established temporal KG datasets across various metrics.

    "abstract": "Automated attack discovery techniques, such as attacker synthesis or model-based fuzzing, provide powerful ways to ensure network protocols operate correctly and securely. Such techniques, in general, require a formal representation of the protocol, often in the form of a finite state machine (FSM). Unfortunately, many protocols are only described in English prose, and implementing even a simple network protocol as an FSM is time-consuming and prone to subtle logical errors. Automatically extracting protocol FSMs from documentation can significantly contribute to increased use of these techniques and result in more robust and secure protocol implementations. In this work we focus on attacker synthesis as a representative technique for protocol security, and on RFCs as a representative format for protocol prose description. Unlike other works that rely on rule-based approaches or use off-the-shelf NLP tools directly, we suggest a data-driven approach for extracting FSMs from RFC documents. Specifically, we use a hybrid approach consisting of three key steps: (1) large-scale word-representation learning for technical language, (2) focused zero-shot learning for mapping protocol text to a protocol-independent information language, and (3) rule-based mapping from protocol-independent information to a specific protocol FSM. We show the generalizability of our FSM extraction by using the RFCs for six different protocols: BGPv4, DCCP, LTP, PPTP, SCTP and TCP. We demonstrate how automated extraction of an FSM from an RFC can be applied to the synthesis of attacks, with TCP and DCCP as case-studies. Our approach shows that it is possible to automate attacker synthesis against protocols by using textual specifications such as RFCs. ",

Recent evidence suggests that existing solutions dependent on simple Gaussian formulations may not be sufficient. However, moving to other distributions necessitates Monte Carlo (MC) sampling to estimate quantities such as the KL divergence: it could be expensive and scales poorly as the dimensions of both the input data and the model grow. This is directly related to the structure of the computation graph, which can grow linearly as a function of the number of MC samples needed. Here, we construct a framework to describe these computation graphs, and identify probability families where the graph size can be independent or only weakly dependent on the number of MC samples. These families correspond directly to large classes of distributions. Empirically, we can run a much larger number of iterations for MC approximations for larger architectures used in computer vision with gains in performance measured in confident accuracy, stability of training, memory and training time.

In this paper, we classify intentional and unintentional adversarial text perturbation into ten types and propose a deobfuscation pipeline to make NLP models robust to such perturbations. We propose Continuous Word2Vec (CW2V), our data-driven method to learn word embeddings that ensures that perturbations of words have embeddings similar to those of the original words. We show that CW2V embeddings are generally more robust to text perturbations than embeddings based on character ngrams. Our robust classification pipeline combines deobfuscation and classification, using proposed defense methods and word embeddings to classify whether Facebook posts are requesting engagement such as likes.

    "abstract": "The notion of concept drift refers to the phenomenon that the distribution, which is underlying the observed data, changes over time; as a consequence machine learning models may become inaccurate and need adjustment. Many unsupervised approaches for drift detection rely on measuring the discrepancy between the sample distributions of two time windows. This may be done directly, after some preprocessing (feature extraction, embedding into a latent space, etc.), or with respect to inferred features (mean, variance, conditional probabilities etc.). Most drift detection methods can be distinguished in what metric they use, how this metric is estimated, and how the decision threshold is found. In this paper, we analyze structural properties of the drift induced signals in the context of different metrics. We compare different types of estimators and metrics theoretically and empirically and investigate the relevance of the single metric components. In addition, we propose new choices and demonstrate their suitability in several experiments. ",

    "abstract": "Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection plays a core role in activity understanding. As a compositional learning problem (human-verb-object), studying its generalization matters. However, widely-used metric mean average precision (mAP) fails to model the compositional generalization well. Thus, we propose a novel metric, mPD (mean Performance Degradation), as a complementary of mAP to evaluate the performance gap among compositions of different objects and the same verb. Surprisingly, mPD reveals that previous methods usually generalize poorly. With mPD as a cue, we propose Object Category (OC) Immunity to boost HOI generalization. The idea is to prevent model from learning spurious object-verb correlations as a short-cut to over-fit the train set. To achieve OC-immunity, we propose an OC-immune network that decouples the inputs from OC, extracts OC-immune representations, and leverages uncertainty quantification to generalize to unseen objects. In both conventional and zero-shot experiments, our method achieves decent improvements. To fully evaluate the generalization, we design a new and more difficult benchmark, on which we present significant advantage. The code is available at https://github.com/Foruck/OC-Immunity. ",

    "abstract": "Session-based recommendation (SBR) aims at predicting the next item for an ongoing anonymous session. The major challenge of SBR is how to capture richer relations in between items and learn ID-based item embeddings to capture such relations. Recent studies propose to first construct an item graph from sessions and employ a Graph Neural Network (GNN) to encode item embedding from the graph. Although such graph-based approaches have achieved performance improvements, their GNNs are not suitable for ID-based embedding learning for the SBR task. In this paper, we argue that the objective of such ID-based embedding learning is to capture a kind of \\textit{neighborhood affinity} in that the embedding of a node is similar to that of its neighbors' in the embedding space. We propose a new graph neural network, called Graph Spring Network (GSN), for learning ID-based item embedding on an item graph to optimize neighborhood affinity in the embedding space. Furthermore, we argue that even stacking multiple GNN layers may not be enough to encode potential relations for two item nodes far-apart in a graph. In this paper, we propose a strategy that first selects some informative item anchors and then encode items' potential relations to such anchors. In summary, we propose a GSN-IAS model (Graph Spring Network and Informative Anchor Selection) for the SBR task. We first construct an item graph to describe items' co-occurrences in all sessions. We design the GSN for ID-based item embedding learning and propose an \\textit{item entropy} measure to select informative anchors. We then design an unsupervised learning mechanism to encode items' relations to anchors. We next employ a shared gated recurrent unit (GRU) network to learn two session representations and make two next item predictions. Finally, we design an adaptive decision fusion strategy to fuse two predictions to make the final recommendation. ",

    "abstract": "Robust Reinforcement Learning (RL) focuses on improving performances under model errors or adversarial attacks, which facilitates the real-life deployment of RL agents. Robust Adversarial Reinforcement Learning (RARL) is one of the most popular frameworks for robust RL. However, most of the existing literature models RARL as a zero-sum simultaneous game with Nash equilibrium as the solution concept, which could overlook the sequential nature of RL deployments, produce overly conservative agents, and induce training instability. In this paper, we introduce a novel hierarchical formulation of robust RL - a general-sum Stackelberg game model called RRL-Stack - to formalize the sequential nature and provide extra flexibility for robust training. We develop the Stackelberg Policy Gradient algorithm to solve RRL-Stack, leveraging the Stackelberg learning dynamics by considering the adversary's response. Our method generates challenging yet solvable adversarial environments which benefit RL agents' robust learning. Our algorithm demonstrates better training stability and robustness against different testing conditions in the single-agent robotics control and multi-agent highway merging tasks. ",

To solve this intractable non-convex problem, we propose a soft actor-critic (SAC) deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based joint beamforming and BS-RIS-UE association design algorithm, which can learn the best policy by interacting with the environment using less prior information and avoid falling into the local optimal solution by incorporating with the maximization of policy information entropy. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed SAC-DRL algorithm can achieve significant performance gains compared with benchmark schemes. ",

The experimental results show that the combination of original and synthetic data greatly improves the discrimination of the neural network.

In this paper, we present a learning-based method to detect slip using barometric tactile sensors. These sensors have many desirable properties including high durability and reliability, and are built from inexpensive, off-the-shelf components. We train a temporal convolution neural network to detect slip, achieving high detection accuracies while displaying robustness to the speed and direction of the slip motion. Further, we test our detector on two manipulation tasks involving a variety of common objects and demonstrate successful generalization to real-world scenarios not seen during training.

To address these challenges, we first build a danger behavior dataset with locations and labels from surveillance videos, and transform action recognition of long videos to an object detection task that avoids keyframes detection. Then, we propose a novel end-to-end dangerous behavior detection method, named DangerDet, that combines multi-scale body features and keypoints-based pose features. We could improve the accuracy of behavior classification due to the highly correlation between pose and behavior. On our dataset, DangerDet achieves 71.0\\% mAP with about 11 FPS.

In the next step, we used the library functions to develop and test our MAPPING tool where the functions were given as input and from the output, we can get the implemented function in four terminal lattice network.

However, most existing methods have limited defogging capabilities for real cases because they are trained on the paired clear and synthesized foggy images of the same scenes. In addition, they have limitations in preserving vivid color and rich textual details in defogging. To address these issues, we develop a novel generative adversarial network, called holistic attention-fusion adversarial network (HAAN), for single image defogging. HAAN consists of a Fog2Fogfree block and a Fogfree2Fog block. In each block, there are three learning-based modules, namely, fog removal, color-texture recovery, and fog synthetic, that are constrained each other to generate high quality images. HAAN is designed to exploit the self-similarity of texture and structure information by learning the holistic channel-spatial feature correlations between the foggy image with its several derived images. Moreover, in the fog synthetic module, we utilize the atmospheric scattering model to guide it to improve the generative quality by focusing on an atmospheric light optimization with a novel sky segmentation network. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets show that HAAN outperforms state-of-the-art defogging methods in terms of quantitative accuracy and subjective visual quality. ",

Although there are currently general datasets for object detection, there is still a lack of large-scale, open-source dataset for the construction industry, which limits the developments of object detection algorithms as they tend to be data-hungry. Therefore, this paper develops a new large-scale image dataset specifically collected and annotated for the construction site, called Site Object Detection dAtaset (SODA), which contains 15 kinds of object classes categorized by workers, materials, machines, and layout. Firstly, more than 20,000 images were collected from multiple construction sites in different site conditions, weather conditions, and construction phases, which covered different angles and perspectives. After careful screening and processing, 19,846 images including 286,201 objects were then obtained and annotated with labels in accordance with predefined categories. Statistical analysis shows that the developed dataset is advantageous in terms of diversity and volume. Further evaluation with two widely-adopted object detection algorithms based on deep learning (YOLO v3/ YOLO v4) also illustrates the feasibility of the dataset for typical construction scenarios, achieving a maximum mAP of 81.47%. In this manner, this research contributes a large-scale image dataset for the development of deep learning-based object detection methods in the construction industry and sets up a performance benchmark for further evaluation of corresponding algorithms in this area.

    "abstract": "The attention mechanism is one of the most important priori knowledge to enhance convolutional neural networks. Most attention mechanisms are bound to the convolutional layer and use local or global contextual information to recalibrate the input. This is a popular attention strategy design method. Global contextual information helps the network to consider the overall distribution, while local contextual information is more general. The contextual information makes the network pay attention to the mean or maximum value of a particular receptive field. Different from the most attention mechanism, this article proposes a novel attention mechanism with the heuristic difference attention module, HDAM. HDAM's input recalibration is based on the difference between the local and global contextual information instead of the mean and maximum values. At the same time, to make different layers have a more suitable local receptive field size and increase the exibility of the local receptive field design, we use genetic algorithm to heuristically produce local receptive fields. First, HDAM extracts the mean value of the global and local receptive fields as the corresponding contextual information. Then the difference between the global and local contextual information is calculated. Finally HDAM uses this difference to recalibrate the input. In addition, we use the heuristic ability of genetic algorithm to search for the local receptive field size of each layer. Our experiments on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 show that HDAM can use fewer parameters than other attention mechanisms to achieve higher accuracy. We implement HDAM with the Python library, Pytorch, and the code and models will be publicly available. ",

Such an obstacle limits private applications' further prosperity. This paper reviews and evaluates the state-of-the-art open-source differential privacy tools of different domains using various estimating categories and privacy settings. Particularly, we look into the performances of three differential privacy tools for machine learning, two for statistical query, and four for synthetic data generation. We test all the tools on both continuous and categorical data and quantify their performance under different privacy budget and data size w.r.t. utility loss and system overhead. The accumulated evaluation results reveal several patterns that users can follow to optimally configure the tools, and provide preliminary guidelines on tool selection under different criteria. Finally, we openly release our evaluation coding repository, a framework that users can reuse to further evaluate the studied tools and beyond. We anticipate this work to provide a comprehensive insight into the performances of the existing dominant privacy tools, and a concrete reference for a potentially large developer community on private applications, thus narrowing the gap between conceptual differential privacy and private functionality development.

In addition, these methods can only construct negative triplets using the existing entities, which limits the potential to explore harder negative triplets. To address these issues, we adopt mixing operation in generating harder negative samples for knowledge graphs and introduce an inexpensive but effective method called MixKG. Technically, MixKG first proposes two kinds of criteria to filter hard negative triplets among the sampled negatives: based on scoring function and based on correct entity similarity. Then, MixKG synthesizes harder negative samples via the convex combinations of the paired selected hard negatives. Experiments on two public datasets and four classical KGE methods show MixKG is superior to previous negative sampling algorithms. ",

    "abstract": "Off-policy evaluation and learning (OPE/L) use offline observational data to make better decisions, which is crucial in applications where experimentation is necessarily limited. OPE/L is nonetheless sensitive to discrepancies between the data-generating environment and that where policies are deployed. Recent work proposed distributionally robust OPE/L (DROPE/L) to remedy this, but the proposal relies on inverse-propensity weighting, whose regret rates may deteriorate if propensities are estimated and whose variance is suboptimal even if not. For vanilla OPE/L, this is solved by doubly robust (DR) methods, but they do not naturally extend to the more complex DROPE/L, which involves a worst-case expectation. In this paper, we propose the first DR algorithms for DROPE/L with KL-divergence uncertainty sets. For evaluation, we propose Localized Doubly Robust DROPE (LDR$^2$OPE) and prove its semiparametric efficiency under weak product rates conditions. Notably, thanks to a localization technique, LDR$^2$OPE only requires fitting a small number of regressions, just like DR methods for vanilla OPE. For learning, we propose Continuum Doubly Robust DROPL (CDR$^2$OPL) and show that, under a product rate condition involving a continuum of regressions, it enjoys a fast regret rate of $\\mathcal{O}(N^{-1/2})$ even when unknown propensities are nonparametrically estimated. We further extend our results to general $f$-divergence uncertainty sets. We illustrate the advantage of our algorithms in simulations. ",

    "abstract": "Voltage unbalance in distribution networks (DN) is expected to grow with increasing penetration of single-phase distributed generation and single-phase loads such as electric vehicle chargers. Unbalance mitigation will be a significant concern as voltage unbalance leads to increased losses, reduced motor and inverter efficiency, and becomes a limiting factor for DN operation. The true definition of the unbalance metric needs phasor measurements of network voltage and current. However, such phasor measurements are generally not available in real life and as such approximate definitions are widely used due to their simplicity. This work aims to compare the true voltage unbalance definition and approximate unbalance metrics derived from phase voltage magnitude, as phase voltage magnitudes are commonly measured by digital metering infrastructure. For the comparison, multi-period power flow simulations are performed for 161 Spanish distribution feeders with R/X ratios varying from 2.87 to 14.68. We observe that phase magnitude-based unbalance metrics reasonably approximate the true unbalance for higher R/X ratios with a varying load power factor in a DN. Furthermore, the approximate unbalance metrics slightly improve for a low DN power factor due to the increase in DN unbalance. Therefore, the phase magnitude-based unbalance metric can be utilized for approximating DN unbalance. ",

    "abstract": "Modern cloud computing advances have been pressing application modernization in the last 15 years, stressing the need for application redesign towards the use of more distributed and ephemeral resources. From the initial IaaS and PaaS approaches, to microservices and now to the serverless model (and especially the Function as a Service approach), new challenges arise constantly for application developers. This paper presents a design and development environment that aims to ease application evolution and migration to the new FaaS model, based on the widely used Node-RED open source tool. The goal of the environment is to enable a more user friendly and abstract function and workflow creation for complex FaaS applications. To this end, it bypasses workflow description and function reuse limitations of the current FaaS platforms, by providing an extendable, pattern-enriched palette of ready-made, reusable functionality that can be combined in arbitrary ways. The environment embeds seamless DevOps processes for generating the deployable artefacts (i.e. functions and images) of the FaaS platform (Openwhisk). Annotation mechanisms are also available for the developer to dictate diverse execution options or management guidelines towards the deployment and operation stacks. The evaluation is based on case studies of indicative scenarios, including creating, registering and executing functions and flows based on the Node-RED runtime, embedding of existing legacy code in a FaaS environment, parallelizing a workload, collecting data at the edge and creating function orchestrators to accompany the application. For the latter, a detailed argumentation is provided as to why this process should not be constrained by the \"double billing\" principle of FaaS. ",

This paper describes an approximate algorithm that performs parallel sampling on Candidate Parent Sets (CPSs), and can be viewed as an extension of MINOBS which is a state-of-the-art algorithm for structure learning from high dimensional data. The modified algorithm, which we call Parallel Sampling MINOBS (PS-MINOBS), constructs the graph by sampling CPSs for each variable. Sampling is performed in parallel under the assumption the distribution of CPSs is half-normal when ordered by Bayesian score for each variable. Sampling from a half-normal distribution ensures that the CPSs sampled are likely to be those which produce the higher scores. Empirical results show that, in most cases, the proposed algorithm discovers higher score structures than MINOBS when both algorithms are restricted to the same runtime limit. ",

The traditional homogenization techniques typically rely on the periodicity of the multiscale coefficients, thus finding the G-limits often requires sophisticated techniques in more general settings even when multiscale coefficient is known, if possible. Alternatively, we propose a simple approach to estimate the G-limits from (noisy-free or noisy) multiscale solution data, either from the existing forward multiscale solvers or sensor measurements. By casting this problem into an inverse problem, our approach adopts physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) algorithm to estimate the G-limits from the multiscale solution data by leveraging a priori knowledge of the underlying homogenized equations. Unlike the existing approaches, our approach does not rely on the periodicity assumption or the known multiscale coefficient during the learning stage, allowing us to estimate homogenized coefficients in more general settings beyond the periodic setting. We demonstrate that the proposed approach can deliver reasonable and accurate approximations to the G-limits as well as homogenized solutions through several benchmark problems. ",

In the field of 3D object detection, previous methods have been taking the advantage of context encoding, graph embedding, or explicit relation reasoning to extract relation context. However, there exists inevitably redundant relation context due to noisy or low-quality proposals. In fact, invalid relation context usually indicates underlying scene misunderstanding and ambiguity, which may, on the contrary, reduce the performance in complex scenes. Inspired by recent attention mechanism like Transformer, we propose a novel 3D attention-based relation module (ARM3D). It encompasses object-aware relation reasoning to extract pair-wise relation contexts among qualified proposals and an attention module to distribute attention weights towards different relation contexts. In this way, ARM3D can take full advantage of the useful relation context and filter those less relevant or even confusing contexts, which mitigates the ambiguity in detection. We have evaluated the effectiveness of ARM3D by plugging it into several state-of-the-art 3D object detectors and showing more accurate and robust detection results. Extensive experiments show the capability and generalization of ARM3D on 3D object detection. Our source code is available at https://github.com/lanlan96/ARM3D. ",

Currently, deep neural networks struggle to generalize robustly to such shifts in the data distribution. We study robust generalization in the context of using recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to learn regular languages. We hypothesize that standard end-to-end modeling strategies cannot generalize well to systematic distribution shifts and propose a compositional strategy to address this. We compare an end-to-end strategy that maps strings to labels with a compositional strategy that predicts the structure of the deterministic finite-state automaton (DFA) that accepts the regular language. We theoretically prove that the compositional strategy generalizes significantly better than the end-to-end strategy. In our experiments, we implement the compositional strategy via an auxiliary task where the goal is to predict the intermediate states visited by the DFA when parsing a string. Our empirical results support our hypothesis, showing that auxiliary tasks can enable robust generalization. Interestingly, the end-to-end RNN generalizes significantly better than the theoretical lower bound, suggesting that it is able to achieve at least some degree of robust generalization. ",

    "abstract": "In the wake of increasing political extremism, online platforms have been criticized for contributing to polarization. One line of criticism has focused on echo chambers and the recommended content served to users by these platforms. In this work, we introduce the fair exposure problem: given limited intervention power of the platform, the goal is to enforce balance in the spread of content (e.g., news articles) among two groups of users through constraints similar to those imposed by the Fairness Doctrine in the United States in the past. Groups are characterized by different affiliations (e.g., political views) and have different preferences for content. We develop a stylized framework that models intra- and inter-group content propagation under homophily, and we formulate the platform's decision as an optimization problem that aims at maximizing user engagement, potentially under fairness constraints. Our main notion of fairness requires that each group see a mixture of their preferred and non-preferred content, encouraging information diversity. Promoting such information diversity is often viewed as desirable and a potential means for breaking out of harmful echo chambers. We study the solutions to both the fairness-agnostic and fairness-aware problems. We prove that a fairness-agnostic approach inevitably leads to group-homogeneous targeting by the platform. This is only partially mitigated by imposing fairness constraints: we show that there exist optimal fairness-aware solutions which target one group with different types of content and the other group with only one type that is not necessarily the group's most preferred. Finally, using simulations with real-world data, we study the system dynamics and quantify the price of fairness. ",

Thus, it is critical to validate the correctness of triples in PGs to improve their reliability. Knowledge graph (KG) embedding methods have strong error detection abilities. Yet, existing KG embedding methods may not be directly applicable to a PG due to its distinct characteristics: (1) PG contains rich textual signals, which necessitates a joint exploration of both text information and graph structure; (2) PG contains a large number of attribute triples, in which attribute values are represented by free texts. Since free texts are too flexible to define entities in KGs, traditional way to map entities to their embeddings using ids is no longer appropriate for attribute value representation; (3) Noisy triples in a PG mislead the embedding learning and significantly hurt the performance of error detection. To address the aforementioned challenges, we propose an end-to-end noise-tolerant embedding learning framework, PGE, to jointly leverage both text information and graph structure in PG to learn embeddings for error detection.

We model such a multi-dimensional network security game as a constrained non-zero sum game. Two security breaching models, the product-form and the proportion-form, are considered. For each breaching model, we prove the existence of a unique Nash equilibrium (NE) based on Rosen's theorem and propose efficient algorithms to find the NE when the games are strictly concave. Furthermore, we show the existence of multiple NEs in the product-form breaching model when the strict concavity does not hold. Our study sheds light on the strategic behaviors of the attacker and the defender, in particular, on how they allocate resources to the targets which have different weights, and how their utilities as well as strategies are influenced by the resource constraints.

Currently, spatial propagation networks (SPNs) are the most popular affinity-based methods in depth completion, but they still suffer from the representation limitation of the fixed affinity and the over smoothing during iterations. Our solution is to estimate independent affinity matrices in each SPN iteration, but it is over-parameterized and heavy calculation. This paper introduces an efficient model that learns the affinity among neighboring pixels with an attention-based, dynamic approach. Specifically, the Dynamic Spatial Propagation Network (DySPN) we proposed makes use of a non-linear propagation model (NLPM). It decouples the neighborhood into parts regarding to different distances and recursively generates independent attention maps to refine these parts into adaptive affinity matrices. Furthermore, we adopt a diffusion suppression (DS) operation so that the model converges at an early stage to prevent over-smoothing of dense depth. Finally, in order to decrease the computational cost required, we also introduce three variations that reduce the amount of neighbors and attentions needed while still retaining similar accuracy. In practice, our method requires less iteration to match the performance of other SPNs and yields better results overall. DySPN outperforms other state-of-the-art (SoTA) methods on KITTI Depth Completion (DC) evaluation by the time of submission and is able to yield SoTA performance in NYU Depth v2 dataset as well. ",

Due to the ephemeral nature of web applications, a client visiting a website has no guarantee that the code it receives today is the same as yesterday, or the same as others receive.

Although some parameter-efficient tuning paradigms have been proposed to address this problem, they still require large resources to compute the gradients in the training phase. In this paper, we propose $\\mathcal{Y}$-Tuning, an efficient yet effective paradigm to adapt frozen large-scale PTMs to specific downstream tasks. $\\mathcal{Y}$-tuning learns dense representations for labels $\\mathcal{Y}$ defined in a given task and aligns them to fixed feature representation. Without tuning the features of input text and model parameters, $\\mathcal{Y}$-tuning is both parameter-efficient and training-efficient. For $\\text{DeBERTa}_\\text{XXL}$ with 1.6 billion parameters, $\\mathcal{Y}$-tuning achieves performance more than $96\\%$ of full fine-tuning on GLUE Benchmark with only $2\\%$ tunable parameters and much fewer training costs.

Using an LFR graph generator, we create a dataset of 11780 graphs covering the whole LFR parameter space.

We find that the parameter space consists of distinct zones where one particular measure is the best. We analyze the geometry of the resulting zones and describe it with simple criteria.

Harnessing their monitoring and control functionalities, sophisticated schemes enhancing MG stability can be deployed. However, the deployment of `smart' assets increases the threat surface. Power systems possess mechanisms capable of detecting abnormal operations. Furthermore, the lack of sophistication in attack strategies can render them detectable since they blindly violate power system semantics. On the other hand, the recent increase of process-aware rootkits that can attain persistence and compromise operations in undetectable ways requires special attention. In this work, we investigate the steps followed by stealthy rootkits at the process level of control systems pre- and post-compromise. We investigate the rootkits' precompromise stage involving the deployment to multiple system locations and aggregation of system-specific information to build a neural network-based virtual data-driven model (VDDM) of the system. Then, during the weaponization phase, we demonstrate how the VDDM measurement predictions are paramount, first to orchestrate crippling attacks from multiple system standpoints, maximizing the impact, and second, impede detection blinding system operator situational awareness.

    "abstract": "Recent studies demonstrate that deep networks, even robustified by the state-of-the-art adversarial training (AT), still suffer from large robust generalization gaps, in addition to the much more expensive training costs than standard training. In this paper, we investigate this intriguing problem from a new perspective, i.e., injecting appropriate forms of sparsity during adversarial training. We introduce two alternatives for sparse adversarial training: (i) static sparsity, by leveraging recent results from the lottery ticket hypothesis to identify critical sparse subnetworks arising from the early training; (ii) dynamic sparsity, by allowing the sparse subnetwork to adaptively adjust its connectivity pattern (while sticking to the same sparsity ratio) throughout training. We find both static and dynamic sparse methods to yield win-win: substantially shrinking the robust generalization gap and alleviating the robust overfitting, meanwhile significantly saving training and inference FLOPs. Extensive experiments validate our proposals with multiple network architectures on diverse datasets, including CIFAR-10/100 and Tiny-ImageNet. For example, our methods reduce robust generalization gap and overfitting by 34.44% and 4.02%, with comparable robust/standard accuracy boosts and 87.83%/87.82% training/inference FLOPs savings on CIFAR-100 with ResNet-18. Besides, our approaches can be organically combined with existing regularizers, establishing new state-of-the-art results in AT.

    "abstract": "Machine Learning (ML) techniques are increasingly adopted to tackle ever-evolving high-profile network attacks, including DDoS, botnet, and ransomware, due to their unique ability to extract complex patterns hidden in data streams. These approaches are however routinely validated with data collected in the same environment, and their performance degrades when deployed in different network topologies and/or applied on previously unseen traffic, as we uncover. This suggests malicious/benign behaviors are largely learned superficially and ML-based Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) need revisiting, to be effective in practice. In this paper we dive into the mechanics of large-scale network attacks, with a view to understanding how to use ML for Network Intrusion Detection (NID) in a principled way. We reveal that, although cyberattacks vary significantly in terms of payloads, vectors and targets, their early stages, which are critical to successful attack outcomes, share many similarities and exhibit important temporal correlations. Therefore, we treat NID as a time-sensitive task and propose NetSentry, perhaps the first of its kind NIDS that builds on Bidirectional Asymmetric LSTM (Bi-ALSTM), an original ensemble of sequential neural models, to detect network threats before they spread. We cross-evaluate NetSentry using two practical datasets, training on one and testing on the other, and demonstrate F1 score gains above 33% over the state-of-the-art, as well as up to 3 times higher rates of detecting attacks such as XSS and web bruteforce. Further, we put forward a novel data augmentation technique that boosts the generalization abilities of a broad range of supervised deep learning algorithms, leading to average F1 score gains above 35%.

By mining the training tasks, we can select a compact portfolio of configurations that perform well over a wide variety of tasks, as well as learn a strategy to select portfolio configurations for yet-unseen tasks. The algorithm runs in a zero-shot manner, that is without training any models online except the chosen one.

In this paper, we introduce the Parametric Control Barrier Function (Parametric-CBF), a novel variant of the traditional Control Barrier Function to extend its expressivity in describing different safe behaviors among heterogeneous robots. Instead of assuming cooperative and homogeneous robots using the same safe controllers, the ego robot is able to model the neighboring robots' underlying safe controllers through different Parametric-CBFs with observed data. Given learned parametric-CBF and proved forward invariance, it provides greater flexibility for the ego robot to better coordinate with other heterogeneous robots with improved efficiency while enjoying formally provable safety guarantees. We demonstrate the usage of Parametric-CBF in behavior prediction and adaptive safe control in the ramp merging scenario from the applications of autonomous driving. Compared to traditional CBF, Parametric-CBF has the advantage of capturing varying drivers' characteristics given richer description of robot behavior in the context of safe control. Numerical simulations are given to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. ",

    "abstract": "The text-based speech editor allows the editing of speech through intuitive cutting, copying, and pasting operations to speed up the process of editing speech. However, the major drawback of current systems is that edited speech often sounds unnatural due to cut-copy-paste operation. In addition, it is not obvious how to synthesize records according to a new word not appearing in the transcript. This paper proposes a novel end-to-end text-based speech editing method called context-aware mask prediction network (CampNet). The model can simulate the text-based speech editing process by randomly masking part of speech and then predicting the masked region by sensing the speech context. It can solve unnatural prosody in the edited region and synthesize the speech corresponding to the unseen words in the transcript. Secondly, for the possible operation of text-based speech editing, we design three text-based operations based on CampNet: deletion, insertion, and replacement. These operations can cover various situations of speech editing. Thirdly, to synthesize the speech corresponding to long text in insertion and replacement operations, a word-level autoregressive generation method is proposed. Fourthly, we propose a speaker adaptation method using only one sentence for CampNet and explore the ability of few-shot learning based on CampNet, which provides a new idea for speech forgery tasks. The subjective and objective experiments on VCTK and LibriTTS datasets show that the speech editing results based on CampNet are better than TTS technology, manual editing, and VoCo method. We also conduct detailed ablation experiments to explore the effect of the CampNet structure on its performance. Finally, the experiment shows that speaker adaptation with only one sentence can further improve the naturalness of speech.

    "abstract": "With the widespread use of machine learning, concerns over its security and reliability have become prevalent. As such, many have developed defenses to harden neural networks against adversarial examples, imperceptibly perturbed inputs that are reliably misclassified. Adversarial training in which adversarial examples are generated and used during training is one of the few known defenses able to reliably withstand such attacks against neural networks. However, adversarial training imposes a significant training overhead and scales poorly with model complexity and input dimension. In this paper, we propose Robust Representation Matching (RRM), a low-cost method to transfer the robustness of an adversarially trained model to a new model being trained for the same task irrespective of architectural differences. Inspired by student-teacher learning, our method introduces a novel training loss that encourages the student to learn the teacher's robust representations. Compared to prior works, RRM is superior with respect to both model performance and adversarial training time. On CIFAR-10, RRM trains a robust model $\\sim 1.8\\times$ faster than the state-of-the-art. Furthermore, RRM remains effective on higher-dimensional datasets. On Restricted-ImageNet, RRM trains a ResNet50 model $\\sim 18\\times$ faster than standard adversarial training. ",

It enables productivity improvement and maintenance cost reduction by preventing malfunctions and detecting anomalies based on time-series data. However, multivariate time-series anomaly detection is challenging because real-world time-series data exhibit complex temporal dependencies. For this task, it is crucial to learn a rich representation that effectively contains the nonlinear temporal dynamics of normal behavior. In this study, we propose an unsupervised multivariate time-series anomaly detection model named RAE-MEPC which learns informative normal representations based on multi-resolution ensemble and predictive coding. We introduce multi-resolution ensemble encoding to capture the multi-scale dependency from the input time series. The encoder hierarchically aggregates the temporal features extracted from the sub-encoders with different encoding lengths. From these encoded features, the reconstruction decoder reconstructs the input time series based on multi-resolution ensemble decoding where lower-resolution information helps to decode sub-decoders with higher-resolution outputs. Predictive coding is further introduced to encourage the model to learn the temporal dependencies of the time series. Experiments on real-world benchmark datasets show that the proposed model outperforms the benchmark models for multivariate time-series anomaly detection. ",

However, a prior study found that laypeople did not understand the data perturbation processes of DP and how DP noise protects their sensitive personal information. Consequently, they distrusted the techniques and chose to opt out of participating. In this project, we designed explanative illustrations of three DP models (Central DP, Local DP, Shuffler DP) to help laypeople conceptualize how random noise is added to protect individuals' privacy and preserve group utility. Following pilot surveys and interview studies, we conducted two online experiments (N = 595) examining participants' comprehension, privacy and utility perception, and data-sharing decisions across the three DP models. Besides the comparisons across the three models, we varied the noise levels of each model. We found that the illustrations can be effective in communicating DP to the participants. Given an adequate comprehension of DP, participants preferred strong privacy protection for a certain type of data usage scenarios (i.e., commercial interests) at both the model level and the noise level. We also obtained empirical evidence showing participants' acceptance of the Shuffler DP model for data privacy protection. Our findings have implications for multiple stakeholders for user-centered deployments of differential privacy, including app developers, DP model developers, data curators, and online users. ",

However, since the models are unable to select attention targets on demand, the diversity of trainable tasks are limited. This paper proposed a novel Key-Query-Value formulated visual attention model which can be guided to a certain attention target. The model creates an attention heatmap from Key and Query, and selectively extracts the attended data represented in Value. Such structure is capable of incorporating external inputs to create the Query, which will be trained to represent the target objects. The separation of Query creation improved the model's flexibility, enabling to simultaneously obtain and switch between multiple targets in a top-down manner. The proposed model is experimented on a simulator and a real-world environment, showing better performance compared to existing end-to-end robot vision models. The results of real-world experiments indicated the model's high scalability and extendiblity on robot controlling tasks. ",

    "abstract": "The autonomous car must recognize the driving environment quickly for safe driving. As the Light Detection And Range (LiDAR) sensor is widely used in the autonomous car, fast semantic segmentation of LiDAR point cloud, which is the point-wise classification of the point cloud within the sensor framerate, has attracted attention in recognition of the driving environment. Although the voxel and fusion-based semantic segmentation models are the state-of-the-art model in point cloud semantic segmentation recently, their real-time performance suffer from high computational load due to high voxel resolution. In this paper, we propose the fast voxel-based semantic segmentation model using Point Convolution and 3D Sparse Convolution (PCSCNet). The proposed model is designed to outperform at both high and low voxel resolution using point convolution-based feature extraction. Moreover, the proposed model accelerates the feature propagation using 3D sparse convolution after the feature extraction. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art real-time models in semantic segmentation of SemanticKITTI and nuScenes, and achieves the real-time performance in LiDAR point cloud inference.

When the compromised print advertisement is observed by an ADAS in a passing car, an undesired reaction is triggered from the ADAS. We analyze state-of-the-art object detectors and show that they do not take color or context into account in object detection. Our validation of these findings on Mobileye 630 PRO shows that this ADAS also fails to take color or context into account. Then, we show how an attacker can take advantage of these findings to execute an attack on a commercial ADAS, by embedding a phantom road sign in a print advertisement, which causes a car equipped with Mobileye 630 PRO to trigger a false notification to slow down. Finally, we discuss multiple countermeasures which can be deployed in order to mitigate the effect of our proposed attack. ",

Although still controversial, the prevailing view is that this trade-off is inherent, either empirically or theoretically. Thus, we dig for the origin of this trade-off in adversarial training and find that it may stem from the improperly defined robust error, which imposes an inductive bias of local invariance -- an overcorrection towards smoothness. Given this, we advocate employing local equivariance to describe the ideal behavior of a robust model, leading to a self-consistent robust error named SCORE. By definition, SCORE facilitates the reconciliation between robustness and accuracy, while still handling the worst-case uncertainty via robust optimization. By simply substituting KL divergence with variants of distance metrics, SCORE can be efficiently minimized. Empirically, our models achieve top-rank performance on RobustBench under AutoAttack. Besides, SCORE provides instructive insights for explaining the overfitting phenomenon and semantic input gradients observed on robust models. ",

Graph augmentation is an essential strategy to improve the performance of graph-based tasks, and has been widely utilized for analyzing web and social graphs. However, previous works for graph augmentation either a) involve the target model in the process of augmentation, losing the generalizability to other tasks, or b) rely on simple heuristics that lead to unreliable results. In this work, we introduce five desired properties for effective augmentation. Then, we propose NodeSam (Node Split and Merge) and SubMix (Subgraph Mix), two model-agnostic approaches for graph augmentation that satisfy all desired properties with different motivations. NodeSam makes a balanced change of the graph structure to minimize the risk of semantic change, while SubMix mixes random subgraphs of multiple graphs to create rich soft labels combining the evidence for different classes. Our experiments on social networks and molecular graphs show that NodeSam and SubMix outperform existing approaches in graph classification. ",

    "abstract": "Transcranial MRI-guided focused ultrasound (TcMRgFUS) is a therapeutic ultrasound method that focuses sound through the skull to a small region noninvasively under MRI guidance. It is clinically approved to thermally ablate regions of the thalamus and is being explored for other therapies, such as blood brain barrier opening and neuromodulation. To accurately target ultrasound through the skull, the transmitted waves must constructively interfere at the target region. However, heterogeneity of the sound speed, density, and ultrasound attenuation in different individuals' skulls requires patient-specific estimates of these parameters for optimal treatment planning. CT imaging is currently the gold standard for estimating acoustic properties of an individual skull during clinical procedures, but CT imaging exposes patients to radiation and increases the overall number of imaging procedures required for therapy. A method to estimate acoustic parameters in the skull without the need for CT would be desirable. Here, we synthesized CT images from routinely acquired T1-weighted MRI by using a 3D patch-based conditional generative adversarial network and evaluated the performance of synthesized CT images for treatment planning with transcranial focused ultrasound. We compared the performance of synthetic CT to real CT images using Kranion and k-Wave acoustic simulation. Our work demonstrates the feasibility of replacing real CT with the MR-synthesized CT for TcMRgFUS planning. ",

This is especially so in voice activated systems where the data can be noisy with many ambiguous directions for user intents. Before operation begins, these classifiers are generally lacking in real-world training data. Active learning is a common approach used to help label large amounts of collected user input. However, this approach requires many hours of manual labeling work. We present the Nearest Neighbors Scores Improvement (NNSI) algorithm for automatic data selection and labeling. The NNSI reduces the need for manual labeling by automatically selecting highly-ambiguous samples and labeling them with high accuracy. This is done by integrating the classifier's output from a semantically similar group of text samples. The labeled samples can then be added to the training set to improve the accuracy of the classifier. We demonstrated the use of NNSI on two large-scale, real-life voice conversation systems. Evaluation of our results showed that our method was able to select and label useful samples with high accuracy. Adding these new samples to the training data significantly improved the classifiers and reduced error rates by up to 10%. ",

However, the observable nodes and connections in real cases are often incomplete or unavailable due to measurement errors, private protection issues, or other problems. Therefore, inferring the complete network structure is useful for understanding human interactions and complex dynamics. The existing studies have not fully solved the problem of inferring network structure with partial information about connections or nodes. In this paper, we tackle the problem by utilizing time-series data generated by network dynamics. We regard the network inference problem based on dynamical time series data as a problem of minimizing errors for predicting states of observable nodes and proposed a novel data-driven deep learning model called Gumbel-softmax Inference for Network (GIN) to solve the problem under incomplete information. The GIN framework includes three modules: a dynamics learner, a network generator, and an initial state generator to infer the unobservable parts of the network. We implement experiments on artificial and empirical social networks with discrete and continuous dynamics. The experiments show that our method can infer the unknown parts of the structure and the initial states of the observable nodes with up to 90\\% accuracy. The accuracy declines linearly with the increase of the fractions of unobservable nodes. Our framework may have wide applications where the network structure is hard to obtain and the time series data is rich. ",

In our setting, inference is performed by iteratively sampling gradients of the marginal and conditional distributions entailed by the causal model. Counterfactual estimation is achieved by firstly inferring latent variables with deterministic forward diffusion, then intervening on a reverse diffusion process using the gradients of an anti-causal predictor w.r.t the input. Furthermore, we propose a metric for evaluating the generated counterfactuals. We find that Diff-SCM produces more realistic and minimal counterfactuals than baselines on MNIST data and can also be applied to ImageNet data. Code is available https://github.com/vios-s/Diff-SCM.

Existing CL approaches often keep a buffer of previously-seen samples, perform knowledge distillation, or use regularization techniques towards this goal. Despite their performance, they still suffer from interference across tasks which leads to catastrophic forgetting. To ameliorate this problem, we propose to only activate and select sparse neurons for learning current and past tasks at any stage. More parameters space and model capacity can thus be reserved for the future tasks. This minimizes the interference between parameters for different tasks. To do so, we propose a Sparse neural Network for Continual Learning (SNCL), which employs variational Bayesian sparsity priors on the activations of the neurons in all layers. Full Experience Replay (FER) provides effective supervision in learning the sparse activations of the neurons in different layers. A loss-aware reservoir-sampling strategy is developed to maintain the memory buffer. The proposed method is agnostic as to the network structures and the task boundaries.

State-of-the-art solutions suffer on high on-chain cost, low flexibility and security thus can hardly reach general users.

TENET identifies the pitfalls for supporting off-chain MPC-enabled confidential smart contracts by leveraging the TEE network and proposes corresponding treats, e.g., anonymously negotiate MPC among apriori-unknown participants, atomically and fairly distribute the MPC outputs, and securely evaluate an MPC program with constant on-chain transactions. TENET manages to secure an MPC by only 3 transactions. In our evaluation on both examples and real-world applications involving 2 to 11 parties, TENET costs 0.55-0.98X gas (0.91X on average) against the state-of-the-art. ",

In particular, a recent study proposes an algorithm to protect each user's feature vector in an attributed graph with LDP (Local Differential Privacy), a strong privacy notion without a trusted third party. However, this algorithm does not protect edges (friendships) in a social graph or protect user privacy in unattributed graphs. It remains open how to strongly protect edges with LDP while keeping high accuracy in GNNs. In this paper, we propose a novel LDP algorithm called the DPRR (Degree-Preserving Randomized Response) to provide LDP for edges in GNNs. Our DPRR preserves each user's degree hence a graph structure while providing edge LDP. Technically, we use Warner's RR (Randomized Response) and strategic edge sampling, where each user's sampling probability is automatically tuned to preserve the degree information. We prove that the DPRR approximately preserves the degree information under edge LDP. We focus on graph classification as a task of GNNs and evaluate the DPRR using two social graph datasets. Our experimental results show that the DPRR significantly outperforms Warner's RR and provides accuracy close to a non-private algorithm with a reasonable privacy budget, e.g., epsilon=1. ",

Our hierarchical reinforcement learning framework, named SGIM-SAHT, offers a new direction of research, and tries to unify partial implementations on robot arms and mobile robots. We outline our contributions to enable robots to map multiple control tasks to sequences of actions: representations of task dependencies, an intrinsically motivated exploration to learn task hierarchies, and active imitation learning.

    "abstract": "Model-based methods for recommender systems have been studied extensively for years. Modern recommender systems usually resort to 1) representation learning models which define user-item preference as the distance between their embedding representations, and 2) embedding-based Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) search to tackle the efficiency problem introduced by large-scale corpus. While providing efficient retrieval, the embedding-based retrieval pattern also limits the model capacity since the form of user-item preference measure is restricted to the distance between their embedding representations. However, for other more precise user-item preference measures, e.g., preference scores directly derived from a deep neural network, they are computationally intractable because of the lack of an efficient retrieval method, and an exhaustive search for all user-item pairs is impractical. In this paper, we propose a novel method to extend ANN search to arbitrary matching functions, e.g., a deep neural network. Our main idea is to perform a greedy walk with a matching function in a similarity graph constructed from all items. To solve the problem that the similarity measures of graph construction and user-item matching function are heterogeneous, we propose a pluggable adversarial training task to ensure the graph search with arbitrary matching function can achieve fairly high precision. Experimental results in both open source and industry datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. The proposed method has been fully deployed in the Taobao display advertising platform and brings a considerable advertising revenue increase.

    "abstract": "Sparsity of user-to-item rating data becomes one of challenging issues in the recommender systems, which severely deteriorates the recommendation performance. Fortunately, context-aware recommender systems can alleviate the sparsity problem by making use of some auxiliary information, such as the information of both the users and items. In particular, the visual information of items, such as the movie poster, can be considered as the supplement for item description documents, which helps to obtain more item features. In this paper, we focus on movie recommender system and propose a probabilistic matrix factorization based recommendation scheme called visual recurrent convolutional matrix factorization (VRConvMF), which utilizes the textual and multi-level visual features extracted from the descriptive texts and posters respectively. We implement the proposed VRConvMF and conduct extensive experiments on three commonly used real world datasets to validate its effectiveness. The experimental results illustrate that the proposed VRConvMF outperforms the existing schemes. ",

We adapt this method to the copy detection task by changing the architecture and training objective, including a pooling operator from the instance matching literature, and adapting contrastive learning to augmentations that combine images. Our approach relies on an entropy regularization term, promoting consistent separation between descriptor vectors, and we demonstrate that this significantly improves copy detection accuracy. Our method produces a compact descriptor vector, suitable for real-world web scale applications. Statistical information from a background image distribution can be incorporated into the descriptor. On the recent DISC2021 benchmark, SSCD is shown to outperform both baseline copy detection models and self-supervised architectures designed for image classification by huge margins, in all settings. For example, SSCD out-performs SimCLR descriptors by 48% absolute. ",

However, most recent studies have shown several vulnerabilities from attacks with a potential to jeopardize the integrity of the model, presenting a new window of research opportunity in terms of cyber-security. This survey is conducted with a main intention of highlighting the most relevant information related to security vulnerabilities in the context of machine learning (ML) classifiers; more specifically, directed towards training procedures against data poisoning attacks, representing a type of attack that consists of tampering the data samples fed to the model during the training phase, leading to a degradation in the models accuracy during the inference phase. This work compiles the most relevant insights and findings found in the latest existing literatures addressing this type of attacks. Moreover, this paper also covers several defense techniques that promise feasible detection and mitigation mechanisms, capable of conferring a certain level of robustness to a target model against an attacker. A thorough assessment is performed on the reviewed works, comparing the effects of data poisoning on a wide range of ML models in real-world conditions, performing quantitative and qualitative analyses. This paper analyzes the main characteristics for each approach including performance success metrics, required hyperparameters, and deployment complexity. Moreover, this paper emphasizes the underlying assumptions and limitations considered by both attackers and defenders along with their intrinsic properties such as: availability, reliability, privacy, accountability, interpretability, etc. Finally, this paper concludes by making references of some of main existing research trends that provide pathways towards future research directions in the field of cyber-security.

In real-world scenarios, license plate recognition still faces many challenges and is impaired by unpredictable interference such as weather or lighting conditions. Many machine learning based ALPR solutions have been proposed to solve such challenges in recent years. However, most are not convincing, either because their results are evaluated on small or simple datasets that lack diverse surroundings, or because they require powerful hardware to achieve a reasonable frames-per-second in real-world applications. In this paper, we propose a novel segmentation-free framework for license plate recognition and introduce NP-ALPR, a diverse and challenging dataset which resembles real-world scenarios. The proposed network model consists of the latest deep learning methods and state-of-the-art ideas, and benefits from a novel network architecture. It achieves higher accuracy with lower computational requirements than previous works. We evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method on three different datasets and show a recognition accuracy of over 99% and over 70 fps, demonstrating that our method is not only robust but also computationally efficient.

The training dataset contains only normal data as anomalous states are introduced in the latent variable and input them into the generator to produce diverse pseudo-anomalous data.

    "abstract": "The vulnerability against presentation attacks is a crucial problem undermining the wide-deployment of face recognition systems. Though presentation attack detection (PAD) systems try to address this problem, the lack of generalization and robustness continues to be a major concern. Several works have shown that using multi-channel PAD systems could alleviate this vulnerability and result in more robust systems. However, there is a wide selection of channels available for a PAD system such as RGB, Near Infrared, Shortwave Infrared, Depth, and Thermal sensors. Having a lot of sensors increases the cost of the system, and therefore an understanding of the performance of different sensors against a wide variety of attacks is necessary while selecting the modalities. In this work, we perform a comprehensive study to understand the effectiveness of various imaging modalities for PAD. The studies are performed on a multi-channel PAD dataset, collected with 14 different sensing modalities considering a wide range of 2D, 3D, and partial attacks. We used the multi-channel convolutional network-based architecture, which uses pixel-wise binary supervision. The model has been evaluated with different combinations of channels, and different image qualities on a variety of challenging known and unknown attack protocols. The results reveal interesting trends and can act as pointers for sensor selection for safety-critical presentation attack detection systems. The source codes and protocols to reproduce the results are made available publicly making it possible to extend this work to other architectures. ",

Domain adaptation techniques used in NMT usually require fine-tuning and in-domain training data, which may pose difficulties for those working with lesser-resourced languages and may also lead to performance decay of the NMT system for out-of-domain sentences. Scylla does not require fine-tuning of the NMT model, avoiding the risk of model over-fitting and consequent decrease in performance for out-of-domain translations. Two versions of Scylla are presented: one using the source sentence as input, and another one using the target sentence. We evaluate Scylla in comparison to a state-of-the-art commercial NMT system in an experiment in which 50 sentences from the Sports domain are translated from Brazilian Portuguese to English. The two versions of Scylla significantly outperform the baseline commercial system in HTER. ",

The representations of existing PAD works with simple global pooling method, however, lose the local feature discriminability. In this paper, the VLAD aggregation method is adopted to quantize local features with visual vocabulary locally partitioning the feature space, and hence preserve the local discriminability. We further propose the vocabulary separation and adaptation method to modify VLAD for cross-domain PADtask. The proposed vocabulary separation method divides vocabulary into domain-shared and domain-specific visual words to cope with the diversity of live and attack faces under the cross-domain scenario. The proposed vocabulary adaptation method imitates the maximization step of the k-means algorithm in the end-to-end training, which guarantees the visual words be close to the center of assigned local features and thus brings robust similarity measurement. We give illustrations and extensive experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of VLAD with the proposed vocabulary separation and adaptation method on standard cross-domain PAD benchmarks.

However, the vast majority of the existing segmentation-based approaches are limited to their complex post-processing algorithms and the scale robustness of their segmentation models, where the post-processing algorithms are not only isolated to the model optimization but also time-consuming and the scale robustness is usually strengthened by fusing multi-scale feature maps directly. In this paper, we propose a Differentiable Binarization (DB) module that integrates the binarization process, one of the most important steps in the post-processing procedure, into a segmentation network. Optimized along with the proposed DB module, the segmentation network can produce more accurate results, which enhances the accuracy of text detection with a simple pipeline. Furthermore, an efficient Adaptive Scale Fusion (ASF) module is proposed to improve the scale robustness by fusing features of different scales adaptively. By incorporating the proposed DB and ASF with the segmentation network, our proposed scene text detector consistently achieves state-of-the-art results, in terms of both detection accuracy and speed, on five standard benchmarks.

    "abstract": "Biometric data, such as face images, are often associated with sensitive information (e.g medical, financial, personal government records). Hence, a data breach in a system storing such information can have devastating consequences. Deep learning is widely utilized for face recognition (FR); however, such models are vulnerable to backdoor attacks executed by malicious parties. Backdoor attacks cause a model to misclassify a particular class as a target class during recognition. This vulnerability can allow adversaries to gain access to highly sensitive data protected by biometric authentication measures or allow the malicious party to masquerade as an individual with higher system permissions. Such breaches pose a serious privacy threat. Previous methods integrate noise addition mechanisms into face recognition models to mitigate this issue and improve the robustness of classification against backdoor attacks. However, this can drastically affect model accuracy. We propose a novel and generalizable approach (named BA-BAM: Biometric Authentication - Backdoor Attack Mitigation), that aims to prevent backdoor attacks on face authentication deep learning models through transfer learning and selective image perturbation. The empirical evidence shows that BA-BAM is highly robust and incurs a maximal accuracy drop of 2.4%, while reducing the attack success rate to a maximum of 20%. Comparisons with existing approaches show that BA-BAM provides a more practical backdoor mitigation approach for face recognition. ",

    "abstract": "Traffic flow prediction is an integral part of an intelligent transportation system and thus fundamental for various traffic-related applications. Buses are an indispensable way of moving for urban residents with fixed routes and schedules, which leads to latent travel regularity. However, human mobility patterns, specifically the complex relationships between bus passengers, are deeply hidden in this fixed mobility mode. Although many models exist to predict traffic flow, human mobility patterns have not been well explored in this regard. To reduce this research gap and learn human mobility knowledge from this fixed travel behaviors, we propose a multi-pattern passenger flow prediction framework, MPGCN, based on Graph Convolutional Network (GCN). Firstly, we construct a novel sharing-stop network to model relationships between passengers based on bus record data. Then, we employ GCN to extract features from the graph by learning useful topology information and introduce a deep clustering method to recognize mobility patterns hidden in bus passengers. Furthermore, to fully utilize Spatio-temporal information, we propose GCN2Flow to predict passenger flow based on various mobility patterns. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first work to adopt a multipattern approach to predict the bus passenger flow from graph learning. We design a case study for optimizing routes. Extensive experiments upon a real-world bus dataset demonstrate that MPGCN has potential efficacy in passenger flow prediction and route optimization. ",

While being very flexible environments, they are vulnerable to computing and networking attacks. Recent NCSs hacking incidents had major impact. They call for more research on cyber-physical security. Fears about the use of quantum computing to break current cryptosystems make matters worse. While the quantum threat motivated the creation of new disciplines to handle the issue, such as post-quantum cryptography, other fields have overlooked the existence of quantum-enabled adversaries. This is the case of cyber-physical defense research, a distinct but complementary discipline to cyber-physical protection. Cyber-physical defense refers to the capability to detect and react in response to cyber-physical attacks. Concretely, it involves the integration of mechanisms to identify adverse events and prepare response plans, during and after incidents occur. In this paper, we make the assumption that the eventually available quantum computer will provide an advantage to adversaries against defenders, unless they also adopt this technology. We envision the necessity for a paradigm shift, where an increase of adversarial resources because of quantum supremacy does not translate into higher likelihood of disruptions. Consistently with current system design practices in other areas, such as the use of artificial intelligence for the reinforcement of attack detection tools, we outline a vision for next generation cyber-physical defense layers leveraging ideas from quantum computing and machine learning. Through an example, we show that defenders of NCSs can learn and improve their strategies to anticipate and recover from attacks. ",

The image quality of OCTA, however, is often hurt by Bulk Motion Artifacts (BMA), which are due to micromotion of subjects and typically appear as bright stripes surrounded by blurred areas. State-of-the-art BMA handling solutions usually treat the problem as an image inpainting one with deep neural network algorithms. These solutions, however, require numerous training samples with nontrivial annotation. Nevertheless, this context-based inpainting model has limited correction capability because it discards the rich structural and appearance information carried in the BMA stripe region. To address these issues, in this paper we propose a self-supervised content-aware BMA recover model. First, the gradient-based structural information and appearance feature are extracted from the BMA area and injected into the model to capture more connectivity. Second, with easily collected defective masks, the model is trained in a self-supervised manner that only the clear areas are for training while the BMA areas for inference. With structural information and appearance feature from noisy image as references, our model could correct larger BMA and produce better visualizing result. Only 2D images with defective masks are involved so our method is more efficient. Experiments on OCTA of mouse cortex demonstrate that our model could correct most BMA with extremely large sizes and inconsistent intensities while existing methods fail. ",

The proposed statistical model considers the link blockage and other network parameters such as antenna configuration and device density. The findings show that the characteristic function (CF) of the aggregated interference power can be regarded as a weighted mixture of two alpha-stable distributions.

These techniques have a great many applications in all areas of the modern digital economy and artificial intelligence. More importantly, these methods are essential for a rapidly increasing number of safety-critical applications such as autonomous vehicles and intelligent defense systems. However, emerging adversarial learning attacks pose a serious security threat that greatly undermines further such systems. The latter are classified into four types, evasion (manipulating data to avoid detection), poisoning (injection malicious training samples to disrupt retraining), model stealing (extraction), and inference (leveraging over-generalization on training data). Understanding this type of attacks is a crucial first step for the development of effective countermeasures. The paper provides a detailed tutorial on the principles of adversarial machining learning, explains the different attack scenarios, and gives an in-depth insight into the state-of-art defense mechanisms against this rising threat .

    "abstract": "Knowledge graphs (KGs) are an important source repository for a wide range of applications and rule mining from KGs recently attracts wide research interest in the KG-related research community. Many solutions have been proposed for the rule mining from large-scale KGs, which however are limited in the inefficiency of rule generation and ineffectiveness of rule evaluation. To solve these problems, in this paper we propose a generation-then-evaluation rule mining approach guided by reinforcement learning. Specifically, a two-phased framework is designed. The first phase aims to train a reinforcement learning agent for rule generation from KGs, and the second is to utilize the value function of the agent to guide the step-by-step rule generation. We conduct extensive experiments on several datasets and the results prove that our rule mining solution achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of efficiency and effectiveness. ",

    "abstract": "The task of abductive natural language inference (\\alpha{}nli), to decide which hypothesis is the more likely explanation for a set of observations, is a particularly difficult type of NLI. Instead of just determining a causal relationship, it requires common sense to also evaluate how reasonable an explanation is. All recent competitive systems build on top of contextualized representations and make use of transformer architectures for learning an NLI model. When somebody is faced with a particular NLI task, they need to select the best model that is available. This is a time-consuming and resource-intense endeavour. To solve this practical problem, we propose a simple method for predicting the performance without actually fine-tuning the model. We do this by testing how well the pre-trained models perform on the \\alpha{}nli task when just comparing sentence embeddings with cosine similarity to what the performance that is achieved when training a classifier on top of these embeddings. We show that the accuracy of the cosine similarity approach correlates strongly with the accuracy of the classification approach with a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.65. Since the similarity computation is orders of magnitude faster to compute on a given dataset (less than a minute vs. hours), our method can lead to significant time savings in the process of model selection.

Existing methods often focus on state-based metrics, which do not consider the underlying causal structures of the environment, and while recent research has begun to explore RL environments for causal learning, these environments primarily leverage causal information through causal inference or induction rather than exploration. In contrast, human children - some of the most proficient explorers - have been shown to use causal information to great benefit. In this work, we introduce a novel RL environment designed with a controllable causal structure, which allows us to evaluate exploration strategies used by both agents and children in a unified environment. In addition, through experimentation on both computation models and children, we demonstrate that there are significant differences between information-gain optimal RL exploration in causal environments and the exploration of children in the same environments. We conclude with a discussion of how these findings may inspire new directions of research into efficient exploration and disambiguation of causal structures for RL algorithms. ",

When the domain includes many objects, reasoning about the objects and their relationships makes robot planning even more difficult. In this paper, we develop an algorithm called scene analysis for robot planning (SARP) that enables robots to reason with visual contextual information toward achieving long-term goals under uncertainty. SARP constructs scene graphs, a factored representation of objects and their relations, using images captured from different positions, and reasons with them to enable context-aware robot planning under partial observability. Experiments have been conducted using multiple 3D environments in simulation, and a dataset collected by a real robot. In comparison to standard robot planning and scene analysis methods, in a target search domain, SARP improves both efficiency and accuracy in task completion.

We present a theoretical analysis of both approaches and our results are extensively validated using simulations.

Epidemiological ODE models contain mechanisms that can guide us in these two tasks; however, they have limited capability of ingesting data sources and modeling composite signals. Thus we propose to supervise neural networks with epidemic mechanistic models while simultaneously learning their hidden dynamics. Our method EINN allows neural models have the flexibility to learn the disease spread dynamics and use auxiliary features in a general framework. In contrast with previous work, we not assume the observability of complete dynamics and do not need to numerically solve the ODE equations during training.

Recently, convolutional neural networks have shown significant ability to extract the blood vessel structure. However, it remains challenging to refined segmentation for the capillaries and the edges of retinal vessels due to thickness inconsistencies and blurry boundaries. In this paper, we propose a novel deep neural network for retinal vessel segmentation based on shared decoder and pyramid-like loss (SPNet) to address the above problems. Specifically, we introduce a decoder-sharing mechanism to capture multi-scale semantic information, where feature maps at diverse scales are decoded through a sequence of weight-sharing decoder modules. Also, to strengthen characterization on the capillaries and the edges of blood vessels, we define a residual pyramid architecture which decomposes the spatial information in the decoding phase. A pyramid-like loss function is designed to compensate possible segmentation errors progressively. Experimental results on public benchmarks show that the proposed method outperforms the backbone network and the state-of-the-art methods, especially in the regions of the capillaries and the vessel contours. In addition, performances on cross-datasets verify that SPNet shows stronger generalization ability. ",

Diabetic retinopathy, for example, is a complication of type 1 and 2 diabetus mellitus that can cause blindness. Microvascular diseases are assessed by visual inspection of retinal images, but this can be challenging when diseases exhibit silent symptoms or patients cannot attend in-person meetings. We examine the performance of machine learning algorithms in detecting microvascular disease when trained on either statistical or topological summaries of segmented retinal vascular images. We apply our methods to four publicly-available datasets and find that the fractal dimension performs best for high resolution images. By contrast, we find that topological descriptor vectors quantifying the number of loops in the data achieve the highest accuracy for low resolution images. Further analysis, using the topological approach, reveals that microvascular disease may alter morphology by reducing the number of loops in the retinal vasculature. Our work provides preliminary guidelines on which methods are most appropriate for assessing disease in high and low resolution images. In the longer term, these methods could be incorporated into automated disease assessment tools. ",

With the rise of deep learning, neural networks (NN) have shown great potential in CD. However, current NN models introduce backbone architectures that lose the detail information during learning.

In this work, we tackle this issue by proposing RDP-Net: a region detail preserving network for CD. We propose an efficient training strategy that quantifies the importance of individual samples during the warmup period of NN training. Then, we perform non-uniform sampling based on the importance score so that the NN could learn detail information from easy to hard. Next, we propose an effective edge loss that improves the network's attention on details such as boundaries and small regions. As a result, we provide a NN model that achieves the state-of-the-art empirical performance in CD with only 1.70M parameters. We hope our RDP-Net would benefit the practical CD applications on compact devices and could inspire more people to bring change detection to a new level with the efficient training strategy. ",

    "abstract": "Brain tumor detection can make the difference between life and death. Recently, deep learning-based brain tumor detection techniques have gained attention due to their higher performance. However, obtaining the expected performance of such deep learning-based systems requires large amounts of classified images to train the deep models. Obtaining such data is usually boring, time-consuming, and can easily be exposed to human mistakes which hinder the utilization of such deep learning approaches. This paper introduces a novel framework for brain tumor detection and classification. The basic idea is to generate a large synthetic MRI images dataset that reflects the typical pattern of the brain MRI images from a small class-unbalanced collected dataset. The resulted dataset is then used for training a deep model for detection and classification. Specifically, we employ two types of deep models. The first model is a generative model to capture the distribution of the important features in a set of small class-unbalanced brain MRI images. Then by using this distribution, the generative model can synthesize any number of brain MRI images for each class. Hence, the system can automatically convert a small unbalanced dataset to a larger balanced one. The second model is the classifier that is trained using the large balanced dataset to detect brain tumors in MRI images. The proposed framework acquires an overall detection accuracy of 96.88% which highlights the promise of the proposed framework as an accurate low-overhead brain tumor detection system. ",

    "abstract": "Machine Learning explainability techniques have been proposed as a means of `explaining' or interrogating a model in order to understand why a particular decision or prediction has been made. Such an ability is especially important at a time when machine learning is being used to automate decision processes which concern sensitive factors and legal outcomes. Indeed, it is even a requirement according to EU law. Furthermore, researchers concerned with imposing overly restrictive functional form (e.g. as would be the case in a linear regression) may be motivated to use machine learning algorithms in conjunction with explainability techniques, as part of exploratory research, with the goal of identifying important variables which are associated with an outcome of interest. For example, epidemiologists might be interested in identifying 'risk factors' - i.e., factors which affect recovery from disease - by using random forests and assessing variable relevance using importance measures. However, and as we aim to demonstrate, machine learning algorithms are not as flexible as they might seem, and are instead incredibly sensitive to the underling causal structure in the data. The consequences of this are that predictors which are, in fact, critical to a causal system and highly correlated with the outcome, may nonetheless be deemed by explainability techniques to be unrelated/unimportant/unpredictive of the outcome. Rather than this being a limitation of explainability techniques per se, it is rather a consequence of the mathematical implications of regressions, and the interaction of these implications with the associated conditional independencies of the underlying causal structure. We provide some alternative recommendations for researchers wanting to explore the data for important variables. ",

In this paper, we aim to quantitatively analyze why DNNs can achieve comparable performance in the physical layer comparing with traditional techniques, and also drive their cost in terms of computational complexity. To achieve this goal, we first analyze the encoding performance of a DNN-based transmitter and compare it to a traditional one. And then, we theoretically analyze the performance of DNN-based estimator and compare it with traditional estimators. Third, we investigate and validate how information is flown in a DNN-based communication system under the information theoretic concepts. Our analysis develops a concise way to open the \"black box\" of DNNs in physical layer communication, which can be applied to support the design of DNN-based intelligent communication techniques and help to provide explainable performance assessment.

    "title": "Photometric Redshift Estimation with Convolutional Neural Networks and  Galaxy Images: A Case Study of Resolving Biases in Data-Driven Methods",
    "abstract": "Deep Learning models have been increasingly exploited in astrophysical studies, yet such data-driven algorithms are prone to producing biased outputs detrimental for subsequent analyses. In this work, we investigate two major forms of biases, i.e., class-dependent residuals and mode collapse, in a case study of estimating photometric redshifts as a classification problem using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and galaxy images with spectroscopic redshifts. We focus on point estimates and propose a set of consecutive steps for resolving the two biases based on CNN models, involving representation learning with multi-channel outputs, balancing the training data and leveraging soft labels. The residuals can be viewed as a function of spectroscopic redshifts or photometric redshifts, and the biases with respect to these two definitions are incompatible and should be treated in a split way. We suggest that resolving biases in the spectroscopic space is a prerequisite for resolving biases in the photometric space. Experiments show that our methods possess a better capability in controlling biases compared to benchmark methods, and exhibit robustness under varying implementing and training conditions provided with high-quality data. Our methods have promises for future cosmological surveys that require a good constraint of biases, and may be applied to regression problems and other studies that make use of data-driven models. Nonetheless, the bias-variance trade-off and the demand on sufficient statistics suggest the need for developing better methodologies and optimizing data usage strategies. ",

    "abstract": "Diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) using clinical evaluation (cognitive tests) is challenging due to wide variations amongst individuals. Since no effective treatment exists, prompt and reliable ASD diagnosis can enable the effective preparation of treatment regimens. This paper proposes structural Magnetic Resonance Imaging (sMRI)-based ASD diagnosis via an outlier detection approach. To learn Spatio-temporal patterns in structural brain connectivity, a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) is trained exclusively with sMRI scans of healthy subjects. Given a stack of three adjacent slices as input, the GAN generator reconstructs the next three adjacent slices; the GAN discriminator then identifies ASD sMRI scan reconstructions as outliers. This model is compared against two other baselines -- a simpler UNet and a sophisticated Self-Attention GAN. Axial, Coronal, and Sagittal sMRI slices from the multi-site ABIDE II dataset are used for evaluation. Extensive experiments reveal that our ASD detection framework performs comparably with the state-of-the-art with far fewer training data. Furthermore, longitudinal data (two scans per subject over time) achieve 17-28% higher accuracy than cross-sectional data (one scan per subject). Among other findings, metrics employed for model training as well as reconstruction loss computation impact detection performance, and the coronal modality is found to best encode structural information for ASD detection.

We proposed a two-stage framework to address multi-channel speech denoising and dereverberation.

In the second stage, a multiple input and single output (MISO) network is applied to enhance the speech from desired direction and post-filtering. As a result, our system ranked 3rd place in ICASSP2022 L3DAS22 challenge and significantly outperforms the baseline system, while achieving 3.2% WER and 0.972 STOI on the blind test-set. ",

    "abstract": "We study the problem of transfer-learning in the setting of stochastic linear bandit tasks. We consider that a low dimensional linear representation is shared across the tasks, and study the benefit of learning this representation in the multi-task learning setting. Following recent results to design stochastic bandit policies, we propose an efficient greedy policy based on trace norm regularization. It implicitly learns a low dimensional representation by encouraging the matrix formed by the task regression vectors to be of low rank. Unlike previous work in the literature, our policy does not need to know the rank of the underlying matrix. We derive an upper bound on the multi-task regret of our policy, which is, up to logarithmic factors, of order $\\sqrt{NdT(T+d)r}$, where $T$ is the number of tasks, $r$ the rank, $d$ the number of variables and $N$ the number of rounds per task. We show the benefit of our strategy compared to the baseline $Td\\sqrt{N}$ obtained by solving each task independently. We also provide a lower bound to the multi-task regret. Finally, we corroborate our theoretical findings with preliminary experiments on synthetic data. ",

S3T introduces a momentum-based paradigm, MoCo, with Swin Transformer as its feature extractor to music time-frequency domain. For better music representations learning, S3T contributes a music data augmentation pipeline and two specially designed pre-processors. To our knowledge, S3T is the first method combining the Swin Transformer with a self-supervised learning method for music classification. We evaluate S3T on music genre classification and music tagging tasks with linear classifiers trained on learned representations. Experimental results show that S3T outperforms the previous self-supervised method (CLMR) by 12.5 percents top-1 accuracy and 4.8 percents PR-AUC on two tasks respectively, and also surpasses the task-specific state-of-the-art supervised methods. Besides, S3T shows advances in label efficiency using only 10% labeled data exceeding CLMR on both tasks with 100% labeled data. ",

    "abstract": "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been diagnosed automatically using Machine Learning algorithms over chest X-ray (CXR) images. However, most of the earlier studies used Deep Learning models over scarce datasets bearing the risk of overfitting. Additionally, previous studies have revealed the fact that deep networks are not reliable for classification since their decisions may originate from irrelevant areas on the CXRs. Therefore, in this study, we propose Operational Segmentation Network (OSegNet) that performs detection by segmenting COVID-19 pneumonia for a reliable diagnosis. To address the data scarcity encountered in training and especially in evaluation, this study extends the largest COVID-19 CXR dataset: QaTa-COV19 with 121,378 CXRs including 9258 COVID-19 samples with their corresponding ground-truth segmentation masks that are publicly shared with the research community. Consequently, OSegNet has achieved a detection performance with the highest accuracy of 99.65% among the state-of-the-art deep models with 98.09% precision. ",

    "abstract": "We establish a one-shot strong converse bound for privacy amplification against quantum side information using trace distance as a security criterion. This strong converse bound implies that in the independent and identical scenario, the trace distance exponentially converges to one in every finite blocklength when the rate of the extracted randomness exceeds the quantum conditional entropy. The established one-shot bound has an application to bounding the information leakage of classical-quantum wiretap channel coding and private communication over quantum channels. That is, the trace distance between Alice and Eavesdropper's joint state and its decoupled state vanishes as the rate of randomness used in hashing exceeds the quantum mutual information. On the other hand, the trace distance converges to one when the rate is below the quantum mutual information, resulting in an exponential strong converse. Our result also leads to an exponential strong converse for entropy accumulation, which complements a recent result by Dupuis [arXiv:2105.05342]. Lastly, our result and its applications apply to the moderate deviation regime. Namely, we characterize the asymptotic behaviors of the trace distances when the associated rates approach the fundamental thresholds with speeds slower than $O(1/\\sqrt{n})$. ",

    "abstract": "We study the problem of assortative and disassortative partitions on random $d$-regular graphs. Nodes in the graph are partitioned into two non-empty groups. In the assortative partition every node requires at least $H$ of their neighbors to be in their own group. In the disassortative partition they require less than $H$ neighbors to be in their own group. Using the cavity method based on analysis of the Belief Propagation algorithm we establish for which combinations of parameters $(d,H)$ these partitions exist with high probability and for which they do not. For $H>\\lceil \\frac{d}{2} \\rceil $ we establish that the structure of solutions to the assortative partition problems corresponds to the so-called frozen-1RSB. This entails a conjecture of algorithmic hardness of finding these partitions efficiently. For $H \\le \\lceil \\frac{d}{2} \\rceil $ we argue that the assortative partition problem is algorithmically easy on average for all $d$. Further we provide arguments about asymptotic equivalence between the assortative partition problem and the disassortative one, going trough a close relation to the problem of single-spin-flip-stable states in spin glasses. In the context of spin glasses, our results on algorithmic hardness imply a conjecture that gapped single spin flip stable states are hard to find which may be a universal reason behind the observation that physical dynamics in glassy systems display convergence to marginal stability.
