    "abstract": "Graph neural networks (GNNs) build on the success of deep learning models by extending them for use in graph spaces. Transfer learning has proven extremely successful for traditional deep learning problems: resulting in faster training and improved performance. Despite the increasing interest in GNNs and their use cases, there is little research on their transferability. This research demonstrates that transfer learning is effective with GNNs, and describes how source tasks and the choice of GNN impact the ability to learn generalisable knowledge. We perform experiments using real-world and synthetic data within the contexts of node classification and graph classification. To this end, we also provide a general methodology for transfer learning experimentation and present a novel algorithm for generating synthetic graph classification tasks. We compare the performance of GCN, GraphSAGE and GIN across both the synthetic and real-world datasets. Our results demonstrate empirically that GNNs with inductive operations yield statistically significantly improved transfer. Further we show that similarity in community structure between source and target tasks support statistically significant improvements in transfer over and above the use of only the node attributes.

The proposed model is composed by a a generic Internal Combustion engine and a speed controller, that communicate through a Controller Area Network (CAN) bus. We consider a threat model composed by three representative attack scenarios designed to modify the output of the model, thus affecting the rotational speed of the engine. Two attack scenarios target both vehicle sensor systems and CAN communication, while one attack scenario only requires injection of CAN messages. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt of modeling the consequences of realistic cyber attacks against a modern vehicle. ",

    "abstract": "In cooperative localization schemes for robotic networks relying on noisy range measurements between agents, the achievable positioning accuracy strongly depends on the network geometry. This motivates the problem of planning robot trajectories in such multi-robot systems in a way that maintains high localization accuracy. We present potential-based planning methods, where localizability potentials are introduced to characterize the quality of the network geometry for cooperative position estimation. These potentials are based on Cram\\'er Rao Lower Bounds (CRLB) and provide a theoretical lower bound on the error covariance achievable by any unbiased position estimator. In the process, we establish connections between CRLBs and the theory of graph rigidity, which has been previously used to plan the motion of robotic networks. We develop decentralized deployment algorithms appropriate for large networks, and we use equality-constrained CRLBs to extend the concept of localizability to scenarios where additional information about the relative positions of the ranging sensors is known. We illustrate the resulting robot deployment methodology through simulated examples. ",

    "abstract": "A major bottleneck in training robust Human-Activity Recognition models (HAR) is the need for large-scale labeled sensor datasets. Because labeling large amounts of sensor data is an expensive task, unsupervised and semi-supervised learning techniques have emerged that can learn good features from the data without requiring any labels. In this paper, we extend this line of research and present a novel technique called Collaborative Self-Supervised Learning (ColloSSL) which leverages unlabeled data collected from multiple devices worn by a user to learn high-quality features of the data. A key insight that underpins the design of ColloSSL is that unlabeled sensor datasets simultaneously captured by multiple devices can be viewed as natural transformations of each other, and leveraged to generate a supervisory signal for representation learning. We present three technical innovations to extend conventional self-supervised learning algorithms to a multi-device setting: a Device Selection approach which selects positive and negative devices to enable contrastive learning, a Contrastive Sampling algorithm which samples positive and negative examples in a multi-device setting, and a loss function called Multi-view Contrastive Loss which extends standard contrastive loss to a multi-device setting. Our experimental results on three multi-device datasets show that ColloSSL outperforms both fully-supervised and semi-supervised learning techniques in majority of the experiment settings, resulting in an absolute increase of upto 7.9% in F_1 score compared to the best performing baselines. We also show that ColloSSL outperforms the fully-supervised methods in a low-data regime, by just using one-tenth of the available labeled data in the best case. ",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we introduce a new representation for team-coordinated game-theoretic decision making, which we coin team belief DAG form. In our representation, at every timestep, a team coordinator observes the information that is public to all its members, and then decides on a prescription for all the possible states consistent with its observations. Our representation unifies and extends recent approaches to team coordination. Similar to the approach of Carminati et al (2021), our team belief DAG form can be used to capture adversarial team games, and enables standard, out-of-the-box game-theoretic techniques including no-regret learning (e.g., CFR and its state-of-the-art modern variants such as DCFR and PCFR+) and first-order methods. However, our representation can be exponentially smaller, and can be viewed as a lossless abstraction of theirs into a directed acyclic graph. In particular, like the LP-based algorithm of Zhang & Sandholm (2022), the size of our representation scales with the amount of information uncommon to the team; in fact, using linear programming on top of our team belief DAG form to solve for a team correlated equilibrium in an adversarial team games recovers almost exactly their algorithm. Unlike that paper, however, our representation explicitly exposes the structure of the decision space, which is what enables the aforementioned game-theoretic techniques. ",

    "abstract": "Mining the latent intentions from large volumes of natural language inputs is a key step to help data analysts design and refine Intelligent Virtual Assistants (IVAs) for customer service. To aid data analysts in this task we present Verint Intent Manager (VIM), an analysis platform that combines unsupervised and semi-supervised approaches to help analysts quickly surface and organize relevant user intentions from conversational texts. For the initial exploration of data we make use of a novel unsupervised and semi-supervised pipeline that integrates the fine-tuning of high performing language models, a distributed k-NN graph building method and community detection techniques for mining the intentions and topics from texts. The fine-tuning step is necessary because pre-trained language models cannot encode texts to efficiently surface particular clustering structures when the target texts are from an unseen domain or the clustering task is not topic detection. For flexibility we deploy two clustering approaches: where the number of clusters must be specified and where the number of clusters is detected automatically with comparable clustering quality but at the expense of additional computation time. We describe the application and deployment and demonstrate its performance using BERT on three text mining tasks. Our experiments show that BERT begins to produce better task-aware representations using a labeled subset as small as 0.5% of the task data. The clustering quality exceeds the state-of-the-art results when BERT is fine-tuned with labeled subsets of only 2.5% of the task data. As deployed in the VIM application, this flexible clustering pipeline produces high quality results, improving the performance of data analysts and reducing the time it takes to surface intentions from customer service data, thereby reducing the time it takes to build and deploy IVAs in new domains.

    "abstract": "One of the main shortcomings of event data in football, which has been extensively used for analytics in the recent years, is that it still requires manual collection, thus limiting its availability to a reduced number of tournaments. In this work, we propose a computational framework to automatically extract football events using tracking data, namely the coordinates of all players and the ball. Our approach consists of two models: (1) the possession model evaluates which player was in possession of the ball at each time, as well as the distinct player configurations in the time intervals where the ball is not in play; (2) the event detection model relies on the changes in ball possession to determine in-game events, namely passes, shots, crosses, saves, receptions and interceptions, as well as set pieces. First, analyze the accuracy of tracking data for determining ball possession, as well as the accuracy of the time annotations for the manually collected events. Then, we benchmark the auto-detected events with a dataset of manually annotated events to show that in most categories the proposed method achieves $+90\\%$ detection rate. Lastly, we demonstrate how the contextual information offered by tracking data can be leveraged to increase the granularity of auto-detected events, and exhibit how the proposed framework may be used to conduct a myriad of data analyses in football.

On the other hand, the security of encryption scheme for the vision transformer has never evaluated. In this paper, jigsaw puzzle solver attacks are utilized to evaluate the security of encrypted images by regarding the divided patches as pieces of a jigsaw puzzle. In experiments, an image is resized and divided into patches to apply block scrambling-based image encryption, and then the security of encrypted images for the vision transformer against jigsaw puzzle solver attacks is evaluated.

Besides the approach like graph kernels, Gromov-Wasserstein (GW) distance recently draws big attention due to its flexibility to capture both topological and feature characteristics, as well as handling the permutation invariance. However, structured data are widely distributed for different data mining and machine learning applications. With privacy concerns, accessing the decentralized data is limited to either individual clients or different silos. To tackle these issues, we propose a privacy-preserving framework to analyze the GW discrepancy of node embedding learned locally from graph neural networks in a federated flavor, and then explicitly place local differential privacy (LDP) based on Multi-bit Encoder to protect sensitive information. Our experiments show that, with strong privacy protections guaranteed by the $\\varepsilon$-LDP algorithm, the proposed framework not only preserves privacy in graph learning but also presents a noised structural metric under GW distance, resulting in comparable and even better performance in classification and clustering tasks. Moreover, we reason the rationale behind the LDP-based GW distance analytically and empirically. ",

    "abstract": "Recent work suggests that representations learned by adversarially robust networks are more human perceptually-aligned than non-robust networks via image manipulations. Despite appearing closer to human visual perception, it is unclear if the constraints in robust DNN representations match biological constraints found in human vision. Human vision seems to rely on texture-based/summary statistic representations in the periphery, which have been shown to explain phenomena such as crowding and performance on visual search tasks. To understand how adversarially robust optimizations/representations compare to human vision, we performed a psychophysics experiment using a set of metameric discrimination tasks where we evaluated how well human observers could distinguish between images synthesized to match adversarially robust representations compared to non-robust representations and a texture synthesis model of peripheral vision (Texforms). We found that the discriminability of robust representation and texture model images decreased to near chance performance as stimuli were presented farther in the periphery. Moreover, performance on robust and texture-model images showed similar trends within participants, while performance on non-robust representations changed minimally across the visual field. These results together suggest that (1) adversarially robust representations capture peripheral computation better than non-robust representations and (2) robust representations capture peripheral computation similar to current state-of-the-art texture peripheral vision models. More broadly, our findings support the idea that localized texture summary statistic representations may drive human invariance to adversarial perturbations and that the incorporation of such representations in DNNs could give rise to useful properties like adversarial robustness.

Our results show that adding linear layers to a ReLU network yields a representation cost that reflects a complex interplay between the alignment and sparsity of ReLU units. Specifically, using a neural network to fit training data with minimum representation cost yields an interpolating function that is constant in directions perpendicular to a low-dimensional subspace on which a parsimonious interpolant exists.

    "abstract": "Non-maximum suppression (NMS) is widely used in object detection pipelines for removing duplicated bounding boxes. The inconsistency between the confidence for NMS and the real localization confidence seriously affects detection performance. Prior works propose to predict Intersection-over-Union (IoU) between bounding boxes and corresponding ground-truths to improve NMS, while accurately predicting IoU is still a challenging problem. We argue that the complex definition of IoU and feature misalignment make it difficult to predict IoU accurately. In this paper, we propose a novel Decoupled IoU Regression (DIR) model to handle these problems. The proposed DIR decouples the traditional localization confidence metric IoU into two new metrics, Purity and Integrity. Purity reflects the proportion of the object area in the detected bounding box, and Integrity refers to the completeness of the detected object area. Separately predicting Purity and Integrity can divide the complex mapping between the bounding box and its IoU into two clearer mappings and model them independently. In addition, a simple but effective feature realignment approach is also introduced to make the IoU regressor work in a hindsight manner, which can make the target mapping more stable. The proposed DIR can be conveniently integrated with existing two-stage detectors and significantly improve their performance. Through a simple implementation of DIR with HTC, we obtain 51.3% AP on MS COCO benchmark, which outperforms previous methods and achieves state-of-the-art. ",

Recently, the transformer model with self-attention mechanisms has been adopted in this field.

To combat these problems, we introduce HTS-AT: an audio transformer with a hierarchical structure to reduce the model size and training time. It is further combined with a token-semantic module to map final outputs into class featuremaps, thus enabling the model for the audio event detection (i.e. localization in time). We evaluate HTS-AT on three datasets of audio classification where it achieves new state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on AudioSet and ESC-50, and equals the SOTA on Speech Command V2. It also achieves better performance in event localization than the previous CNN-based models. Moreover, HTS-AT requires only 35% model parameters and 15% training time of the previous audio transformer. These results demonstrate the high performance and high efficiency of HTS-AT. ",

This form of cyberbullying is an unpleasant and sometimes dangerous phenomenon for online social networks. Although prior work exists on automated identification of other types of cyberbullying, a need exists for methods capable of detecting doxing on Twitter specifically. We propose and evaluate a set of approaches for automatically detecting second- and third-party disclosures on Twitter of sensitive private information, a subset of which constitutes doxing. We summarize our findings of common intentions behind doxing episodes and compare nine different approaches for automated detection based on string-matching and one-hot encoded heuristics, as well as word and contextualized string embedding representations of tweets. We identify an approach providing 96.86% accuracy and 97.37% recall using contextualized string embeddings and conclude by discussing the practicality of our proposed methods. ",

    "abstract": "Building autonomous vehicles (AVs) is a complex problem, but enabling them to operate in the real world where they will be surrounded by human-driven vehicles (HVs) is extremely challenging. Prior works have shown the possibilities of creating inter-agent cooperation between a group of AVs that follow a social utility. Such altruistic AVs can form alliances and affect the behavior of HVs to achieve socially desirable outcomes. We identify two major challenges in the co-existence of AVs and HVs. First, social preferences and individual traits of a given human driver, e.g., selflessness and aggressiveness are unknown to an AV, and it is almost impossible to infer them in real-time during a short AV-HV interaction. Second, contrary to AVs that are expected to follow a policy, HVs do not necessarily follow a stationary policy and therefore are extremely hard to predict. To alleviate the above-mentioned challenges, we formulate the mixed-autonomy problem as a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) problem and propose a decentralized framework and reward function for training cooperative AVs. Our approach enables AVs to learn the decision-making of HVs implicitly from experience, optimizes for a social utility while prioritizing safety and allowing adaptability; robustifying altruistic AVs to different human behaviors and constraining them to a safe action space. Finally, we investigate the robustness, safety and sensitivity of AVs to various HVs behavioral traits and present the settings in which the AVs can learn cooperative policies that are adaptable to different situations.

For this purpose, we demonstrate using the Grad-CAM heatmap, that in various correctly classified examples, that the forged region is indeed the region contributing to the classification.

However, up until now, choosing which source tasks to include in the multi-task learning has been more art than science. In this paper, we give the first formal study on resource task sampling by leveraging the techniques from active learning. We propose an algorithm that iteratively estimates the relevance of each source task to the target task and samples from each source task based on the estimated relevance. Theoretically, we show that for the linear representation class, to achieve the same error rate, our algorithm can save up to a \\textit{number of source tasks} factor in the source task sample complexity, compared with the naive uniform sampling from all source tasks. We also provide experiments on real-world computer vision datasets to illustrate the effectiveness of our proposed method on both linear and convolutional neural network representation classes.

In this work we address a problem of active fault detection in an IoT scenario, whereby a monitor can probe a remote device in order to acquire fresh information and facilitate fault detection. However, probing could have a significant impact on the system's energy and communication resources. To this end, we utilize Age of Information as a measure of the freshness of information at the monitor and adopt a semantics-aware communication approach between the monitor and the remote device. In semantics-aware communications, the processes of generating and transmitting information are treated jointly to consider the importance of information and the purpose of communication. We formulate the problem as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process and show analytically that the optimal policy is of a threshold type. Finally, we use a computationally efficient stochastic approximation algorithm to approximate the optimal policy and present numerical results that exhibit the advantage of our approach compared to a conventional delay-based probing policy.

It is currently still unclear to which extent one can improve community detection with GAE and VGAE, especially in the absence of node features. It is moreover uncertain whether one could do so while simultaneously preserving good performances on link prediction. In this paper, we show that jointly addressing these two tasks with high accuracy is possible. For this purpose, we introduce and theoretically study a community-preserving message passing scheme, doping our GAE and VGAE encoders by considering both the initial graph structure and modularity-based prior communities when computing embedding spaces. We also propose novel training and optimization strategies, including the introduction of a modularity-inspired regularizer complementing the existing reconstruction losses for joint link prediction and community detection.

This has led to the development of a number of knowledge integration (KI) methods which aim to incorporate external knowledge into pretrained LMs. Even though KI methods show some performance gains over vanilla LMs, the inner-workings of these methods are not well-understood. For instance, it is unclear how and what kind of knowledge is effectively integrated into these models and if such integration may lead to catastrophic forgetting of already learned knowledge. This paper revisits the KI process in these models with an information-theoretic view and shows that KI can be interpreted using a graph convolution operation. We propose a probe model called \\textit{Graph Convolution Simulator} (GCS) for interpreting knowledge-enhanced LMs and exposing what kind of knowledge is integrated into these models. We conduct experiments to verify that our GCS can indeed be used to correctly interpret the KI process, and we use it to analyze two well-known knowledge-enhanced LMs: ERNIE and K-Adapter, and find that only a small amount of factual knowledge is integrated in them. We stratify knowledge in terms of various relation types and find that ERNIE and K-Adapter integrate different kinds of knowledge to different extent. Our analysis also shows that simply increasing the size of the KI corpus may not lead to better KI; fundamental advances may be needed. ",

However, the use of adaptivity not only comes at the cost of extra memory but also raises the fundamental question: can non-adaptive methods like SGD enjoy similar benefits? In this paper, we provide an affirmative answer to this question by proposing to achieve both robust and memory-efficient training via the following general recipe: (1) modify the architecture and make it scale invariant, i.e. the scale of parameter doesn't affect the output of the network, (2) train with SGD and weight decay, and optionally (3) clip the global gradient norm proportional to weight norm multiplied by $\\sqrt{\\tfrac{2\\lambda}{\\eta}}$, where $\\eta$ is learning rate and $\\lambda$ is weight decay. We show that this general approach is robust to rescaling of parameter and loss by proving that its convergence only depends logarithmically on the scale of initialization and loss, whereas the standard SGD might not even converge for many initializations. Following our recipe, we design a scale invariant version of BERT, called SIBERT, which when trained simply by vanilla SGD achieves performance comparable to BERT trained by adaptive methods like Adam on downstream tasks.

However, developers do not have the expertise and the knowledge required to embed the legal and social requirements for data protection into software systems. Objective: We present an approach to decrease privacy risks during agile software development by automatically detecting privacy-related information in the context of user story requirements, a prominent notation in agile Requirement Engineering (RE). Methods: The proposed approach combines Natural Language Processing (NLP) and linguistic resources with deep learning algorithms to identify privacy aspects into User Stories. NLP technologies are used to extract information regarding the semantic and syntactic structure of the text. This information is then processed by a pre-trained convolutional neural network, which paved the way for the implementation of a Transfer Learning technique. We evaluate the proposed approach by performing an empirical study with a dataset of 1680 user stories. Results: The experimental results show that deep learning algorithms allow to obtain better predictions than those achieved with conventional (shallow) machine learning methods. Moreover, the application of Transfer Learning allows to considerably improve the accuracy of the predictions, ca. 10%. Conclusions: Our study contributes to encourage software engineering researchers in considering the opportunities to automate privacy detection in the early phase of design, by also exploiting transfer learning models.

Furthermore, with the lack of a good evaluation protocol, resulting algorithms may fail to generalize, due to lack of diversity in training. To address these gaps, this paper facilitates a more comprehensive evaluation and objective comparison of crowd navigation algorithms by proposing a consistent set of metrics that accounts for both efficiency and social conformity, and a systematic protocol comprising multiple crowd navigation scenarios of varying complexity for evaluation. We tested four state-of-the-art algorithms under this protocol. Results revealed that some state-of-the-art algorithms have much challenge in generalizing, and using our protocol for training, we were able to improve the algorithm's performance. We demonstrate that the set of proposed metrics provides more insight and effectively differentiates the performance of these algorithms with respect to efficiency and social conformity. ",

By using both gradient maps and adversarial images as inputs, we propose a Two-stream Restoration Network (TRN) to restore the adversarial images. To optimally restore the perturbed images with two streams of inputs, a Gradient Map Estimation Mechanism is proposed to estimate the gradients of adversarial images, and a Fusion Block is designed in TRN to explore and fuse the information in two streams. Once trained, our TRN can defend against a wide range of attack methods without significantly degrading the performance of benign inputs.

    "abstract": "Many of the successes of machine learning are based on minimizing an averaged loss function. However, it is well-known that this paradigm suffers from robustness issues that hinder its applicability in safety-critical domains. These issues are often addressed by training against worst-case perturbations of data, a technique known as adversarial training. Although empirically effective, adversarial training can be overly conservative, leading to unfavorable trade-offs between nominal performance and robustness. To this end, in this paper we propose a framework called probabilistic robustness that bridges the gap between the accurate, yet brittle average case and the robust, yet conservative worst case by enforcing robustness to most rather than to all perturbations. From a theoretical point of view, this framework overcomes the trade-offs between the performance and the sample-complexity of worst-case and average-case learning. From a practical point of view, we propose a novel algorithm based on risk-aware optimization that effectively balances average- and worst-case performance at a considerably lower computational cost relative to adversarial training. Our results on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and SVHN illustrate the advantages of this framework on the spectrum from average- to worst-case robustness. ",

    "abstract": "In the quest for low power, bio-inspired computation both memristive and memcapacitive-based Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) have been the subjects of increasing focus for hardware implementation of neuromorphic computing. One step further, regenerative capacitive neural networks, which call for the use of adiabatic computing, offer a tantalising route towards even lower energy consumption, especially when combined with `memimpedace' elements. Here, we present an artificial neuron featuring adiabatic synapse capacitors to produce membrane potentials for the somas of neurons; the latter implemented via dynamic latched comparators augmented with Resistive Random-Access Memory (RRAM) devices. Our initial 4-bit adiabatic capacitive neuron proof-of-concept example shows 90% synaptic energy saving. At 4 synapses/soma we already witness an overall 35% energy reduction. Furthermore, the impact of process and temperature on the 4-bit adiabatic synapse shows a maximum energy variation of 30% at 100 degree Celsius across the corners without any functionality loss. Finally, the efficacy of our adiabatic approach to ANN is tested for 512 & 1024 synapse/neuron for worst and best case synapse loading conditions and variable equalising capacitance's quantifying the expected trade-off between equalisation capacitance and range of optimal power-clock frequencies vs. loading (i.e. the percentage of active synapses).

    "abstract": "Given the importance of privacy, many Internet protocols are nowadays designed with privacy in mind (e.g., using TLS for confidentiality). Foreseeing all privacy issues at the time of protocol design, however, is challenging and may become near impossible when interaction out of protocol bounds occurs. One demonstrably not well understood interaction occurs when DHCP exchanges are accompanied by automated changes to the global DNS, for example to dynamically add hostnames for allocated IP addresses. As we will substantiate in this paper, this is a privacy risk: the presence of specific clients and network dynamics may be learned from virtually anywhere on the Internet, even if other mechanisms to limit tracking by outsiders (e.g., blocking pings) are in place. We present a first of its kind study into this risk. We identify networks that expose client identifiers in reverse DNS records and study the relation between the presence of clients and said records. Our results show a strong link: in 9 out of 10 cases, records linger for at most an hour, for a selection of academic, enterprise and ISP networks alike. We also demonstrate how client patterns and network dynamics can be learned, by tracking devices owned by persons named Brian over time, revealing shifts in work patterns caused by COVID-19 related work-from-home measures, and by determining a good time to stage a heist.

    "abstract": "We study backdoor poisoning attacks against image classification networks, whereby an attacker inserts a trigger into a subset of the training data, in such a way that at test time, this trigger causes the classifier to predict some target class. %There are several techniques proposed in the literature that aim to detect the attack but only a few also propose to defend against it, and they typically involve retraining the network which is not always possible in practice. We propose lightweight automated detection and correction techniques against poisoning attacks, which are based on neuron patterns mined from the network using a small set of clean and poisoned test samples with known labels. The patterns built based on the mis-classified samples are used for run-time detection of new poisoned inputs. For correction, we propose an input correction technique that uses a differential analysis to identify the trigger in the detected poisoned images, which is then reset to a neutral color. Our detection and correction are performed at run-time and input level, which is in contrast to most existing work that is focused on offline model-level defenses. We demonstrate that our technique outperforms existing defenses such as NeuralCleanse and STRIP on popular benchmarks such as MNIST, CIFAR-10, and GTSRB against the popular BadNets attack and the more complex DFST attack.

    "abstract": "Recently, Wong et al. showed that adversarial training with single-step FGSM leads to a characteristic failure mode named catastrophic overfitting (CO), in which a model becomes suddenly vulnerable to multi-step attacks. They showed that adding a random perturbation prior to FGSM (RS-FGSM) seemed to be sufficient to prevent CO. However, Andriushchenko and Flammarion observed that RS-FGSM still leads to CO for larger perturbations, and proposed an expensive regularizer (GradAlign) to avoid CO. In this work, we methodically revisit the role of noise and clipping in single-step adversarial training. Contrary to previous intuitions, we find that using a stronger noise around the clean sample combined with not clipping is highly effective in avoiding CO for large perturbation radii. Based on these observations, we then propose Noise-FGSM (N-FGSM) that, while providing the benefits of single-step adversarial training, does not suffer from CO. Empirical analyses on a large suite of experiments show that N-FGSM is able to match or surpass the performance of previous single-step methods while achieving a 3$\\times$ speed-up. ",

Skin cancer occurs when errors (mutations) occur in the DNA of skin cells. The mutations cause the cells to grow out of control and form a mass of cancer cells. The aim of this study was to try to classify images of skin lesions with the help of convolutional neural networks. The deep neural networks show humongous potential for image classification while taking into account the large variability exhibited by the environment. Here we trained images based on the pixel values and classified them on the basis of disease labels. The dataset was acquired from an Open Source Kaggle Repository(Kaggle Dataset)which itself was acquired from ISIC(International Skin Imaging Collaboration) Archive. The training was performed on multiple models accompanied with Transfer Learning. The highest model accuracy achieved was over 86.65%. The dataset used is publicly available to ensure credibility and reproducibility of the aforementioned result. ",

We propose a novel Mutated Pathway VNN or MPVNN architecture, designed using prior signaling pathway knowledge and gene mutation data-based edge randomization simulating signal flow disruption. As a case study, we use the PI3K-Akt pathway and demonstrate overall improved cancer-specific survival risk prediction results of MPVNN over standard non-NN and other similar sized NN survival analysis methods. We show that trained MPVNN architecture interpretation, which points to smaller sets of genes connected by signal flow within the PI3K-Akt pathway that are important in risk prediction for particular cancer types, is reliable.

The design of optimal control policies is perplexed from a variety of social, political, economical and epidemiological factors. Here, based on epidemiological data reported in recent studies for the Italian region of Lombardy, which experienced one of the largest and most devastating outbreaks in Europe during the first wave of the pandemic, we address a probabilistic model predictive control (PMPC) approach for the modelling and the systematic study of what if scenarios of the social distancing in a retrospective analysis for the first wave of the pandemic in Lombardy. The performance of the proposed PMPC scheme was assessed based on simulations of a compartmental model that was developed to quantify the uncertainty in the level of the asymptomatic cases in the population, and the synergistic effect of social distancing in various activities, and public awareness campaign prompting people to adopt cautious behaviors to reduce the risk of disease transmission. The PMPC scheme takes into account the social mixing effect, i.e. the effect of the various activities in the potential transmission of the disease. The proposed approach demonstrates the utility of a PMPC approach in addressing COVID-19 transmission and implementing public relaxation policies. ",

Existing methods typically rely on frequency-domain representations to estimate the sung frequencies. However, this design does not lead to human-level performance in the perception of melody information for both tone (pitch-class) and octave. In this paper, we propose TONet, a plug-and-play model that improves both tone and octave perceptions by leveraging a novel input representation and a novel network architecture. First, we present an improved input representation, the Tone-CFP, that explicitly groups harmonics via a rearrangement of frequency-bins. Second, we introduce an encoder-decoder architecture that is designed to obtain a salience feature map, a tone feature map, and an octave feature map. Third, we propose a tone-octave fusion mechanism to improve the final salience feature map. Experiments are done to verify the capability of TONet with various baseline backbone models. Our results show that tone-octave fusion with Tone-CFP can significantly improve the singing voice extraction performance across various datasets -- with substantial gains in octave and tone accuracy.

Advances in Multidetector CT imaging technology have enabled additional functionalities, including generation of thin slice multiplanar cross-sectional body imaging and 3D reconstructions.

This paper proposes a Deep Learning model that learns to reconstruct CT projections from a few or even a single-view X-ray. This is based on a novel architecture that builds from neural radiance fields, which learns a continuous representation of CT scans by disentangling the shape and volumetric depth of surface and internal anatomical structures from 2D images. Our model is trained on chest and knee datasets, and we demonstrate qualitative and quantitative high-fidelity renderings and compare our approach to other recent radiance field-based methods.

Based on AlphaDesign, we propose a new method called ADesign to improve accuracy by introducing protein angles as new features, using a simplified graph transformer encoder (SGT), and proposing a confidence-aware protein decoder (CPD). Meanwhile, SGT and CPD also improve model efficiency by simplifying the training and testing procedures. Experiments show that ADesign significantly outperforms previous graph models, e.g., the average accuracy is improved by 8\\%, and the inference speed is 40+ times faster than before. ",

    "abstract": "Graph embeddings, wherein the nodes of the graph are represented by points in a continuous space, are used in a broad range of Graph ML applications. The quality of such embeddings crucially depends on whether the geometry of the space matches that of the graph. Euclidean spaces are often a poor choice for many types of real-world graphs, where hierarchical structure and a power-law degree distribution are linked to negative curvature. In this regard, it has recently been shown that hyperbolic spaces and more general manifolds, such as products of constant-curvature spaces and matrix manifolds, are advantageous to approximately match nodes pairwise distances. However, all these classes of manifolds are homogeneous, implying that the curvature distribution is the same at each point, making them unsuited to match the local curvature (and related structural properties) of the graph. In this paper, we study graph embeddings in a broader class of heterogeneous rotationally-symmetric manifolds. By adding a single extra radial dimension to any given existing homogeneous model, we can both account for heterogeneous curvature distributions on graphs and pairwise distances. We evaluate our approach on reconstruction tasks on synthetic and real datasets and show its potential in better preservation of high-order structures and heterogeneous random graphs generation. ",

However, machine learning model faces the cold-start problem where the model performance drops when predicting the interaction of a novel drug or target. Previous works try to solve the cold start problem by learning the drug or target representation using unsupervised learning. While the drug or target representation can be learned in an unsupervised manner, it still lacks the interaction information, which is critical in drug-target interaction. Results: To incorporate the interaction information into the drug and protein interaction, we proposed using transfer learning from chemical-chemical interaction (CCI) and protein-protein interaction (PPI) task to drug-target interaction task. The representation learned by CCI and PPI tasks can be transferred smoothly to the DTA task due to the similar nature of the tasks. The result on the drug-target affinity datasets shows that our proposed method has advantages compared to other pretraining methods in the DTA task. ",
