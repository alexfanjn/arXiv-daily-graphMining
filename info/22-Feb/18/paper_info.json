    "abstract": "Inspired by the great success of unsupervised learning in Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing, the Reinforcement Learning community has recently started to focus more on unsupervised discovery of skills. Most current approaches, like DIAYN or DADS, optimize some form of mutual information objective. We propose a different approach that uses reward functions encoded by neural networks. These are trained iteratively to reward more complex behavior. In high-dimensional robotic environments our approach learns a wide range of interesting skills including front-flips for Half-Cheetah and one-legged running for Humanoid. In the pixel-based Montezuma's Revenge environment our method also works with minimal changes and it learns complex skills that involve interacting with items and visiting diverse locations. A web version of this paper which shows animations for the different skills is available in https://as.inf.ethz.ch/research/open_ended_RL/main.html ",

    "abstract": "The spread of an epidemic is often modeled by an SIR random process on a social network graph. The MinINF problem for optimal social distancing involves minimizing the expected number of infections, when we are allowed to break at most $B$ edges; similarly the MinINFNode problem involves removing at most $B$ vertices. These are fundamental problems in epidemiology and network science. While a number of heuristics have been considered, the complexity of these problems remains generally open. In this paper, we present two bicriteria approximation algorithms for MinINF, which give the first non-trivial approximations for this problem. The first is based on the cut sparsification result of Karger \\cite{karger:mathor99}, and works when the transmission probabilities are not too small. The second is a Sample Average Approximation (SAA) based algorithm, which we analyze for the Chung-Lu random graph model. We also extend some of our results to tackle the MinINFNode problem. ",

    "abstract": "Differential privacy (DP) has been the de-facto standard to preserve privacy-sensitive information in database. Nevertheless, there lacks a clear and convincing contextualization of DP in image database, where individual images' indistinguishable contribution to a certain analysis can be achieved and observed when DP is exerted. As a result, the privacy-accuracy trade-off due to integrating DP is insufficiently demonstrated in the context of differentially-private image database. This work aims at contextualizing DP in image database by an explicit and intuitive demonstration of integrating conceptional differential privacy with images. To this end, we design a lightweight approach dedicating to privatizing image database as a whole and preserving the statistical semantics of the image database to an adjustable level, while making individual images' contribution to such statistics indistinguishable. The designed approach leverages principle component analysis (PCA) to reduce the raw image with large amount of attributes to a lower dimensional space whereby DP is performed, so as to decrease the DP load of calculating sensitivity attribute-by-attribute. The DP-exerted image data, which is not visible in its privatized format, is visualized through PCA inverse such that both a human and machine inspector can evaluate the privatization and quantify the privacy-accuracy trade-off in an analysis on the privatized image database. Using the devised approach, we demonstrate the contextualization of DP in images by two use cases based on deep learning models, where we show the indistinguishability of individual images induced by DP and the privatized images' retention of statistical semantics in deep learning tasks, which is elaborated by quantitative analyses on the privacy-accuracy trade-off under different privatization settings.

    "abstract": "The plethora of algorithms in the research field of process mining builds on directly-follows relations. Even though various improvements have been made in the last decade, there are serious weaknesses of these relationships. Once events associated with different objects that relate with a cardinality of 1:N and N:M to each other, techniques based on directly-follows relations produce spurious relations, self-loops, and back-jumps. This is due to the fact that event sequence as described in classical event logs differs from event causation. In this paper, we address the research problem of representing the causal structure of process-related event data. To this end, we develop a new approach called Causal Process Mining. This approach renounces the use of flat event logs and considers relational databases of event data as an input. More specifically, we transform the relational data structures based on the Causal Process Template into what we call Causal Event Graph. We evaluate our approach and compare its outputs with techniques based on directly-follows relations in a case study with an European food production company. Our results demonstrate that directly-follows miners produce a large number of spurious relationships, which our approach captures correctly. ",

Currently, most methods are based on contrastive learning adapted from the image domain, which requires view generation and a sufficient number of negative samples. In contrast, existing predictive models do not require negative sampling, but lack theoretical guidance on the design of pretext training tasks. In this work, we propose the LaGraph, a theoretically grounded predictive SSL framework based on latent graph prediction. Learning objectives of LaGraph are derived as self-supervised upper bounds to objectives for predicting unobserved latent graphs. In addition to its improved performance, LaGraph provides explanations for recent successes of predictive models that include invariance-based objectives. We provide theoretical analysis comparing LaGraph to related methods in different domains. Our experimental results demonstrate the superiority of LaGraph in performance and the robustness to decreasing of training sample size on both graph-level and node-level tasks. ",

Due to their broad applications, there is an increasing need to develop tools to explain how GNNs make decisions given graph structured data. Existing learning-based GNN explanation approaches are task-specific in training and hence suffer from crucial drawbacks. Specifically, they are incapable of producing explanations for a multitask prediction model with a single explainer. They are also unable to provide explanations in cases where the GNN is trained in a self-supervised manner, and the resulting representations are used in future downstream tasks. To address these limitations, we propose a Task-Agnostic GNN Explainer (TAGE) trained under self-supervision with no knowledge of downstream tasks. TAGE enables the explanation of GNN embedding models without downstream tasks and allows efficient explanation of multitask models. Our extensive experiments show that TAGE can significantly speed up the explanation efficiency by using the same model to explain predictions for multiple downstream tasks while achieving explanation quality as good as or even better than current state-of-the-art GNN explanation approaches.

These fields are commonly represented as neural networks which map latent descriptors and 3D coordinates to implicit function values. The latent descriptor of a neural field acts as a deformation handle for the 3D shape it represents. Thus, smoothness with respect to this descriptor is paramount for performing shape-editing operations. In this work, we introduce a novel regularization designed to encourage smooth latent spaces in neural fields by penalizing the upper bound on the field's Lipschitz constant. Compared with prior Lipschitz regularized networks, ours is computationally fast, can be implemented in four lines of code, and requires minimal hyperparameter tuning for geometric applications. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on shape interpolation and extrapolation as well as partial shape reconstruction from 3D point clouds, showing both qualitative and quantitative improvements over existing state-of-the-art and non-regularized baselines.

Applied to ImageNet, this leads to object centric features that perform on par with supervised features on most object-centric downstream tasks. In this work, we question if using this ability, we can learn any salient and more representative information present in diverse unbounded set of images from across the globe. To do so, we train models on billions of random images without any data pre-processing or prior assumptions about what we want the model to learn. We scale our model size to dense 10 billion parameters to avoid underfitting on a large data size. We extensively study and validate our model performance on over 50 benchmarks including fairness, robustness to distribution shift, geographical diversity, fine grained recognition, image copy detection and many image classification datasets. The resulting model, not only captures well semantic information, it also captures information about artistic style and learns salient information such as geolocations and multilingual word embeddings based on visual content only. More importantly, we discover that such model is more robust, more fair, less harmful and less biased than supervised models or models trained on object centric datasets such as ImageNet. ",

In this paper, we model the interactions among organizations in cross-silo FL as a public goods game for the first time and theoretically prove that there exists a social dilemma where the maximum social welfare is not achieved in Nash equilibrium. To overcome this social dilemma, we employ the Multi-player Multi-action Zero-Determinant (MMZD) strategy to maximize the social welfare. With the help of the MMZD, an individual organization can unilaterally control the social welfare without extra cost. Since the MMZD strategy can be adopted by all organizations, we further study the scenario where multiple organizations jointly adopt the MMZD strategy and form an MMZD Alliance (MMZDA). We prove theoretically that the MMZDA strategy strengthens the control of the maximum social welfare. Experimental results validate that the MMZD strategy is effective in maximizing the social welfare and the MMZDA can achieve a larger maximum value. ",

In the past, economists have estimated relevant quantities by fitting predictive models to small surveys, but in recent years large datasets of online resumes have also become available. These new datasets provide job sequences of many more individuals, but they are too large and complex for standard econometric modeling. To this end, we adapt ideas from modern language modeling to the analysis of large-scale job sequence data. We develop CAREER, a transformer-based model that learns a low-dimensional representation of an individual's job history. This representation can be used to predict jobs directly on a large dataset, or can be \"transferred\" to represent jobs in smaller and better-curated datasets. We fit the model to a large dataset of resumes, 24 million people who are involved in more than a thousand unique occupations. It forms accurate predictions on held-out data, and it learns useful career representations that can be fine-tuned to make accurate predictions on common economics datasets. ",

    "abstract": "The recent work of Papyan, Han, & Donoho (2020) presented an intriguing \"Neural Collapse\" phenomenon, showing a structural property of interpolating classifiers in the late stage of training. This opened a rich area of exploration studying this phenomenon. Our motivation is to study the upper limits of this research program: How far will understanding Neural Collapse take us in understanding deep learning? First, we investigate its role in generalization. We refine the Neural Collapse conjecture into two separate conjectures: collapse on the train set (an optimization property) and collapse on the test distribution (a generalization property). We find that while Neural Collapse often occurs on the train set, it does not occur on the test set. We thus conclude that Neural Collapse is primarily an optimization phenomenon, with as-yet-unclear connections to generalization. Second, we investigate the role of Neural Collapse in feature learning. We show simple, realistic experiments where training longer leads to worse last-layer features, as measured by transfer-performance on a downstream task. This suggests that neural collapse is not always desirable for representation learning, as previously claimed. Finally, we give preliminary evidence of a \"cascading collapse\" phenomenon, wherein some form of Neural Collapse occurs not only for the last layer, but in earlier layers as well. We hope our work encourages the community to continue the rich line of Neural Collapse research, while also considering its inherent limitations. ",

    "abstract": "It is evidence that representation learning can improve model's performance over multiple downstream tasks in many real-world scenarios, such as image classification and recommender systems. Existing learning approaches rely on establishing the correlation (or its proxy) between features and the downstream task (labels), which typically results in a representation containing cause, effect and spurious correlated variables of the label. Its generalizability may deteriorate because of the unstability of the non-causal parts. In this paper, we propose to learn causal representation from observational data by regularizing the learning procedure with mutual information measures according to our hypothetical causal graph. The optimization involves a counterfactual loss, based on which we deduce a theoretical guarantee that the causality-inspired learning is with reduced sample complexity and better generalization ability. Extensive experiments show that the models trained on causal representations learned by our approach is robust under adversarial attacks and distribution shift. ",

To address the two challenges, we propose Graph Masked Autoencoders (GMAE), a self-supervised model for learning graph representations, where vanilla graph transformers are used as the encoder and the decoder. GMAE takes partially masked graphs as input, and reconstructs the features of the masked nodes. We adopt asymmetric encoder-decoder design, where the encoder is a deep graph transformer and the decoder is a shallow graph transformer. The masking mechanism and the asymmetric design make GMAE a memory-efficient model compared with conventional transformers. We show that, compared with training from scratch, the graph transformer pre-trained using GMAE can achieve much better performance after fine-tuning. We also show that, when serving as a conventional self-supervised graph representation model and using an SVM model as the downstream graph classifier, GMAE achieves state-of-the-art performance on 5 of the 7 benchmark datasets.

Some of the state of the art approaches try to address the problem with adversarial agents, but these agents often require expert supervision to fine tune and prevent the adversary from becoming too challenging to the trainee agent. While other approaches involve automatically adjusting environment setups during training, they have been limited to simple environments where low-dimensional encodings can be used. Inspired by these approaches, we propose genetic curriculum, an algorithm that automatically identifies scenarios in which the agent currently fails and generates an associated curriculum to help the agent learn to solve the scenarios and acquire more robust behaviors. As a non-parametric optimizer, our approach uses a raw, non-fixed encoding of scenarios, reducing the need for expert supervision and allowing our algorithm to adapt to the changing performance of the agent. Our empirical studies show improvement in robustness over the existing state of the art algorithms, providing training curricula that result in agents being 2 - 8x times less likely to fail without sacrificing cumulative reward. We include an ablation study and share insights on why our algorithm outperforms prior approaches. ",

The non-ideality of weight mapping can be compensated by iterative programming with a write-verify scheme, i.e., reading the conductance and rewriting if necessary. In all existing works, such a practice is applied to every single weight of a DNN as it is being mapped, which requires extensive programming time. In this work, we show that it is only necessary to select a small portion of the weights for write-verify to maintain the DNN accuracy, thus achieving significant speedup. We further introduce a second derivative based technique SWIM, which only requires a single pass of forward and backpropagation, to efficiently select the weights that need write-verify. Experimental results on various DNN architectures for different datasets show that SWIM can achieve up to 10x programming speedup compared with conventional full-blown write-verify while attaining a comparable accuracy.

    "abstract": "Multivariate time series forecasting has long received significant attention in real-world applications, such as energy consumption and traffic prediction. While recent methods demonstrate good forecasting abilities, they suffer from three fundamental limitations. (i) Discrete neural architectures: Interlacing individually parameterized spatial and temporal blocks to encode rich underlying patterns leads to discontinuous latent state trajectories and higher forecasting numerical errors. (ii) High complexity: Discrete approaches complicate models with dedicated designs and redundant parameters, leading to higher computational and memory overheads. (iii) Reliance on graph priors: Relying on predefined static graph structures limits their effectiveness and practicability in real-world applications. In this paper, we address all the above limitations by proposing a continuous model to forecast Multivariate Time series with dynamic Graph neural Ordinary Differential Equations (MTGODE). Specifically, we first abstract multivariate time series into dynamic graphs with time-evolving node features and unknown graph structures. Then, we design and solve a neural ODE to complement missing graph topologies and unify both spatial and temporal message passing, allowing deeper graph propagation and fine-grained temporal information aggregation to characterize stable and precise latent spatial-temporal dynamics. Our experiments demonstrate the superiorities of MTGODE from various perspectives on five time series benchmark datasets. ",

    "abstract": "We present Neural Marionette, an unsupervised approach that discovers the skeletal structure from a dynamic sequence and learns to generate diverse motions that are consistent with the observed motion dynamics. Given a video stream of point cloud observation of an articulated body under arbitrary motion, our approach discovers the unknown low-dimensional skeletal relationship that can effectively represent the movement. Then the discovered structure is utilized to encode the motion priors of dynamic sequences in a latent structure, which can be decoded to the relative joint rotations to represent the full skeletal motion. Our approach works without any prior knowledge of the underlying motion or skeletal structure, and we demonstrate that the discovered structure is even comparable to the hand-labeled ground truth skeleton in representing a 4D sequence of motion. The skeletal structure embeds the general semantics of possible motion space that can generate motions for diverse scenarios. We verify that the learned motion prior is generalizable to the multi-modal sequence generation, interpolation of two poses, and motion retargeting to a different skeletal structure. ",

The LF track focuses on dealing with bona fide and fully fake utterances with various real-world noises etc. The PF track aims to distinguish the partially fake audio from the real. The FG track is a rivalry game, which includes two tasks: an audio generation task and an audio fake detection task. In this paper, we describe the datasets, evaluation metrics, and protocols.

    "abstract": "Printed Circuit Board (PCB) assurance in the optical domain is a crucial field of study. Though there are many existing PCB assurance methods using image processing, computer vision (CV), and machine learning (ML), the PCB field is complex and increasingly evolving so new techniques are required to overcome the emerging problems. Existing ML-based methods outperform traditional CV methods, however they often require more data, have low explainability, and can be difficult to adapt when a new technology arises. To overcome these challenges, CV methods can be used in tandem with ML methods. In particular, human-interpretable CV algorithms such as those that extract color, shape, and texture features increase PCB assurance explainability. This allows for incorporation of prior knowledge, which effectively reduce the number of trainable ML parameters and thus, the amount of data needed to achieve high accuracy when training or retraining an ML model. Hence, this study explores the benefits and limitations of a variety of common computer vision-based features for the task of PCB component detection using semantic data. Results of this study indicate that color features demonstrate promising performance for PCB component detection. The purpose of this paper is to facilitate collaboration between the hardware assurance, computer vision, and machine learning communities. ",

    "abstract": "The selfish mining attack, arguably the most famous game-theoretic attack in blockchain, indicates that the Bitcoin protocol is not incentive-compatible. Most subsequent works mainly focus on strengthening the selfish mining strategy, thus enabling a single strategic agent more likely to deviate. In sharp contrast, little attention has been paid to the resistant behavior against the selfish mining attack, let alone further equilibrium analysis for miners and mining pools in the blockchain as a multi-agent system. In this paper, first, we propose a strategy called insightful mining to counteract selfish mining. By infiltrating an undercover miner into the selfish pool, the insightful pool could acquire the number of its hidden blocks. We prove that, with this extra insight, the utility of the insightful pool could be strictly greater than the selfish pool's when they have the same mining power. Then we investigate the mining game where all pools can either choose to be honest or take the insightful mining strategy. We characterize the Nash equilibrium of this mining game, and derive three corollaries: (a) each mining game has a pure Nash equilibrium; (b) honest mining is a Nash equilibrium if the largest mining pool has a fraction of mining power no more than 1/3; (c) there are at most two insightful pools under equilibrium no matter how the mining power is distributed.

In general, the contrastive learning process in GCL is performed on top of the representations learned by a graph neural network (GNN) backbone, which transforms and propagates the node contextual information based on its local neighborhoods. However, existing GCL efforts have severe limitations in terms of both encoding architecture, augmentation, and contrastive objective, making them commonly inefficient and ineffective to use in different datasets. In this work, we go beyond the existing unsupervised GCL counterparts and address their limitations by proposing a simple yet effective framework S$^3$-CL. Specifically, by virtue of the proposed structural and semantic contrastive learning, even a simple neural network is able to learn expressive node representations that preserve valuable structural and semantic patterns. Our experiments demonstrate that the node representations learned by S$^3$-CL achieve superior performance on different downstream tasks compared to the state-of-the-art GCL methods. ",

Nonetheless, we do not have a firm understanding as to which perceptual aspects of memes cause this phenomenon.

We use two benchmark datasets comprising 12,140 and 10,567 images from 4chan's \"Politically Incorrect\" board (/pol/) and Facebook's Hateful Memes Challenge dataset to train the competition's top-ranking machine learning models for the discovery of the most prominent features that distinguish viral hateful memes from benign ones. We conduct three experiments to determine the importance of multimodality on classification performance, the influential capacity of fringe Web communities on mainstream social platforms and vice versa, and the models' learning transferability on 4chan memes. Our experiments show that memes' image characteristics provide a greater wealth of information than its textual content. We also find that current systems developed for online detection of hate speech in memes necessitate further concentration on its visual elements to improve their interpretation of underlying cultural connotations, implying that multimodal models fail to adequately grasp the intricacies of hate speech in memes and generalize across social media platforms.

    "abstract": "With the increasing use of IoT-enabled sensors, it is important to have effective methods for querying the sensors. For example, in a dense network of battery-driven temperature sensors, it is often possible to query (sample) just a subset of the sensors at any given time, since the values of the non-sampled sensors can be estimated from the sampled values. If we can divide the set of sensors into disjoint so-called representative sampling subsets that each represent the other sensors sufficiently well, we can alternate the sampling between the sampling subsets and thus, increase battery life significantly. In this paper, we formulate the problem of finding representative sampling subsets as a graph problem on a so-called sensor graph with the sensors as nodes. Our proposed solution, SubGraphSample, consists of two phases. In Phase-I, we create edges in the sensor graph based on the similarities between the time series of sensor values, analyzing six different techniques based on proven time series similarity metrics. In Phase-II, we propose two new techniques and extend four existing ones to find the maximal number of representative sampling subsets. Finally, we propose AutoSubGraphSample which auto-selects the best technique for Phase-I and Phase-II for a given dataset. Our extensive experimental evaluation shows that our approach can yield significant battery life improvements within realistic error bounds. ",

It is helpful to analyze and understand human activities in crowded spaces and widely applied in many areas such as surveillance video analysis and autonomous driving systems. Thanks to the success of deep learning, trajectory prediction has made significant progress. The current methods are dedicated to studying the agents' future trajectories under the social interaction and the sceneries' physical constraints. Moreover, how to deal with these factors still catches researchers' attention. However, they ignore the \\textbf{Semantic Shift Phenomenon} when modeling these interactions in various prediction sceneries.

In this paper, we propose a \\textbf{C}ontextual \\textbf{S}emantic \\textbf{C}onsistency \\textbf{Net}work (\\textbf{CSCNet}) to predict agents' future activities with powerful and efficient context constraints. We utilize a well-designed context-aware transfer to obtain the intermediate representations from the scene images and trajectories. Then we eliminate the differences between social and physical interactions by aligning activity semantics and scene semantics to cross the Gap.

Specifically, in order to use visual information, we first encode the detected lips to fixed-size vectors with MobileNet and concatenate them with acoustic features followed by the fusion network for WWS. However, the audio-visual model based on neural networks requires a large footprint and a high computational complexity. To meet the application requirements, we introduce a neural network pruning strategy via the lottery ticket hypothesis in an iterative fine-tuning manner (LTH-IF), to the single-modal and multi-modal models, respectively. Tested on our in-house corpus for audio-visual WWS in a home TV scene, the proposed audio-visual system achieves significant performance improvements over the single-modality (audio-only or video-only) system under different noisy conditions. Moreover, LTH-IF pruning can largely reduce the network parameters and computations with no degradation of WWS performance, leading to a potential product solution for the TV wake-up scenario. ",

Although multiple survey papers have reviewed SSL techniques, there is none that only focuses on those that use geometric transformations. Furthermore, such methods have not been covered in depth in papers where they are reviewed. Our motivation to present this work is that geometric transformations have shown to be powerful supervisory signals in unsupervised representation learning. Moreover, many such works have found tremendous success, but have not gained much attention. We present a concise survey of SSL approaches that use geometric transformations. We shortlist six representative models that use image transformations including those based on predicting and autoencoding transformations. We review their architecture as well as learning methodologies. We also compare the performance of these models in the object recognition task on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets. Our analysis indicates the AETv2 performs the best in most settings. Rotation with feature decoupling also performed well in some settings. We then derive insights from the observed results.

More specifically, we prove that every gradient attack can be reduced to data poisoning, in any personalized federated learning system with PAC guarantees (which we show are both desirable and realistic). This equivalence makes it possible to obtain new impossibility results on the resilience to data poisoning as corollaries of existing impossibility theorems on Byzantine machine learning.

Our key observation is that to recover the underlying structures as well as surface details given a partial input, a fundamental component is a good feature representation that can capture both global structure and local geometric details. Towards this end, we first propose FSNet, a feature structuring module that can adaptively aggregate point-wise features into a 2D structured feature map by learning multiple latent patterns from local regions. We then integrate FSNet into a coarse-to-fine pipeline for point cloud completion. Specifically, a 2D convolutional neural network is adopted to decode feature maps from FSNet into a coarse and complete point cloud. Next, a point cloud upsampling network is used to generate dense point cloud from the partial input and the coarse intermediate output. To efficiently exploit the local structures and enhance the point distribution uniformity, we propose IFNet, a point upsampling module with self-correction mechanism that can progressively refine details of the generated dense point cloud. We conduct both qualitative and quantitative experiments on ShapeNet, MVP, and KITTI datasets, which demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art point cloud completion approaches. ",

    "abstract": "Currently, most single image dehazing models cannot run an ultra-high-resolution (UHD) image with a single GPU shader in real-time. To address the problem, we introduce the principle of infinite approximation of Taylor's theorem with the Laplace pyramid pattern to build a model which is capable of handling 4K hazy images in real-time. The N branch networks of the pyramid network correspond to the N constraint terms in Taylor's theorem. Low-order polynomials reconstruct the low-frequency information of the image (e.g. color, illumination). High-order polynomials regress the high-frequency information of the image (e.g. texture). In addition, we propose a Tucker reconstruction-based regularization term that acts on each branch network of the pyramid model.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a novel and practical mechanism which enables the service provider to verify whether a suspect model is stolen from the victim model via model extraction attacks. Our key insight is that the profile of a DNN model's decision boundary can be uniquely characterized by its \\textit{Universal Adversarial Perturbations (UAPs)}. UAPs belong to a low-dimensional subspace and piracy models' subspaces are more consistent with victim model's subspace compared with non-piracy model. Based on this, we propose a UAP fingerprinting method for DNN models and train an encoder via \\textit{contrastive learning} that takes fingerprint as inputs, outputs a similarity score. Extensive studies show that our framework can detect model IP breaches with confidence $> 99.99 \\%$ within only $20$ fingerprints of the suspect model. It has good generalizability across different model architectures and is robust against post-modifications on stolen models. ",

Most existing FL schemes are incapability for the above scenarios. In this paper, we propose a communication-efficient FL scheme, CoFED, based on pseudo-labeling unlabeled data like co-training. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first FL scheme compatible with heterogeneous tasks, heterogeneous models, and heterogeneous training algorithms simultaneously.

    "abstract": "Deep neural networks (NN) perform well in various tasks (e.g., computer vision) because of the convolutional neural networks (CNN). However, the difficulty of gathering quality data in the industry field hinders the practical use of NN. To cope with this issue, the concept of transfer learning (TL) has emerged, which leverages the fine-tuning of NNs trained on large-scale datasets in data-scarce situations. Therefore, this paper suggests a two-stage architectural fine-tuning method for image classification, inspired by the concept of neural architecture search (NAS). One of the main ideas of our proposed method is a mutation with base architectures, which reduces the search cost by using given architectural information. Moreover, an early-stopping is also considered which directly reduces NAS costs. Experimental results verify that our proposed method reduces computational and searching costs by up to 28.2% and 22.3%, compared to existing methods. ",

    "abstract": "Recently over-smoothing phenomenon of Transformer-based models is observed in both vision and language fields. However, no existing work has delved deeper to further investigate the main cause of this phenomenon. In this work, we make the attempt to analyze the over-smoothing problem from the perspective of graph, where such problem was first discovered and explored. Intuitively, the self-attention matrix can be seen as a normalized adjacent matrix of a corresponding graph. Based on the above connection, we provide some theoretical analysis and find that layer normalization plays a key role in the over-smoothing issue of Transformer-based models. Specifically, if the standard deviation of layer normalization is sufficiently large, the output of Transformer stacks will converge to a specific low-rank subspace and result in over-smoothing. To alleviate the over-smoothing problem, we consider hierarchical fusion strategies, which combine the representations from different layers adaptively to make the output more diverse. Extensive experiment results on various data sets illustrate the effect of our fusion method. ",

First, the MIMO-GFM control couples the AC and DC loops by a general multivariable control transfer matrix. Then, the parameters design is transformed into a standard fixed-structure H-infinity synthesis. By this way, all the loops can be tuned simultaneously and optimally without relying on the assumptions of loop decoupling. Therefore, a superior and robust performance can be achieved.

    "abstract": "Many modern Internet applications, like content moderation and recommendation on social media, require reviewing and score a large number of alternatives. In such a context, the voting can only be sparse, as the number of alternatives is too large for any individual to review a significant fraction of all of them. Moreover, in critical applications, malicious players might seek to hack the voting process by entering dishonest reviews or creating fake accounts. Classical voting methods are unfit for this task, as they usually (a) require each reviewer to assess all available alternatives and (b) can be easily manipulated by malicious players. This paper defines precisely the problem of robust sparse voting, highlights its underlying technical challenges, and presents Mehestan, a novel voting mechanism that solves the problem. Namely, we prove that by using Mehestan, no (malicious) voter can have more than a small parametrizable effect on each alternative's score, and we identify conditions of voters comparability under which any unanimous preferences can be recovered, even when these preferences are expressed by voters on very different scales.

    "abstract": "It is currently known how to characterize functions that neural networks can learn with SGD for two extremal parameterizations: neural networks in the linear regime, and neural networks with no structural constraints. However, for the main parametrization of interest (non-linear but regular networks) no tight characterization has yet been achieved, despite significant developments. We take a step in this direction by considering depth-2 neural networks trained by SGD in the mean-field regime. We consider functions on binary inputs that depend on a latent low-dimensional subspace (i.e., small number of coordinates). This regime is of interest since it is poorly understood how neural networks routinely tackle high-dimensional datasets and adapt to latent low-dimensional structure without suffering from the curse of dimensionality. Accordingly, we study SGD-learnability with $O(d)$ sample complexity in a large ambient dimension $d$. Our main results characterize a hierarchical property, the \"merged-staircase property\", that is both necessary and nearly sufficient for learning in this setting. We further show that non-linear training is necessary: for this class of functions, linear methods on any feature map (e.g., the NTK) are not capable of learning efficiently. The key tools are a new \"dimension-free\" dynamics approximation result that applies to functions defined on a latent space of low-dimension, a proof of global convergence based on polynomial identity testing, and an improvement of lower bounds against linear methods for non-almost orthogonal functions.

    "abstract": "In the current practice of short-term power scheduling, online power reserves are used to address generation mismatches and contingencies. Neither online inertia nor the speed of the committed units is considered in the scheduling process. With the increasing injection of uncertain renewable energy sources, this practice is starting to fall short especially in island power systems, where the primary frequency response is already scarce, and any contingency leads to potentially poor frequency response. This paper introduces a data driven linear constraint to improve the post-fault frequency quality in island power systems. A coherent initial data-set is obtained by simulating the system frequency response of single outages. Then logistic regression is employed as a predictive analytic procedure to differentiate the acceptable and unacceptable incidents. To compare the conventional methods with the proposed approach and also to handle the uncertain nature of renewable energy generation, an adaptive robust unit commitment formulation is utilized. Results for the island power system of La Palma show that depending on the chosen cut-point on the logistic regression estimation the proposed method can improve the frequency response quality of the system while reducing the operation costs.

Our result is a bi-criteria fully polynomial time approximation algorithm based on a dynamic programming algorithm. It allows to find a solution within a factor of 1 + epsilon of the optimal makespan, where the memory capacity of the machines may be exceeded by a factor at most 1 + epsilon.

Knowledge graphs can provide comprehensive and semantic representation for heterogeneous data, and have been successfully leveraged in many biomedical applications including drug repurposing. Our objective is to construct a knowledge graph from literature to study relations between Alzheimer's disease (AD) and chemicals, drugs and dietary supplements in order to identify opportunities to prevent or delay neurodegenerative progression. We collected biomedical annotations and extracted their relations using SemRep via SemMedDB. We used both a BERT-based classifier and rule-based methods during data preprocessing to exclude noise while preserving most AD-related semantic triples. The 1,672,110 filtered triples were used to train with knowledge graph completion algorithms (i.e., TransE, DistMult, and ComplEx) to predict candidates that might be helpful for AD treatment or prevention. Among three knowledge graph completion models, TransE outperformed the other two (MR = 13.45, Hits@1 = 0.306). We leveraged the time-slicing technique to further evaluate the prediction results. We found supporting evidence for most highly ranked candidates predicted by our model which indicates that our approach can inform reliable new knowledge. This paper shows that our graph mining model can predict reliable new relationships between AD and other entities (i.e., dietary supplements, chemicals, and drugs). The knowledge graph constructed can facilitate data-driven knowledge discoveries and the generation of novel hypotheses. ",

We used an optimized anchor generation methods to get better anchor box shape and more boxes are used for detection as we believe this is necessary for small object detection. A alternative backbone is used to compensate the heavy time cost introduced by dense anchor box regression.

    "abstract": "Listing dense subgraphs in large graphs plays a key task in varieties of network analysis applications like community detection. Clique, as the densest model, has been widely investigated. However, in practice, communities rarely form as cliques for various reasons, e.g., data noise. Therefore, $k$-plex, -- graph with each vertex adjacent to all but at most $k$ vertices, is introduced as a relaxed version of clique. Often, to better simulate cohesive communities, an emphasis is placed on connected $k$-plexes with small $k$. In this paper, we continue the research line of listing all maximal $k$-plexes and maximal $k$-plexes of prescribed size. Our first contribution is algorithm \\emph{ListPlex} that lists all maximal $k$-plexes in $O^*(\\gamma^D)$ time for each constant $k$, where $\\gamma$ is a value related to $k$ but strictly smaller than 2, and $D$ is the degeneracy of the graph that is far less than the vertex number $n$ in real-word graphs. Compared to the trivial bound of $2^n$, the improvement is significant, and our bound is better than all previously known results. In practice, we further use several techniques to accelerate listing $k$-plexes of a given size, such as structural-based prune rules, cache-efficient data structures, and parallel techniques. All these together result in a very practical algorithm. Empirical results show that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art solutions by up to orders of magnitude. ",

The multi-color space fusion network takes the decomposed structure image as input and estimates the color corrected output by employing the feature representations from diverse color spaces of the input. The detail enhancement network addresses the blurriness of the original underwater image by improving the image details from high-frequency sub-bands.

We study a scenario where the rank of the true solution is unknown and over-estimated instead. The over-estimation of the rank gives rise to an over-parameterized model in which there are more degrees of freedom than needed. Such over-parameterization may lead to overfitting, or adversely affect the performance of the algorithm. We prove that a simple SubGM with small initialization is agnostic to both over-parameterization and noise in the measurements. In particular, we show that small initialization nullifies the effect of over-parameterization on the performance of SubGM, leading to an exponential improvement in its convergence rate. Moreover, we provide the first unifying framework for analyzing the behavior of SubGM under both outlier and Gaussian noise models, showing that SubGM converges to the true solution, even under arbitrarily large and arbitrarily dense noise values, and--perhaps surprisingly--even if the globally optimal solutions do not correspond to the ground truth. At the core of our results is a robust variant of restricted isometry property, called Sign-RIP, which controls the deviation of the sub-differential of the $\\ell_1$-loss from that of an ideal, expected loss. As a byproduct of our results, we consider a subclass of robust low-rank matrix recovery with Gaussian measurements, and show that the number of required samples to guarantee the global convergence of SubGM is independent of the over-parameterized rank.

We used social network analysis to evaluate whether contacts have the same S. aureus genotype, or whether contagiousness is an indirect effect of contacts sharing the same lifestyle or characteristics. The Fit Futures 1 study collected data on social contact among 1038 first level students in the same high school district in Norway. S. aureus persistent carriage was determined from two nasal swab cultures and genotype from spa-typing of a positive throat swab culture. Bootstrap, t-tests, logistic regression, and autocorrelation were used to evaluate social network influence on host risk factors and S. aureus carriage. Both persistent carriage and spa-type were transmitted in the social network (p<0.001). The probability of carriage increased by 3.7% and 5.0% for each additional S. aureus positive friend, in univariable regression and multivariable autocorrelation analysis respectively. Male sex was associated with a 15% lower risk of transmission compared to women, although the prevalence of carriage was higher for men (36% versus 24%). Medium physical activity, medium and high alcohol-use, and normal-weight students had higher number of contacts, and increased risk of transmission (p<0.002). We demonstrate direct social transmission of S. aureus in a general youth population. Lifestyle factors are associated with risk of transmission suggesting indirect social group effects from having more similar environmental exposures. The predominance in carriage is determined by sex-specific predisposing host characteristics as social transmission is less frequent than in females. Better understanding of how social interactions influence S. aureus carriage dynamics in the population is important for developing new preventive measures. ",

This has resulted in the sharp growth of violent events and deteriorating online discourse.

In this paper, we examine the social engagements between Reddit users who have participated in feminist discourse and the Manosphere communities on Reddit to understand the process of development of traits associated with the adoption of extremist ideologies. By using existing research on the psychology of radicalization we track how specific types of social engagement with the Manosphere influence the development of traits associated with radicalization. Our findings show that: (1) participation, even by the simple act of joining the Manosphere, has a significant influence on the language and outlook traits of a user, (2) Manosphere elites are extremely effective propagators of radical traits and cause their increase even outside the Manosphere, and (3) community perception can heavily influence a user's behavior. Finally, we examine how our findings can help draft community and platform moderation policies to help mitigate the problem of online radicalization. ",

In this paper, we thus propose a batch-dynamic algorithm for MPI-based parallel computing. Building on top of a distributed graph/matrix data structure that allows for fast updates, our dynamic SpGEMM reduces the communication volume significantly. It does so by exploiting that updates change far fewer matrix entries than there are non-zeros in the input operands. Our experiments with popular benchmark graphs show that our approach pays off. For batches of insertions or removals of matrix entries, our dynamic SpGEMM is substantially faster than the static state-of-the-art algorithm in CombBLAS 2.0 and in CTF. ",

    "title": "GRAPHSHAP: Motif-based Explanations for Black-box Graph Classifiers",
    "abstract": "Most methods for explaining black-box classifiers (e.g., on tabular data, images, or time series) rely on measuring the impact that the removal/perturbation of features has on the model output. This forces the explanation language to match the classifier features space. However, when dealing with graph data, in which the basic features correspond essentially to the adjacency information describing the graph structure (i.e., the edges), this matching between features space and explanation language might not be appropriate. In this regard, we argue that (i) a good explanation method for graph classification should be fully agnostic with respect to the internal representation used by the black-box; and (ii) a good explanation language for graph classification tasks should be represented by higher-order structures, such as motifs. The need to decouple the feature space (edges) from the explanation space (motifs) is thus a major challenge towards developing actionable explanations for graph classification tasks. In this paper we introduce GRAPHSHAP, a Shapley-based approach able to provide motif-based explanations for black-box graph classifiers, assuming no knowledge whatsoever about the model or its training data: the only requirement is that the black-box can be queried at will. Furthermore, we introduce additional auxiliary components such as a synthetic graph dataset generator, algorithms for subgraph mining and ranking, a custom graph convolutional layer, and a kernel to approximate the explanation scores while maintaining linear time complexity. Finally, we test GRAPHSHAP on a real-world brain-network dataset consisting of patients affected by Autism Spectrum Disorder and a control group. Our experiments highlight how the classification provided by a black-box model can be effectively explained by few connectomics patterns. ",

    "abstract": "Structural data well exists in Web applications, such as social networks in social media, citation networks in academic websites, and threads data in online forums. Due to the complex topology, it is difficult to process and make use of the rich information within such data. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown great advantages on learning representations for structural data. However, the non-transparency of the deep learning models makes it non-trivial to explain and interpret the predictions made by GNNs. Meanwhile, it is also a big challenge to evaluate the GNN explanations, since in many cases, the ground-truth explanations are unavailable. In this paper, we take insights of Counterfactual and Factual (CF^2) reasoning from causal inference theory, to solve both the learning and evaluation problems in explainable GNNs. For generating explanations, we propose a model-agnostic framework by formulating an optimization problem based on both of the two casual perspectives. This distinguishes CF^2 from previous explainable GNNs that only consider one of them. Another contribution of the work is the evaluation of GNN explanations. For quantitatively evaluating the generated explanations without the requirement of ground-truth, we design metrics based on Counterfactual and Factual reasoning to evaluate the necessity and sufficiency of the explanations. Experiments show that no matter ground-truth explanations are available or not, CF^2 generates better explanations than previous state-of-the-art methods on real-world datasets. Moreover, the statistic analysis justifies the correlation between the performance on ground-truth evaluation and our proposed metrics. ",

    "abstract": "Given a graph function, defined on an arbitrary set of edge weights and node features, does there exist a Graph Neural Network (GNN) whose output is identical to the graph function? In this paper, we fully answer this question and characterize the class of graph problems that can be represented by GNNs. We identify an algebraic condition, in terms of the permutation of edge weights and node features, which proves to be necessary and sufficient for a graph problem to lie within the reach of GNNs. Moreover, we show that this condition can be efficiently verified by checking quadratically many constraints. Note that our refined characterization on the expressive power of GNNs are orthogonal to those theoretical results showing equivalence between GNNs and Weisfeiler-Lehman graph isomorphism heuristic. For instance, our characterization implies that many natural graph problems, such as min-cut value, max-flow value, and max-clique size, can be represented by a GNN. In contrast, and rather surprisingly, there exist very simple graphs for which no GNN can correctly find the length of the shortest paths between all nodes. Note that finding shortest paths is one of the most classical problems in Dynamic Programming (DP). Thus, the aforementioned negative example highlights the misalignment between DP and GNN, even though (conceptually) they follow very similar iterative procedures. Finally, we support our theoretical results by experimental simulations. ",

    "abstract": "This paper describes the principle of \"General Cyclical Training\" in machine learning, where training starts and ends with \"easy training\" and the \"hard training\" happens during the middle epochs. We propose several manifestations for training neural networks, including algorithmic examples (via hyper-parameters and loss functions), data-based examples, and model-based examples. Specifically, we introduce several novel techniques: cyclical weight decay, cyclical batch size, cyclical focal loss, cyclical softmax temperature, cyclical data augmentation, cyclical gradient clipping, and cyclical semi-supervised learning. In addition, we demonstrate that cyclical weight decay, cyclical softmax temperature, and cyclical gradient clipping (as three examples of this principle) are beneficial in the test accuracy performance of a trained model. Furthermore, we discuss model-based examples (such as pretraining and knowledge distillation) from the perspective of general cyclical training and recommend some changes to the typical training methodology. In summary, this paper defines the general cyclical training concept and discusses several specific ways in which this concept can be applied to training neural networks.

In each round, a vertex $u$ is presented to the player independently and uniformly at random. The player then adaptively selects a vertex $v$, and adds the edge $uv$ to the graph. For a fixed monotone graph property, the objective of the player is to force the graph to satisfy this property with high probability in as few rounds as possible. We focus on the problem of constructing a perfect matching in as few rounds as possible. In particular, we present an adaptive strategy for the player which achieves a perfect matching in $\\beta n$ rounds, where the value of $\\beta < 1.206$ is derived from a solution to some system of differential equations. This improves upon the previously best known upper bound of $(1+2/e+o(1)) \\, n < 1.736 \\, n$ rounds. We also improve the previously best lower bound of $(\\ln 2 + o(1)) \\, n > 0.693 \\, n$ and show that the player cannot achieve the desired property in less than $\\alpha n$ rounds, where the value of $\\alpha > 0.932$ is derived from a solution to another system of differential equations. As a result, the gap between the upper and lower bounds is decreased roughly four times. ",

To address this, here we propose a novel self-supervised 3D CNN that enables phase aberration robust plane-wave imaging. Instead of aiming at estimating the SoS distribution as in conventional methods, our approach is unique in that the network is trained in a self-supervised manner to robustly generate a high-quality image from various phase aberrated images by modeling the variation in the speed of sound as stochastic. Experimental results using real measurements from tissue-mimicking phantom and \\textit{in vivo} scans confirmed that the proposed method can significantly reduce the phase aberration artifacts and improve the visual quality of deep scans.

CortexODE leverages neural ordinary different equations (ODEs) to deform an input surface into a target shape by learning a diffeomorphic flow. The trajectories of the points on the surface are modeled as ODEs, where the derivatives of their coordinates are parameterized via a learnable Lipschitz-continuous deformation network. This provides theoretical guarantees for the prevention of self-intersections. CortexODE can be integrated to an automatic learning-based pipeline, which reconstructs cortical surfaces efficiently in less than 6 seconds. The pipeline utilizes a 3D U-Net to predict a white matter segmentation from brain Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans, and further generates a signed distance function that represents an initial surface. Fast topology correction is introduced to guarantee homeomorphism to a sphere. Following the isosurface extraction step, two CortexODE models are trained to deform the initial surface to white matter and pial surfaces respectively. The proposed pipeline is evaluated on large-scale neuroimage datasets in various age groups including neonates (25-45 weeks), young adults (22-36 years) and elderly subjects (55-90 years). Our experiments demonstrate that the CortexODE-based pipeline can achieve less than 0.2mm average geometric error while being orders of magnitude faster compared to conventional processing pipelines.

Therefore, the proposed method can handle the interdependence among events upon classification, while the conventional AED methods with multiple binary classifiers with a linear layer and sigmoid function have placed an assumption of conditional independence. In the experiments with a real-recording dataset, the proposed method demonstrates its superior AED performance to a relative 14.80% improvement compared to a convolutional recurrent neural network baseline system with the multiple binary classifiers.

As these tasks have high entry barriers, we aim to lower the barriers by proposing an end-to-end music remastering system that transforms the mastering style of input audio to that of the target. The system is trained in a self-supervised manner, in which released pop songs were used for training. We also anticipated the model to generate realistic audio reflecting the reference's mastering style by applying a pre-trained encoder and a projection discriminator.

We show that the $p$-eikonal equation with $p=1$ is a provably robust distance-type function on a graph, and the $p\\to \\infty$ limit recovers shortest path distances. While the $p$-eikonal equation does not correspond to a shortest-path graph distance, we nonetheless show that the continuum limit of the $p$-eikonal equation on a random geometric graph recovers a geodesic density weighted distance in the continuum. We consider applications of the $p$-eikonal equation to data depth and semi-supervised learning, and use the continuum limit to prove asymptotic consistency results for both applications. Finally, we show the results of experiments with data depth and semi-supervised learning on real image datasets, including MNIST, FashionMNIST and CIFAR-10, which show that the $p$-eikonal equation offers significantly better results compared to shortest path distances.
