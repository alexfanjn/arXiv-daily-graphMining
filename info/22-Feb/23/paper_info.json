    "abstract": "While many quantum computing techniques for machine learning have been proposed, their performance on real-world datasets remains to be studied. In this paper, we explore how a variational quantum circuit could be integrated into a classical neural network for the problem of detecting pneumonia from chest radiographs. We substitute one layer of a classical convolutional neural network with a variational quantum circuit to create a hybrid neural network. We train both networks on an image dataset containing chest radiographs and benchmark their performance. To mitigate the influence of different sources of randomness in network training, we sample the results over multiple rounds. We show that the hybrid network outperforms the classical network on different performance measures, and that these improvements are statistically significant. Our work serves as an experimental demonstration of the potential of quantum computing to significantly improve neural network performance for real-world, non-trivial problems relevant to society and industry.

    "title": "A Novel Anomaly Detection Method for Multimodal WSN Data Flow via a  Dynamic Graph Neural Network",
    "abstract": "Anomaly detection is widely used to distinguish system anomalies by analyzing the temporal and spatial features of wireless sensor network (WSN) data streams; it is one of critical technique that ensures the reliability of WSNs. Currently, graph neural networks (GNNs) have become popular state-of-the-art methods for conducting anomaly detection on WSN data streams. However, the existing anomaly detection methods based on GNNs do not consider the temporal and spatial features of WSN data streams simultaneously, such as multi-node, multi-modal and multi-time features, seriously impacting their effectiveness. In this paper, a novel anomaly detection model is proposed for multimodal WSN data flows, where three GNNs are used to separately extract the temporal features of WSN data flows, the correlation features between different modes and the spatial features between sensor node positions. Specifically, first, the temporal features and modal correlation features extracted from each sensor node are fused into one vector representation, which is further aggregated with the spatial features, i.e., the spatial position relationships of the nodes; finally, the current time-series data of WSN nodes are predicted, and abnormal states are identified according to the fusion features. The simulation results obtained on a public dataset show that the proposed approach is able to significantly improve upon the existing methods in terms of its robustness, and its F1 score reaches 0.90, which is 14.2% higher than that of the graph convolution network (GCN) with long short-term memory (LSTM).

    "title": "A Novel Architecture Slimming Method for Network Pruning and Knowledge  Distillation",
    "abstract": "Network pruning and knowledge distillation are two widely-known model compression methods that efficiently reduce computation cost and model size. A common problem in both pruning and distillation is to determine compressed architecture, i.e., the exact number of filters per layer and layer configuration, in order to preserve most of the original model capacity. In spite of the great advances in existing works, the determination of an excellent architecture still requires human interference or tremendous experimentations. In this paper, we propose an architecture slimming method that automates the layer configuration process. We start from the perspective that the capacity of the over-parameterized model can be largely preserved by finding the minimum number of filters preserving the maximum parameter variance per layer, resulting in a thin architecture. We formulate the determination of compressed architecture as a one-step orthogonal linear transformation, and integrate principle component analysis (PCA), where the variances of filters in the first several projections are maximized. We demonstrate the rationality of our analysis and the effectiveness of the proposed method through extensive experiments. In particular, we show that under the same overall compression rate, the compressed architecture determined by our method shows significant performance gain over baselines after pruning and distillation. Surprisingly, we find that the resulting layer-wise compression rates correspond to the layer sensitivities found by existing works through tremendous experimentations. ",

As a hot research frontier driven by industrial needs, recent years have witnessed more and more novel learning models employed to improve advertising CTR prediction. Although extant research provides necessary details on algorithmic design for addressing a variety of specific problems in advertising CTR prediction, the methodological evolution and connections between modeling frameworks are precluded. However, to the best of our knowledge, there are few comprehensive surveys on this topic. We make a systematic literature review on state-of-the-art and latest CTR prediction research, with a special focus on modeling frameworks. Specifically, we give a classification of state-of-the-art CTR prediction models in the extant literature, within which basic modeling frameworks and their extensions, advantages and disadvantages, and performance assessment for CTR prediction are presented. Moreover, we summarize CTR prediction models with respect to the complexity and the order of feature interactions, and performance comparisons on various datasets. Furthermore, we identify current research trends, main challenges and potential future directions worthy of further explorations. This review is expected to provide fundamental knowledge and efficient entry points for IS and marketing scholars who want to engage in this area. ",

In such problems, one often needs to optimize an objective function subject to a set of constraints, including for instance constraints on the entropy of a policy or to restrict the possible set of actions or states accessible to an agent. Convergence guarantees for evolutionary strategies to optimize stochastic constrained problems are however lacking in the literature. In this work, we address this problem by designing a novel optimization algorithm with a sufficient decrease mechanism that ensures convergence and that is based only on estimates of the functions. We demonstrate the applicability of this algorithm on two types of experiments: i) a control task for maximizing rewards and ii) maximizing rewards subject to a non-relaxable set of constraints. ",

    "abstract": "We present a novel data-driven approach of learning traffic flow patterns of a transportation network given that many instances of origin to destination (OD) travel demand and link flows of the network are available. Instead of estimating traffic flow patterns assuming certain user behavior (e.g., user equilibrium or system optimal), here we explore the idea of learning those flow patterns directly from the data. To implement this idea, we have formulated the traffic-assignment problem as a data-driven learning problem and developed a neural network-based framework known as Graph Convolutional Neural Network (GCNN) to solve it. The proposed framework represents the transportation network and OD demand in an efficient way and utilizes the diffusion process of multiple OD demands from nodes to links. We validate the solutions of the model against analytical solutions generated from running static user equilibrium-based traffic assignments over Sioux Falls and East Massachusetts networks. The validation result shows that the implemented GCNN model can learn the flow patterns very well with less than 2% mean absolute difference between the actual and estimated link flows for both networks under varying congested conditions. When the training of the model is complete, it can instantly determine the traffic flows of a large-scale network. Hence this approach can overcome the challenges of deploying traffic assignment models over large-scale networks and open new directions of research in data-driven network modeling. ",

    "abstract": "Applying machine learning (ML) to sensitive domains requires privacy protection of the underlying training data through formal privacy frameworks, such as differential privacy (DP). Yet, usually, the privacy of the training data comes at the costs of the resulting ML models' utility. One reason for this is that DP uses one homogeneous privacy budget epsilon for all training data points, which has to align with the strictest privacy requirement encountered among all data holders. In practice, different data holders might have different privacy requirements and data points of data holders with lower requirements could potentially contribute more information to the training process of the ML models. To account for this possibility, we propose three novel methods that extend the DP framework Private Aggregation of Teacher Ensembles (PATE) to support training an ML model with different personalized privacy guarantees within the training data. We formally describe the methods, provide theoretical analyses of their privacy bounds, and experimentally evaluate their effect on the final model's utility at the example of the MNIST and Adult income datasets. Our experiments show that our personalized privacy methods yield higher accuracy models than the non-personalized baseline. Thereby, our methods can improve the privacy-utility trade-off in scenarios in which different data holders consent to contribute their sensitive data at different privacy levels. ",

In this work, we generalize the stochastic primal-dual hybrid gradient algorithm to develop semi-implicit hybrid gradient methods (SI-HGs) for finding stationary points of nonconvex-nonconcave minimax problems. SI-HGs have the convergence rate $O(1/K)$, which improves upon the rate $O(1/K^{1/2})$ of DAT and YOPO.

    "abstract": "Deep-learning-based intelligent services have become prevalent in cyber-physical applications including smart cities and health-care. Deploying deep-learning-based intelligence near the end-user enhances privacy protection, responsiveness, and reliability. Resource-constrained end-devices must be carefully managed in order to meet the latency and energy requirements of computationally-intensive deep learning services. Collaborative end-edge-cloud computing for deep learning provides a range of performance and efficiency that can address application requirements through computation offloading. The decision to offload computation is a communication-computation co-optimization problem that varies with both system parameters (e.g., network condition) and workload characteristics (e.g., inputs). On the other hand, deep learning model optimization provides another source of tradeoff between latency and model accuracy. An end-to-end decision-making solution that considers such computation-communication problem is required to synergistically find the optimal offloading policy and model for deep learning services. To this end, we propose a reinforcement-learning-based computation offloading solution that learns optimal offloading policy considering deep learning model selection techniques to minimize response time while providing sufficient accuracy. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our solution for edge devices in an end-edge-cloud system and evaluate with a real-setup implementation using multiple AWS and ARM core configurations. Our solution provides 35% speedup in the average response time compared to the state-of-the-art with less than 0.9% accuracy reduction, demonstrating the promise of our online learning framework for orchestrating DL inference in end-edge-cloud systems.

    "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic will be remembered as a uniquely disruptive period that altered the lives of billions of citizens globally, resulting in new-normal for the way people live and work. With the coronavirus pandemic, everyone had to adapt to the \"work or study from home\" operating model that has transformed our online lives and exponentially increased the use of cyberspace. Concurrently, there has been a huge spike in social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter during the COVID-19 lockdown periods. These lockdown periods have resulted in a set of new cybercrimes, thereby allowing attackers to victimise users of social media platforms in times of fear, uncertainty, and doubt. The threats range from running phishing campaigns and malicious domains to extracting private information about victims for malicious purposes. This research paper performs a large-scale study to investigate the impact of lockdown periods during the COVID-19 pandemic on the security and privacy of social media users. We analyse 10.6 Million COVID-related tweets from 533 days of data crawling and investigate users' security and privacy behaviour in three different periods (i.e., before, during, and after lockdown). Our study shows that users unintentionally share more personal identifiable information when writing about the pandemic situation in their tweets. The privacy risk reaches 100% if a user posts three or more sensitive tweets about the pandemic. We investigate the number of suspicious domains shared in social media during different pandemic phases. Our analysis reveals an increase in suspicious domains during the lockdown compared to other lockdown phases. We observe that IT, Search Engines, and Businesses are the top three categories that contain suspicious domains. Our analysis reveals that adversaries' strategies to instigate malicious activities change with the country's pandemic situation. ",

We present a novel camera view generation method which maximizes the visible geometric attributes (segment shape and relative placement between segments). Camera views are created for individual segments and are used to determine local bending angles at each node by projecting them to 2D. The final embedding is generated by minimizing an energy function (the weights of which are user adjustable) based on branch length and the 2D angles, while avoiding intersections. The user can also interactively modify segment placement within the 2D embedding, and the overall embedding will update accordingly. A global to local interactive exploration is provided using hierarchical camera views that are created for subtrees within the structure.

Existing prior works have attempted to model video distribution by representing videos as 3D grids of RGB values, which impedes the scale of generated videos and neglects continuous dynamics. In this paper, we found that the recent emerging paradigm of implicit neural representations (INRs) that encodes a continuous signal into a parameterized neural network effectively mitigates the issue. By utilizing INRs of video, we propose dynamics-aware implicit generative adversarial network (DIGAN), a novel generative adversarial network for video generation. Specifically, we introduce (a) an INR-based video generator that improves the motion dynamics by manipulating the space and time coordinates differently and (b) a motion discriminator that efficiently identifies the unnatural motions without observing the entire long frame sequences. We demonstrate the superiority of DIGAN under various datasets, along with multiple intriguing properties, e.g., long video synthesis, video extrapolation, and non-autoregressive video generation. For example, DIGAN improves the previous state-of-the-art FVD score on UCF-101 by 30.7% and can be trained on 128 frame videos of 128x128 resolution, 80 frames longer than the 48 frames of the previous state-of-the-art method.

In this paper, we propose a new Transformer architecture, named dual-encoding Transformer (DET). DET has a structural encoder to aggregate information from connected neighbors and a semantic encoder to focus on semantically useful distant nodes. In comparison with resorting to multi-hop neighbors, DET seeks the desired distant neighbors via self-supervised training.

There are various examples of occurrence dynamics in the daily life, and it is important to train the temporal dynamics and solve two different prediction problems, time and type predictions. Especially, deep neural network based models have outperformed the statistical models, such as Hawkes processes and Poisson processes. However, many existing approaches overfit to specific events, instead of learning and predicting various event types. Therefore, such approaches could not cope with the modified relationships between events and fail to predict the intensity functions of temporal point processes very well. In this paper, to solve these problems, we propose a variational neural temporal point process (VNTPP). We introduce the inference and the generative networks, and train a distribution of latent variable to deal with stochastic property on deep neural network. The intensity functions are computed using the distribution of latent variable so that we can predict event types and the arrival times of the events more accurately. We empirically demonstrate that our model can generalize the representations of various event types. Moreover, we show quantitatively and qualitatively that our model outperforms other deep neural network based models and statistical processes on synthetic and real-world datasets. ",

    "abstract": "A Machine-Critical Application is a system that is fundamentally necessary to the success of specific and sensitive operations such as search and recovery, rescue, military, and emergency management actions. Recent advances in Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing, voice recognition, and speech processing technologies have naturally allowed the development and deployment of speech-based conversational interfaces to interact with various machine-critical applications. While these conversational interfaces have allowed users to give voice commands to carry out strategic and critical activities, their robustness to adversarial attacks remains uncertain and unclear. Indeed, Adversarial Artificial Intelligence (AI) which refers to a set of techniques that attempt to fool machine learning models with deceptive data, is a growing threat in the AI and machine learning research community, in particular for machine-critical applications. The most common reason of adversarial attacks is to cause a malfunction in a machine learning model. An adversarial attack might entail presenting a model with inaccurate or fabricated samples as it's training data, or introducing maliciously designed data to deceive an already trained model. While focusing on speech recognition for machine-critical applications, in this paper, we first review existing speech recognition techniques, then, we investigate the effectiveness of adversarial attacks and defenses against these systems, before outlining research challenges, defense recommendations, and future work. This paper is expected to serve researchers and practitioners as a reference to help them in understanding the challenges, position themselves and, ultimately, help them to improve existing models of speech recognition for mission-critical applications.

    "abstract": "Precisely modeling interactions and accurately predicting trajectories of surrounding vehicles are essential to the decision-making and path-planning of intelligent vehicles. This paper proposes a novel framework based on ensemble learning to improve the performance of trajectory predictions in interactive scenarios. The framework is termed Interactive Ensemble Trajectory Predictor (IETP). IETP assembles interaction-aware trajectory predictors as base learners to build an ensemble learner. Firstly, each base learner in IETP observes historical trajectories of vehicles in the scene. Then each base learner handles interactions between vehicles to predict trajectories. Finally, an ensemble learner is built to predict trajectories by applying two ensemble strategies on the predictions from all base learners. Predictions generated by the ensemble learner are final outputs of IETP. In this study, three experiments using different data are conducted based on the NGSIM dataset. Experimental results show that IETP improves the predicting accuracy and decreases the variance of errors compared to base learners. In addition, IETP exceeds baseline models with 50% of the training data, indicating that IETP is data-efficient. Moreover, the implementation of IETP is publicly available at https://github.com/BIT-Jack/IETP. ",

In private federated learning applications, these vectors are held by client devices, leading to a distributed summation problem. Standard Secure Multiparty Computation (SMC) protocols for this problem are susceptible to poisoning attacks, where a client may have a large influence on the sum, without being detected. In this work, we propose a poisoning-robust private summation protocol in the multiple-server setting, recently studied in PRIO. We present a protocol for vector summation that verifies that the Euclidean norm of each contribution is approximately bounded. We show that by relaxing the security constraint in SMC to a differential privacy like guarantee, one can improve over PRIO in terms of communication requirements as well as the client-side computation. Unlike SMC algorithms that inevitably cast integers to elements of a large finite field, our algorithms work over integers/reals, which may allow for additional efficiencies. ",

    "abstract": "DNNs' demand for massive data forces practitioners to collect data from the Internet without careful check due to the unacceptable cost, which brings potential risks of backdoor attacks. A backdoored model always predicts a target class in the presence of a predefined trigger pattern, which can be easily realized via poisoning a small amount of data. In general, adversarial training is believed to defend against backdoor attacks since it helps models to keep their prediction unchanged even if we perturb the input image (as long as within a feasible range). Unfortunately, few previous studies succeed in doing so. To explore whether adversarial training could defend against backdoor attacks or not, we conduct extensive experiments across different threat models and perturbation budgets, and find the threat model in adversarial training matters. For instance, adversarial training with spatial adversarial examples provides notable robustness against commonly-used patch-based backdoor attacks. We further propose a hybrid strategy which provides satisfactory robustness across different backdoor attacks. ",

In this paper, we propose Equivariant Hierarchy-based Graph Networks (EGHNs) which consist of the three key components: generalized Equivariant Matrix Message Passing (EMMP) , E-Pool and E-UpPool. In particular, EMMP is able to improve the expressivity of conventional equivariant message passing, E-Pool assigns the quantities of the low-level nodes into high-level clusters, while E-UpPool leverages the high-level information to update the dynamics of the low-level nodes. As their names imply, both E-Pool and E-UpPool are guaranteed to be equivariant to meet physic symmetry. Considerable experimental evaluations verify the effectiveness of our EGHN on several applications including multi-object dynamics simulation, motion capture, and protein dynamics modeling. ",

    "abstract": "Gait recognition, a promising long-distance biometric technology, has aroused intense interest in computer vision. Existing works on gait recognition can be divided into appearance-based methods and model-based methods, which extract features from silhouettes and skeleton data, respectively. However, since appearance-based methods are greatly affected by clothing changing and carrying condition, and model-based methods are limited by the accuracy of pose estimation approaches, gait recognition remains challenging in practical applications. In order to integrate the merits of such two approaches, a two-branch neural network (NN)-based model is proposed in this paper. The method contains two branches, namely a CNN-based branch taking silhouettes as input and a GCN-based branch taking skeletons as input. In addition, two modifications are introduced into the GCN-based branch to boost the performance. First, we present a simple fully connected graph convolution operator to integrate multi-scale graph convolutions and relieve dependence on natural connections. Second, we deploy an attention module named STC-Att after each GCN block to learn spatial, temporal and channel-wise attention simultaneously. We evaluated the proposed two-branch neural network on the CASIA-B dataset. The experimental results show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in various conditions. ",

    "abstract": "Causal inference from observational datasets often relies on measuring and adjusting for covariates. In practice, measurements of the covariates can often be noisy and/or biased, or only measurements of their proxies may be available. Directly adjusting for these imperfect measurements of the covariates can lead to biased causal estimates. Moreover, without additional assumptions, the causal effects are not point-identifiable due to the noise in these measurements. To this end, we study the partial identification of causal effects given noisy covariates, under a user-specified assumption on the noise level. The key observation is that we can formulate the identification of the average treatment effects (ATE) as a robust optimization problem. This formulation leads to an efficient robust optimization algorithm that bounds the ATE with noisy covariates. We show that this robust optimization approach can extend a wide range of causal adjustment methods to perform partial identification, including backdoor adjustment, inverse propensity score weighting, double machine learning, and front door adjustment. Across synthetic and real datasets, we find that this approach provides ATE bounds with a higher coverage probability than existing methods. ",

TART represents a tree model with a series of transposed convolutions that boost the speed of inference by avoiding the creation of transition matrices. As a result, TART allows one to search for the best tree structure with a few design parameters, achieving higher classification accuracy than those of baseline models in feature-based datasets. ",

We introduce a feature vector which represents the unbiased feature estimation of persons. The network updates the feature vector self-adaptively and utilizes the feature similarity for the regression of crowd numbers. Besides, the proposed GLC loss leverages the consistency between the network estimations from global and local areas.

Finally, the generated regions are used to fine-tune the perturbations making the model misclassified with fewer perturbations.

Previous research has developed lifted representations to address the relational nature of such dynamics but has strictly required that the representation has no cycles. To facilitate cycles in relational representation and learning, we introduce relational $\\sigma$-separation, a new criterion for understanding relational systems with feedback loops. We also introduce a new lifted representation, $\\sigma$-abstract ground graph which helps with abstracting statistical independence relations in all possible instantiations of the cyclic relational model. We show the necessary and sufficient conditions for the completeness of $\\sigma$-AGG and that relational $\\sigma$-separation is sound and complete in the presence of one or more cycles with arbitrary length.

In this paper, we propose an approach for speeding up neural scoring time by applying a combination of Distillation, Pruning and Fast Matrix multiplication. We employ knowledge distillation to learn shallow neural networks from an ensemble of regression trees. Then, we exploit an efficiency-oriented pruning technique that performs a sparsification of the most computationally-intensive layers of the neural network that is then scored with optimized sparse matrix multiplication. Moreover, by studying both dense and sparse high performance matrix multiplication, we develop a scoring time prediction model which helps in devising neural network architectures that match the desired efficiency requirements. Comprehensive experiments on two public learning-to-rank datasets show that neural networks produced with our novel approach are competitive at any point of the effectiveness-efficiency trade-off when compared with tree-based ensembles, providing up to 4x scoring time speed-up without affecting the ranking quality.

In this work, we investigate how two well-known modeling principles -- modularity and data augmentation -- affect systematic generalization of neural networks in grounded language learning. We analyze how large the vocabulary needs to be to achieve systematic generalization and how similar the augmented data needs to be to the problem at hand. Our findings show that even in the controlled setting of a synthetic benchmark, achieving systematic generalization remains very difficult. After training on an augmented dataset with almost forty times more adverbs than the original problem, a non-modular baseline is not able to systematically generalize to a novel combination of a known verb and adverb. When separating the task into cognitive processes like perception and navigation, a modular neural network is able to utilize the augmented data and generalize more systematically, achieving 70% and 40% exact match increase over state-of-the-art on two gSCAN tests that have not previously been improved. We hope that this work gives insight into the drivers of systematic generalization, and what we still need to improve for neural networks to learn more like humans do. ",

    "abstract": "Nowadays, thermal infrared satellite remote sensors enable to extract very interesting information at large scale, in particular Land Surface Temperature (LST). However such data are limited in spatial and/or temporal resolutions which prevents from an analysis at fine scales. For example, MODIS satellite provides daily acquisitions with 1Km spatial resolutions which is not sufficient to deal with highly heterogeneous environments as agricultural parcels. Therefore, image super-resolution is a crucial task to better exploit MODIS LSTs. This issue is tackled in this paper. We introduce a deep learning-based algorithm, named Multi-residual U-Net, for super-resolution of MODIS LST single-images. Our proposed network is a modified version of U-Net architecture, which aims at super-resolving the input LST image from 1Km to 250m per pixel. The results show that our Multi-residual U-Net outperforms other state-of-the-art methods. ",

    "abstract": "Signed networks are ubiquitous in many real-world applications (e.g., social networks encoding trust/distrust relationships, correlation networks arising from time series data). While many signed networks are directed, there is a lack of survey papers and software packages on graph neural networks (GNNs) specially designed for directed networks. In this paper, we present PyTorch Geometric Signed Directed, a survey and software on GNNs for signed and directed networks. We review typical tasks, loss functions and evaluation metrics in the analysis of signed and directed networks, discuss data used in related experiments, and provide an overview of methods proposed. The deep learning framework consists of easy-to-use GNN models, synthetic and real-world data, as well as task-specific evaluation metrics and loss functions for signed and directed networks. The software is presented in a modular fashion, so that signed and directed networks can also be treated separately. As an extension library for PyTorch Geometric, our proposed software is maintained with open-source releases, detailed documentation, continuous integration, unit tests and code coverage checks.

    "abstract": "Analyzing long time series with RNNs often suffers from infeasible training. Segmentation is therefore commonly used in data pre-processing. However, in non-stationary time series, there exists often distribution shift among different segments. RNN is easily swamped in the dilemma of fitting bias in these segments due to the lack of global information, leading to poor generalization, known as Temporal Covariate Shift (TCS) problem, which is only addressed by a recently proposed RNN-based model. One of the assumptions in TCS is that the distribution of all divided intervals under the same segment are identical. This assumption, however, may not be true on high-frequency time series, such as traffic flow, that also have large stochasticity. Besides, macro information across long periods isn't adequately considered in the latest RNN-based methods. To address the above issues, we propose Hyper Attention Recurrent Neural Network (HARNN) for the modeling of temporal patterns containing both micro and macro information. An HARNN consists of a meta layer for parameter generation and an attention-enabled main layer for inference. High-frequency segments are transformed into low-frequency segments and fed into the meta layers, while the first main layer consumes the same high-frequency segments as conventional methods. In this way, each low-frequency segment in the meta inputs generates a unique main layer, enabling the integration of both macro information and micro information for inference. This forces all main layers to predict the same target which fully harnesses the common knowledge in varied distributions when capturing temporal patterns. Evaluations on multiple benchmarks demonstrated that our model outperforms a couple of RNN-based methods on a federation of key metrics. ",

To protect consensus valuefrom being influenced by misbehaving nodes, we address this problem by detecting misbehaviors, mitigating the corresponding adverse impact and achieving the resilient average consensus. In this paper, general types of misbehaviors are considered,including deception attacks, accidental faults and link failures. We characterize the adverse impact of misbehaving nodes in a distributed manner via two-hop communication information and develop a deterministic detection-compensation-based consensus (D-DCC) algorithm with a decaying fault-tolerant error bound. Considering scenarios where information sets are intermittently available due to link failures, a stochastic extension named stochastic detection-compensation-based consensus(S-DCC) algorithm is proposed. We prove that D-DCC and S-DCC allow nodes to asymptotically achieve resilient averageconsensus exactly and in expectation, respectively. Then, the Wasserstein distance is introduced to analyze the accuracy ofS-DCC. Finally, extensive simulations are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm ",

Moreover, we empirically demonstrate that our bounds significantly outperform prior works on a wide range of real-world datasets, such as collections of images, text documents represented as bags-of-words, and text sequences vectorized by neural embeddings.

Modern deep architectures contain multiple mechanisms that allow hundreds or even thousands of layers to train. This work is trying to answer if extending neural network depth may be beneficial in a life-long learning setting. In particular, we propose a novel method based on adding new layers on top of existing ones to enable the forward transfer of knowledge and adapting previously learned representations for new tasks. We utilize a method of determining the most similar tasks for selecting the best location in our network to add new nodes with trainable parameters. This approach allows for creating a tree-like model, where each node is a set of neural network parameters dedicated to a specific task. The proposed method is inspired by Progressive Neural Network (PNN) concept, therefore it is rehearsal-free and benefits from dynamic change of network structure. However, it requires fewer parameters per task than PNN. Experiments on Permuted MNIST and SplitCIFAR show that the proposed algorithm is on par with other continual learning methods. We also perform ablation studies to clarify the contributions of each system part. ",

    "abstract": "As a structured representation of the image content, the visual scene graph (visual relationship) acts as a bridge between computer vision and natural language processing. Existing models on the scene graph generation task notoriously require tens or hundreds of labeled samples. By contrast, human beings can learn visual relationships from a few or even one example. Inspired by this, we design a task named One-Shot Scene Graph Generation, where each relationship triplet (e.g., \"dog-has-head\") comes from only one labeled example. The key insight is that rather than learning from scratch, one can utilize rich prior knowledge. In this paper, we propose Multiple Structured Knowledge (Relational Knowledge and Commonsense Knowledge) for the one-shot scene graph generation task. Specifically, the Relational Knowledge represents the prior knowledge of relationships between entities extracted from the visual content, e.g., the visual relationships \"standing in\", \"sitting in\", and \"lying in\" may exist between \"dog\" and \"yard\", while the Commonsense Knowledge encodes \"sense-making\" knowledge like \"dog can guard yard\". By organizing these two kinds of knowledge in a graph structure, Graph Convolution Networks (GCNs) are used to extract knowledge-embedded semantic features of the entities. Besides, instead of extracting isolated visual features from each entity generated by Faster R-CNN, we utilize an Instance Relation Transformer encoder to fully explore their context information. Based on a constructed one-shot dataset, the experimental results show that our method significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods by a large margin. Ablation studies also verify the effectiveness of the Instance Relation Transformer encoder and the Multiple Structured Knowledge. ",

Specifically, we first construct an affinity matrix among detected objects to represent the probability of a relationship between two objects. Graph convolution networks (GCNs) over this relation affinity matrix are then used as object encoders, producing relation-regularized representations of objects. With these relation-regularized features, our R2-Net can effectively refine object labels and generate scene graphs. Extensive experiments are conducted on the visual genome dataset for three SGG tasks (i.e., predicate classification, scene graph classification, and scene graph detection), demonstrating the effectiveness of our proposed method. Ablation studies also verify the key roles of our proposed components in performance improvement. ",

A promising approach is to leverage time obtained over networks a mobile device can connect to, and detect discrepancies between the GNSS-provided time and the network time. The challenge lies in having reliably both accurate and trustworthy network time as the basis for the GNSS attack detection. Here, we provide a concrete proposal that leverages, together with the network time servers, the nearly ubiquitous IEEE 802.11 (Wi-Fi) infrastructure. Our framework supports application-layer, secure and robust real time broadcasting by Wi-Fi Access Points (APs), based on hash chains and infrequent digital signatures verification to minimize computational and communication overhead, allowing mobile nodes to efficiently obtain authenticated and rich time information as they roam. We pair this method with Network Time Security (NTS), for enhanced resilience through multiple sources, available, ideally, simultaneously. We analyze the performance of our scheme in a dedicated setup, gauging the overhead for authenticated time data (Wi-Fi timestamped beacons and NTS). The results show that it is possible to provide security for the external to GNSS time sources, with minimal overhead for authentication and integrity, even when the GNSS-equipped nodes are mobile, and thus have short interactions with the Wi-Fi infrastructure and possibly intermittent Internet connectivity, as well as limited resources.

Many works consider the FDI attack in the context of the ability to change a measurement in a static system only. However, successful attacks will require first intrusion into a system followed by construction of an attack vector that can bypass bad data detection (BDD). In this way, we develop a full service framework for FDI risk assessment. The framework considers both the costs of system intrusion via a weighted graph assessment in combination with a physical, line overload-based vulnerability assessment. We present our simulations on a IEEE 14-bus system with an overlain RTU network to model the true risk of intrusion. The cyber model considers multiple methods of entry for the FDI attack including meter intrusion, RTU intrusion and combined style attacks. Post-intrusion our physical reinforcement model analyses the required level of topology divergence to protect against a branch overload from an optimised attack vector. ",

Existing audio-visual navigation works assume a clean environment that solely contains the target sound, which, however, would not be suitable in most real-world applications due to the unexpected sound noise or intentional interference. In this work, we design an acoustically complex environment in which, besides the target sound, there exists a sound attacker playing a zero-sum game with the agent. More specifically, the attacker can move and change the volume and category of the sound to make the agent suffer from finding the sounding object while the agent tries to dodge the attack and navigate to the goal under the intervention. Under certain constraints to the attacker, we can improve the robustness of the agent towards unexpected sound attacks in audio-visual navigation. For better convergence, we develop a joint training mechanism by employing the property of a centralized critic with decentralized actors. Experiments on two real-world 3D scan datasets, Replica, and Matterport3D, verify the effectiveness and the robustness of the agent trained under our designed environment when transferred to the clean environment or the one containing sound attackers with random policy.

    "abstract": "The precise estimate of remaining useful life (RUL) is vital for the prognostic analysis and predictive maintenance that can significantly reduce failure rate and maintenance costs. The degradation-related features extracted from the sensor streaming data with neural networks can dramatically improve the accuracy of the RUL prediction. The Temporal deep degradation network (TDDN) model is proposed to make the RUL prediction with the degradation-related features given by the one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D CNN) feature extraction and attention mechanism. 1D CNN is used to extract the temporal features from the streaming sensor data. Temporal features have monotonic degradation trends from the fluctuating raw sensor streaming data. Attention mechanism can improve the RUL prediction performance by capturing the fault characteristics and the degradation development with the attention weights. The performance of the TDDN model is evaluated on the public C-MAPSS dataset and compared with the existing methods. The results show that the TDDN model can achieve the best RUL prediction accuracy in complex conditions compared to current machine learning models. The degradation-related features extracted from the high-dimension sensor streaming data demonstrate the clear degradation trajectories and degradation stages that enable TDDN to predict the turbofan-engine RUL accurately and efficiently.

    "abstract": "This paper presents an algorithm for the efficient simulation of ductile crack propagation through heterogeneous structures, as e.g. metallic microstructures, which are given as voxel data. These kinds of simulations are required for e.g., the numerical investigation of wear mechanisms at small length scales, which is still a challenging task in engineering. The basic idea of the proposed algorithm is to combine the advantages of the Finite Cell Method allowing for a convenient integration of heterogeneous finite element problems with the eigenerosion approach to still enable the mesh-independent simulation of crack propagation. The major component is to switch from finite subcells to finite elements wherever the crack progresses, thereby automatically adaptively refining at the crack tip by managing the newly appearing nodes as hanging nodes. Technically relevant problems of crack propagation at the microscale are mostly linked with sub-critical crack growth where the crack moves fast and stepwise with subsequent load cycles. Therefore, inertia may become important which is why dynamics are taken into account by spreading the mass of the eroded elements to the nodes to avoid a loss in mass resulting from the erosion procedure. Furthermore, a certain treatment for the finite cell decomposition is considered in order to ensure efficiency and accuracy. The numerical framework as well as the voxel decomposition techniques are analyzed in detail in different three-dimensional numerical examples to show the performance of the proposed approach. ",

Given the increasing digital technology adoption amongst older adults, researchers have investigated how technology can support aging populations. However, little work has examined how technology can support older adults during crises, despite increasingly common natural disasters, public health emergencies, and other crisis scenarios in which older adults are especially vulnerable. Addressing this gap, we conducted focus groups with older adults residing in coastal locations to examine to what extent they felt technology could support them during emergencies. Our findings characterize participants' desire for tools that enhance community resilience-local knowledge, preparedness, community relationships, and communication, that help communities withstand disasters. Further, older adults' crisis technology preferences were linked to their sense of control, social relationships, and digital readiness. We discuss how a focus on community resilience can yield crisis technologies that more effectively support older adults. ",

However, few positive results about EFX allocations exist, with the existence of such allocations alone being an open question. In this work, we study an intuitive relaxation of EFX allocations: our allocations are only required to satisfy the EFX constraint for certain pre-defined pairs of agents. Since these problem instances can be represented using an undirected graph where the vertices correspond to the agents and each edge represents an EFX constraint, we call such allocations graph EFX ($G$-EFX) allocations. We show that $G$-EFX allocations exist for three different classes of graphs -- two of them generalize the star $K_{1, n-1}$ and the third generalizes the three-edge path $P_4$. We also present and evaluate an algorithm using problem instances from Spliddit to show that $G$-EFX allocations are likely to exist for larger classes of graphs like long paths $P_n$. ",

    "abstract": "As a main use case of 5G and Beyond wireless network, the ever-increasing machine type communications (MTC) devices pose critical challenges over MTC network in recent years. It is imperative to support massive MTC devices with limited resources. To this end, Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) based random access network has been deemed as a prospective candidate for MTC network. In this paper, we propose a deep reinforcement learning (RL) based approach for NOMA-based random access network with truncated channel inversion power control. Specifically, each MTC device randomly selects a pre-defined power level with a certain probability for data transmission. Devices are using channel inversion power control yet subject to the upper bound of the transmission power. Due to the stochastic feature of the channel fading and the limited transmission power, devices with different achievable power levels have been categorized as different types of devices. In order to achieve high throughput with considering the fairness between all devices, two objective functions are formulated. One is to maximize the minimum long-term expected throughput of all MTC devices, the other is to maximize the geometric mean of the long-term expected throughput for all MTC devices. A Policy based deep reinforcement learning approach is further applied to tune the transmission probabilities of each device to solve the formulated optimization problems. Extensive simulations are conducted to show the merits of our proposed approach. ",

We jointly utilize MDT data, electromagnetic simulations, and network Key Performance indicators (KPIs) to define a simulated network environment for the training of a Deep Q-Network (DQN) agent. Some tweaks have been introduced to the classical DQN formulation to improve the agent's sample efficiency, stability, and performance. In particular, a custom exploration policy is designed to introduce soft constraints at training time. Results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms baseline approaches like DQN and best-fist search in terms of long-term reward and sample efficiency.

Previous works focus on reducing the dimension of speech to get the content information. But the size is hard to determine to lead to the untangle overlapping problem. We propose the Disentangled Representation Voice Conversion (DRVC) model to address the issue. DRVC model is an end-to-end self-supervised model consisting of the content encoder, timbre encoder, and generator.

Once a payment schedule has been defined, where we assume that a bank cannot refuse a payment towards one of its lenders if it has sufficient funds, the liquidity of the system is defined as the sum of total payments made in the network. Maximizing systemic liquidity is a natural objective of any financial authority, so, we study the setting where the financial authority offers bailout money to some bank(s) or forgives the debts of others in order to maximize liquidity, and examine efficient ways to achieve this. We investigate the approximation ratio provided by the greedy bailout policy compared to the optimal one, and we study the computational hardness of finding the optimal debt-removal and budget-constrained optimal bailout policy, respectively. We also study financial systems from a game-theoretic standpoint. We observe that the removal of some incoming debt might be in the best interest of a bank, if that helps one of its borrowers remain solvent and avoid costs related to default. Assuming that a bank's well-being (i.e., utility) is aligned with the incoming payments they receive from the network, we define and analyze a game among banks who want to maximize their utility by strategically giving up some incoming payments. In addition, we extend the previous game by considering bailout payments. After formally defining the above games, we prove results about the existence and quality of pure Nash equilibria, as well as the computational complexity of finding such equilibria. ",

We found simple interpretations of the learned representation and model components, and they are consistent with core properties of the probabilistic inference algorithm. We successfully identified a `graph translator' between the statistical interactions in belief propagation and parameters of the corresponding trained network, and showed that it enables two types of novel generalization: to recover the underlying structure of a new system instance based solely on time series observations, or to construct a new network from this structure directly. Our results demonstrated a path towards understanding both dynamics and structure of a complex system and how such understanding can be used for generalization. ",

We implement the proposed method as an initialization module, which, if enabled, automatically detects the degree of excitation of the collected data and calibrate, on-the-fly, the temporal offset, extrinsic, gravity vector, and IMU bias, which are then used as high-quality initial state values for online LiDAR-inertial odometry systems. Experiments conducted with different types of LiDARs and LiDAR-inertial combinations show the robustness, adaptability and efficiency of our initialization method.

Two commonly desired properties for learned prediction sets are \\emph{valid coverage} and \\emph{good efficiency} (such as low length or low cardinality). Conformal prediction is a powerful technique for learning prediction sets with valid coverage, yet by default its conformalization step only learns a single parameter, and does not optimize the efficiency over more expressive function classes. In this paper, we propose a generalization of conformal prediction to multiple learnable parameters, by considering the constrained empirical risk minimization (ERM) problem of finding the most efficient prediction set subject to valid empirical coverage. This meta-algorithm generalizes existing conformal prediction algorithms, and we show that it achieves approximate valid population coverage and near-optimal efficiency within class, whenever the function class in the conformalization step is low-capacity in a certain sense. Next, this ERM problem is challenging to optimize as it involves a non-differentiable coverage constraint. We develop a gradient-based algorithm for it by approximating the original constrained ERM using differentiable surrogate losses and Lagrangians. Experiments show that our algorithm is able to learn valid prediction sets and improve the efficiency significantly over existing approaches in several applications such as prediction intervals with improved length, minimum-volume prediction sets for multi-output regression, and label prediction sets for image classification.

Karger, Motwani, and Sudan \\cite{KMS98} give a vector program for which a coloring of the graph can be encoded as a semidefinite matrix of low rank. By complementary slackness conditions of semidefinite programming, if an optimal dual solution has sufficiently high rank, any optimal primal solution must have low rank. We attempt to characterize graphs for which we can show that the corresponding dual optimal solution must have sufficiently high rank. In the case of the original Karger, Motwani, and Sudan vector program, we show that any graph which is a $k$-tree has sufficiently high dual rank, and we can extract the coloring from the corresponding low-rank primal solution. We can also show that if the graph is not uniquely colorable, then no sufficiently high rank dual optimal solution can exist. This allows us to completely characterize the planar graphs for which dual optimal solutions have sufficiently high dual rank. We then modify the semidefinite program to have an objective function with costs, and explore when we can create a cost function whose optimal dual solution has sufficiently high rank. We show that it is always possible to construct such a cost function given the graph coloring. The construction of the cost function gives rise to a heuristic for graph coloring which we show works well in the case of planar graphs. Our research was motivated by the Colin de Verdi\\`ere graph invariant \\cite{CDV90}(and a corresponding conjecture of Colin de Verdi\\`ere), in which matrices that have some similarities to the dual feasible matrices must have high rank in the case that graphs are of a certain type. We explore the connection between the conjecture and the rank of the dual solutions. ",

Currently, the correct data augmentation is chosen by human effort and costly cross-validation, which makes it cumbersome to apply to new datasets. We develop a convenient gradient-based method for selecting the data augmentation. Our approach relies on phrasing data augmentation as an invariance in the prior distribution and learning it using Bayesian model selection, which has been shown to work in Gaussian processes, but not yet for deep neural networks. We use a differentiable Kronecker-factored Laplace approximation to the marginal likelihood as our objective, which can be optimised without human supervision or validation data. We show that our method can successfully recover invariances present in the data, and that this improves generalisation on image datasets. ",

    "title": "On Local Distributions in Graph Signal Processing",
    "abstract": "Graph filtering is the cornerstone operation in graph signal processing (GSP). Thus, understanding it is key in developing potent GSP methods. Graph filters are local and distributed linear operations, whose output depends only on the local neighborhood of each node. Moreover, a graph filter's output can be computed separately at each node by carrying out repeated exchanges with immediate neighbors. Graph filters can be compactly written as polynomials of a graph shift operator (typically, a sparse matrix description of the graph). This has led to relating the properties of the filters with the spectral properties of the corresponding matrix -- which encodes global structure of the graph. In this work, we propose a framework that relies solely on the local distribution of the neighborhoods of a graph. The crux of this approach is to describe graphs and graph signals in terms of a measurable space of rooted balls. Leveraging this, we are able to seamlessly compare graphs of different sizes and coming from different models, yielding results on the convergence of spectral densities, transferability of filters across arbitrary graphs, and continuity of graph signal properties with respect to the distribution of local substructures.

    "abstract": "Causal effect estimation is important for numerous tasks in the natural and social sciences. However, identifying effects is impossible from observational data without making strong, often untestable assumptions. We consider algorithms for the partial identification problem, bounding treatment effects from multivariate, continuous treatments over multiple possible causal models when unmeasured confounding makes identification impossible. We consider a framework where observable evidence is matched to the implications of constraints encoded in a causal model by norm-based criteria. This generalizes classical approaches based purely on generative models. Casting causal effects as objective functions in a constrained optimization problem, we combine flexible learning algorithms with Monte Carlo methods to implement a family of solutions under the name of stochastic causal programming. In particular, we present ways by which such constrained optimization problems can be parameterized without likelihood functions for the causal or the observed data model, reducing the computational and statistical complexity of the task.

However, in medical imaging, where the reconstruction problem is underdetermined and model predictions inform high-stakes diagnoses, uncertainty quantification of INR inference is critical. To that end, we study UncertaINR: a Bayesian reformulation of INR-based image reconstruction, for computed tomography (CT). We test several Bayesian deep learning implementations of UncertaINR and find that they achieve well-calibrated uncertainty, while retaining accuracy competitive with other classical, INR-based, and CNN-based reconstruction techniques. In contrast to the best-performing prior approaches, UncertaINR does not require a large training dataset, but only a handful of validation images. ",

    "abstract": "Robust and efficient interpretation of QSAR methods is quite useful to validate AI prediction rationales with subjective opinion (chemist or biologist expertise), understand sophisticated chemical or biological process mechanisms, and provide heuristic ideas for structure optimization in pharmaceutical industry. For this purpose, we construct a multi-layer self-attention based Graph Neural Network framework, namely Ligandformer, for predicting ligand property with interpretation. Ligandformer integrates attention maps on ligand structure from different network blocks. The integrated attention map reflects the machine's local interest on compound structure, and indicates the relationship between predicted compound property and its structure. This work mainly contributes to three aspects: 1. Ligandformer directly opens the black-box of deep learning methods, providing local prediction rationales on chemical structures. 2. Ligandformer gives robust prediction in different experimental rounds, overcoming the ubiquitous prediction instability of deep learning methods. 3. Ligandformer can be generalized to predict different chemical or biological properties with high performance. Furthermore, Ligandformer can simultaneously output specific property score and visible attention map on structure, which can support researchers to investigate chemical or biological property and optimize structure efficiently. Our framework outperforms over counterparts in terms of accuracy, robustness and generalization, and can be applied in complex system study. ",

Two prominent models have been introduced for these problems: either one assigns flow to arcs fulfilling weak flow conservation in any scenario, or one assigns flow to paths where an arc failure or delay affects a whole path. We provide a unifying framework by presenting novel general models, in which we assign flow to subpaths. These models contain the known models as special cases and unify their advantages in order to obtain less conservative robust solutions. We give a thorough analysis with respect to complexity of the general models. In particular, we show that the general models are essentially NP-hard, whereas, e.g. in the static case with $\\Gamma = 1$ an optimal solution can be computed in polynomial time. Further, we answer the open question about the complexity of the dynamic path model for $\\Gamma = 1$. We also compare the solution quality of the different models. In detail, we show that the general models have better robust optimal values than the known models and we prove bounds on these gaps. ",

    "abstract": "The foremost challenge to causal inference with real-world data is to handle the imbalance in the covariates with respect to different treatment options, caused by treatment selection bias. To address this issue, recent literature has explored domain-invariant representation learning based on different domain divergence metrics (e.g., Wasserstein distance, maximum mean discrepancy, position-dependent metric, and domain overlap). In this paper, we reveal the weaknesses of these strategies, i.e., they lead to the loss of predictive information when enforcing the domain invariance; and the treatment effect estimation performance is unstable, which heavily relies on the characteristics of the domain distributions and the choice of domain divergence metrics. Motivated by information theory, we propose to learn the Infomax and Domain-Independent Representations to solve the above puzzles. Our method utilizes the mutual information between the global feature representations and individual feature representations, and the mutual information between feature representations and treatment assignment predictions, in order to maximally capture the common predictive information for both treatment and control groups. Moreover, our method filters out the influence of instrumental and irrelevant variables, and thus it effectively increases the predictive ability of potential outcomes. Experimental results on both the synthetic and real-world datasets show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on causal effect inference. Moreover, our method exhibits reliable prediction performances when facing data with different characteristics of data distributions, complicated variable types, and severe covariate imbalance. ",

We introduce a general meta-algorithm for estimating conditional average treatment effects (CATE) with differential privacy (DP) guarantees. Our meta-algorithm can work with simple, single-stage CATE estimators such as S-learner and more complex multi-stage estimators such as DR and R-learner. We perform a tight privacy analysis by taking advantage of sample splitting in our meta-algorithm and the parallel composition property of differential privacy. In this paper, we implement our approach using DP-EBMs as the base learner. DP-EBMs are interpretable, high-accuracy models with privacy guarantees, which allow us to directly observe the impact of DP noise on the learned causal model. Our experiments show that multi-stage CATE estimators incur larger accuracy loss than single-stage CATE or ATE estimators and that most of the accuracy loss from differential privacy is due to an increase in variance, not biased estimates of treatment effects.

Given shared randomness, which is initially correlated with a quantum system held by an eavesdropper, the goal is to extract uniform randomness which is decoupled from the latter. The optimal rate for this task is known to satisfy the strong converse property and we provide a lower bound on the corresponding strong converse exponent. In the strong converse region, the distance of the final state of the protocol from the desired decoupled state converges exponentially fast to its maximal value, in the asymptotic limit. We show that this necessarily leads to totally insecure communication by establishing that the eavesdropper can infer any sent messages with certainty, when given very limited extra information. In fact, we prove that in the strong converse region, the eavesdropper has an exponential advantage in inferring the sent message correctly, compared to the achievability region. Additionally we establish the following technical result, which is central to our proofs, and is of independent interest: the smoothing parameter for the smoothed max-relative entropy satisfies the strong converse property.
