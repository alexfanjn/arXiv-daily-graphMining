    "abstract": "This paper addresses the unsupervised learning of content-style decomposed representation. We first give a definition of style and then model the content-style representation as a token-level bipartite graph. An unsupervised framework, named Retriever, is proposed to learn such representations. First, a cross-attention module is employed to retrieve permutation invariant (P.I.) information, defined as style, from the input data. Second, a vector quantization (VQ) module is used, together with man-induced constraints, to produce interpretable content tokens. Last, an innovative link attention module serves as the decoder to reconstruct data from the decomposed content and style, with the help of the linking keys. Being modal-agnostic, the proposed Retriever is evaluated in both speech and image domains. The state-of-the-art zero-shot voice conversion performance confirms the disentangling ability of our framework. Top performance is also achieved in the part discovery task for images, verifying the interpretability of our representation. In addition, the vivid part-based style transfer quality demonstrates the potential of Retriever to support various fascinating generative tasks.

    "abstract": "Machine learning systems are becoming more and more ubiquitous in increasingly complex areas, including cutting-edge scientific research. The opposite is also true: the interest in better understanding the inner workings of machine learning systems motivates their analysis under the lens of different scientific disciplines. Physics is particularly successful in this, due to its ability to describe complex dynamical systems. While explanations of phenomena in machine learning based on physics are increasingly present, examples of direct application of notions akin to physics in order to improve machine learning systems are more scarce. Here we provide one such application in the problem of developing algorithms that preserve the privacy of the manipulated data, which is especially important in tasks such as the processing of medical records. We develop well-defined conditions to guarantee robustness to specific types of privacy leaks, and rigorously prove that such conditions are satisfied by tensor-network architectures. These are inspired by the efficient representation of quantum many-body systems, and have shown to compete and even surpass traditional machine learning architectures in certain cases. Given the growing expertise in training tensor-network architectures, these results imply that one may not have to be forced to make a choice between accuracy in prediction and ensuring the privacy of the information processed.

However, when such rules are implemented to learn different new tasks, they usually require a significant amount of work on task-dependent fine-tuning. This paper aims to make this process easier by employing an evolutionary algorithm that evolves suitable synaptic plasticity rules for the task at hand. More specifically, we provide a set of various local signals, a set of mathematical operators, and a global reward signal, after which a Cartesian genetic programming process finds an optimal learning rule from these components. Using this approach, we find learning rules that successfully solve an XOR and cart-pole task, and discover new learning rules that outperform the baseline rules from literature. ",

    "title": "Bayesian Deep Learning for Graphs",
    "abstract": "The adaptive processing of structured data is a long-standing research topic in machine learning that investigates how to automatically learn a mapping from a structured input to outputs of various nature. Recently, there has been an increasing interest in the adaptive processing of graphs, which led to the development of different neural network-based methodologies. In this thesis, we take a different route and develop a Bayesian Deep Learning framework for graph learning. The dissertation begins with a review of the principles over which most of the methods in the field are built, followed by a study on graph classification reproducibility issues. We then proceed to bridge the basic ideas of deep learning for graphs with the Bayesian world, by building our deep architectures in an incremental fashion. This framework allows us to consider graphs with discrete and continuous edge features, producing unsupervised embeddings rich enough to reach the state of the art on several classification tasks. Our approach is also amenable to a Bayesian nonparametric extension that automatizes the choice of almost all model's hyper-parameters. Two real-world applications demonstrate the efficacy of deep learning for graphs. The first concerns the prediction of information-theoretic quantities for molecular simulations with supervised neural models. After that, we exploit our Bayesian models to solve a malware-classification task while being robust to intra-procedural code obfuscation techniques. We conclude the dissertation with an attempt to blend the best of the neural and Bayesian worlds together. The resulting hybrid model is able to predict multimodal distributions conditioned on input graphs, with the consequent ability to model stochasticity and uncertainty better than most works. Overall, we aim to provide a Bayesian perspective into the articulated research field of deep learning for graphs. ",

Advances in machine learning algorithms enable learning POD-based dynamics from data and making accurate and fast predictions of dynamical systems.

HBNODE enjoys several practical advantages for learning POD-based ROMs with theoretical guarantees, including 1) HBNODE can learn long-term dependencies effectively from sequential observations and 2) HBNODE is computationally efficient in both training and testing. We compare HBNODE with other popular ROMs on several complex dynamical systems, including the von K\\'{a}rm\\'{a}n Street flow, the Kurganov-Petrova-Popov equation, and the one-dimensional Euler equations for fluids modeling.

    "abstract": "VPR is a fundamental task for autonomous navigation as it enables a robot to localize itself in the workspace when a known location is detected. Although accuracy is an essential requirement for a VPR technique, computational and energy efficiency are not less important for real-world applications. CNN-based techniques archive state-of-the-art VPR performance but are computationally intensive and energy demanding. Binary neural networks (BNN) have been recently proposed to address VPR efficiently. Although a typical BNN is an order of magnitude more efficient than a CNN, its processing time and energy usage can be further improved. In a typical BNN, the first convolution is not completely binarized for the sake of accuracy. Consequently, the first layer is the slowest network stage, requiring a large share of the entire computational effort. This paper presents a class of BNNs for VPR that combines depthwise separable factorization and binarization to replace the first convolutional layer to improve computational and energy efficiency. Our best model achieves state-of-the-art VPR performance while spending considerably less time and energy to process an image than a BNN using a non-binary convolution as a first stage. ",

Here, we propose a novel unsupervised technique for learning fine-grained political leaning from the textual content of social media posts. Our technique leverages a deep neural network for learning latent political ideologies in a representation learning task. Then, users are projected in a low-dimensional ideology space where they are subsequently clustered. The political leaning of a user is automatically derived from the cluster to which the user is assigned. We evaluated our technique in two challenging classification tasks and we compared it to baselines and other state-of-the-art approaches. Our technique obtains the best results among all unsupervised techniques, with micro F1 = 0.426 in the 8-class task and micro F1 = 0.772 in the 3-class task. Other than being interesting on their own, our results also pave the way for the development of new and better unsupervised approaches for the detection of fine-grained political leaning. ",

This paper studies the consensus problem for a set of processes connected by a dynamic directed network, in which computation and communication is lock-step synchronous but controlled by an oblivious message adversary. In this basic model, determining consensus solvability and designing consensus algorithms in the case where it is possible, has been shown to be surprisingly difficult. We present an explicit decision procedure to determine if consensus is possible under a given adversary. This in turn enables us, for the first time, to study the time complexity of consensus in this model. In particular, we derive time complexity upper bounds for consensus solvability both for a centralized decision procedure as well as for solving distributed consensus. We complement these results with time complexity lower bounds. Intriguingly, we find that reaching consensus under an oblivious message adversary can take exponentially longer than broadcasting the input value of some process to all other processes. ",

However, the ability to tailor such strategies to inoculate a model against specific classes of corruptions or attacks -- without incurring substantial losses in robustness against other classes of corruptions -- remains elusive. In this work, we successfully harden a model against Fourier-based attacks, while producing superior-to-AugMix accuracy and calibration results on both the CIFAR-10-C and CIFAR-100-C datasets; classification error is reduced by over ten percentage points for some high-severity noise and digital-type corruptions. We achieve this by incorporating Fourier-basis perturbations in the AugMix image-augmentation framework. Thus we demonstrate that the AugMix framework can be tailored to effectively target particular distribution shifts, while boosting overall model robustness. ",

    "abstract": "Malicious accounts spreading misinformation has led to widespread false and misleading narratives in recent times, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, and social media platforms struggle to eliminate these contents rapidly. This is because adapting to new domains requires human intensive fact-checking that is slow and difficult to scale. To address this challenge, we propose to leverage news-source credibility labels as weak labels for social media posts and propose model-guided refinement of labels to construct large-scale, diverse misinformation labeled datasets in new domains. The weak labels can be inaccurate at the article or social media post level where the stance of the user does not align with the news source or article credibility. We propose a framework to use a detection model self-trained on the initial weak labels with uncertainty sampling based on entropy in predictions of the model to identify potentially inaccurate labels and correct for them using self-supervision or relabeling. The framework will incorporate social context of the post in terms of the community of its associated user for surfacing inaccurate labels towards building a large-scale dataset with minimum human effort. To provide labeled datasets with distinction of misleading narratives where information might be missing significant context or has inaccurate ancillary details, the proposed framework will use the few labeled samples as class prototypes to separate high confidence samples into false, unproven, mixture, mostly false, mostly true, true, and debunk information. The approach is demonstrated for providing a large-scale misinformation dataset on COVID-19 vaccines. ",

Furthermore, we propose a novel base-2 logarithmic quantization scheme to quantize weights to power-of-two discrete values. Our proposed scheme allows us to replace resource-hungry high-precision multipliers with simple shift-add operations. According to our evaluations, our method outperforms existing work on CIFAR10 and ImageNet datasets and even achieves better accuracy performance with 3-bit weights and activations when compared to the full-precision models. Moreover, our scheme simultaneously prunes the network's parameters and allows us to flexibly adjust the pruning ratio during the quantization process. ",

    "abstract": "While several works have studied the vulnerability of automated FRS and have proposed morphing attack detection (MAD) methods, very few have focused on studying the human ability to detect morphing attacks. The examiner/observer's face morph detection ability is based on their observation, domain knowledge, experience, and familiarity with the problem, and no works report the detailed findings from observers who check identity documents as a part of their everyday professional life. This work creates a new benchmark database of realistic morphing attacks from 48 unique subjects leading to 400 morphed images presented to the observers in a Differential-MAD (D-MAD) setting. Unlike the existing databases, the newly created morphed image database has been created with careful considerations to age, gender and ethnicity to create realistic morph attacks. Further, unlike the previous works, we also capture ten images from Automated Border Control (ABC) gates to mimic the realistic D-MAD setting leading to 400 probe images in border crossing scenarios. The newly created dataset is further used to study the ability of human observers' ability to detect morphed images. In addition, a new dataset of 180 morphed images is also created using the FRGCv2 dataset under the Single Image-MAD (S-MAD) setting. Further, to benchmark the human ability in detecting morphs, a new evaluation platform is created to conduct S-MAD and D-MAD analysis. The benchmark study employs 469 observers for D-MAD and 410 observers for S-MAD who are primarily governmental employees from more than 40 countries. The analysis provides interesting insights and points to expert observers' missing competence and failure to detect a considerable amount of morphing attacks. Human observers tend to detect morphed images to a lower accuracy as compared to the automated MAD algorithms evaluated in this work. ",

    "abstract": "Complex systems, such as pathophysiological processes, commonly exhibit chaotic, nonlinear, and intermittent phenomena. Koopman operator theory and Hankel alternative view of Koopman (HAVOK) model have been widely used to decompose the chaos of the complex system dynamics into an intermittent forced linear system. Although the statistics of the intermittent forcing have been proposed to characterize intermittencies in the HAVOK model, they were not adequate to attribute for the mode switching of nonlinear dynamics and the fat-tailed non-Gaussian distribution originated from high-frequency bursts and rarely-observed intermittent forcing. The paper proposed a new intermittency dynamics analysis approach to characterize the intermittent phases, chaotic bursts, and local spectral-temporal properties of various intermittent dynamics modes using spectral decomposition and wavelet analysis. To validate our methods, the intermittency behavior of apneic events in obstructive sleep apnea disorder was selected as the case, in which heart rate variability (HRV) features were extracted. Next, we constructed the Hankel matrix from the HRV features and obtained the last eigen time-delay coordinate by singular value decomposition of the Hankel matrix, which was modeled as an intermittent forcing input. The statistics of the forcing in OSA demonstrated the fat-tailed distribution of the intermittent forcing, which correspond to the intermittency of the underlying OSA pathophysiological process. The pooled means and standard deviations of the burst duration and the inter-burst duration across OSA patients were also calculated to be minutes and minutes. Scalogram amplitude and spectral decomposition of the wavelet transform exhibited various predominant frequencies and dynamics modes associated with apneic events. ",

Based on the theoretical findings, we present two feasible ways to improve the robustness of existing neural networks. The proposed approaches are very simple and only require upsampling the inputs or modifying the stride configuration of convolution operators.

In the list locally surjective homomorphism problem, denoted by LLSHom($H$), the graph $H$ is fixed and the instance consists of a graph $G$ whose every vertex is equipped with a subset of $V(H)$, called list. We ask for the existence of a locally surjective homomorphism from $G$ to $H$, where every vertex of $G$ is mapped to a vertex from its list. In this paper, we study the complexity of the LLSHom($H$) problem in $F$-free graphs, i.e., graphs that exclude a fixed graph $F$ as an induced subgraph. We aim to understand for which pairs $(H,F)$ the problem can be solved in subexponential time. We show that for all graphs $H$, for which the problem is NP-hard in general graphs, it cannot be solved in subexponential time in $F$-free graphs unless $F$ is a bounded-degree forest or the ETH fails. The initial study reveals that a natural subfamily of bounded-degree forests $F$ that might lead to some tractability results is the family $\\mathcal S$ consisting of forests whose every component has at most three leaves. In this case, we exhibit the following dichotomy theorem: besides the cases that are polynomial-time solvable in general graphs, the graphs $H \\in \\{P_3,C_4\\}$ are the only connected ones that allow for a subexponential-time algorithm in $F$-free graphs for every $F \\in \\mathcal S$ (unless the ETH fails).

We focus on filling a long continuous gap (e.g., multiple months of missing daily observations) rather than on individual randomly missing observations. Our proposed gap filling algorithm uses an automated method for determining the optimal MLP model architecture, thus allowing for optimal prediction performance for the given time series. We tested our approach by filling gaps of various lengths (three months to three years) in three environmental datasets with different time series characteristics, namely daily groundwater levels, daily soil moisture, and hourly Net Ecosystem Exchange. We compared the accuracy of the gap-filled values obtained with our approach to the widely-used R-based time series gap filling methods ImputeTS and mtsdi. The results indicate that using an MLP for filling a large gap leads to better results, especially when the data behave nonlinearly. Thus, our approach enables the use of datasets that have a large gap in one variable, which is common in many long-term environmental monitoring observations. ",

Drugs and drug classes can be identified through the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision (ICD-10) codes present on death certificates. However, ICD-10 codes do not always provide high levels of specificity in drug identification. To achieve more fine-grained identification of substances on a death certificate, the free-text cause of death section, completed by the medical certifier, must be analyzed. Current methods for analyzing free-text death certificates rely solely on look-up tables for identifying specific substances, which must be frequently updated and maintained. To improve identification of drugs on death certificates, a deep learning named-entity recognition model was developed, which achieved an F1-score of 99.13%. This model can identify new drug misspellings and novel substances that are not present on current surveillance look-up tables, enhancing the surveillance of drug overdose deaths. ",

    "abstract": "Ventricular arrhythmias (VA) are the main causes of sudden cardiac death. Developing machine learning methods for detecting VA based on electrocardiograms (ECGs) can help save people's lives. However, developing such machine learning models for ECGs is challenging because of the following: 1) group-level diversity from different subjects and 2) individual-level diversity from different moments of a single subject. In this study, we aim to solve these problems in the pre-training and fine-tuning stages. For the pre-training stage, we propose a novel model agnostic meta-learning (MAML) with curriculum learning (CL) method to solve group-level diversity. MAML is expected to better transfer the knowledge from a large dataset and use only a few recordings to quickly adapt the model to a new person. CL is supposed to further improve MAML by meta-learning from easy to difficult tasks. For the fine-tuning stage, we propose improved pre-fine-tuning to solve individual-level diversity. We conduct experiments using a combination of three publicly available ECG datasets. The results show that our method outperforms the compared methods in terms of all evaluation metrics. Ablation studies show that MAML and CL could help perform more evenly, and pre-fine-tuning could better fit the model to training data. ",

Many explanations stem from the model perspective, and may not necessarily effectively communicate why the model is making its predictions at the right level of abstraction.

In this work, we review the emerging area of concept based explanations. We start by introducing concept explanations including the class of Concept Activation Vectors (CAV) which characterize concepts using vectors in appropriate spaces of neural activations, and discuss different properties of useful concepts, and approaches to measure the usefulness of concept vectors. We then discuss approaches to automatically extract concepts, and approaches to address some of their caveats.

    "abstract": "Depression is increasingly impacting individuals both physically and psychologically worldwide. It has become a global major public health problem and attracts attention from various research fields. Traditionally, the diagnosis of depression is formulated through semi-structured interviews and supplementary questionnaires, which makes the diagnosis heavily relying on physicians experience and is subject to bias. Mental health monitoring and cloud-based remote diagnosis can be implemented through an automated depression diagnosis system. In this article, we propose an attention-based multimodality speech and text representation for depression prediction. Our model is trained to estimate the depression severity of participants using the Distress Analysis Interview Corpus-Wizard of Oz (DAIC-WOZ) dataset. For the audio modality, we use the collaborative voice analysis repository (COVAREP) features provided by the dataset and employ a Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory Network (Bi-LSTM) followed by a Time-distributed Convolutional Neural Network (T-CNN). For the text modality, we use global vectors for word representation (GloVe) to perform word embeddings and the embeddings are fed into the Bi-LSTM network. Results show that both audio and text models perform well on the depression severity estimation task, with best sequence level F1 score of 0.9870 and patient-level F1 score of 0.9074 for the audio model over five classes (healthy, mild, moderate, moderately severe, and severe), as well as sequence level F1 score of 0.9709 and patient-level F1 score of 0.9245 for the text model over five classes. Results are similar for the multimodality fused model, with the highest F1 score of 0.9580 on the patient-level depression detection task over five classes. Experiments show statistically significant improvements over previous works. ",

The architecture is a cascade of dynamical systems designed to separate linearly predictable components of the signal such as trends and seasonality, from the non-linear ones. The former are modeled by local Linear Dynamic Layers, and their residual is fed to a generic Temporal Convolutional Network that also aggregates global statistics from different time series as context for the local predictions of each one. The last layer implements the anomaly detector, which exploits the temporal structure of the prediction residuals to detect both isolated point anomalies and set-point changes. It is based on a novel application of the classic CUMSUM algorithm, adapted through the use of a variational approximation of f-divergences. The model automatically adapts to the time scales of the observed signals. It approximates a SARIMA model at the get-go, and auto-tunes to the statistics of the signal and its covariates, without the need for supervision, as more data is observed. The resulting system, which we call STRIC, outperforms both state-of-the-art robust statistical methods and deep neural network architectures on multiple anomaly detection benchmarks. ",

    "abstract": "Learning representations from electrocardiogram (ECG) serves as a fundamental step for many downstream machine learning-based ECG analysis tasks. However, the learning process is always restricted by lack of high-quality labeled data in reality. Existing methods addressing data deficiency either cannot provide satisfied representations for downstream tasks or require too much effort to construct similar and dissimilar pairs to learn informative representations. In this paper, we propose a straightforward but effective approach to learn ECG representations. Inspired by the temporal and spatial characteristics of ECG, we flip the original signals horizontally, vertically, and both horizontally and vertically. The learning is then done by classifying the four types of signals including the original one. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed temporal-spatial (T-S) reverse detection method, we conduct a downstream task to detect atrial fibrillation (AF) which is one of the most common ECG tasks. The results show that the ECG representations learned with our method lead to remarkable performances on the downstream task. In addition, after exploring the representational feature space and investigating which parts of the ECG signal contribute to the representations, we conclude that the temporal reverse is more effective than the spatial reverse for learning ECG representations.

    "abstract": "Detecting toxic or pejorative expressions in online communities has become one of the main concerns for preventing the users' mental harm. This led to the development of large-scale hate speech detection datasets of various domains, which are mainly built upon web-crawled texts with labels by crowd workers. However, for languages other than English, researchers might have to rely on only a small-sized corpus due to the lack of data-driven research of hate speech detection. This sometimes misleads the evaluation of prevalently used pretrained language models (PLMs) such as BERT, given that PLMs often share the domain of pretraining corpus with the evaluation set, resulting in over-representation of the detection performance. Also, the scope of pejorative expressions might be restricted if the dataset is built on a single domain text. To alleviate the above problems in Korean hate speech detection, we propose APEACH,a method that allows the collection of hate speech generated by unspecified users. By controlling the crowd-generation of hate speech and adding only a minimum post-labeling, we create a corpus that enables the generalizable and fair evaluation of hate speech detection regarding text domain and topic. We Compare our outcome with prior work on an annotation-based toxic news comment dataset using publicly available PLMs. We check that our dataset is less sensitive to the lexical overlap between the evaluation set and pretraining corpus of PLMs, showing that it helps mitigate the unexpected under/over-representation of model performance. We distribute our dataset publicly online to further facilitate the general-domain hate speech detection in Korean. ",

Furthermore, as multimedia content improves the visibility of posts more than text data, it has been observed that often multimedia is being used for creating fake content. A plethora of previous multimodal-based work has tried to address the problem of modeling heterogeneous modalities in identifying fake content. However, these works have the following limitations: (1) inefficient encoding of inter-modal relations by utilizing a simple concatenation operator on the modalities at a later stage in a model, which might result in information loss; (2) training very deep neural networks with a disproportionate number of parameters on small but complex real-life multimodal datasets result in higher chances of overfitting. To address these limitations, we propose GAME-ON, a Graph Neural Network based end-to-end trainable framework that allows granular interactions within and across different modalities to learn more robust data representations for multimodal fake news detection. We use two publicly available fake news datasets, Twitter and Weibo, for evaluations. Our model outperforms on Twitter by an average of 11% and keeps competitive performance on Weibo, within a 2.6% margin, while using 65% fewer parameters than the best comparable state-of-the-art baseline.

Domain Specific Language (DSL) frameworks for graph processing can reduce the programming complexity and development cost of algorithm design. However, accelerator-specific development requires certain technical expertise and significant effort to devise, implement, and validate the system. For most algorithm designers, the expensive cost for hardware programming experience makes FPGA accelerators either unavailable or uneconomic. Although general-purpose High-Level Synthesis (HLS) tools help to map high-level language to Hardware Description Languages (HDLs), the generated code is often inefficient and lengthy compared with the highly-optimized graph accelerators. One cannot make full use of an FPGA accelerator's capacity with low development cost. To easily program graph algorithms while keeping performance degradation acceptable, we propose a graph programming system named JGraph, which contains two main parts: 1) a DSL for graph atomic operations with a graph library for high-level abstractions including user-defined functions with parameters, 2) a light-weight HLS translator to generate high-performance HDL code, cooperating with a communication manager and a runtime scheduler. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first graph programming system with DSL and translator on the FPGA platform. Our system can generate up to 300 MTEPS BFS traversal within tens of seconds. ",

This paper proposes a multi-view graph (MVG) program representation method. MVG pays more attention to code semantics and simultaneously includes both data flow and control flow as multiple views. These views are then combined and processed by a graph neural network (GNN) to obtain a comprehensive program representation that covers various aspects. We thoroughly evaluate our proposed MVG approach in the context of algorithm detection, an important and challenging subfield of PLP. Specifically, we use a public dataset POJ-104 and also construct a new challenging dataset ALG-109 to test our method.

    "abstract": "Proactive evacuation traffic management largely depends on real-time monitoring and prediction of traffic flow at a high spatiotemporal resolution. However, evacuation traffic prediction is challenging due to the uncertainties caused by sudden changes in projected hurricane paths and consequently household evacuation behavior. Moreover, modeling spatiotemporal traffic flow patterns requires extensive data over a longer time period, whereas evacuations typically last for 2 to 5 days. In this paper, we present a novel data-driven approach for predicting evacuation traffic at a network scale. We develop a dynamic graph convolution LSTM (DGCN-LSTM) model to learn the network dynamics of hurricane evacuation. We first train the model for non-evacuation period traffic data showing that the model outperforms existing deep learning models for predicting non-evacuation period traffic with an RMSE value of 226.84. However, when we apply the model for evacuation period, the RMSE value increased to 1440.99. We overcome this issue by adopting a transfer learning approach with additional features related to evacuation traffic demand such as distance from the evacuation zone, time to landfall, and other zonal level features to control the transfer of information (network dynamics) from non-evacuation periods to evacuation periods. The final transfer learned DGCN-LSTM model performs well to predict evacuation traffic flow (RMSE=399.69). The implemented model can be applied to predict evacuation traffic over a longer forecasting horizon (6 hour). It will assist transportation agencies to activate appropriate traffic management strategies to reduce delays for evacuating traffic. ",

    "abstract": "In a data-driven world, datasets constitute a significant economic value. Dataset owners who spend time and money to collect and curate the data are incentivized to ensure that their datasets are not used in ways that they did not authorize. When such misuse occurs, dataset owners need technical mechanisms for demonstrating their ownership of the dataset in question. Dataset watermarking provides one approach for ownership demonstration which can, in turn, deter unauthorized use. In this paper, we investigate a recently proposed data provenance method, radioactive data, to assess if it can be used to demonstrate ownership of (image) datasets used to train machine learning (ML) models. The original paper reported that radioactive data is effective in white-box settings. We show that while this is true for large datasets with many classes, it is not as effective for datasets where the number of classes is low $(\\leq 30)$ or the number of samples per class is low $(\\leq 500)$. We also show that, counter-intuitively, the black-box verification technique is effective for all datasets used in this paper, even when white-box verification is not. Given this observation, we show that the confidence in white-box verification can be improved by using watermarked samples directly during the verification process. We also highlight the need to assess the robustness of radioactive data if it were to be used for ownership demonstration since it is an adversarial setting unlike provenance identification. Compared to dataset watermarking, ML model watermarking has been explored more extensively in recent literature. However, most of the model watermarking techniques can be defeated via model extraction. We show that radioactive data can effectively survive model extraction attacks, which raises the possibility that it can be used for ML model ownership verification robust against model extraction.

To address this problem, this paper proposes a module that can be inserted into the existing networks, and directly incorporates the rotation invariance into the feature extraction layers of the CNNs. This module does not have learnable parameters and will not increase the complexity of the model. At the same time, only by training the upright data, it can perform well on the rotated testing set. These advantages will be suitable for fields such as biomedicine and astronomy where it is difficult to obtain upright samples or the target has no directionality.

In this paper, we propose a data augmentation optimization method based on the adversarial strategy called TeachAugment, which can produce informative transformed images to the model without requiring careful tuning by leveraging a teacher model. Specifically, the augmentation is searched so that augmented images are adversarial for the target model and recognizable for the teacher model. We also propose data augmentation using neural networks, which simplifies the search space design and allows for updating of the data augmentation using the gradient method. We show that TeachAugment outperforms existing methods in experiments of image classification, semantic segmentation, and unsupervised representation learning tasks. ",

    "abstract": "Nowadays, hand gesture recognition has become an alternative for human-machine interaction. It has covered a large area of applications like 3D game technology, sign language interpreting, VR (virtual reality) environment, and robotics. But detection of the hand portion has become a challenging task in computer vision and pattern recognition communities. Deep learning algorithm like convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture has become a very popular choice for classification tasks, but CNN architectures suffer from some problems like high variance during prediction, overfitting problem and also prediction errors. To overcome these problems, an ensemble of CNN-based approaches is presented in this paper. Firstly, the gesture portion is detected by using the background separation method based on binary thresholding. After that, the contour portion is extracted, and the hand region is segmented. Then, the images have been resized and fed into three individual CNN models to train them in parallel. In the last part, the output scores of CNN models are averaged to construct an optimal ensemble model for the final prediction. Two publicly available datasets (labeled as Dataset-1 and Dataset-2) containing infrared images and one self-constructed dataset have been used to validate the proposed system. Experimental results are compared with the existing state-of-the-art approaches, and it is observed that our proposed ensemble model outperforms other existing proposed methods. ",

To tackle these control and scheduling challenges, we propose a novel scoped dataflow for modeling graph traversal queries, which explicitly exposes concurrent execution and control of any subquery to the finest granularity. We implemented Banyan, an engine based on the scoped dataflow model for GQS. Banyan focuses on scaling up the performance on a single machine, and provides the ability to easily scale out. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks show that Banyan improves performance by up to three orders of magnitude over state-of-the-art graph query engines, while providing performance isolation and load balancing.

However, we observed that the existing methods suffer from the representation collapse problem and easily tend to encode samples with different classes into the same latent embedding. Consequently, the discriminative capability of nodes is limited, resulting in sub-optimal clustering performance. To address this problem, we propose a novel deep graph clustering algorithm termed Improved Dual Correlation Reduction Network (IDCRN) through improving the discriminative capability of samples. Specifically, by approximating the cross-view feature correlation matrix to an identity matrix, we reduce the redundancy between different dimensions of features, thus improving the discriminative capability of the latent space explicitly. Meanwhile, the cross-view sample correlation matrix is forced to approximate the designed clustering-refined adjacency matrix to guide the learned latent representation to recover the affinity matrix even across views, thus enhancing the discriminative capability of features implicitly. Moreover, we avoid the collapsed representation caused by the over-smoothing issue in Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) through an introduced propagation regularization term, enabling IDCRN to capture the long-range information with the shallow network structure. Extensive experimental results on six benchmarks have demonstrated the effectiveness and the efficiency of IDCRN compared to the existing state-of-the-art deep graph clustering algorithms. ",

    "abstract": "The increasing amount of data to be processed on edge devices, such as cameras, has motivated Artificial Intelligence (AI) integration at the edge. Typical image processing methods performed at the edge, such as feature extraction or edge detection, use convolutional filters that are energy, computation, and memory hungry algorithms. But edge devices and cameras have scarce computational resources, bandwidth, and power and are limited due to privacy constraints to send data over to the cloud. Thus, there is a need to process image data at the edge. Over the years, this need has incited a lot of interest in implementing neuromorphic computing at the edge. Neuromorphic systems aim to emulate the biological neural functions to achieve energy-efficient computing. Recently, Oscillatory Neural Networks (ONN) present a novel brain-inspired computing approach by emulating brain oscillations to perform autoassociative memory types of applications. To speed up image edge detection and reduce its power consumption, we perform an in-depth investigation with ONNs. We propose a novel image processing method by using ONNs as a hetero-associative memory (HAM) for image edge detection. We simulate our ONN-HAM solution using first, a Matlab emulator, and then a fully digital ONN design. We show results on gray scale square evaluation maps, also on black and white and gray scale 28x28 MNIST images and finally on black and white 512x512 standard test images. We compare our solution with standard edge detection filters such as Sobel and Canny. Finally, using the fully digital design simulation results, we report on timing and resource characteristics, and evaluate its feasibility for real-time image processing applications. Our digital ONN-HAM solution can process images with up to 120x120 pixels (166 MHz system frequency) respecting real-time camera constraints. This work is the first to explore ONNs as hetero-associative memory for image processing applications. ",

While these two graph-theoretic concepts stem from the electric network on an undirected graph, they have a number of applications over not only that but also a wide variety of fields. In this paper, we propose a generalization of Kron reduction to directed graphs. Furthermore, we prove this reduction method preserves the structure of the original graphs such as strong connectivity or weight balancedness. Also, we generalize the effective resistance to directed graphs via Markov chain theory, which is invariant under Kron reduction. Although the effective resistance of our proposal is asymmetric, we prove that it induces the novel graph metric on strongly connected directed graphs. Finally, we compare our method with existing studies and prove that the hitting probability metric is the logarithm of the effective resistance in the stochastic case, and the effective resistance in the doubly stochastic case is the same with the resistance distance on ergodic Markov chain.

Unfortunately, most existing MIL algorithms focus on improving the performances of group label predictions and cannot be used to accurately predict instance labels. In this work, we propose the TargetedMIL algorithm, which learns semantically meaningful representations that can be interpreted as causal to the object of interest.

Recently, Graph Neural Network truly outperforms the traditional methods. Nevertheless, the most conventional GNN based model works well while given a pre-defined graph structure. And the existing methods of defining the graph structures focus purely on spatial dependencies and ignored the temporal correlation. Besides, the semantics of the static pre-defined graph adjacency applied during the whole training progress is always incomplete, thus overlooking the latent topologies that may fine-tune the model. To tackle these challenges, we proposed a new traffic forecasting framework--Spatio-Temporal Latent Graph Structure Learning networks (ST-LGSL). More specifically, the model employed a graph generator based on Multilayer perceptron and K-Nearest Neighbor, which learns the latent graph topological information from the entire data considering both spatial and temporal dynamics. Furthermore, with the initialization of MLP-kNN based on ground-truth adjacency matrix and similarity metric in kNN, ST-LGSL aggregates the topologies focusing on geography and node similarity. Additionally, the generated graphs act as the input of spatio-temporal prediction module combined with the Diffusion Graph Convolutions and Gated Temporal Convolutions Networks. Experimental results on two benchmarking datasets in real world demonstrate that ST-LGSL outperforms various types of state-of-art baselines. ",

The proposed methodology combines a multi-dimensional time series forecast and a novel approach to large-scale optimization. Gradient-boosting method is applied to forecast both generation and consumption time-series of the Monash university campus for the month of November 2020. For the consumption forecasts we employ log transformation to model trend and stabilize variance. Additional seasonality and trend features are added to the model inputs when applicable. The forecasts obtained are used as the base load for the schedule optimisation of university activities and battery usage. The goal of the optimisation is to minimize the electricity cost consisting of the price of electricity and the peak electricity tariff both altered by the load from class activities and battery use as well as the penalty of not scheduling some optional activities. The schedule of the class activities is obtained through evolutionary optimisation using the covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy and the genetic algorithm. This schedule is then improved through local search by testing possible times for each activity one-by-one. The battery schedule is formulated as a mixed-integer programming problem and solved by the Gurobi solver. This method obtains the second lowest cost when evaluated against 6 other methods presented at an IEEE competition that all used mixed-integer programming and the Gurobi solver to schedule both the activities and the battery use.

    "abstract": "Objective. Deep neural networks (DNN) have shown unprecedented success in various brain-machine interface (BCI) applications such as epileptic seizure prediction. However, existing approaches typically train models in a patient-specific fashion due to the highly personalized characteristics of epileptic signals. Therefore, only a limited number of labeled recordings from each subject can be used for training. As a consequence, current DNN based methods demonstrate poor generalization ability to some extent due to the insufficiency of training data. On the other hand, patient-independent models attempt to utilize more patient data to train a universal model for all patients by pooling patient data together. Despite different techniques applied, results show that patient-independent models perform worse than patient-specific models due to high individual variation across patients. A substantial gap thus exists between patient-specific and patient-independent models. In this paper, we propose a novel training scheme based on knowledge distillation which makes use of a large amount of data from multiple subjects. It first distills informative features from signals of all available subjects with a pre-trained general model. A patient-specific model can then be obtained with the help of distilled knowledge and additional personalized data. Significance. The proposed training scheme significantly improves the performance of patient-specific seizure predictors and bridges the gap between patient-specific and patient-independent predictors. Five state-of-the-art seizure prediction methods are trained on the CHB-MIT sEEG database with our proposed scheme. The resulting accuracy, sensitivity, and false prediction rate show that our proposed training scheme consistently improves the prediction performance of state-of-the-art methods by a large margin.

The agent's expectancy of reward, expressed as learned projections in the considered space, allows the neoRL agent to extract purposive behavior from the learned map according to the reward hypothesis. We explore this allegory further, considering neoRL modules as nodes in a network with desire as input and state-action Q-value as output; we see that action sets with Euclidean significance imply an interpretation of state-action vectors as Euclidean projections of desire. Autonomous desire from neoRL nodes within the agent allows for deeper neoRL behavioral graphs. Experiments confirm the effect of neoRL networks governed by autonomous desire, verifying the four principles for purposive networks. A neoRL agent governed by purposive networks can navigate Euclidean spaces in real-time while learning, exemplifying how modern AI still can profit from inspiration from early psychology. ",

In this paper, we present models for these two tasks as part of the SIMMC 2.0 Challenge (Kottur et al. 2021). Specifically, we use TOD-BERT and LXMERT based models, compare them to a number of baselines and provide ablation experiments. Our results show that (1) language models are able to exploit correlations in the data to detect ambiguity; and (2) unimodal coreference resolution models can avoid the need for a vision component, through the use of smart object representations.

    "abstract": "Despite numerous studies of deep autoencoders (AEs) for unsupervised anomaly detection, AEs still lack a way to express uncertainty in their predictions, crucial for ensuring safe and trustworthy machine learning systems in high-stake applications. Therefore, in this work, the formulation of Bayesian autoencoders (BAEs) is adopted to quantify the total anomaly uncertainty, comprising epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties. To evaluate the quality of uncertainty, we consider the task of classifying anomalies with the additional option of rejecting predictions of high uncertainty. In addition, we use the accuracy-rejection curve and propose the weighted average accuracy as a performance metric. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the BAE and total anomaly uncertainty on a set of benchmark datasets and two real datasets for manufacturing: one for condition monitoring, the other for quality inspection.

We call such automorphisms marking preserving, and we are in fact interested in the action of their group on the marked sets. While this problem is at least as hard as general graph isomorphism (i.e., GI-hard), we give an FPT-time algorithm with respect to the parameter equal to the largest number of marked sets incomparable by inclusion.

The Temporal Link Prediction task of WSDM Cup 2022 expects a single model that can work well on two kinds of temporal graphs simultaneously, which have quite different characteristics and data properties, to predict whether a link of a given type will occur between two given nodes within a given time span. Our team, named as nothing here, regards this task as a link prediction task in heterogeneous temporal networks and proposes a generic model, i.e., Heterogeneous Temporal Graph Network (HTGN), to solve such temporal link prediction task with the unfixed time intervals and the diverse link types. That is, HTGN can adapt to the heterogeneity of links and the prediction with unfixed time intervals within an arbitrary given time period. To train the model, we design a Bi-Time-Window training strategy (BTW) which has two kinds of mini-batches from two kinds of time windows. As a result, for the final test, we achieved an AUC of 0.662482 on dataset A, an AUC of 0.906923 on dataset B, and won 2nd place with an Average T-scores of 0.628942. ",

One example is Multivariate Exponential Smoothing Long Short-Term Memory (MES-LSTM), a hybrid between a multivariate statistical forecasting model and a Recurrent Neural Network variant, Long Short-Term Memory. It has also been shown that a model that ($i$) produces accurate forecasts and ($ii$) is able to quantify the associated predictive uncertainty satisfactorily, can be successfully adapted to a model suitable for anomaly detection tasks. With the increasing ubiquity of multivariate data and new application domains, there have been numerous anomaly detection methods proposed in recent years. The proposed methods have largely focused on deep learning techniques, which are prone to suffer from challenges such as ($i$) large sets of parameters that may be computationally intensive to tune, $(ii)$ returning too many false positives rendering the techniques impractical for use, $(iii)$ requiring labeled datasets for training which are often not prevalent in real life, and ($iv$) understanding of the root causes of anomaly occurrences inhibited by the predominantly black-box nature of deep learning methods. In this article, an extension of MES-LSTM is presented, an interpretable anomaly detection model that overcomes these challenges. With a focus on renewable energy generation as an application domain, the proposed approach is benchmarked against the state-of-the-art. The findings are that MES-LSTM anomaly detector is at least competitive to the benchmarks at anomaly detection tasks, and less prone to learning from spurious effects than the benchmarks, thus making it more reliable at root cause discovery and explanation.

Additionally, we introduce linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) to verify the necessary incremental input/output-to-state stability ($\\delta$-IOSS) detectability condition. We consider an MHE formulation with time-discounted quadratic objective for nonlinear systems admitting an exponential $\\delta$-IOSS Lyapunov function. We show that with a suitable parameterization of the MHE objective, the $\\delta$-IOSS Lyapunov function serves as an $M$-step Lyapunov function for MHE. Provided that the estimation horizon is chosen large enough, this directly implies exponential stability of MHE. The stability analysis is also applicable to full information estimation, where the restriction to exponential $\\delta$-IOSS can be relaxed. Moreover, we provide simple LMI conditions to systematically derive $\\delta$-IOSS Lyapunov functions, which allows us to easily verify $\\delta$-IOSS for a large class of nonlinear detectable systems. This is useful in the context of MHE in general, since most of the existing nonlinear (robust) stability results for MHE depend on the system being $\\delta$-IOSS (detectable). In combination, we thus provide sufficient conditions that directly provide a framework to design MHE schemes with guaranteed robust exponential stability. The applicability of the overall MHE design is demonstrated with a nonlinear chemical reactor process. ",

More specifically, the use of classical outlier detection techniques on features extracted by deep pre-trained neural networks have been shown to deliver remarkable performances on the MVTec Anomaly Detection (MVTec AD) dataset.

There exists to our knowledge no work studying these pre-trained methods under fully unsupervised setting. In this work, we first assess the robustness of these pre-trained methods to fully unsupervised context, using polluted training sets (i.e. containing defective samples), and show that these methods are more robust to pollution compared to methods such as CutPaste. We then propose SROC, a Simple Refinement strategy for One Class classification. SROC enables to remove most of the polluted images from the training set, and to recover some of the lost AUC. We further show that our simple heuristic competes with, and even outperforms much more complex strategies from the existing literature. ",

In particular, we show that this method solves the corresponding non-convex core-periphery optimization problem globally to an arbitrary precision. This method turns out to coincide with the computation of the Perron eigenvector of a nonlinear hypergraph operator, suitably defined in term of the incidence matrix of the hypergraph, generalizing recently proposed centrality models for hypergraphs.

Furthermore, doing so also has calibration benefits with respect to image-only methods. We benchmark on the public dataset KITTI, and in doing so, reveal a few small but common algorithmic mistakes currently used in computing metrics on that set, and offer efficient, provably correct alternatives.

Considering urban, suburban and rural scenarios as commonly-used network deployment models, we investigate the feasibility of the proposed model over them and provide guidance on the overall cloudlet facility installation over optical access network. We also study the percentage of incremental energy budget in the presence of cloudlets of the existing network.

To address this, we propose a Siamese network based on MobileNetV3-Large for an end-to-end relative camera pose regression independent of camera parameters. The proposed network uses pair of images taken at different locations in the same scene to estimate the 3D translation vector and rotation vector in unit quaternion. To increase the generality of the model, rather than training it for a single scene, data for four scenes are combined to train a single universal model to estimate the relative pose. Further for independency of hyperparameter weighing between translation and rotation loss is not used. Instead we use the novel two-stage training procedure to learn the balance implicitly with faster convergence. We compare the results obtained with the Cambridge Landmarks dataset, comprising of different scenes, with existing CNN-based regression methods as baselines, e.g., RPNet and RCPNet. The findings indicate that, when compared to RCPNet, proposed model improves the estimation of the translation vector by a percentage change of 16.11%, 28.88%, 52.27% on the Kings College, Old Hospital, St Marys Church scenes from Cambridge Landmarks dataset, respectively.

    "abstract": "Image attribution -- matching an image back to a trusted source -- is an emerging tool in the fight against online misinformation. Deep visual fingerprinting models have recently been explored for this purpose. However, they are not robust to tiny input perturbations known as adversarial examples. First we illustrate how to generate valid adversarial images that can easily cause incorrect image attribution. Then we describe an approach to prevent imperceptible adversarial attacks on deep visual fingerprinting models, via robust contrastive learning. The proposed training procedure leverages training on $\\ell_\\infty$-bounded adversarial examples, it is conceptually simple and incurs only a small computational overhead. The resulting models are substantially more robust, are accurate even on unperturbed images, and perform well even over a database with millions of images. In particular, we achieve 91.6% standard and 85.1% adversarial recall under $\\ell_\\infty$-bounded perturbations on manipulated images compared to 80.1% and 0.0% from prior work. We also show that robustness generalizes to other types of imperceptible perturbations unseen during training. Finally, we show how to train an adversarially robust image comparator model for detecting editorial changes in matched images. ",

We present a novel extension to the Dynamic-Window Approach (DWA-O) to account for a surface's navigability cost while computing robot trajectories. DWA-O also dynamically modulates the robot's acceleration limits based on the variation in the robot-terrain interactions. In terms of perception, our method learns to predict navigability costs in $\\sim 20$ minutes for five different surfaces, compared to 3-4 hours for previous scene segmentation methods and leads to a decrease in inference time.

    "abstract": "Recent advances in technology for hyper-realistic visual effects provoke the concern that deepfake videos of political speeches will soon be visually indistinguishable from authentic video recordings. Yet there exists little empirical research on how audio-visual information influences people's susceptibility to fall for political misinformation. The conventional wisdom in the field of communication research predicts that people will fall for fake news more often when the same version of a story is presented as a video as opposed to text. However, audio-visual manipulations often leave distortions that some but not all people may pick up on. Here, we evaluate how communication modalities influence people's ability to discern real political speeches from fabrications based on a randomized experiment with 5,727 participants who provide 61,792 truth discernment judgments. We show participants soundbites from political speeches that are randomly assigned to appear using permutations of text, audio, and video modalities. We find that communication modalities mediate discernment accuracy: participants are more accurate on video with audio than silent video, and more accurate on silent video than text transcripts. Likewise, we find participants rely more on how something is said (the audio-visual cues) rather than what is said (the speech content itself). However, political speeches that do not match public perceptions of politicians' beliefs reduce participants' reliance on visual cues. In particular, we find that reflective reasoning moderates the degree to which participants consider visual information: low performance on the Cognitive Reflection Test is associated with an underreliance on visual cues and an overreliance on what is said.

Here, we use these biological codes to show that a universal fault-tolerant neural network can be achieved if the faultiness of each neuron lies below a sharp threshold, which we find coincides in order of magnitude with noise observed in biological neurons.

    "abstract": "Children's automatic speech recognition (ASR) is always difficult due to, in part, the data scarcity problem, especially for kindergarten-aged kids. When data are scarce, the model might overfit to the training data, and hence good starting points for training are essential. Recently, meta-learning was proposed to learn model initialization (MI) for ASR tasks of different languages. This method leads to good performance when the model is adapted to an unseen language. However, MI is vulnerable to overfitting on training tasks (learner overfitting). It is also unknown whether MI generalizes to other low-resource tasks. In this paper, we validate the effectiveness of MI in children's ASR and attempt to alleviate the problem of learner overfitting. To achieve model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML), we regard children's speech at each age as a different task. In terms of learner overfitting, we propose a task-level augmentation method by simulating new ages using frequency warping techniques. Detailed experiments are conducted to show the impact of task augmentation on each age for kindergarten-aged speech. As a result, our approach achieves a relative word error rate (WER) improvement of 51% over the baseline system with no augmentation or initialization. ",

In Progressive GAN, which is the current state-of-the-art GAN for image augmentation, instead of training the GAN all at once, a new concept of progressing growing of Discriminator and Generator simultaneously, was proposed. Although the lower stages such as 4x4 and 8x8 train rather quickly, the later stages consume a tremendous amount of time which could take days to finish the model training. In our paper, we propose a novel pipeline that combines Progressive GAN with slight modifications and Super Resolution GAN. Super Resolution GAN up samples low-resolution images to high-resolution images which can prove to be a useful resource to reduce the training time exponentially. ",

    "abstract": "Battery energy storage system (BESS) can effectively mitigate the uncertainty of variable renewable generation. Degradation is un-preventable for batteries such as the most popular Lithium-ion battery (LiB). The main causes of LiB degradation are loss of Li-ions, loss of electrolyte, and increase of internal resistance which are hard to model and predict. In this paper, we propose a data driven method to predict the battery degradation per a given scheduled battery operational profile. Particularly, a neural net-work based battery degradation (NNBD) model is proposed to quantify the battery degradation with inputs of major battery degradation factors. When incorporating the proposed NNBD model into microgrid day-ahead scheduling (MDS), we can estab-lish a battery degradation based MDS (BDMDS) model that can consider the equivalent battery degradation cost precisely. Since the proposed NNBD model is highly non-linear and non-convex, BDMDS would be very hard to solve. To address this issue, a neural network and optimization decoupled heuristic (NNODH) algorithm is proposed in this paper to effectively solve this neural network embedded optimization problem. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed NNODH algorithm is able to ob-tain the optimal solution with lowest total cost including normal operation cost and battery degradation cost. ",

In particular, neural additive models (NAM) offer the interpretability to the black-box deep learning and achieve state-of-the-art accuracy among the large family of generalized additive models. In order to empower NAM with feature selection and improve the generalization, we propose the sparse neural additive models (SNAM) that employ the group sparsity regularization (e.g. Group LASSO), where each feature is learned by a sub-network whose trainable parameters are clustered as a group. We study the theoretical properties for SNAM with novel techniques to tackle the non-parametric truth, thus extending from classical sparse linear models such as the LASSO, which only works on the parametric truth. Specifically, we show that SNAM with subgradient and proximal gradient descents provably converges to zero training loss as $t\\to\\infty$, and that the estimation error of SNAM vanishes asymptotically as $n\\to\\infty$. We also prove that SNAM, similar to LASSO, can have exact support recovery, i.e. perfect feature selection, with appropriate regularization. Moreover, we show that the SNAM can generalize well and preserve the `identifiability', recovering each feature's effect. We validate our theories via extensive experiments and further testify to the good accuracy and efficiency of SNAM. ",

    "abstract": "Segmentation of curvilinear structures is important in many applications, such as retinal blood vessel segmentation for early detection of vessel diseases and pavement crack segmentation for road condition evaluation and maintenance. Currently, deep learning-based methods have achieved impressive performance on these tasks. Yet, most of them mainly focus on finding powerful deep architectures but ignore capturing the inherent curvilinear structure feature (e.g., the curvilinear structure is darker than the context) for a more robust representation. In consequence, the performance usually drops a lot on cross-datasets, which poses great challenges in practice. In this paper, we aim to improve the generalizability by introducing a novel local intensity order transformation (LIOT). Specifically, we transfer a gray-scale image into a contrast-invariant four-channel image based on the intensity order between each pixel and its nearby pixels along with the four (horizontal and vertical) directions. This results in a representation that preserves the inherent characteristic of the curvilinear structure while being robust to contrast changes. Cross-dataset evaluation on three retinal blood vessel segmentation datasets demonstrates that LIOT improves the generalizability of some state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, the cross-dataset evaluation between retinal blood vessel segmentation and pavement crack segmentation shows that LIOT is able to preserve the inherent characteristic of curvilinear structure with large appearance gaps.

To this end, this paper presents a novel heterogeneous stochastic variational linear model of coregionalization (HSVLMC) model for simultaneously learning the tasks with varied input domains. Particularly, we develop the stochastic variational framework with a Bayesian calibration method that (i) takes into account the effect of dimensionality reduction raised by domain mapping in order to achieve effective input alignment; and (ii) employs a residual modeling strategy to leverage the inductive bias brought by prior domain mappings for better model inference.

Given the heterogeneity of PD, it is challenging to classify early stages 1 and 2 and detect brain function alterations. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is a promising tool in revealing functional connectivity (FC) differences and developing biomarkers in PD. Some machine learning approaches like support vector machine and logistic regression have been successfully applied in the early diagnosis of PD using fMRI data, which outperform classifiers based on manually selected morphological features. However, the early-stage characterization in FC changes has not been fully investigated. Given the complexity and non-linearity of fMRI data, we propose the use of a long short-term memory (LSTM) network to characterize the early stages of PD. The study included 84 subjects (56 in stage 2 and 28 in stage 1) from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI), the largest available public PD dataset. Under a repeated 10-fold stratified cross-validation, the LSTM model reached an accuracy of 71.63%, 13.52% higher than the best traditional machine learning method, indicating significantly better robustness and accuracy compared with other machine learning classifiers. We used the learned LSTM model weights to select the top brain regions that contributed to model prediction and performed FC analyses to characterize functional changes with disease stage and motor impairment to gain better insight into the brain mechanisms of PD.

While much previous work has studied the economic characteristics of cities as a function of size and examined the exposure of urban economies to automation, this has often been from a static perspective. In this work we examine the structure of city job networks to uncover the diffusive properties.

More specifically, we use different network centrality measures to capture the role of early investments for the success of the firm. Our results, which are robust to different specifications, suggest that success has a strong positive association with centrality measures of the firm and of its large investors, and a weaker but still detectable association with centrality measures of small investors and features describing firms as knowledge bridges. Finally, based on our analyses, success is not associated with firms' and investors' spreading power (harmonic centrality), nor with the tightness of investors' community (clustering coefficient) and spreading ability (VoteRank).

    "title": "Learning to Schedule Heuristics for the Simultaneous Stochastic  Optimization of Mining Complexes",
    "abstract": "The simultaneous stochastic optimization of mining complexes (SSOMC) is a large-scale stochastic combinatorial optimization problem that simultaneously manages the extraction of materials from multiple mines and their processing using interconnected facilities to generate a set of final products, while taking into account material supply (geological) uncertainty to manage the associated risk. Although simulated annealing has been shown to outperform comparing methods for solving the SSOMC, early performance might dominate recent performance in that a combination of the heuristics' performance is used to determine which perturbations to apply. This work proposes a data-driven framework for heuristic scheduling in a fully self-managed hyper-heuristic to solve the SSOMC. The proposed learn-to-perturb (L2P) hyper-heuristic is a multi-neighborhood simulated annealing algorithm. The L2P selects the heuristic (perturbation) to be applied in a self-adaptive manner using reinforcement learning to efficiently explore which local search is best suited for a particular search point. Several state-of-the-art agents have been incorporated into L2P to better adapt the search and guide it towards better solutions. By learning from data describing the performance of the heuristics, a problem-specific ordering of heuristics that collectively finds better solutions faster is obtained. L2P is tested on several real-world mining complexes, with an emphasis on efficiency, robustness, and generalization capacity. Results show a reduction in the number of iterations by 30-50% and in the computational time by 30-45%. ",

    "title": "Combining Observational and Randomized Data for Estimating Heterogeneous  Treatment Effects",
    "abstract": "Estimating heterogeneous treatment effects is an important problem across many domains. In order to accurately estimate such treatment effects, one typically relies on data from observational studies or randomized experiments. Currently, most existing works rely exclusively on observational data, which is often confounded and, hence, yields biased estimates. While observational data is confounded, randomized data is unconfounded, but its sample size is usually too small to learn heterogeneous treatment effects. In this paper, we propose to estimate heterogeneous treatment effects by combining large amounts of observational data and small amounts of randomized data via representation learning. In particular, we introduce a two-step framework: first, we use observational data to learn a shared structure (in form of a representation); and then, we use randomized data to learn the data-specific structures. We analyze the finite sample properties of our framework and compare them to several natural baselines. As such, we derive conditions for when combining observational and randomized data is beneficial, and for when it is not. Based on this, we introduce a sample-efficient algorithm, called CorNet. We use extensive simulation studies to verify the theoretical properties of CorNet and multiple real-world datasets to demonstrate our method's superiority compared to existing methods. ",
