    "abstract": "Performance of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in image analysis tasks is often marred in the presence of acquisition-related distribution shifts between training and test images. Recently, it has been proposed to tackle this problem by fine-tuning trained CNNs for each test image. Such test-time-adaptation (TTA) is a promising and practical strategy for improving robustness to distribution shifts as it requires neither data sharing between institutions nor annotating additional data. Previous TTA methods use a helper model to increase similarity between outputs and/or features extracted from a test image with those of the training images. Such helpers, which are typically modeled using CNNs, can be task-specific and themselves vulnerable to distribution shifts in their inputs. To overcome these problems, we propose to carry out TTA by matching the feature distributions of test and training images, as modelled by a field-of-experts (FoE) prior. FoEs model complicated probability distributions as products of many simpler expert distributions. We use 1D marginal distributions of a trained task CNN's features as experts in the FoE model. Further, we compute principal components of patches of the task CNN's features, and consider the distributions of PCA loadings as additional experts. We validate the method on 5 MRI segmentation tasks (healthy tissues in 4 anatomical regions and lesions in 1 one anatomy), using data from 17 clinics, and on a MRI registration task, using data from 3 clinics. We find that the proposed FoE-based TTA is generically applicable in multiple tasks, and outperforms all previous TTA methods for lesion segmentation. For healthy tissue segmentation, the proposed method outperforms other task-agnostic methods, but a previous TTA method which is specifically designed for segmentation performs the best for most of the tested datasets. Our code is publicly available. ",

    "abstract": "We hypothesize that due to the greedy nature of learning in multi-modal deep neural networks, these models tend to rely on just one modality while under-fitting the other modalities. Such behavior is counter-intuitive and hurts the models' generalization, as we observe empirically. To estimate the model's dependence on each modality, we compute the gain on the accuracy when the model has access to it in addition to another modality. We refer to this gain as the conditional utilization rate. In the experiments, we consistently observe an imbalance in conditional utilization rates between modalities, across multiple tasks and architectures. Since conditional utilization rate cannot be computed efficiently during training, we introduce a proxy for it based on the pace at which the model learns from each modality, which we refer to as the conditional learning speed. We propose an algorithm to balance the conditional learning speeds between modalities during training and demonstrate that it indeed addresses the issue of greedy learning. The proposed algorithm improves the model's generalization on three datasets: Colored MNIST, Princeton ModelNet40, and NVIDIA Dynamic Hand Gesture. ",

We implement the proposed PVI extractor on both sequential approaches (long short-term memory (LSTM) models) and non-sequential approaches (convolutional models). We use the Waymo Open Dataset that contains real-world urban traffic scenes with both pedestrian and vehicle annotations. For the LSTM-based models, our proposed model is compared with Social-LSTM and Social-GAN, and using our proposed PVI extractor reduces the average displacement error (ADE) and the final displacement error (FDE) by 7.46% and 5.24%, respectively. For the convolutional-based models, our proposed model is compared with Social-STGCNN and Social-IWSTCNN, and using our proposed PVI extractor reduces the ADE and FDE by 2.10% and 1.27%, respectively. The results show that the pedestrian-vehicle interaction influences pedestrian behavior, and the models using the proposed PVI extractor can capture the interaction between pedestrians and vehicles, and thereby outperform the compared methods.

    "abstract": "In 1996, philosopher Helen Nissenbaum issued a clarion call concerning the erosion of accountability in society due to the ubiquitous delegation of consequential functions to computerized systems. Using the conceptual framing of moral blame, Nissenbaum described four types of barriers to accountability that computerization presented: 1) \"many hands,\" the problem of attributing moral responsibility for outcomes caused by many moral actors; 2) \"bugs,\" a way software developers might shrug off responsibility by suggesting software errors are unavoidable; 3) \"computer as scapegoat,\" shifting blame to computer systems as if they were moral actors; and 4) \"ownership without liability,\" a free pass to the tech industry to deny responsibility for the software they produce. We revisit these four barriers in relation to the recent ascendance of data-driven algorithmic systems--technology often folded under the heading of machine learning (ML) or artificial intelligence (AI)--to uncover the new challenges for accountability that these systems present. We then look ahead to how one might construct and justify a moral, relational framework for holding responsible parties accountable, and argue that the FAccT community is uniquely well-positioned to develop such a framework to weaken the four barriers.

Unfortunately, the focus is mostly on manipulating only the very high-level features associated with the last layers. In this work, we look at neural network architectures for classification in a more general way and introduce an algorithm which defines before the training the paths of the network through which the per-class information flows. We show that using our algorithm we can extract a lighter single-purpose binary classifier for a particular class by removing the parameters that do not participate in the predefined information path of that class, which is approximately 60% of the total parameters. Notably, leveraging coding theory to design the information paths enables us to use intermediate network layers for making early predictions without having to evaluate the full network. We demonstrate that a slightly modified ResNeXt model, trained with our algorithm, can achieve higher classification accuracy on CIFAR-10/100 and ImageNet than the original ResNeXt, while having all the aforementioned properties.

In this paper, we interpret this approach from a game theoretical perspective. Defining optimal solutions in domain-adversarial training as a local Nash equilibrium, we show that gradient descent in domain-adversarial training can violate the asymptotic convergence guarantees of the optimizer, oftentimes hindering the transfer performance. Our analysis leads us to replace gradient descent with high-order ODE solvers (i.e., Runge-Kutta), for which we derive asymptotic convergence guarantees. This family of optimizers is significantly more stable and allows more aggressive learning rates, leading to high performance gains when used as a drop-in replacement over standard optimizers. Our experiments show that in conjunction with state-of-the-art domain-adversarial methods, we achieve up to 3.5% improvement with less than of half training iterations. Our optimizers are easy to implement, free of additional parameters, and can be plugged into any domain-adversarial framework. ",

The present thesis first develops principled methods to make generic machine learning models robust against distributional uncertainties and adversarial data. Particular focus will be on parametric models where some training data are being used to learn a parametric model. The developed framework is of high interest especially when training and testing data are drawn from \"slightly\" different distribution. We then introduce distributionally robust learning frameworks to minimize the worst-case expected loss over a prescribed ambiguity set of training distributions quantified via Wasserstein distance. Later, we build on this robust framework to design robust semi-supervised learning over graph methods. The second part of this thesis aspires to fully unleash the potential of next-generation wired and wireless networks, where we design \"smart\" network entities using (deep) reinforcement learning approaches. Finally, this thesis enhances the power system operation and control. Our contribution is on sustainable distribution grids with high penetration of renewable sources and demand response programs. To account for unanticipated and rapidly changing renewable generation and load consumption scenarios, we specifically delegate reactive power compensation to both utility-owned control devices (e.g., capacitor banks), as well as smart inverters of distributed generation units with cyber-capabilities.

Existing methods often suffer from low efficiency because the target phases are added to the entire audio sample, resulting in high demand for computational resources. This paper proposes a novel scheme named FAAG as an iterative optimization-based method to generate targeted adversarial examples quickly. By injecting the noise over the beginning part of the audio, FAAG generates adversarial audio in high quality with a high success rate timely. Specifically, we use audio's logits output to map each character in the transcription to an approximate position of the audio's frame. Thus, an adversarial example can be generated by FAAG in approximately two minutes using CPUs only and around ten seconds with one GPU while maintaining an average success rate over 85%. Specifically, the FAAG method can speed up around 60% compared with the baseline method during the adversarial example generation process. Furthermore, we found that appending benign audio to any suspicious examples can effectively defend against the targeted adversarial attack. We hope that this work paves the way for inventing new adversarial attacks against speech recognition with computational constraints. ",

The learner has access to a family of weight functions such that the test distribution is a reweighting of the training distribution under one of these functions, a setting typically studied under the name of Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO). We consider the problem of deriving regret bounds in the classical learning theory setting, and require that the resulting regret bounds hold uniformly for all potential test distributions. We show that the DRO formulation does not guarantee uniformly small regret under distribution shift. We instead propose an alternative method called Minimax Regret Optimization (MRO), and show that under suitable conditions this method achieves uniformly low regret across all test distributions. We also adapt our technique to have stronger guarantees when the test distributions are heterogeneous in their similarity to the training data. Given the widespead optimization of worst case risks in current approaches to robust machine learning, we believe that MRO can be a strong alternative to address distribution shift scenarios. ",

    "abstract": "Despite recent developments in using the invariance principle from causality to enable out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization on Euclidean data, e.g., images, studies on graph data are limited. Different from images, the complex nature of graphs poses unique challenges that thwart the adoption of the invariance principle for OOD generalization. In particular, distribution shifts on graphs can happen at both structure-level and attribute-level, which increases the difficulty of capturing the invariance. Moreover, domain or environment partitions, which are often required by OOD methods developed on Euclidean data, can be expensive to obtain for graphs. Aiming to bridge this gap, we characterize distribution shifts on graphs with causal models, and show that the OOD generalization on graphs with invariance principle is possible by identifying an invariant subgraph for making predictions. We propose a novel framework to explicitly model this process using a contrastive strategy. By contrasting the estimated invariant subgraphs, our framework can provably identify the underlying invariant subgraph under mild assumptions. Experiments across several synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the state-of-the-art OOD generalization ability of our method. ",

Slice Admission Control (SAC) algorithm is a necessity for Slice Providers (SPs) to guarantee the QoS of each admitted request. Except for resource restrictions, more factors need to be considered in the sliced environment during the admission process, such as priority and fairness. The former relates to the innate characteristics of different services, while the latter matters because slices are instantiated on the shared physical equipments. In this paper, we investigate the SAC problem in 5G/B5G networks, taking priority and fairness into account simultaneously. Reinterpretation of the two intuitively conflicting concepts are proposed in advance to cope with this special scenario, then an online SAC algorithm called Prioritized Slice Admission Control Considering Fairness, PSACCF in short, is designed to help maintaining priority and achieving an adjustable degree of fairness under the assumption of rational service subscribers. Numerous simulations are carried out and the results show that PSACCF can effectively enhance the fairness indicator without compromising the priority requirement, and exhibits stronger stability and adaptability over existing policies.

Deep learning ROM (DL-ROM) using deep-convolutional autoencoders (DC-AE) has been shown to capture nonlinear solution manifolds but fails to perform adequately when linear subspace approaches such as proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) would be optimal. Besides, most DL-ROM models rely on convolutional layers, which might limit its application to only a structured mesh. The proposed framework in this study relies on the combination of an autoencoder (AE) and Barlow Twins (BT) self-supervised learning, where BT maximizes the information content of the embedding with the latent space through a joint embedding architecture. Through a series of benchmark problems of natural convection in porous media, BT-AE performs better than the previous DL-ROM framework by providing comparable results to POD-based approaches for problems where the solution lies within a linear subspace as well as DL-ROM autoencoder-based techniques where the solution lies on a nonlinear manifold; consequently, bridges the gap between linear and nonlinear reduced manifolds. Furthermore, this BT-AE framework can operate on unstructured meshes, which provides flexibility in its application to standard numerical solvers, on-site measurements, experimental data, or a combination of these sources.

Unlike sketch-based image retrieval (SBIR), the main aim of ZSSBIR is to retrieve natural images given free hand-drawn sketches that may not appear during training. Previous approaches used semantic aligned sketch-image pairs or utilized memory expensive fusion layer for projecting the visual information to a low dimensional subspace, which ignores the significant heterogeneous cross-domain discrepancy between highly abstract sketch and relevant image. This may yield poor performance in the training phase. To tackle this issue and overcome this drawback, we propose a Wasserstein distance based cross-modal semantic network (WAD-CMSN) for ZSSBIR. Specifically, it first projects the visual information of each branch (sketch, image) to a common low dimensional semantic subspace via Wasserstein distance in an adversarial training manner. Furthermore, identity matching loss is employed to select useful features, which can not only capture complete semantic knowledge, but also alleviate the over-fitting phenomenon caused by the WAD-CMSN model. Experimental results on the challenging Sketchy (Extended) and TU-Berlin (Extended) datasets indicate the effectiveness of the proposed WAD-CMSN model over several competitors. ",

Since the generation of the model needs to extract the effective information of the training data, the model has the risk of leaking the privacy of the training data. Membership inference attacks can measure the model leakage of source data to a certain degree. In this paper, we design a privacy-preserving generative framework against membership inference attacks, through the information extraction and data generation capabilities of the generative model variational autoencoder (VAE) to generate synthetic data that meets the needs of differential privacy. Instead of adding noise to the model output or tampering with the training process of the target model, we directly process the original data. We first map the source data to the latent space through the VAE model to get the latent code, then perform noise process satisfying metric privacy on the latent code, and finally use the VAE model to reconstruct the synthetic data. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates that the machine learning model trained with newly generated synthetic data can effectively resist membership inference attacks and still maintain high utility.

In this paper, we investigate this phenomenon under the clean-label setting (i.e., attackers do not have complete control over the training or labeling process). Empirically, we show that existing backdoor attacks in malware classifiers are still detectable by recent defenses such as MNTD. To improve stealthiness, we propose a new attack, Jigsaw Puzzle (JP), based on the key observation that malware authors have little to no incentive to protect any other authors' malware but their own. As such, Jigsaw Puzzle learns a trigger to complement the latent patterns of the malware author's samples, and activates the backdoor only when the trigger and the latent pattern are pieced together in a sample. We further focus on realizable triggers in the problem space (e.g., software code) using bytecode gadgets broadly harvested from benign software. Our evaluation confirms that Jigsaw Puzzle is effective as a backdoor, remains stealthy against state-of-the-art defenses, and is a threat in realistic settings that depart from reasoning about feature-space only attacks. We conclude by exploring promising approaches to improve backdoor defenses. ",

    "abstract": "Adversarial training (AT) and its variants are the most effective approaches for obtaining adversarially robust models. A unique characteristic of AT is that an inner maximization problem needs to be solved repeatedly before the model weights can be updated, which makes the training slow. FGSM AT significantly improves its efficiency but it fails when the step size grows. The SOTA GradAlign makes FGSM AT compatible with a higher step size, however, its regularization on input gradient makes it 3 to 4 times slower than FGSM AT. Our proposed NoiseAug removes the extra computation overhead by directly regularizing on the input itself. The key contribution of this work lies in an empirical finding that single-step FGSM AT is not as hard as suggested in the past line of work: noise augmentation is all you need for (FGSM) fast AT. Towards understanding the success of our NoiseAug, we perform an extensive analysis and find that mitigating Catastrophic Overfitting (CO) and Robust Overfitting (RO) need different augmentations. Instead of more samples caused by data augmentation, we identify what makes NoiseAug effective for preventing CO might lie in its improved local linearity. ",

    "abstract": "Imitation learning is employed to learn sensorimotor coordination for steering angle prediction in an end-to-end fashion requires expert demonstrations. These expert demonstrations are paired with environmental perception and vehicle control data. The conventional frame-based RGB camera is the most common exteroceptive sensor modality used to acquire the environmental perception data. The frame-based RGB camera has produced promising results when used as a single modality in learning end-to-end lateral control. However, the conventional frame-based RGB camera has limited operability in illumination variation conditions and is affected by the motion blur. The event camera provides complementary information to the frame-based RGB camera. This work explores the fusion of frame-based RGB and event data for learning end-to-end lateral control by predicting steering angle. In addition, how the representation from event data fuse with frame-based RGB data helps to predict the lateral control robustly for the autonomous vehicle. To this end, we propose DRFuser, a novel convolutional encoder-decoder architecture for learning end-to-end lateral control. The encoder module is branched between the frame-based RGB data and event data along with the self-attention layers. Moreover, this study has also contributed to our own collected dataset comprised of event, frame-based RGB, and vehicle control data. The efficacy of the proposed method is experimentally evaluated on our collected dataset, Davis Driving dataset (DDD), and Carla Eventscape dataset. The experimental results illustrate that the proposed method DRFuser outperforms the state-of-the-art in terms of root-mean-square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) used as evaluation metrics.

Specifically, we discover implicit bias in terms of support vectors in ReLU networks, which play a key role in why and how ReLU networks generalize well. Moreover, we analyze gradient flows with respect to the magnitude of the norm of initialization, and show the impact of the norm in gradient dynamics.

Existing efforts in graph anomaly detection typically only consider the information in a single scale (view), thus inevitably limiting their capability in capturing anomalous patterns in complex graph data. To address this limitation, we propose a novel framework, graph ANomaly dEtection framework with Multi-scale cONtrastive lEarning (ANEMONE in short). By using a graph neural network as a backbone to encode the information from multiple graph scales (views), we learn better representation for nodes in a graph. In maximizing the agreements between instances at both the patch and context levels concurrently, we estimate the anomaly score of each node with a statistical anomaly estimator according to the degree of agreement from multiple perspectives. To further exploit a handful of ground-truth anomalies (few-shot anomalies) that may be collected in real-life applications, we further propose an extended algorithm, ANEMONE-FS, to integrate valuable information in our method. We conduct extensive experiments under purely unsupervised settings and few-shot anomaly detection settings, and we demonstrate that the proposed method ANEMONE and its variant ANEMONE-FS consistently outperform state-of-the-art algorithms on six benchmark datasets.

This task faces some critical challenges that current deep learning approaches do not address. The design of current approaches do not take into consideration the fact that networking hardware (e.g., routers) often runs with limited computational resources. Further, they do not meet the need for faithful explainability highlighted by regulatory bodies. Finally, these traffic classifiers are evaluated on small datasets which fail to reflect the diversity of applications in real commercial settings. Therefore, this paper introduces a Lightweight, Efficient and eXplainable-by-design convolutional neural network (LEXNet) for Internet traffic classification, which relies on a new residual block (for lightweight and efficiency purposes) and prototype layer (for explainability). Based on a commercial-grade dataset, our evaluation shows that LEXNet succeeds to maintain the same accuracy as the best performing state-of-the-art neural network, while providing the additional features previously mentioned. Moreover, we demonstrate that LEXNet significantly reduces the model size and inference time compared to the state-of-the-art neural networks with explainability-by-design and post hoc explainability methods. Finally, we illustrate the explainability feature of our approach, which stems from the communication of detected application prototypes to the end-user, and we highlight the faithfulness of LEXNet explanations through a comparison with post hoc methods.

The proposed method uses an unsupervised learning technique to overcome the issues with finding large volumes of labelled training data. Experimental results show that without hyperparameter optimisation, using Capsules significantly reduces overfitting and improves the training efficiency. Additionally, results also show that the branched input models can learn multivariate data more consistently with or without Capsules in comparison to the non-branched input models.

    "abstract": "Massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) is believed to deliver unrepresented spectral efficiency gains for 5G and beyond. However, a practical challenge arises during its commercial deployment, which is known as the \"curse of mobility\". The performance of massive MIMO drops alarmingly when the velocity level of user increases. In this paper, we tackle the problem in frequency division duplex (FDD) massive MIMO with a novel Channel State Information (CSI) acquisition framework. A joint angle-delay-Doppler (JADD) wideband beamformer is proposed for channel training. Our idea consists in the exploitation of the partial channel reciprocity of FDD and the angle-delay-Doppler channel structure. More precisely, the base station (BS) estimates the angle-delay-Doppler information of the UL channel based on UL pilots using Matrix Pencil method. It then computes the wideband JADD beamformers according to the extracted parameters. Afterwards, the user estimates and feeds back some scalar coefficients for the BS to reconstruct the predicted DL channel. Asymptotic analysis shows that the CSI prediction error converges to zero when the number of BS antennas and the bandwidth increases. Numerical results with industrial channel model demonstrate that our framework can well adapt to high speed (350 km/h), large CSI delay (10 ms) and channel sample noise. ",

Recent neural approaches automate individual components but the corresponding latent representations cannot provide artists explicit controls as in conventional tools. In this paper, we present a new learning-based, video-driven approach for generating dynamic facial geometries with high-quality physically-based assets. Two key components are well-structured latent spaces due to dense temporal samplings from videos and explicit facial expression controls to regulate the latent spaces. For data collection, we construct a hybrid multiview-photometric capture stage, coupling with an ultra-fast video camera to obtain raw 3D facial assets. We then model the facial expression, geometry and physically-based textures using separate VAEs with a global MLP-based expression mapping across the latent spaces, to preserve characteristics across respective attributes while maintaining explicit controls over geometry and texture. We also introduce to model the delta information as wrinkle maps for physically-base textures, achieving high-quality rendering of dynamic textures. We demonstrate our approach in high-fidelity performer-specific facial capture and cross-identity facial motion retargeting. In addition, our neural asset along with fast adaptation schemes can also be deployed to handle in-the-wild videos. Besides, we motivate the utility of our explicit facial disentangle strategy by providing promising physically-based editing results like geometry and material editing or winkle transfer with high realism. Comprehensive experiments show that our technique provides higher accuracy and visual fidelity than previous video-driven facial reconstruction and animation methods. ",

    "abstract": "Modern deep neural networks can easily overfit to biased training data containing corrupted labels or class imbalance. Sample re-weighting methods are popularly used to alleviate this data bias issue. Most current methods, however, require to manually pre-specify the weighting schemes as well as their additional hyper-parameters relying on the characteristics of the investigated problem and training data. This makes them fairly hard to be generally applied in practical scenarios, due to their significant complexities and inter-class variations of data bias situations. To address this issue, we propose a meta-model capable of adaptively learning an explicit weighting scheme directly from data. Specifically, by seeing each training class as a separate learning task, our method aims to extract an explicit weighting function with sample loss and task/class feature as input, and sample weight as output, expecting to impose adaptively varying weighting schemes to different sample classes based on their own intrinsic bias characteristics. Synthetic and real data experiments substantiate the capability of our method on achieving proper weighting schemes in various data bias cases, like the class imbalance, feature-independent and dependent label noise scenarios, and more complicated bias scenarios beyond conventional cases. Besides, the task-transferability of the learned weighting scheme is also substantiated, by readily deploying the weighting function learned on relatively smaller-scale CIFAR-10 dataset on much larger-scale full WebVision dataset. A performance gain can be readily achieved compared with previous SOAT ones without additional hyper-parameter tuning and meta gradient descent step. The general availability of our method for multiple robust deep learning issues, including partial-label learning, semi-supervised learning and selective classification, has also been validated. ",

Since virtual network mapping is an NP-hard problem, a lot of research has focused on the evolutionary algorithm's masterpiece genetic algorithm. However, the parameter setting in the traditional method is too dependent on experience, and its low flexibility makes it unable to adapt to increasingly complex network environments. In addition, link-mapping strategies that do not consider load balancing can easily cause link blocking in high-traffic environments. In the IoT environment involving medical, disaster relief, life support and other equipment, network performance and stability are particularly important. Therefore, how to provide a more flexible virtual network mapping service in a heterogeneous network environment with large traffic is an urgent problem. Aiming at this problem, a virtual network mapping strategy based on hybrid genetic algorithm is proposed. This strategy uses a dynamically calculated cross-probability and pheromone-based mutation gene selection strategy to improve the flexibility of the algorithm. In addition, a weight update mechanism based on load balancing is introduced to reduce the probability of mapping failure while balancing the load. Simulation results show that the proposed method performs well in a number of performance metrics including mapping average quotation, link load balancing, mapping cost-benefit ratio, acceptance rate and running time.

GCN-based KGC models first use GCNs to generate expressive entity representations and then use knowledge graph embedding (KGE) models to capture the interactions among entities and relations. However, many GCN-based KGC models fail to outperform state-of-the-art KGE models though introducing additional computational complexity. This phenomenon motivates us to explore the real effect of GCNs in KGC. Therefore, in this paper, we build upon representative GCN-based KGC models and introduce variants to find which factor of GCNs is critical in KGC. Surprisingly, we observe from experiments that the graph structure modeling in GCNs does not have a significant impact on the performance of KGC models, which is in contrast to the common belief. Instead, the transformations for entity representations are responsible for the performance improvements. Based on the observation, we propose a simple yet effective framework named LTE-KGE, which equips existing KGE models with linearly transformed entity embeddings. Experiments demonstrate that LTE-KGE models lead to similar performance improvements with GCN-based KGC methods, while being more computationally efficient. These results suggest that existing GCNs are unnecessary for KGC, and novel GCN-based KGC models should count on more ablation studies to validate their effectiveness.

    "abstract": "Detecting deepfakes is an important problem, but recent work has shown that DNN-based deepfake detectors are brittle against adversarial deepfakes, in which an adversary adds imperceptible perturbations to a deepfake to evade detection. In this work, we show that a modification to the detection strategy in which we replace a single classifier with a carefully chosen ensemble, in which input transformations for each model in the ensemble induces pairwise orthogonal gradients, can significantly improve robustness beyond the de facto solution of adversarial training. We present theoretical results to show that such orthogonal gradients can help thwart a first-order adversary by reducing the dimensionality of the input subspace in which adversarial deepfakes lie. We validate the results empirically by instantiating and evaluating a randomized version of such \"orthogonal\" ensembles for adversarial deepfake detection and find that these randomized ensembles exhibit significantly higher robustness as deepfake detectors compared to state-of-the-art deepfake detectors against adversarial deepfakes, even those created using strong PGD-500 attacks.

Furthermore, our tool is equipped with the state of the art object-centric process mining techniques.

    "abstract": "Modern production data processing and machine learning pipelines on the cloud are critical components for many cloud-based companies. These pipelines are typically composed of complex workflows represented by directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). Cloud environments are attractive to these workflows due to the wide range of choice with heterogeneous instances and prices that can provide the flexibility for different cost-performance needs. However, this flexibility also leads to the complexity of selecting the right resource configuration (e.g., instance type, resource demands) for each task in the DAG, while simultaneously scheduling the tasks with the selected resources to reach the optimal end-to-end performance and cost. These two decisions are often codependent resulting in an NP-hard scheduling optimization bottleneck. Existing solutions only focus solely on either problem and ignore the co-effect on the end-to-end optimum. We propose AGORA, a scheduler that considers both task-level resource allocation and execution for DAG workflows as a whole in heterogeneous cloud environments. AGORA first (1) studies the characteristics of the tasks from prior runs and gives predictions on resource configurations, and (2) automatically finds the best configuration with its corresponding schedules for the entire workflow with a cost-performance objective. We evaluate AGORA in a heterogeneous Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud environment with multi-tenant workflows served by Airflow and demonstrate a performance improvement up to 45% and cost reduction up to 77% compared to state-of-the-art schedulers. In addition, we apply AGORA to a real-world production trace from Alibaba and show cost reduction of 65% and DAG completion time reduction of 57%. ",

Protection mechanisms in digital audio processing tools have not eliminated the need of production entities located downstream the distribution chain to assess audio quality and detect defects inserted further upstream. Such analysis often relies on the received audio and scarce meta-data alone. Deliberate use of artefacts such as clicks in popular music as well as more recent defects stemming from corruption in modern audio encodings call for data-centric and context sensitive solutions for detection. We present a convolutional network architecture following end-to-end encoder decoder configuration to develop detectors for two exemplary audio defects. A click detector is trained and compared to a traditional signal processing method, with a discussion on context sensitivity. Additional post-processing is used for data augmentation and workflow simulation. The ability of our models to capture variance is explored in a detector for artefacts from decompression of corrupted MP3 compressed audio. For both tasks we describe the synthetic generation of artefacts for controlled detector training and evaluation. We evaluate our detectors on the large open-source Free Music Archive (FMA) and genre-specific datasets. ",

In recent work, it has been shown that adversarial attacks, such as FAKEBOB, can work effectively against speaker verification systems. The goal of this paper is to design a detector that can distinguish an original audio from an audio contaminated by adversarial attacks. Specifically, our designed detector, called MEH-FEST, calculates the minimum energy in high frequencies from the short-time Fourier transform of an audio and uses it as a detection metric. Through both analysis and experiments, we show that our proposed detector is easy to implement, fast to process an input audio, and effective in determining whether an audio is corrupted by FAKEBOB attacks. The experimental results indicate that the detector is extremely effective: with near zero false positive and false negative rates for detecting FAKEBOB attacks in Gaussian mixture model (GMM) and i-vector speaker verification systems. Moreover, adaptive adversarial attacks against our proposed detector and their countermeasures are discussed and studied, showing the game between attackers and defenders. ",

It is traditionally measured in a clinical setting and requires a labor-intensive labeling process. We hypothesize that it is possible to perform robust 4-class sleep staging using the raw photoplethysmography (PPG) time series and modern advances in deep learning (DL). Methods: We used two publicly available sleep databases that included raw PPG recordings, totalling 2,374 patients and 23,055 hours. We developed SleepPPG-Net, a DL model for 4-class sleep staging from the raw PPG time series. SleepPPG-Net was trained end-to-end and consists of a residual convolutional network for automatic feature extraction and a temporal convolutional network to capture long-range contextual information. We benchmarked the performance of SleepPPG-Net against models based on the best-reported state-of-the-art (SOTA) algorithms. Results: When benchmarked on a held-out test set, SleepPPG-Net obtained a median Cohen's Kappa ($\\kappa$) score of 0.75 against 0.69 for the best SOTA approach. SleepPPG-Net showed good generalization performance to an external database, obtaining a $\\kappa$ score of 0.74 after transfer learning. Perspective: Overall, SleepPPG-Net provides new SOTA performance. In addition, performance is high enough to open the path to the development of wearables that meet the requirements for usage in clinical applications such as the diagnosis and monitoring of obstructive sleep apnea.

These perturbations are applied to random words in random sentences to defend NLP models against adversarial attacks. Our Random Perturbations Defense and Increased Randomness Defense methods are successful in returning attacked models to similar accuracy of models before attacks. The original accuracy of the model used in this work is 80% for sentiment classification. After undergoing attacks, the accuracy drops to accuracy between 0% and 44%. After applying our defense methods, the accuracy of the model is returned to the original accuracy within statistical significance. ",

In this work, we address this shortcoming by developing metrics that meaningfully capture the threat of reconstructed face images. Using end-to-end experiments and user studies, we show that reconstructed face images enable re-identification by both commercial facial recognition systems and humans, at a rate that is at worst, a factor of four times higher than randomized baselines.

The NODE is treated as an isolated entity describing the full network as opposed to earlier research, which embedded it between pre- and post-appended layers trained by conventional methods. The proposed parameter reconstruction is done for a general first order differential equation by minimizing a cost functional covering a variety of loss functions and penalty terms. A nonlinear conjugate gradient method (NCG) is derived for the minimization. Mathematical properties are stated for the differential equation and the cost functional. The adjoint problem needed is derived together with a sensitivity problem. The sensitivity problem can estimate changes in the network output under perturbation of the trained parameters. To preserve smoothness during the iterations the Sobolev gradient is calculated and incorporated. As a proof-of-concept, numerical results are included for a NODE and two synthetic datasets, and compared with standard gradient approaches (not based on NODEs). The results show that the proposed method works well for deep learning with infinite numbers of layers, and has built-in stability and smoothness. ",

In many applications, the two datasets will likely follow different distributions, but both may be close to the test distribution. We introduce the problem of building a predictor which minimizes the maximum loss over all probability distributions over the original features, auxiliary features, and binary labels, whose Wasserstein distance is $r_1$ away from the empirical distribution over the labeled dataset and $r_2$ away from that of the unlabeled dataset.

However, this dual formulation offers a possibility of directly visualizing how an NN makes use of training patterns at test time, by examining the corresponding attention weights. We conduct experiments on small scale supervised image classification tasks in single-task, multi-task, and continual learning settings, as well as language modelling, and discuss potentials and limits of this view for better understanding and interpreting how NNs exploit training patterns.

    "abstract": "Representation learning that leverages large-scale labelled datasets, is central to recent progress in machine learning. Access to task relevant labels at scale is often scarce or expensive, motivating the need to learn from unlabelled datasets with self-supervised learning (SSL). Such large unlabelled datasets (with data augmentations) often provide a good coverage of the underlying input distribution. However evaluating the representations learned by SSL algorithms still requires task-specific labelled samples in the training pipeline. Additionally, the generalization of task-specific encoding is often sensitive to potential distribution shift. Inspired by recent advances in theoretical machine learning and vision neuroscience, we observe that the eigenspectrum of the empirical feature covariance matrix often follows a power law. For visual representations, we estimate the coefficient of the power law, $\\alpha$, across three key attributes which influence representation learning: learning objective (supervised, SimCLR, Barlow Twins and BYOL), network architecture (VGG, ResNet and Vision Transformer), and tasks (object and scene recognition). We observe that under mild conditions, proximity of $\\alpha$ to 1, is strongly correlated to the downstream generalization performance. Furthermore, $\\alpha \\approx 1$ is a strong indicator of robustness to label noise during fine-tuning. Notably, $\\alpha$ is computable from the representations without knowledge of any labels, thereby offering a framework to evaluate the quality of representations in unlabelled datasets. ",

We investigate the spin-polarized homogeneous electron gas and demonstrate that the same neural network architecture is capable of accurately representing both the delocalized Fermi liquid state and the localized Wigner crystal state. The network is given no \\emph{a priori} knowledge that a phase transition exists, but converges on the translationally invariant ground state at high density and spontaneously breaks the symmetry to produce the crystalline ground state at low density.

    "abstract": "MRI-guidance techniques that dynamically adapt radiation beams to follow tumor motion in real-time will lead to more accurate cancer treatments and reduced collateral healthy tissue damage. The gold-standard for reconstruction of undersampled MR data is compressed sensing (CS) which is computationally slow and limits the rate that images can be available for real-time adaptation. Here, we demonstrate the use of automated transform by manifold approximation (AUTOMAP), a generalized framework that maps raw MR signal to the target image domain, to rapidly reconstruct images from undersampled radial k-space data. The AUTOMAP neural network was trained to reconstruct images from a golden-angle radial acquisition, a benchmark for motion-sensitive imaging, on lung cancer patient data and generic images from ImageNet. Model training was subsequently augmented with motion-encoded k-space data derived from videos in the YouTube-8M dataset to encourage motion robust reconstruction. We find that AUTOMAP-reconstructed radial k-space has equivalent accuracy to CS but with much shorter processing times after initial fine-tuning on retrospectively acquired lung cancer patient data. Validation of motion-trained models with a virtual dynamic lung tumor phantom showed that the generalized motion properties learned from YouTube lead to improved target tracking accuracy. Our work shows that AUTOMAP can achieve real-time, accurate reconstruction of radial data. These findings imply that neural-network-based reconstruction is potentially superior to existing approaches for real-time image guidance applications. ",

    "abstract": "Tomographic imaging is in general an ill-posed inverse problem. Typically, a single regularized image estimate of the sought-after object is obtained from tomographic measurements. However, there may be multiple objects that are all consistent with the same measurement data. The ability to generate such alternate solutions is important because it may enable new assessments of imaging systems. In principle, this can be achieved by means of posterior sampling methods. In recent years, deep neural networks have been employed for posterior sampling with promising results. However, such methods are not yet for use with large-scale tomographic imaging applications. On the other hand, empirical sampling methods may be computationally feasible for large-scale imaging systems and enable uncertainty quantification for practical applications. Empirical sampling involves solving a regularized inverse problem within a stochastic optimization framework in order to obtain alternate data-consistent solutions. In this work, we propose a new empirical sampling method that computes multiple solutions of a tomographic inverse problem that are consistent with the same acquired measurement data. The method operates by repeatedly solving an optimization problem in the latent space of a style-based generative adversarial network (StyleGAN), and was inspired by the Photo Upsampling via Latent Space Exploration (PULSE) method that was developed for super-resolution tasks. The proposed method is demonstrated and analyzed via numerical studies that involve two stylized tomographic imaging modalities. These studies establish the ability of the method to perform efficient empirical sampling and uncertainty quantification. ",

No non-trivial lower bound was known. This is the first explicit example of a graph family with bounded maximum degree and unbounded stack-number. The main tool used in our proof of the lower bound is the topological overlap theorem of Gromov. We actually prove a stronger result in terms of so-called triangulations of Cartesian products. We conclude that triangulations of three-dimensional Cartesian products of any sufficiently large connected graphs have large stack-number. The upper bound is a special case of a more general construction based on families of permutations derived from Hadamard matrices. The strong product of three paths is also the first example of a bounded degree graph with bounded queue-number and unbounded stack-number. A natural question that follows from our result is to determine the smallest $\\Delta_0$ such that there exist a graph family with unbounded stack-number, bounded queue-number and maximum degree $\\Delta_0$.

One of the challenges for background subtraction methods is dynamic background, which constitute stochastic movements in some parts of the background. In this paper, we have proposed a new background subtraction method, called DBSGen, which uses two generative neural networks, one for dynamic motion removal and another for background generation. At the end, the foreground moving objects are obtained by a pixel-wise distance threshold based on a dynamic entropy map. The proposed method has a unified framework that can be optimized in an end-to-end and unsupervised fashion.

Knee pain is clinically evaluated by routine radiographs, where the widespread adoption of radiographic images and their availability at low cost, make them the principle component in the assessment of knee pain and knee pathologies, such as arthritis, trauma, and sport injuries. However, interpretation of the knee radiographs is still highly subjective, and overlapping structures within the radiographs and the large volume of images needing to be analyzed on a daily basis, make interpretation challenging for both naive and experienced practitioners. There is thus a need to implement an artificial intelligence strategy to objectively and automatically interpret knee radiographs, facilitating triage of abnormal radiographs in a timely fashion. The current work proposes an accurate and effective pipeline for autonomous detection, localization, and classification of knee joint area in plain radiographs combining the You Only Look Once (YOLO v3) deep convolutional neural network with a large and fully-annotated knee radiographs dataset. The present work is expected to stimulate more interest from the deep learning computer vision community to this pragmatic and clinical application. ",

To accelerate the computation, in this paper, we proposed a decentralized surrogate median regression (deSMR) method for efficiently solving the decentralized sparsity learning problem. We show that our proposed algorithm enjoys a linear convergence rate with a simple implementation.

Moreover, we establish the theoretical results for sparse support recovery. Thorough numerical experiments and real data study are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. ",

In this paper, we propose a machine learning strategy to discover breakdown precursors in CERN's Compact Linear Collider (CLIC) accelerating structures. By interpreting the parameters of the learned models with explainable Artificial Intelligence (AI), we reverse-engineer physical properties for deriving fast, reliable, and simple rule based models. Based on 6 months of historical data and dedicated experiments, our models show fractions of data with high influence on the occurrence of breakdowns.

    "abstract": "Atrial Fibrillation (AF) is a heart's arrhythmia which, despite being often asymptomatic, represents an important risk factor for stroke, therefore being able to predict AF at the electrocardiogram exam, would be of great impact on actively targeting patients at high risk. In the present work we use Convolution Neural Networks to analyze ECG and predict Atrial Fibrillation starting from realistic datasets, i.e. considering fewer ECG than other studies and extending the maximal distance between ECG and AF diagnosis. We achieved 75.5% (0.75) AUC firstly increasing our dataset size by a shifting technique and secondarily using the dilation parameter of the convolution neural network. In addition we find that, contrarily to what is commonly used by clinicians reporting AF at the exam, the most informative leads for the task of predicting AF are D1 and avR. Similarly, we find that the most important frequencies to check are in the range of 5-20 Hz. Finally, we develop a net able to manage at the same time the electrocardiographic signal together with the electronic health record, showing that integration between different sources of data is a profitable path. In fact, the 2.8% gain of such net brings us to a 78.6% (std 0.77) AUC. In future works we will deepen both the integration of sources and the reason why we claim avR is the most informative lead. ",

    "abstract": "We study the performance of Markov chains for the $q$-state ferromagnetic Potts model on random regular graphs. It is conjectured that their performance is dictated by metastability phenomena, i.e., the presence of \"phases\" (clusters) in the sample space where Markov chains with local update rules, such as the Glauber dynamics, are bound to take exponential time to escape, and therefore cause slow mixing. The phases that are believed to drive these metastability phenomena in the case of the Potts model emerge as local, rather than global, maxima of the so-called Bethe functional, and previous approaches of analysing these phases based on optimisation arguments fall short of the task. Our first contribution is to detail the emergence of the metastable phases for the $q$-state Potts model on the $d$-regular random graph for all integers $q,d\\geq 3$, and establish that for an interval of temperatures, delineated by the uniqueness and the Kesten-Stigum thresholds on the $d$-regular tree, the two phases coexist. The proofs are based on a conceptual connection between spatial properties and the structure of the Potts distribution on the random regular graph, rather than complicated moment calculations. Based on this new structural understanding of the model, we obtain various algorithmic consequences. We first complement recent fast mixing results for Glauber dynamics by Blanca and Gheissari below the uniqueness threshold, showing an exponential lower bound on the mixing time above the uniqueness threshold. Then, we obtain tight results even for the non-local Swendsen-Wang chain, where we establish slow mixing/metastability for the whole interval of temperatures where the chain is conjectured to mix slowly on the random regular graph. The key is to bound the conductance of the chains using a random graph \"planting\" argument combined with delicate bounds on random-graph percolation. ",
