    "abstract": "Following language instructions to navigate in unseen environments is a challenging problem for autonomous embodied agents. The agent not only needs to ground languages in visual scenes, but also should explore the environment to reach its target. In this work, we propose a dual-scale graph transformer (DUET) for joint long-term action planning and fine-grained cross-modal understanding. We build a topological map on-the-fly to enable efficient exploration in global action space. To balance the complexity of large action space reasoning and fine-grained language grounding, we dynamically combine a fine-scale encoding over local observations and a coarse-scale encoding on a global map via graph transformers. The proposed approach, DUET, significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on goal-oriented vision-and-language navigation (VLN) benchmarks REVERIE and SOON. It also improves the success rate on the fine-grained VLN benchmark R2R. ",

    "abstract": "Learning-enabled control systems have demonstrated impressive empirical performance on challenging control problems in robotics, but this performance comes at the cost of reduced transparency and lack of guarantees on the safety or stability of the learned controllers. In recent years, new techniques have emerged to provide these guarantees by learning certificates alongside control policies -- these certificates provide concise, data-driven proofs that guarantee the safety and stability of the learned control system. These methods not only allow the user to verify the safety of a learned controller but also provide supervision during training, allowing safety and stability requirements to influence the training process itself. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey of this rapidly developing field of certificate learning. We hope that this paper will serve as an accessible introduction to the theory and practice of certificate learning, both to those who wish to apply these tools to practical robotics problems and to those who wish to dive more deeply into the theory of learning for control.

    "abstract": "Qualitative causal relationships compactly express the direction, dependency, temporal constraints, and monotonicity constraints of discrete or continuous interactions in the world. In everyday or academic language, we may express interactions between quantities (e.g., sleep decreases stress), between discrete events or entities (e.g., a protein inhibits another protein's transcription), or between intentional or functional factors (e.g., hospital patients pray to relieve their pain). Extracting and representing these diverse causal relations are critical for cognitive systems that operate in domains spanning from scientific discovery to social science. This paper presents a transformer-based NLP architecture that jointly extracts knowledge graphs including (1) variables or factors described in language, (2) qualitative causal relationships over these variables, (3) qualifiers and magnitudes that constrain these causal relationships, and (4) word senses to localize each extracted node within a large ontology. We do not claim that our transformer-based architecture is itself a cognitive system; however, we provide evidence of its accurate knowledge graph extraction in real-world domains and the practicality of its resulting knowledge graphs for cognitive systems that perform graph-based reasoning. We demonstrate this approach and include promising results in two use cases, processing textual inputs from academic publications, news articles, and social media. ",

    "abstract": "In recent years, it has become increasingly common for high performance computers (HPC) to possess some level of heterogeneous architecture - typically in the form of GPU accelerators. In some machines these are isolated within a dedicated partition, whilst in others they are integral to all compute nodes - often with multiple GPUs per node - and provide the majority of a machine's compute performance. In light of this trend, it is becoming essential that codes deployed on HPC are updated to execute on accelerator hardware. In this paper we introduce a GPU implementation of the 3D blood flow simulation code HemeLB that has been developed using CUDA C++. We demonstrate how taking advantage of NVIDIA GPU hardware can achieve significant performance improvements compared to the equivalent CPU only code on which it has been built whilst retaining the excellent strong scaling characteristics that have been repeatedly demonstrated by the CPU version. With HPC positioned on the brink of the exascale era, we use HemeLB as a motivation to provide a discussion on some of the challenges that many users will face when deploying their own applications on upcoming exascale machines.

This paper reports the results of a simulation study that examined the effect of binning on the Greedy Equivalence Search (GES) causal discovery algorithm. Our findings suggest that unbinned continuous data often result in the highest search performance, but some exceptions are identified.

To this end, we employ the physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) and its extended version, extended PINNs (XPINNs), where domain decomposition allows deploying locally powerful neural networks in each subdomain, which can provide additional expressivity in subdomains, where a complex solution is expected. Apart from the governing compressible Euler equations, we also enforce the entropy conditions in order to obtain viscosity solutions. Moreover, we enforce positivity conditions on density and pressure. We consider inverse problems involving two-dimensional expansion waves, two-dimensional oblique and bow shock waves. We compare solutions obtained by PINNs and XPINNs and invoke some theoretical results that can be used to decide on the generalization errors of the two methods. ",

    "abstract": "This article uses Deep Learning technologies to safeguard DNA sequencing against Bio-Cyber attacks. We consider a hybrid attack scenario where the payload is encoded into a DNA sequence to activate a Trojan malware implanted in a software tool used in the sequencing pipeline in order to allow the perpetrators to gain control over the resources used in that pipeline during sequence analysis. The scenario considered in the paper is based on perpetrators submitting synthetically engineered DNA samples that contain digitally encoded IP address and port number of the perpetrators machine in the DNA. Genetic analysis of the samples DNA will decode the address that is used by the software trojan malware to activate and trigger a remote connection. This approach can open up to multiple perpetrators to create connections to hijack the DNA sequencing pipeline. As a way of hiding the data, the perpetrators can avoid detection by encoding the address to maximise similarity with genuine DNAs, which we showed previously. However, in this paper we show how Deep Learning can be used to successfully detect and identify the trigger encoded data, in order to protect a DNA sequencing pipeline from trojan attacks. The result shows nearly up to 100% accuracy in detection in such a novel Trojan attack scenario even after applying fragmentation encryption and steganography on the encoded trigger data. In addition, feasibility of designing and synthesizing encoded DNA for such Trojan payloads is validated by a wet lab experiment. ",

    "abstract": "In this article, we present a leap-forward expansion to the study of explainability in neural networks by considering explanations as answers to abstract reasoning-based questions. With $P$ as the prediction from a neural network, these questions are `Why P?', `What if not P?', and `Why P, rather than Q?' for a given contrast prediction $Q$. The answers to these questions are observed correlations, observed counterfactuals, and observed contrastive explanations respectively. Together, these explanations constitute the abductive reasoning scheme. We term the three explanatory schemes as observed explanatory paradigms. The term observed refers to the specific case of post-hoc explainability, when an explanatory technique explains the decision $P$ after a trained neural network has made the decision $P$. The primary advantage of viewing explanations through the lens of abductive reasoning-based questions is that explanations can be used as reasons while making decisions. The post-hoc field of explainability, that previously only justified decisions, becomes active by being involved in the decision making process and providing limited, but relevant and contextual interventions. The contributions of this article are: ($i$) realizing explanations as reasoning paradigms, ($ii$) providing a probabilistic definition of observed explanations and their completeness, ($iii$) creating a taxonomy for evaluation of explanations, and ($iv$) positioning gradient-based complete explanainability's replicability and reproducibility across multiple applications and data modalities, ($v$) code repositories, publicly available at https://github.com/olivesgatech/Explanatory-Paradigms.

    "abstract": "We present two novel hyperparameter optimization strategies for optimization of deep learning models with a modular architecture constructed of multiple subnetworks. As complex networks with multiple subnetworks become more frequently applied in machine learning, hyperparameter optimization methods are required to efficiently optimize their hyperparameters. Existing hyperparameter searches are general, and can be used to optimize such networks, however, by exploiting the multi-subnetwork architecture, these searches can be sped up substantially. The proposed methods offer faster convergence to a better-performing final model. To demonstrate this, we propose 2 independent approaches to enhance these prior algorithms: 1) a divide-and-conquer approach, in which the best subnetworks of top-performing models are combined, allowing for more rapid sampling of the hyperparameter search space. 2) A subnetwork adaptive approach that distributes computational resources based on the importance of each subnetwork, allowing more intelligent resource allocation. These approaches can be flexibily applied to many hyperparameter optimization algorithms. To illustrate this, we combine our approaches with the commonly-used Bayesian optimization method. Our approaches are then tested against both synthetic examples and real-world examples and applied to multiple network types including convolutional neural networks and dense feed forward neural networks. Our approaches show an increased optimization efficiency of up to 23.62x, and a final performance boost of up to 3.5% accuracy for classification and 4.4 MSE for regression, when compared to comparable BO approach.

Intermittently failing uplinks to the central parameter server (PS) can induce a large generalization gap in performance especially when the data distribution among the clients exhibits heterogeneity. In this work, to mitigate communication blockages between clients and the central PS, we introduce the concept of knowledge relaying wherein the successfully participating clients collaborate in relaying their neighbors' local updates to a central parameter server (PS) in order to boost the participation of clients with intermittently failing connectivity. We propose a collaborative relaying based semi-decentralized federated edge learning framework where at every communication round each client first computes a local consensus of the updates from its neighboring clients and eventually transmits a weighted average of its own update and those of its neighbors to the PS. We appropriately optimize these averaging weights to reduce the variance of the global update at the PS while ensuring that the global update is unbiased, consequently improving the convergence rate. Finally, by conducting experiments on CIFAR-10 dataset we validate our theoretical results and demonstrate that our proposed scheme is superior to Federated averaging benchmark especially when data distribution among clients is non-iid.

    "abstract": "We present a method to learn compositional predictive models from image observations based on implicit object encoders, Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs), and graph neural networks. A central question in learning dynamic models from sensor observations is on which representations predictions should be performed. NeRFs have become a popular choice for representing scenes due to their strong 3D prior. However, most NeRF approaches are trained on a single scene, representing the whole scene with a global model, making generalization to novel scenes, containing different numbers of objects, challenging. Instead, we present a compositional, object-centric auto-encoder framework that maps multiple views of the scene to a \\emph{set} of latent vectors representing each object separately. The latent vectors parameterize individual NeRF models from which the scene can be reconstructed and rendered from novel viewpoints. We train a graph neural network dynamics model in the latent space to achieve compositionality for dynamics prediction. A key feature of our approach is that the learned 3D information of the scene through the NeRF model enables us to incorporate structural priors in learning the dynamics models, making long-term predictions more stable. The model can further be used to synthesize new scenes from individual object observations. For planning, we utilize RRTs in the learned latent space, where we can exploit our model and the implicit object encoder to make sampling the latent space informative and more efficient. In the experiments, we show that the model outperforms several baselines on a pushing task containing many objects. Video: https://dannydriess.github.io/compnerfdyn/ ",

We jointly optimize the beamforming vectors at the base station (BS) and the phase shifts of the reflecting elements at the RIS so as to maximize the weighted minimum secrecy rate (WMSR), subject to both transmission power constraints at the BS and unit-modulus constraints at the RIS. To address the formulated optimization problem, we first decouple it into two tractable subproblems and then use the block coordinate descent (BCD) method to alternately optimize the subproblems. Two different methods are proposed to solve the two obtained subproblems. The first method transforms each subproblem into a second order cone programming (SOCP) problem, which can be directly solved using CVX. The second method leverages the Minorization- Maximization (MM) algorithm. Specifically, we first derive a concave approximation function, which is a lower bound of the original objective function, and then the two subproblems are transformed into two simple surrogate problems with closedform solutions. Simulation results verify the performance gains of the proposed robust transmission method over existing nonrobust designs. In addition, the MM algorithm is shown to have much lower complexity than the SOCP-based algorithm. ",

However, in a real world scene, the LiDAR can only acquire a limited object surface point clouds, but the center point of the object does not exist. Obtaining the object by aggregating the incomplete surface point clouds will bring a loss of accuracy in direction and dimension estimation. To address this problem, we propose a corner-guided anchor-free single-stage 3D object detection model (CG-SSD ).Firstly, 3D sparse convolution backbone network composed of residual layers and sub-manifold sparse convolutional layers are used to construct bird's eye view (BEV) features for further deeper feature mining by a lite U-shaped network; Secondly, a novel corner-guided auxiliary module (CGAM) is proposed to incorporate corner supervision signals into the neural network. CGAM is explicitly designed and trained to detect partially visible and invisible corners to obtains a more accurate object feature representation, especially for small or partial occluded objects; Finally, the deep features from both the backbone networks and CGAM module are concatenated and fed into the head module to predict the classification and 3D bounding boxes of the objects in the scene. The experiments demonstrate CG-SSD achieves the state-of-art performance on the ONCE benchmark for supervised 3D object detection using single frame point cloud data, with 62.77%mAP. Additionally, the experiments on ONCE and Waymo Open Dataset show that CGAM can be extended to most anchor-based models which use the BEV feature to detect objects, as a plug-in and bring +1.17%-+14.27%AP improvement.

In this paper, we investigate the intermediate activation manipulation at a more fine-grained level. Instead of uniformly scaling the activation, we individually adjust each element within an activation and thus propose Element-Wise Activation Scaling, dubbed EWAS, to improve CNNs' adversarial robustness. Experimental results on ResNet-18 and WideResNet with CIFAR10 and SVHN show that EWAS significantly improves the robustness accuracy. Especially for ResNet18 on CIFAR10, EWAS increases the adversarial accuracy by 37.65% to 82.35% against C&W attack. EWAS is simple yet very effective in terms of improving robustness.

    "abstract": "Probabilistic time series forecasting has played critical role in decision-making processes due to its capability to quantify uncertainties. Deep forecasting models, however, could be prone to input perturbations, and the notion of such perturbations, together with that of robustness, has not even been completely established in the regime of probabilistic forecasting. In this work, we propose a framework for robust probabilistic time series forecasting. First, we generalize the concept of adversarial input perturbations, based on which we formulate the concept of robustness in terms of bounded Wasserstein deviation. Then we extend the randomized smoothing technique to attain robust probabilistic forecasters with theoretical robustness certificates against certain classes of adversarial perturbations. Lastly, extensive experiments demonstrate that our methods are empirically effective in enhancing the forecast quality under additive adversarial attacks and forecast consistency under supplement of noisy observations.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we present a transformer-based architecture, namely TF-Grasp, for robotic grasp detection. The developed TF-Grasp framework has two elaborate designs making it well suitable for visual grasping tasks. The first key design is that we adopt the local window attention to capture local contextual information and detailed features of graspable objects. Then, we apply the cross window attention to model the long-term dependencies between distant pixels. Object knowledge, environmental configuration, and relationships between different visual entities are aggregated for subsequent grasp detection. The second key design is that we build a hierarchical encoder-decoder architecture with skip-connections, delivering shallow features from encoder to decoder to enable a multi-scale feature fusion. Due to the powerful attention mechanism, the TF-Grasp can simultaneously obtain the local information (i.e., the contours of objects), and model long-term connections such as the relationships between distinct visual concepts in clutter. Extensive computational experiments demonstrate that the TF-Grasp achieves superior results versus state-of-art grasping convolutional models and attain a higher accuracy of 97.99% and 94.6% on Cornell and Jacquard grasping datasets, respectively. Real-world experiments using a 7DoF Franka Emika Panda robot also demonstrate its capability of grasping unseen objects in a variety of scenarios.

This paper compares this joint methodology with an older idea: bottom-up phone-like unit discovery is performed first, and symbolic word segmentation is then performed on top of the discovered units (without influencing the lower level). I specifically describe a duration-penalized dynamic programming (DPDP) procedure that can be used for either phone or word segmentation by changing the self-supervised scoring network that gives segment costs. For phone discovery, DPDP is applied with a contrastive predictive coding clustering model, while for word segmentation it is used with an autoencoding recurrent neural network. The two models are chained in order to segment speech. This approach gives comparable word segmentation results to state-of-the-art joint self-supervised models on an English benchmark. On French and Mandarin data, it outperforms previous systems on the ZeroSpeech benchmarks. Analysis shows that the chained DPDP system segments shorter filler words well, but longer words might require an external top-down signal. ",

    "abstract": "Recently, brain-inspired spiking neuron networks (SNNs) have attracted widespread research interest because of their event-driven and energy-efficient characteristics. Still, it is difficult to efficiently train deep SNNs due to the non-differentiability of its activation function, which disables the typically used gradient descent approaches for traditional artificial neural networks (ANNs). Although the adoption of surrogate gradient (SG) formally allows for the back-propagation of losses, the discrete spiking mechanism actually differentiates the loss landscape of SNNs from that of ANNs, failing the surrogate gradient methods to achieve comparable accuracy as for ANNs. In this paper, we first analyze why the current direct training approach with surrogate gradient results in SNNs with poor generalizability. Then we introduce the temporal efficient training (TET) approach to compensate for the loss of momentum in the gradient descent with SG so that the training process can converge into flatter minima with better generalizability. Meanwhile, we demonstrate that TET improves the temporal scalability of SNN and induces a temporal inheritable training for acceleration. Our method consistently outperforms the SOTA on all reported mainstream datasets, including CIFAR-10/100 and ImageNet. Remarkably on DVS-CIFAR10, we obtained 83$\\%$ top-1 accuracy, over 10$\\%$ improvement compared to existing state of the art.

Since existing methods are trained and evaluated on the same categories, they cannot effectively recognize the categories that have not been used during training. In this paper, we propose a novel domain disentangled generative adversarial network (DD-GAN) for zero-shot sketch-based 3D retrieval, which can retrieve the unseen categories that are not accessed during training. Specifically, we first generate domain-invariant features and domain-specific features by disentangling the learned features of sketches and 3D shapes, where the domain-invariant features are used to align with the corresponding word embeddings. Then, we develop a generative adversarial network that combines the domainspecific features of the seen categories with the aligned domain-invariant features to synthesize samples, where the synthesized samples of the unseen categories are generated by using the corresponding word embeddings. Finally, we use the synthesized samples of the unseen categories combined with the real samples of the seen categories to train the network for retrieval, so that the unseen categories can be recognized. In order to reduce the domain shift between the synthesized domain and the real domain, we adopt the transductive setting to reduce the gap between the distributions of the synthesized unseen categories and real unseen categories. Extensive experiments on the SHREC'13 and SHREC'14 datasets show that our method significantly improves the retrieval performance of the unseen categories. ",

Moreover, a simple, general and interpretable solution for semantic information detection is developed by exploiting triples as semantic symbols. It also allows the receiver to correct errors occurring at the symbolic level. Furthermore, the pre-trained model is fine-tuned to recover semantic information, which overcomes the drawback that a fixed bit length coding is used to encode sentences of different lengths.

    "abstract": "Passenger flow allows the study of users' behavior through the public network and assists in designing new facilities and services. This flow is observed through interactions between passengers and infrastructure. For this task, Bluetooth technology and smartphones represent the ideal solution. The latter component allows users' identification, authentication, and billing, while the former allows short-range implicit interactions, device-to-device. To assess the potential of such a use case, we need to verify how robust Bluetooth signal and related machine learning (ML) classifiers are against the noise of realistic contexts. Therefore, we model binary passenger states with respect to a public vehicle, where one can either be-in or be-out (BIBO). The BIBO label identifies a fundamental building block of continuously-valued passenger flow. This paper describes the Human-Computer interaction experimental setting in a semi-controlled environment, which involves: two autonomous vehicles operating on two routes, serving three bus stops and eighteen users, as well as a proprietary smartphone-Bluetooth sensing platform. The resulting dataset includes multiple sensors' measurements of the same event and two ground-truth levels, the first being validation by participants, the second by three video-cameras surveilling buses and track. We performed a Monte-Carlo simulation of labels-flip to emulate human errors in the labeling process, as is known to happen in smartphone surveys; next we used such flipped labels for supervised training of ML classifiers. The impact of errors on model performance bias can be large. Results show ML tolerance to label flips caused by human or machine errors up to 30%. ",

Current user sensing technologies such as Walk-in/Walk-out (WIWO) and Check-in/Check-out (CICO) have limited scalability for large-scale deployments. These limitations prevent ITS from supporting analysis, optimization, calculation of revenue sharing, and control of MaaS comfort, safety, and efficiency. We focus on the concept of implicit Be-in/Be-out (BIBO) smartphone-sensing and classification. To close the gap and enhance smartphones towards MaaS, we developed a proprietary smartphone-sensing platform collecting contemporary Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) signals from BLE devices installed on buses and Global Positioning System (GPS) locations of both buses and smartphones. To enable the training of a model based on GPS features against the BLE pseudo-label, we propose the Cause-Effect Multitask Wasserstein Autoencoder (CEMWA). CEMWA combines and extends several frameworks around Wasserstein autoencoders and neural networks. As a dimensionality reduction tool, CEMWA obtains an auto-validated representation of a latent space describing users' smartphones within the transport system. This representation allows BIBO clustering via DBSCAN. We perform an ablation study of CEMWA's alternative architectures and benchmark against the best available supervised methods. We analyze performance's sensitivity to label quality. Under the na\\\"ive assumption of accurate ground truth, XGBoost outperforms CEMWA.

A fully bootstrapped strategy for semantic segmentation, which saves efforts for the huge amount of annotation, is crucial for building customized models from end-to-end for open-world domains. This application is eagerly needed in realistic scenarios. Even though recent self-supervised semantic segmentation methods have gained great progress, these works however heavily depend on the fully-supervised pretrained model and make it impossible a fully self-supervised pipeline. To solve this problem, we proposed a bootstrapped training scheme for semantic segmentation, which fully leveraged the global semantic knowledge for self-supervision with our proposed PGG strategy and CAE module. In particular, we perform pixel clustering and assignments for segmentation supervision. Preventing it from clustering a mess, we proposed 1) a pyramid-global-guided (PGG) training strategy to supervise the learning with pyramid image/patch-level pseudo labels, which are generated by grouping the unsupervised features. The stable global and pyramid semantic pseudo labels can prevent the segmentation from learning too many clutter regions or degrading to one background region; 2) in addition, we proposed context-aware embedding (CAE) module to generate global feature embedding in view of its neighbors close both in space and appearance in a non-trivial way.

However, no research focuses on whether such neural network-based models can truly learn the structure of underlying process models. For instance, can such neural networks effectively learn parallel behaviour or loops? Therefore, in this work, we propose an evaluation scheme complemented with new fitness, precision, and generalisation metrics, specifically tailored towards measuring the capacity of deep learning models to learn process model structure. We apply this framework to several process models with simple control-flow behaviour, on the task of next-event prediction.

The task is then to decide whether the given graph contains a perfect matching exactly $k$ of whose edges have color red. EM generalizes several important algorithmic problems such as \\emph{perfect matching} and restricted minimum weight spanning tree problems. When introducing the problem in 1982, Papadimitriou and Yannakakis conjectured EM to be \\textbf{NP}-complete. Later however, Mulmuley et al.~presented a randomized polynomial time algorithm for EM, which puts EM in \\textbf{RP}. Given that to decide whether or not \\textbf{RP}$=$\\textbf{P} represents a big open challenge in complexity theory, this makes it unlikely for EM to be \\textbf{NP}-complete, and in fact indicates the possibility of a \\emph{deterministic} polynomial time algorithm. EM remains one of the few natural combinatorial problems in \\textbf{RP} which are not known to be contained in \\textbf{P}, making it an interesting instance for testing the hypothesis \\textbf{RP}$=$\\textbf{P}. Despite EM being quite well-known, attempts to devise deterministic polynomial algorithms have remained illusive during the last 40 years and progress has been lacking even for very restrictive classes of input graphs. In this paper we finally push the frontier of positive results forward by proving that EM can be solved in deterministic polynomial time for input graphs of bounded independence number, and for bipartite input graphs of bounded bipartite independence number. This generalizes previous positive results for complete (bipartite) graphs which were the only known results for EM on dense graphs. ",

    "abstract": "While Human-Object Interaction(HOI) Detection has achieved tremendous advances in recent, it still remains challenging due to complex interactions with multiple humans and objects occurring in images, which would inevitably lead to ambiguities. Most existing methods either generate all human-object pair candidates and infer their relationships by cropped local features successively in a two-stage manner, or directly predict interaction points in a one-stage procedure. However, the lack of spatial configurations or reasoning steps of two- or one- stage methods respectively limits their performance in such complex scenes. To avoid this ambiguity, we propose a novel actor-centric framework. The main ideas are that when inferring interactions: 1) the non-local features of the entire image guided by actor position are obtained to model the relationship between the actor and context, and then 2) we use an object branch to generate pixel-wise interaction area prediction, where the interaction area denotes the object central area. Moreover, we also use an actor branch to get interaction prediction of the actor and propose a novel composition strategy based on center-point indexing to generate the final HOI prediction. Thanks to the usage of the non-local features and the partly-coupled property of the human-objects composition strategy, our proposed framework can detect HOI more accurately especially for complex images. Extensive experimental results show that our method achieves the state-of-the-art on the challenging V-COCO and HICO-DET benchmarks and is more robust especially in multiple persons and/or objects scenes.

    "abstract": "Neonatal seizure detection algorithms (SDA) are approaching the benchmark of human expert annotation. Measures of algorithm generalizability and non-inferiority as well as measures of clinical efficacy are needed to assess the full scope of neonatal SDA performance. We validated our neonatal SDA on an independent data set of 28 neonates. Generalizability was tested by comparing the performance of the original training set (cross-validation) to its performance on the validation set. Non-inferiority was tested by assessing inter-observer agreement between combinations of SDA and two human expert annotations. Clinical efficacy was tested by comparing how the SDA and human experts quantified seizure burden and identified clinically significant periods of seizure activity in the EEG. Algorithm performance was consistent between training and validation sets with no significant worsening in AUC (p>0.05, n =28). SDA output was inferior to the annotation of the human expert, however, re-training with an increased diversity of data resulted in non-inferior performance ($\\Delta\\kappa$=0.077, 95% CI: -0.002-0.232, n=18). The SDA assessment of seizure burden had an accuracy ranging from 89-93%, and 87% for identifying periods of clinical interest. The proposed SDA is approaching human equivalence and provides a clinically relevant interpretation of the EEG. ",

    "abstract": "Polyps are well-known cancer precursors identified by colonoscopy. However, variability in their size, location, and surface largely affect identification, localisation, and characterisation. Moreover, colonoscopic surveillance and removal of polyps (referred to as polypectomy ) are highly operator-dependent procedures. There exist a high missed detection rate and incomplete removal of colonic polyps due to their variable nature, the difficulties to delineate the abnormality, the high recurrence rates, and the anatomical topography of the colon. There have been several developments in realising automated methods for both detection and segmentation of these polyps using machine learning. However, the major drawback in most of these methods is their ability to generalise to out-of-sample unseen datasets that come from different centres, modalities and acquisition systems. To test this hypothesis rigorously we curated a multi-centre and multi-population dataset acquired from multiple colonoscopy systems and challenged teams comprising machine learning experts to develop robust automated detection and segmentation methods as part of our crowd-sourcing Endoscopic computer vision challenge (EndoCV) 2021. In this paper, we analyse the detection results of the four top (among seven) teams and the segmentation results of the five top teams (among 16). Our analyses demonstrate that the top-ranking teams concentrated on accuracy (i.e., accuracy > 80% on overall Dice score on different validation sets) over real-time performance required for clinical applicability. We further dissect the methods and provide an experiment-based hypothesis that reveals the need for improved generalisability to tackle diversity present in multi-centre datasets. ",

A related problem denoted as the balanced connected $q$-edge partition problem ($BCEP_q$) is defined as follows. Given an undirected graph $G$ and $q$ integers $n_1,n_2,n_3, \\cdots, n_q$, $BCEP_q$ asks whether there exists a partition of the edge set of $G$ into $q$ parts $E_1,E_2,E_3,\\cdots, E_q$ such that for all $i\\in[1,q]$, $|E_i|=n_i$ and the graph induced on the edge set $E_i$ is connected. Here we study both the problems for $q=2$ and prove that $BCP_q$ for $q\\geq 2$ is $W[1]$-hard. We also show that $BCP_2$ is unlikely to have a polynomial kernel on the class of planar graphs. Coming to the positive results, we show that $BCP_2$ is fixed parameter tractable (FPT) parameterized by treewidth of the graph, which generalizes to FPT algorithm for planar graphs. We design another FPT algorithm and a polynomial kernel on the class of unit disk graphs parameterized by $\\min(n_1,n_2)$. Finally, we prove that unlike $BCP_2$, $BCEP_2$ is FPT parameterized by $\\min(n_1,n_2)$. ",

Software defect prediction aims at identifying software components that are likely to cause faults before a software is made available to the end-user. To date, this task has been modeled as a two-class classification problem, however its nature also allows it to be formulated as a one-class classification task. Preliminary results obtained in prior work show that One-Class Support Vector Machine (OCSVM) can outperform two-class classifiers for defect prediction. If confirmed, these results would overcome the data imbalance problem researchers have for long attempted to tackle in this field. In this paper, we further investigate whether learning from one class only is sufficient to produce effective defect prediction models by conducting a thorough large-scale empirical study investigating 15 real-world software projects, three validation scenarios, eight classifiers, robust evaluation measures and statistical significance tests. The results reveal that OCSVM is more suitable for cross-version and cross-project, rather than for within-project defect prediction, thus suggesting it performs better with heterogeneous data. While, we cannot conclude that OCSVM is the best classifier (Random Forest performs best herein), our results show interesting findings that open up further research avenues for training accurate defect prediction classifiers when defective instances are scarce or unavailable.

The existing works mainly extract the inherent human-object dependencies from image/video to accommodate affordance properties that change dynamically. In this paper, we explore to perceive affordance from a vision-language perspective and consider the challenging phrase-based affordance detection problem,i.e., given a set of phrases describing the action purposes, all the object regions in a scene with the same affordance should be detected. To this end, we propose a cyclic bilateral consistency enhancement network (CBCE-Net) to align language and vision features progressively. Specifically, the presented CBCE-Net consists of a mutual guided vision-language module that updates the common features of vision and language in a progressive manner, and a cyclic interaction module (CIM) that facilitates the perception of possible interaction with objects in a cyclic manner. In addition, we extend the public Purpose-driven Affordance Dataset (PAD) by annotating affordance categories with short phrases. The contrastive experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our method over nine typical methods from four relevant fields in terms of both objective metrics and visual quality.

For the trend prediction, the attribute tags, as the essential description of items, can genuinely reflect the decision basis of consumers. However, few existing works explore the attribute trend in the specific community for e-commerce. In this paper, we focus on the community trend prediction on the item attribute and propose a unified framework that combines the dynamic evolution of two graph patterns to predict the attribute trend in a specific community. Specifically, we first design a communityattribute bipartite graph at each time step to learn the collaboration of different communities. Next, we transform the bipartite graph into a hypergraph to exploit the associations of different attribute tags in one community. Lastly, we introduce a dynamic evolution component based on the recurrent neural networks to capture the fashion trend of attribute tags. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets in a large e-commerce platform show the superiority of the proposed approach over several strong alternatives and demonstrate the ability to discover the community trend in advance.

One of the favorite privacy frameworks, differential privacy (DP), is perhaps the most compelling thanks to its fundamental theoretical guarantees. Despite the apparent simplicity of the general concept of differential privacy, it seems non-trivial to get it right when applying it to NLP. In this short paper, we formally analyze several recent NLP papers proposing text representation learning using DPText (Beigi et al., 2019a,b; Alnasser et al., 2021; Beigi et al., 2021) and reveal their false claims of being differentially private.

    "abstract": "Trojan attacks on deep neural networks are both dangerous and surreptitious. Over the past few years, Trojan attacks have advanced from using only a simple trigger and targeting only one class to using many sophisticated triggers and targeting multiple classes. However, Trojan defenses have not caught up with this development. Most defense methods still make out-of-date assumptions about Trojan triggers and target classes, thus, can be easily circumvented by modern Trojan attacks. In this paper, we advocate general defenses that are effective and robust against various Trojan attacks and propose two novel \"filtering\" defenses with these characteristics called Variational Input Filtering (VIF) and Adversarial Input Filtering (AIF). VIF and AIF leverage variational inference and adversarial training respectively to purify all potential Trojan triggers in the input at run time without making any assumption about their numbers and forms. We further extend \"filtering\" to \"filtering-then-contrasting\" - a new defense mechanism that helps avoid the drop in classification accuracy on clean data caused by filtering. Extensive experimental results show that our proposed defenses significantly outperform 4 well-known defenses in mitigating 5 different Trojan attacks including the two state-of-the-art which defeat many strong defenses.

    "abstract": "In the early stages of human life, babies develop their skills by exploring different scenarios motivated by their inherent satisfaction rather than by extrinsic rewards from the environment. This behavior, referred to as intrinsic motivation, has emerged as one solution to address the exploration challenge derived from reinforcement learning environments with sparse rewards. Diverse exploration approaches have been proposed to accelerate the learning process over single- and multi-agent problems with homogeneous agents. However, scarce studies have elaborated on collaborative learning frameworks between heterogeneous agents deployed into the same environment, but interacting with different instances of the latter without any prior knowledge. Beyond the heterogeneity, each agent's characteristics grant access only to a subset of the full state space, which may hide different exploration strategies and optimal solutions. In this work we combine ideas from intrinsic motivation and transfer learning. Specifically, we focus on sharing parameters in actor-critic model architectures and on combining information obtained through intrinsic motivation with the aim of having a more efficient exploration and faster learning. We test our strategies through experiments performed over a modified ViZDooM's My Way Home scenario, which is more challenging than its original version and allows evaluating the heterogeneity between agents. Our results reveal different ways in which a collaborative framework with little additional computational cost can outperform an independent learning process without knowledge sharing. Additionally, we depict the need for modulating correctly the importance between the extrinsic and intrinsic rewards to avoid undesired agent behaviors. ",

In this case study, we audit a recent open source implementation of a differentially private deep learning algorithm and find, with 99.99999999% confidence, that the implementation does not satisfy the claimed differential privacy guarantee.

    "abstract": "Data augmentation is popular in the training of large neural networks; currently, however, there is no clear theoretical comparison between different algorithmic choices on how to use augmented data. In this paper, we take a step in this direction - we first present a simple and novel analysis for linear regression, demonstrating that data augmentation consistency (DAC) is intrinsically more efficient than empirical risk minimization on augmented data (DA-ERM). We then propose a new theoretical framework for analyzing DAC, which reframes DAC as a way to reduce function class complexity. The new framework characterizes the sample efficiency of DAC for various non-linear models (e.g., neural networks). Further, we perform experiments that make a clean and apples-to-apples comparison (i.e., with no extra modeling or data tweaks) between ERM and consistency regularization using CIFAR-100 and WideResNet; these together demonstrate the superior efficacy of DAC.

    "abstract": "In lexicalist linguistic theories, argument structure is assumed to be predictable from the meaning of verbs. As a result, the verb is the primary determinant of the meaning of a clause. In contrast, construction grammarians propose that argument structure is encoded in constructions (or form-meaning pairs) that are distinct from verbs. Decades of psycholinguistic research have produced substantial empirical evidence in favor of the construction view. Here we adapt several psycholinguistic studies to probe for the existence of argument structure constructions (ASCs) in Transformer-based language models (LMs). First, using a sentence sorting experiment, we find that sentences sharing the same construction are closer in embedding space than sentences sharing the same verb. Furthermore, LMs increasingly prefer grouping by construction with more input data, mirroring the behaviour of non-native language learners. Second, in a \"Jabberwocky\" priming-based experiment, we find that LMs associate ASCs with meaning, even in semantically nonsensical sentences. Our work offers the first evidence for ASCs in LMs and highlights the potential to devise novel probing methods grounded in psycholinguistic research. ",

Unlike many existing approaches, our formulation reveals that the positive and negative edges of a signed graph should be treated unequally. We then propose a simple two-stage iterative algorithm for solving the regularized MLE. It is shown that in the logarithmic degree regime, the proposed algorithm can exactly recover the underlying communities in nearly-linear time at the information-theoretic limit. Numerical results on both synthetic and real data are reported to validate and complement our theoretical developments and demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method. ",

Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) is utilized as a data-driven technique to forecast this parameter at Tabriz in East Azerbaijan. Various input patterns, namely T min, T max, and T mean, are utilized for training the architecture whilst DPT is the model's output. The findings indicate that, in general, ANFIS method is capable of identifying data patterns with a high degree of accuracy. However, the approach demonstrates that processing time and computer resources may substantially increase by adding additional functions. Based on the results, the number of iterations and computing resources might change dramatically if new functionalities are included. As a result, tuning parameters have to be optimized inside the method framework. The findings demonstrate a high agreement between results by the data-driven technique (machine learning method) and the observed data. Using this prediction toolkit, DPT can be adequately forecasted solely based on the temperature distribution of Tabriz. This kind of modeling is extremely promising for predicting DPT at various sites. Besides, this study thoroughly compares the Bilayered Neural Network (BNN) and ANFIS models on various scales. Whilst the ANFIS model is extremely stable for almost all numbers of membership functions, the BNN model is highly sensitive to this scale factor to predict DPT. ",

It is shown that such problems possess a continuum of spurious (i.e., not globally optimal) local minima for all target functions that are not affine. In contrast to previous works, our analysis covers all sampling and parameterization regimes, general differentiable loss functions, arbitrary continuous nonpolynomial activation functions, and both the finite- and infinite-dimensional setting. It is further shown that the appearance of the spurious local minima in the considered training problems is a direct consequence of the universal approximation theorem and that the underlying mechanisms also cause, e.g., Lp-best approximation problems to be ill-posed in the sense of Hadamard for all networks that do not have a dense image. The latter result also holds without the assumption of local affine linearity and without any conditions on the hidden layers. The paper concludes with a numerical experiment which demonstrates that spurious local minima can indeed affect the convergence behavior of gradient-based solution algorithms in practice. ",

In this paper we shift focus to the splitting number of graph drawings in $\\mathbb R^2$, where the new vertices resulting from vertex splits can be re-embedded into the existing drawing of the remaining graph. We first provide a non-uniform fixed-parameter tractable (FPT) algorithm for the splitting number problem (without drawings). Then we show the NP-completeness of the splitting number problem for graph drawings, even for its two subproblems of (1) selecting a minimum subset of vertices to split and (2) for re-embedding a minimum number of copies of a given set of vertices. For the latter problem we present an FPT algorithm parameterized by the number of vertex splits.

Together, these ideas allow encoding the loss function as an Ising model Hamiltonian. The quantum annealer then trains the network by finding the ground state. We implement this for an elementary network and illustrate the advantages of quantum training: its consistency in finding the global minimum of the loss function and the fact that the network training converges in a single annealing step, which leads to short training times while maintaining a high classification performance.

Hence fine spectra of anomalous pixels can be effectively screened out from heterogeneous background pixels. Since the same materials have similar characteristics in spatial and spectral dimension, detection performance can be significantly enhanced by jointing spatial and spectral information. In this paper, a spectralspatial fusion anomaly detection (SSFAD) method is proposed for hyperspectral imagery. First, original spectral signals are mapped to a local linear background space composed of median and mean with high confidence, where saliency weight and feature enhancement strategies are implemented to obtain an initial detection map in spectral domain. Futhermore, to make full use of similarity information of local background around testing pixel, a new detector is designed to extract the local similarity spatial features of patch images in spatial domain. Finally, anomalies are detected by adaptively combining the spectral and spatial detection maps. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method has superior detection performance than traditional methods. ",

Actuaries, therefore, use econometric or machine learning techniques to classify, but the distinction between a fair actuarial classification and \"discrimination\" is subtle. For this reason, there is a growing interest about fairness and discrimination in the actuarial community Lindholm, Richman, Tsanakas, and Wuthrich (2022). Presumably, non-sensitive characteristics can serve as substitutes or proxies for protected attributes. For example, the color and model of a car, combined with the driver's occupation, may lead to an undesirable gender bias in the prediction of car insurance prices. Surprisingly, we will show that debiasing the predictor alone may be insufficient to maintain adequate accuracy (1). Indeed, the traditional pricing model is currently built in a two-stage structure that considers many potentially biased components such as car or geographic risks. We will show that this traditional structure has significant limitations in achieving fairness. For this reason, we have developed a novel pricing model approach. Recently some approaches have Blier-Wong, Cossette, Lamontagne, and Marceau (2021); Wuthrich and Merz (2021) shown the value of autoencoders in pricing. In this paper, we will show that (2) this can be generalized to multiple pricing factors (geographic, car type), (3) it perfectly adapted for a fairness context (since it allows to debias the set of pricing components): We extend this main idea to a general framework in which a single whole pricing model is trained by generating the geographic and car pricing components needed to predict the pure premium while mitigating the unwanted bias according to the desired metric.

    "abstract": "This paper studies the trajectory control and task offloading (TCTO) problem in an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted mobile edge computing system, where a UAV flies along a planned trajectory to collect computation tasks from smart devices (SDs). We consider a scenario that SDs are not directly connected by the base station (BS) and the UAV has two roles to play: MEC server or wireless relay. The UAV makes task offloading decisions online, in which the collected tasks can be executed locally on the UAV or offloaded to the BS for remote processing. The TCTO problem involves multi-objective optimization as its objectives are to minimize the task delay and the UAV's energy consumption, and maximize the number of tasks collected by the UAV, simultaneously. This problem is challenging because the three objectives conflict with each other. The existing reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms, either single-objective RLs or single-policy multi-objective RLs, cannot well address the problem since they cannot output multiple policies for various preferences (i.e. weights) across objectives in a single run. This paper adapts the evolutionary multi-objective RL (EMORL), a multi-policy multi-objective RL, to the TCTO problem. This algorithm can output multiple optimal policies in just one run, each optimizing a certain preference. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can obtain more excellent nondominated policies by striking a balance between the three objectives regarding policy quality, compared with two evolutionary and two multi-policy RL algorithms.

Moreover, by exploiting the convergence of the concentrating posteriors to their Laplace approximation we extend the analysis to non-Gaussian target measures which either concentrate around a single point or along a linear manifold.

It is well-understood that assumptions are necessary to perform causal inferences, which are commonly articulated through causal diagrams (Pearl, 2000). Despite the power of this approach, there are settings where the knowledge necessary to specify a causal diagram over all observed variables may not be available, particularly in complex, high-dimensional domains. In this paper, we introduce a new type of graphical model called cluster causal diagrams (for short, C-DAGs) that allows for the partial specification of relationships among variables based on limited prior knowledge, alleviating the stringent requirement of specifying a full causal diagram. A C-DAG specifies relationships between clusters of variables, while the relationships between the variables within a cluster are left unspecified. We develop the foundations and machinery for valid causal inferences over C-DAGs. In particular, we first define a new version of the d-separation criterion and prove its soundness and completeness. Secondly, we extend these new separation rules and prove the validity of the corresponding do-calculus. Lastly, we show that a standard identification algorithm is sound and complete to systematically compute causal effects from observational data given a C-DAG. ",
