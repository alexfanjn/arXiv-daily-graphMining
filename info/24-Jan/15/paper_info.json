    "abstract": "Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) networks will provide Ultra-Reliable Low-Latency Communication (URLLC) to support critical processes underlying the production chains. However, standard protocols for allocating wireless resources may not optimize the latency-reliability trade-off, especially for uplink communication. For example, centralized grant-based scheduling can ensure almost zero collisions, but introduces delays in the way resources are requested by the User Equipments (UEs) and granted by the gNB. In turn, distributed scheduling (e.g., based on random access), in which UEs autonomously choose the resources for transmission, may lead to potentially many collisions especially when the traffic increases. In this work we propose DIStributed combinatorial NEural linear Thompson Sampling (DISNETS), a novel scheduling framework that combines the best of the two worlds. By leveraging a feedback signal from the gNB and reinforcement learning, the UEs are trained to autonomously optimize their uplink transmissions by selecting the available resources to minimize the number of collisions, without additional message exchange to/from the gNB. DISNETS is a distributed, multi-agent adaptation of the Neural Linear Thompson Sampling (NLTS) algorithm, which has been further extended to admit multiple parallel actions. We demonstrate the superior performance of DISNETS in addressing URLLC in IIoT scenarios compared to other baselines. ",

With the motivation to improve the success rate of neural networks in these problems, we propose a new neural network model inspired by existing neural network models with so called product neurons and a learning rule derived from classical error backpropagation, which elegantly solves the problem of mutually exclusive situations. Unlike existing product neurons, which have weights that are preset and not adaptable, our product layers of neurons also do learn. We tested the model and compared its success rate to a classical multilayer perceptron in the aforementioned problems as well as in other hard problems such as the two spirals.

A NeRF, a specialized neural network, can deduce a 3D representation of any scene using 2D images and then synthesize it from various angles upon request. This method is especially tailored for urban environments which have experienced significant destruction, where the structural integrity of buildings is compromised to the point of barring entry-commonly observed post-earthquakes and after severe fires. We have tested our approach through recent post-fire scenario, underlining the efficacy of NeRFs even in challenging outdoor environments characterized by water, snow, varying light conditions, and reflective surfaces.

    "abstract": "Estimation of people's home locations using location-based services data from smartphones is a common task in human mobility assessment. However, commonly used home detection algorithms (HDAs) are often arbitrary and unexamined. In this study, we review existing HDAs and examine five HDAs using eight high-quality mobile phone geolocation datasets. These include four commonly used HDAs as well as an HDA proposed in this work. To make quantitative comparisons, we propose three novel metrics to assess the quality of detected home locations and test them on eight datasets across four U.S. cities. We find that all three metrics show a consistent rank of HDAs' performances, with the proposed HDA outperforming the others. We infer that the temporal and spatial continuity of the geolocation data points matters more than the overall size of the data for accurate home detection. We also find that HDAs with high (and similar) performance metrics tend to create results with better consistency and closer to common expectations. Further, the performance deteriorates with decreasing data quality of the devices, though the patterns of relative performance persist. Finally, we show how the differences in home detection can lead to substantial differences in subsequent inferences using two case studies - (i) hurricane evacuation estimation, and (ii) correlation of mobility patterns with socioeconomic status. Our work contributes to improving the transparency of large-scale human mobility assessment applications. ",

Moreover, we present a quantitative analysis of the system-level hazard rate to be expected from an obstacle detection function. It is shown that using sensor/perceptor fusion, the fused detection system can meet the tolerable hazard rate deemed to be acceptable for the safety integrity level to be applied (SIL-3). A mathematical analysis of CNN models is performed which results in the identification of classification clusters and equivalence classes partitioning the image input space of the CNN. These clusters and classes are used to introduce a novel statistical testing method for determining the residual error probability of a trained CNN and an associated upper confidence limit. We argue that this greybox approach to CNN verification, taking into account the CNN model's internal structure, is essential for justifying that the statistical tests have covered the trained CNN with its neurons and inter-layer mappings in a comprehensive way.

They spread the fungal-type crayfish plague disease (Aphanomyces astaci) that is lethal to the native white clawed crayfish, the only native crayfish species in Britain. Invasive signal crayfish extensively burrow, causing habitat destruction, erosion of river banks and adverse changes in water quality, while also competing with native species for resources and leading to declines in native populations. Moreover, pollution exacerbates the vulnerability of White-clawed crayfish, with their populations declining by over 90% in certain English counties, making them highly susceptible to extinction. To safeguard aquatic ecosystems, it is imperative to address the challenges posed by invasive species and discarded plastics in the United Kingdom's river ecosystem's. The UDEEP platform can play a crucial role in environmental monitoring by performing on-the-fly classification of Signal crayfish and plastic debris while leveraging the efficacy of AI, IoT devices and the power of edge computing (i.e., NJN).

    "abstract": "Rotation-equivariance is an essential yet challenging property in oriented object detection. While general object detectors naturally leverage robustness to spatial shifts due to the translation-equivariance of the conventional CNNs, achieving rotation-equivariance remains an elusive goal. Current detectors deploy various alignment techniques to derive rotation-invariant features, but still rely on high capacity models and heavy data augmentation with all possible rotations. In this paper, we introduce a Fully Rotation-Equivariant Oriented Object Detector (FRED), whose entire process from the image to the bounding box prediction is strictly equivariant. Specifically, we decouple the invariant task (object classification) and the equivariant task (object localization) to achieve end-to-end equivariance. We represent the bounding box as a set of rotation-equivariant vectors to implement rotation-equivariant localization. Moreover, we utilized these rotation-equivariant vectors as offsets in the deformable convolution, thereby enhancing the existing advantages of spatial adaptation. Leveraging full rotation-equivariance, our FRED demonstrates higher robustness to image-level rotation compared to existing methods. Furthermore, we show that FRED is one step closer to non-axis aligned learning through our experiments. Compared to state-of-the-art methods, our proposed method delivers comparable performance on DOTA-v1.0 and outperforms by 1.5 mAP on DOTA-v1.5, all while significantly reducing the model parameters to 16%.

    "abstract": "Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) are essential time-series metrics for ensuring the reliability and stability of many software systems. They faithfully record runtime states to facilitate the understanding of anomalous system behaviors and provide informative clues for engineers to pinpoint the root causes. The unprecedented scale and complexity of modern software systems, however, make the volume of KPIs explode. Consequently, many traditional methods of KPI anomaly detection become impractical, which serves as a catalyst for the fast development of machine learning-based solutions in both academia and industry. However, there is currently a lack of rigorous comparison among these KPI anomaly detection methods, and re-implementation demands a non-trivial effort. Moreover, we observe that different works adopt independent evaluation processes with different metrics. Some of them may not fully reveal the capability of a model and some are creating an illusion of progress. To better understand the characteristics of different KPI anomaly detectors and address the evaluation issue, in this paper, we provide a comprehensive review and evaluation of twelve state-of-the-art methods, and propose a novel metric called salience. Particularly, the selected methods include five traditional machine learning-based methods and seven deep learning-based methods. These methods are evaluated with five multivariate KPI datasets that are publicly available. A unified toolkit with easy-to-use interfaces is also released. We report the benchmark results in terms of accuracy, salience, efficiency, and delay, which are of practical importance for industrial deployment. We believe our work can contribute as a basis for future academic research and industrial application. ",

    "abstract": "Graph neural networks (GNNs) have found widespread application in modeling graph data across diverse domains. While GNNs excel in scenarios where the testing data shares the distribution of their training counterparts (in distribution, ID), they often exhibit incorrect predictions when confronted with samples from an unfamiliar distribution (out-of-distribution, OOD). To identify and reject OOD samples with GNNs, recent studies have explored graph OOD detection, often focusing on training a specific model or modifying the data on top of a well-trained GNN. Despite their effectiveness, these methods come with heavy training resources and costs, as they need to optimize the GNN-based models on training data. Moreover, their reliance on modifying the original GNNs and accessing training data further restricts their universality. To this end, this paper introduces a method to detect Graph Out-of-Distribution At Test-time (namely GOODAT), a data-centric, unsupervised, and plug-and-play solution that operates independently of training data and modifications of GNN architecture. With a lightweight graph masker, GOODAT can learn informative subgraphs from test samples, enabling the capture of distinct graph patterns between OOD and ID samples. To optimize the graph masker, we meticulously design three unsupervised objective functions based on the graph information bottleneck principle, motivating the masker to capture compact yet informative subgraphs for OOD detection. Comprehensive evaluations confirm that our GOODAT method outperforms state-of-the-art benchmarks across a variety of real-world datasets.

It adheres to recent data regulation standards and enhances the privacy and security of machine learning applications.

In this work, we present a new machine unlearning approach Scissorhands, which operates effectively with only a subset of the training data. Initially, Scissorhands identifies the most pertinent parameters in the given model relative to the forgetting data via connection sensitivity. This process involves reinitializing the most influential top-$k$ percent of these parameters, resulting in a trimmed model for erasing the influence of the forgetting data. Subsequently, Scissorhands retrains the trimmed model through a min-max optimization process, seeking parameters that preserve information on the remaining data while discarding information related to the forgetting data. Our experimental results, conducted across five distinct datasets and utilizing both CNN and ViT, demonstrate that Scissorhands, despite utilizing only a limited portion of the training data, showcases competitive performance when compared to existing methods.

One such example is Triplane, in which NeRF is represented using three 2D feature planes. This enables easily using existing 2D neural networks in this framework, e.g., to generate the three planes. Despite its advantage, the triplane representation lagged behind in its 3D recovery quality compared to NeRF solutions.

Despite the rapid growth of image and text-based event classification, the state-of-the-art (SOTA) models find it challenging to bridge the semantic gap between features of image and text modalities due to inconsistent encoding. Also, the black-box nature of models fails to explain the model's outcomes for building trust in high-stakes situations such as disasters, pandemic. Additionally, the word limit imposed on social media posts can potentially introduce bias towards specific events. To address these issues, we proposed CrisisKAN, a novel Knowledge-infused and Explainable Multimodal Attention Network that entails images and texts in conjunction with external knowledge from Wikipedia to classify crisis events. To enrich the context-specific understanding of textual information, we integrated Wikipedia knowledge using proposed wiki extraction algorithm. Along with this, a guided cross-attention module is implemented to fill the semantic gap in integrating visual and textual data. In order to ensure reliability, we employ a model-specific approach called Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) that provides a robust explanation of the predictions of the proposed model. The comprehensive experiments conducted on the CrisisMMD dataset yield in-depth analysis across various crisis-specific tasks and settings. As a result, CrisisKAN outperforms existing SOTA methodologies and provides a novel view in the domain of explainable multimodal event classification. ",

The method embeds PDEs into the neural network by calculating PDE loss at a series of collocation points, providing advantages such as meshfree and more convenient adaptive sampling. However, when solving PDEs using nonuniform collocation points, PINNs still face challenge regarding inefficient convergence of PDE residuals or even failure. In this work, we first analyze the ill-conditioning of the PDE loss in PINNs under nonuniform collocation points. To address the issue, we define volume-weighted residual and propose volume-weighted physics-informed neural networks (VW-PINNs). Through weighting the PDE residuals by the volume that the collocation points occupy within the computational domain, we embed explicitly the spatial distribution characteristics of collocation points in the residual evaluation. The fast and sufficient convergence of the PDE residuals for the problems involving nonuniform collocation points is guaranteed. Considering the meshfree characteristics of VW-PINNs, we also develop a volume approximation algorithm based on kernel density estimation to calculate the volume of the collocation points. We verify the universality of VW-PINNs by solving the forward problems involving flow over a circular cylinder and flow over the NACA0012 airfoil under different inflow conditions, where conventional PINNs fail; By solving the Burgers' equation, we verify that VW-PINNs can enhance the efficiency of existing the adaptive sampling method in solving the forward problem by 3 times, and can reduce the relative error of conventional PINNs in solving the inverse problem by more than one order of magnitude.

We validate this method using a set of five CIOs from three countries discussing four topics on Twitter.

Our method is robust to observing only a small share of messaging on the topic, having only weak markers of inauthenticity, and to the CIO accounts making up a tiny share of messages and accounts on the topic.

Thus, it is crucial to fully understand the complex, dynamic, and sophisticated interactions of the crowd resulting in proactive and foresighted behaviors for robot navigation. In this paper, a novel deep graph learning architecture based on attention mechanisms is proposed, which leverages the spatial-temporal graph to enhance robot navigation. We employ spatial graphs to capture the current spatial interactions, and through the integration with RNN, the temporal graphs utilize past trajectory information to infer the future intentions of each agent. The spatial-temporal graph reasoning ability allows the robot to better understand and interpret the relationships between agents over time and space, thereby making more informed decisions.

    "abstract": "The rich and dynamic information environment of social media provides researchers, policy makers, and entrepreneurs with opportunities to learn about social phenomena in a timely manner. However, using these data to understand social behavior is difficult due to heterogeneity of topics and events discussed in the highly dynamic online information environment. To address these challenges, we present a method for systematically detecting and measuring emotional reactions to offline events using change point detection on the time series of collective affect, and further explaining these reactions using a transformer-based topic model. We demonstrate the utility of the method by successfully detecting major and smaller events on three different datasets, including (1) a Los Angeles Tweet dataset between Jan. and Aug. 2020, in which we revealed the complex psychological impact of the BlackLivesMatter movement and the COVID-19 pandemic, (2) a dataset related to abortion rights discussions in USA, in which we uncovered the strong emotional reactions to the overturn of Roe v. Wade and state abortion bans, and (3) a dataset about the 2022 French presidential election, in which we discovered the emotional and moral shift from positive before voting to fear and criticism after voting. The capability of our method allows for better sensing and monitoring of population's reactions during crises using online data. ",

    "abstract": "Solutions to vision tasks in gastrointestinal endoscopy (GIE) conventionally use image encoders pretrained in a supervised manner with ImageNet-1k as backbones. However, the use of modern self-supervised pretraining algorithms and a recent dataset of 100k unlabelled GIE images (Hyperkvasir-unlabelled) may allow for improvements. In this work, we study the fine-tuned performance of models with ResNet50 and ViT-B backbones pretrained in self-supervised and supervised manners with ImageNet-1k and Hyperkvasir-unlabelled (self-supervised only) in a range of GIE vision tasks. In addition to identifying the most suitable pretraining pipeline and backbone architecture for each task, out of those considered, our results suggest: that self-supervised pretraining generally produces more suitable backbones for GIE vision tasks than supervised pretraining; that self-supervised pretraining with ImageNet-1k is typically more suitable than pretraining with Hyperkvasir-unlabelled, with the notable exception of monocular depth estimation in colonoscopy; and that ViT-Bs are more suitable in polyp segmentation and monocular depth estimation in colonoscopy, ResNet50s are more suitable in polyp detection, and both architectures perform similarly in anatomical landmark recognition and pathological finding characterisation. We hope this work draws attention to the complexity of pretraining for GIE vision tasks, informs this development of more suitable approaches than the convention, and inspires further research on this topic to help advance this development.

    "abstract": "Audio-visual video recognition (AVVR) aims to integrate audio and visual clues to categorize videos accurately. While existing methods train AVVR models using provided datasets and achieve satisfactory results, they struggle to retain historical class knowledge when confronted with new classes in real-world situations. Currently, there are no dedicated methods for addressing this problem, so this paper concentrates on exploring Class Incremental Audio-Visual Video Recognition (CIAVVR). For CIAVVR, since both stored data and learned model of past classes contain historical knowledge, the core challenge is how to capture past data knowledge and past model knowledge to prevent catastrophic forgetting. We introduce Hierarchical Augmentation and Distillation (HAD), which comprises the Hierarchical Augmentation Module (HAM) and Hierarchical Distillation Module (HDM) to efficiently utilize the hierarchical structure of data and models, respectively. Specifically, HAM implements a novel augmentation strategy, segmental feature augmentation, to preserve hierarchical model knowledge. Meanwhile, HDM introduces newly designed hierarchical (video-distribution) logical distillation and hierarchical (snippet-video) correlative distillation to capture and maintain the hierarchical intra-sample knowledge of each data and the hierarchical inter-sample knowledge between data, respectively. Evaluations on four benchmarks (AVE, AVK-100, AVK-200, and AVK-400) demonstrate that the proposed HAD effectively captures hierarchical information in both data and models, resulting in better preservation of historical class knowledge and improved performance. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical analysis to support the necessity of the segmental feature augmentation strategy. ",

    "abstract": "Denoising Diffusion Models (DDMs) have become the leading generative technique for synthesizing high-quality images but are often constrained by their UNet-based architectures that impose certain limitations. In particular, the considerable size of often hundreds of millions of parameters makes them impractical when hardware resources are limited. However, even with powerful hardware, processing images in the gigapixel range is difficult. This is especially true in fields such as microscopy or satellite imaging, where such challenges arise from the limitation to a predefined generative size and the inefficient scaling to larger images. We present two variations of Neural Cellular Automata (NCA)-based DDM methods to address these challenges and jumpstart NCA-based DDMs: Diff-NCA and FourierDiff-NCA. Diff-NCA performs diffusion by using only local features of the underlying distribution, making it suitable for applications where local features are critical. To communicate global knowledge in image space, naive NCA setups require timesteps that increase with the image scale. We solve this bottleneck of current NCA architectures by introducing FourierDiff-NCA, which advances Diff-NCA by adding a Fourier-based diffusion process and combines the frequency-organized Fourier space with the image space. By initiating diffusion in the Fourier domain and finalizing it in the image space, FourierDiff-NCA accelerates global communication. We validate our techniques by using Diff-NCA (208k parameters) to generate high-resolution digital pathology scans at 576x576 resolution and FourierDiff-NCA (887k parameters) to synthesize CelebA images at 64x64, outperforming VNCA and five times bigger UNet-based DDMs. In addition, we demonstrate FourierDiff-NCA's capabilities in super-resolution, OOD image synthesis, and inpainting without additional training.

    "abstract": "To address the evolving landscape of next-generation mobile networks, characterized by an increasing number of connected users, surging traffic demands, and the continuous emergence of new services, a novel communication paradigm is essential. One promising candidate is the integration of network slicing and in-network computing, offering resource isolation, deterministic networking, enhanced resource efficiency, network expansion, and energy conservation. Although prior research has explored resource allocation within network slicing, routing, and in-network computing independently, a comprehensive investigation into their joint approach has been lacking. This paper tackles the joint problem of network slicing, path selection, and the allocation of in-network and cloud computing resources, aiming to maximize the number of accepted users while minimizing energy consumption. First, we introduce a Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) formulation of the problem and analyze its complexity, proving that the problem is NP-hard. Next, a Water Filling-based Joint Slicing, Routing, and In-Network Computing (WF-JSRIN) heuristic algorithm is proposed to solve it. Finally, a comparative analysis was conducted among WF-JSRIN, a random allocation technique, and two optimal approaches, namely Opt-IN (utilizing in-network computation) and Opt-C (solely relying on cloud node resources). The results emphasize WF-JSRIN's efficiency in delivering highly efficient near-optimal solutions with significantly reduced execution times, solidifying its suitability for practical real-world applications.

Our key idea lies in a dimension compression scheme including a dimension compressing vector that applies to individual node states to generate a real-valued message for node communication as an inner product, and a data unfolding step in the local computations where the scalar message is plotted along the subspace generated by the compression vector. We first present a compressed average consensus flow that relies only on such scalar communication, and show that exponential convergence can be achieved with well excited signals for the compression vector. We then employ such a compressed consensus flow as a fundamental consensus subroutine to develop distributed continuous-time and discrete-time solvers for network linear equations, and prove their exponential convergence properties under scalar node communications. With scalar communications, a direct benefit would be the reduced node-to-node communication channel capacity requirement for distributed computing.

In Hyper-STTN, crowded group-wise correlations are constructed using a set of multi-scale hypergraphs with varying group sizes, captured through random-walk robability-based hypergraph spectral convolution. Additionally, a spatial-temporal transformer is adapted to capture pedestrians' pair-wise latent interactions in spatial-temporal dimensions. These heterogeneous group-wise and pair-wise are then fused and aligned though a multimodal transformer network.

However, the substantial computational overheads associated with these models result in high inference latency, limiting their feasibility as practical prefetchers. To close the gap, we propose a new approach based on tabularization that significantly reduces model complexity and inference latency without sacrificing prediction accuracy. Our novel tabularization methodology takes as input a distilled, yet highly accurate attention-based model for memory access prediction and efficiently converts its expensive matrix multiplications into a hierarchy of fast table lookups. As an exemplar of the above approach, we develop DART, a prefetcher comprised of a simple hierarchy of tables. With a modest 0.09 drop in F1-score, DART reduces 99.99% of arithmetic operations from the large attention-based model and 91.83% from the distilled model. DART accelerates the large model inference by 170x and the distilled model by 9.4x. DART has comparable latency and storage costs as state-of-the-art rule-based prefetcher BO but surpasses it by 6.1% in IPC improvement, resulting in a 37.6% speed-up. DART outperforms state-of-the-art NN-based prefetchers TransFetch by 33.1% and Voyager by 37.2% in terms of IPC improvement, primarily due to its low prefetching latency. ",

Companies like Nvidia, Amazon, Sony and Microsoft are investing in building cloud gaming platforms to tap this large unserved market. However, cloud gaming requires the user to have high bandwidth and stable network connectivity - whereas a typical console game needs about 100-200 kbps, a cloud game demands minimum 10-20 Mbps. This makes the Internet Service Provider (ISP) a key player in ensuring the end-user's good gaming experience. In this paper we develop a method to detect user experience to detect Nvidia's GeForce NOW cloud gaming sessions over their network infrastructure, and measure associated user experience. In particular, we envision ISPs taking advantage of our method to provision network capacity at the right time and in the right place to support growth in cloud gaming at the right experience level; as well as identify the role of contextual factors such as user setup (browser vs app) and connectivity type (wired vs wireless) in performance degradation. We first present a detailed anatomy of flow establishment and volumetric profiles of cloud gaming sessions over multiple platforms, followed by a method to detect gameplay and measure key experience aspects such as latency, frame rate and resolution via real-time analysis of network traffic. The insights and methods are also validated in the lab for XBox Cloud Gaming platform. We then implement and deploy our method in a campus network to capture gameplay behaviors and experience measures across various user setups and connectivity types which we believe are valuable for network operators.

Knowledge distillation offers a solution by transferring distilled knowledge from heavy teacher networks to lightweight yet high-performance student networks. However, existing knowledge distillation methods struggle to extract knowledge for distinguishing instances and overlook global relation information. To address these challenges, we propose a graph relation distillation approach for efficient biomedical instance segmentation, which considers three essential types of knowledge: instance-level features, instance relations, and pixel-level boundaries. We introduce two graph distillation schemes deployed at both the intra-image level and the inter-image level: instance graph distillation (IGD) and affinity graph distillation (AGD). IGD constructs a graph representing instance features and relations, transferring these two types of knowledge by enforcing instance graph consistency. AGD constructs an affinity graph representing pixel relations to capture structured knowledge of instance boundaries, transferring boundary-related knowledge by ensuring pixel affinity consistency. Experimental results on a number of biomedical datasets validate the effectiveness of our approach, enabling student models with less than $ 1\\%$ parameters and less than $10\\%$ inference time while achieving promising performance compared to teacher models.

There are many advantages of foundation model, such as excellent feature extraction power, mighty generalization ability, great few-shot and zero-shot learning capacity, etc. which are beneficial to vision tasks. As the unique identity of vehicle, different countries and regions have diverse license plate (LP) styles and appearances, and even different types of vehicles have different LPs.

The MA communication model is an enhancement of the classical communication model, where in addition to the usual players Alice and Bob, there is an all-powerful but untrusted player Merlin who knows their inputs and tries to convince them about the output. Most functions have MA protocols with total communication significantly smaller than what would be needed without Merlin. We focus on the online MA (OMA) model, which is the MA analogue of one-way communication, and introduce the notion of \\emph{non-trivial-OMA} complexity of a function. This is the minimum total communication needed by any non-trivial OMA protocol computing that function, where a trivial OMA protocol is one where Alice sends Bob roughly as many bits as she would have sent without Merlin. We prove a lower bound on the non-trivial-OMA complexity of a natural function \\emph{Equals-Index} (basically the well-known Index problem on large domains) and identify it as a canonical problem for proving strong lower bounds on this complexity: reductions from it (i) reproduce and/or improve upon the lower bounds for all functions that were previously known to have large non-trivial-OMA complexity, (ii) exhibit the first explicit functions whose non-trivial-OMA complexity is superlinear, and even exponential, in their classical one-way complexity, and (iii) show functions on input size $n$ for which this complexity is as large as $n/\\log n$. While exhibiting a function with $\\omega(\\sqrt{n})$ (standard) OMA complexity is a longstanding open problem, we did not even know of any function with $\\omega(\\sqrt{n})$ non-trivial-OMA complexity.

In this work, we introduce ToolGen, an approach that integrates autocompletion tools into the code LLM generation process to address these dependencies. ToolGen comprises two main phases: Data Augmentation and Model Fine-tuning (Offline), and Tool-integrated Code Generation (Online). During the offline phase, ToolGen augments functions within a given code corpus with a special mark token, indicating positions to trigger autocompletion tools. These augmented functions, along with their corresponding docstrings, are then used to fine-tune a selected code LLM. In the online phase, ToolGen iteratively generates functions by predicting tokens step-by-step using the fine-tuned LLM. Whenever a mark token is encountered, ToolGen invokes the autocompletion tool to suggest code completions and selects the most appropriate one. We conduct comprehensive experiments to evaluate ToolGen's effectiveness in repository-level code generation. To facilitate this evaluation, we create a benchmark comprising 680 real-world code repositories and introduce two new repository-level metrics: Dependency Coverage and Success Rate. The results demonstrate that ToolGen significantly improves dependency coverage by 15.2% to 45.8% and success rates by 10.9% to 42.2% across three distinct code LLMs, while maintaining competitive performance in widely-recognized similarity metrics. Furthermore, our generalizability evaluation confirms ToolGen's consistent performance when applied to diverse code LLMs, including various model architectures and scales. ",

    "abstract": "How to evaluate Large Language Models (LLMs) in code generation is an open question. Many benchmarks have been proposed but are inconsistent with practical software projects, e.g., unreal program distributions, insufficient dependencies, and small-scale project contexts. Thus, the capabilities of LLMs in practical projects are still unclear. In this paper, we propose a new benchmark named DevEval, aligned with Developers' experiences in practical projects. DevEval is collected through a rigorous pipeline, containing 2,690 samples from 119 practical projects and covering 10 domains. Compared to previous benchmarks, DevEval aligns to practical projects in multiple dimensions, e.g., real program distributions, sufficient dependencies, and enough-scale project contexts. We assess five popular LLMs on DevEval (e.g., gpt-4, gpt-3.5-turbo, CodeLLaMa, and StarCoder) and reveal their actual abilities in code generation. For instance, the highest Pass@1 of gpt-3.5-turbo only is 42 in our experiments. We also discuss the challenges and future directions of code generation in practical projects. We open-source DevEval and hope it can facilitate the development of code generation in practical projects. ",

    "abstract": "Background: Simultaneously focusing on intra- and inter-individual body dynamics and elucidating how these affect each other will help understand human inter-personal coordination behavior. However, this association has not been investigated previously owing to difficulties in analyzing complex causal relations among several body components.To address this issue, this study proposes a new analytical framework that attempts to understand the underlying causal structures behind each joint movement of individual baseball players using neural Granger causality (NGC) as the explainable AI. Methods: In the NGC analysis, causal relationships were defined as the size of the weight parameters of the first layer of a machine-learning model trained to predict the future state of a specific time-series variable. To verify the approach in a practical context, we conducted an experiment with 16 pairs of expert baseball pitchers and batters; input datasets with 27 joint resultant velocity data (joints of 13 pitchers and 14 batters) were generated and used for model training.Results: NGC analysis revealed significant causal relations among intra- and inter-individual body components such as the batter's hands having a causal effect from the pitcher's throwing arm. Remarkably, although the causality from the batter's body to pitcher's body is much lower than the reverse, it is significantly correlated with batter performance outcomes. Conclusions: The above results suggest the effectiveness of NGC analysis for understanding whole-body inter-personal coordination dynamics and that of the AI technique as a new approach for analyzing complex human behavior from a different perspective than conventional techniques.

Conformal prediction provides a model-agnostic framework for uncertainty quantification that can be applied to any dataset, irrespective of its distribution, post hoc. In contrast to other pixel-level uncertainty quantification methods, conformal prediction operates without requiring access to the underlying model and training dataset, concurrently offering statistically valid and informative prediction regions, all while maintaining computational efficiency. In response to the increased need to report uncertainty alongside point predictions, we bring attention to the promise of conformal prediction within the domain of Earth Observation (EO) applications. To accomplish this, we assess the current state of uncertainty quantification in the EO domain and found that only 20% of the reviewed Google Earth Engine (GEE) datasets incorporated a degree of uncertainty information, with unreliable methods prevalent. Next, we introduce modules that seamlessly integrate into existing GEE predictive modelling workflows and demonstrate the application of these tools for datasets spanning local to global scales, including the Dynamic World and Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) datasets. These case studies encompass regression and classification tasks, featuring both traditional and deep learning-based workflows. Subsequently, we discuss the opportunities arising from the use of conformal prediction in EO. We anticipate that the increased availability of easy-to-use implementations of conformal predictors, such as those provided here, will drive wider adoption of rigorous uncertainty quantification in EO, thereby enhancing the reliability of uses such as operational monitoring and decision making.

    "abstract": "Large foundation models (FMs) adapt surprisingly well to specific domains or tasks with fine-tuning. Federated learning (FL) further enables private FM fine-tuning using the local data on devices. However, the standard FMs' large size poses challenges for resource-constrained and heterogeneous devices. To address this, we consider FMs with reduced parameter sizes, referred to as on-device FMs (ODFMs). While ODFMs allow on-device inference, computational constraints still hinder efficient federated fine-tuning. We propose a parameter-efficient federated fine-tuning method for ODFMs using heterogeneous low-rank approximations (LoRAs) that addresses system and data heterogeneity. We show that homogeneous LoRA ranks face a trade-off between overfitting and slow convergence, and propose HetLoRA, which employs heterogeneous ranks across clients and eliminates the shortcomings of homogeneous HetLoRA. By applying rank self-pruning locally and sparsity-weighted aggregation at the server, we combine the advantages of high and low-rank LoRAs, which achieves improved convergence speed and final performance compared to homogeneous LoRA. Furthermore, it offers enhanced computation efficiency compared to full fine-tuning, making it suitable for heterogeneous devices while preserving data privacy. ",

    "abstract": "Artificial light plays an integral role in modern cities, significantly enhancing human productivity and the efficiency of civilization. However, excessive illumination can lead to light pollution, posing non-negligible threats to economic burdens, ecosystems, and human health. Despite its critical importance, the exploration of its causes remains relatively limited within the field of artificial intelligence, leaving an incomplete understanding of the factors contributing to light pollution and sustainable illumination planning distant. To address this gap, we introduce a novel framework named Causally Aware Generative Adversarial Networks (CAGAN). This innovative approach aims to uncover the fundamental drivers of light pollution within cities and offer intelligent solutions for optimal illumination resource allocation in the context of sustainable urban development. We commence by examining light pollution across 33,593 residential areas in seven global metropolises. Our findings reveal substantial influences on light pollution levels from various building types, notably grasslands, commercial centers and residential buildings as significant contributors. These discovered causal relationships are seamlessly integrated into the generative modeling framework, guiding the process of generating light pollution maps for diverse residential areas. Extensive experiments showcase CAGAN's potential to inform and guide the implementation of effective strategies to mitigate light pollution.

Our strategy incorporates 3-fold improvements: (1) local data augmentations, (2) a hierarchically balanced architecture, and (3) a hybrid contrastive-restorative loss function.

The core of the new arguments lies in devising energy estimates directly for the error equation where one can more easily exploit the polynomial structure of the nonlinearities and compensate inverse estimates with smallness conditions on the error.

Drawing on twelve years of administrative data at a large public university in the US, we find that dropout prediction at the end of the second year has a 20% higher AUC than at the time of enrollment in a Random Forest model. Also, most predictive factors at the time of enrollment, including demographics and high school performance, are quickly superseded in predictive importance by college performance and in later stages by enrollment behavior. Regarding variability across student groups, college GPA has more predictive value for students from traditionally disadvantaged backgrounds than their peers. These results can help researchers and administrators understand the comparative value of different data sources when building early warning systems and optimizing decisions under specific policy goals.

We designed the Attention-Points Network consisting of two losses: Guided-Attention Loss (GALoss) and Box-Points Loss (BPLoss). GALoss uses an instance segmentation mask as ground-truth to learn the attention features needed to improve the detection of small objects. These attention features are then used to predict box points for BPLoss, which determines the points' position relative to the target oriented bounding box. Experimental results show the effectiveness of our Attention-Points Network on a standard oriented aerial dataset with small object instances (DOTA-v1.5) and on a maritime-related dataset (HRSC2016).

    "abstract": "While Large Language Models (LLMs) based agents have successfully mimicked human behaviors in various scenarios, the realm of complex, multi-character social interactions within extended contexts remains underexplored. The challenge is compounded by privacy concerns, making it difficult to capture and utilize intricate real-life interactions. More importantly, the absence of quantitative evaluation methods hampers the pursuit of high-quality agent interactions, often leading to interactions that are limited in informativeness and expressiveness, characterized by superficial small talk without clear intentions. In this work, we leverage the rules of Tabletop Role-Playing Games (TRPG) to create an environment conducive to complex, context-rich interactions, emphasizing informativeness and expressiveness. This virtual setting alleviates privacy concerns and motivates agents to engage in meaningful, high-quality interactions as part of their in-game objectives. To assess these interactions, we introduce the Agent interaction Evaluation framework (AntEval), targeting the qualitative evaluation of interaction informativeness and expressiveness. Specifically, we propose two novel evaluation metrics: Information Exchanging Precision (IEP) and Interaction Expressiveness Gap (IEG). These metrics are designed to assess interactions in scenarios focused on information exchange and intention expression, respectively. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of these metrics in evaluating interaction quality. Notably, we identify significant areas for improvement in LLMs regarding social interactions, as highlighted by our metrics. We believe AntEval will guide further exploration in complex agent interactions, bringing them closer to emulating real human behavior and enhancing their integration and utility in real-world applications.

However, existing network-slicing architectures lack the ability to define intelligent approaches to orchestrate features and resources in the slicing process. This paper discusses machine learning-based orchestration of features and capabilities in network slicing architectures. Initially, the slice resource orchestration and allocation in the slicing planning, configuration, commissioning, and operation phases are analyzed. In sequence, we highlight the need for optimized architectural feature orchestration and recommend using ML-embed agents, federated learning intrinsic mechanisms for knowledge acquisition, and a data-driven approach embedded in the network slicing architecture. We further develop an architectural features orchestration case embedded in the SFI2 network slicing architecture. An attack prevention security mechanism is developed for the SFI2 architecture using distributed embedded and cooperating ML agents. The case presented illustrates the architectural feature's orchestration process and benefits, highlighting its importance for the network slicing process. ",

How to identify hidden confounders poses a key challenge in ITE estimation. Recent studies have incorporated the structural information of social networks to tackle this challenge, achieving notable advancements. However, these methods utilize graph neural networks to learn the representation of hidden confounders in Euclidean space, disregarding two critical issues: (1) the social networks often exhibit a scalefree structure, while Euclidean embeddings suffer from high distortion when used to embed such graphs, and (2) each ego-centric network within a social network manifests a treatment-related characteristic, implying significant patterns of hidden confounders. To address these issues, we propose a novel method called Treatment-Aware Hyperbolic Representation Learning (TAHyper). Firstly, TAHyper employs the hyperbolic space to encode the social networks, thereby effectively reducing the distortion of confounder representation caused by Euclidean embeddings. Secondly, we design a treatment-aware relationship identification module that enhances the representation of hidden confounders by identifying whether an individual and her neighbors receive the same treatment.

    "abstract": "This work proposes a novel approach for hand gesture recognition using an inexpensive, low-resolution (24 x 32) thermal sensor processed by a Spiking Neural Network (SNN) followed by Sparse Segmentation and feature-based gesture classification via Robust Principal Component Analysis (R-PCA). Compared to the use of standard RGB cameras, the proposed system is insensitive to lighting variations while being significantly less expensive compared to high-frequency radars, time-of-flight cameras and high-resolution thermal sensors previously used in literature. Crucially, this paper shows that the innovative use of the recently proposed Monostable Multivibrator (MMV) neural networks as a new class of SNN achieves more than one order of magnitude smaller memory and compute complexity compared to deep learning approaches, while reaching a top gesture recognition accuracy of 93.9% using a 5-class thermal camera dataset acquired in a car cabin, within an automotive context. Our dataset is released for helping future research. ",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we introduce the maximum casual entropy Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) problem for discrete-time mean-field games (MFGs) under an infinite-horizon discounted-reward optimality criterion. The state space of a typical agent is finite. Our approach begins with a comprehensive review of the maximum entropy IRL problem concerning deterministic and stochastic Markov decision processes (MDPs) in both finite and infinite-horizon scenarios. Subsequently, we formulate the maximum casual entropy IRL problem for MFGs - a non-convex optimization problem with respect to policies. Leveraging the linear programming formulation of MDPs, we restructure this IRL problem into a convex optimization problem and establish a gradient descent algorithm to compute the optimal solution with a rate of convergence. Finally, we present a new algorithm by formulating the MFG problem as a generalized Nash equilibrium problem (GNEP), which is capable of computing the mean-field equilibrium (MFE) for the forward RL problem. This method is employed to produce data for a numerical example. We note that this novel algorithm is also applicable to general MFE computations. ",

Key figures like politicians, celebrities and activists have leveraged on its wide user base for strategic communication. Strategic communications, or StratCom, is the deliberate act of information creation and distribution. Its techniques are used by these key figures for establishing their brand and amplifying their messages. Automated scripts are used on top of personal touches to quickly and effectively perform these tasks. The combination of automation and manual online posting creates a Cyborg social media profile, which is a hybrid between bot and human. In this study, we establish a quantitative definition for a Cyborg account, which is an account that are detected as bots in one time window, and identified as humans in another. This definition makes use of frequent changes of bot classification labels and large differences in bot likelihood scores to identify Cyborgs. We perform a large-scale analysis across over 3.1 million users from Twitter collected from two key events, the 2020 Coronavirus pandemic and 2020 US Elections. We extract Cyborgs from two datasets and employ tools from network science, natural language processing and manual annotation to characterize Cyborg accounts. Our analyses identify Cyborg accounts are mostly constructed for strategic communication uses, have a strong duality in their bot/human classification and are tactically positioned in the social media network, aiding these accounts to promote their desired content. Cyborgs are also discovered to have long online lives, indicating their ability to evade bot detectors, or the graciousness of platforms to allow their operations. ",

Self-supervised learning (SSL) shows great potential in handling this task, and some recent studies simultaneously learn multiple SSL tasks to further boost performance. Currently, different SSL tasks are assigned the same set of weights for all graph nodes. However, we observe that some graph nodes whose neighbors are in different groups require significantly different emphases on SSL tasks. In this paper, we propose to dynamically learn the weights of SSL tasks for different nodes and fuse the embeddings learned from different SSL tasks to boost performance. We design an innovative graph clustering approach, namely Dynamically Fusing Self-Supervised Learning (DyFSS). Specifically, DyFSS fuses features extracted from diverse SSL tasks using distinct weights derived from a gating network. To effectively learn the gating network, we design a dual-level self-supervised strategy that incorporates pseudo labels and the graph structure. Extensive experiments on five datasets show that DyFSS outperforms the state-of-the-art multi-task SSL methods by up to 8.66% on the accuracy metric.

Nevertheless, the versatility of these models extends beyond their generative capabilities to encompass various vision applications, such as image inpainting, segmentation, adversarial robustness, among others. This study is dedicated to the investigation of adversarial attacks through the lens of diffusion models. However, our objective does not involve enhancing the adversarial robustness of image classifiers. Instead, our focus lies in utilizing the diffusion model to detect and analyze the anomalies introduced by these attacks on images. To that end, we systematically examine the alignment of the distributions of adversarial examples when subjected to the process of transformation using diffusion models. The efficacy of this approach is assessed across CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets, including varying image sizes in the latter. The results demonstrate a notable capacity to discriminate effectively between benign and attacked images, providing compelling evidence that adversarial instances do not align with the learned manifold of the DMs. ",

Therefore, to balance the high-localization requirements of RSU and the privacy of the vehicles, we demonstrate a new spatial-provenance framework wherein the vehicles agree to compromise their privacy to a certain extent and share a low-precision variant of its coordinates in agreement with the demands of the RSU. To study the deployment feasibility of the proposed framework in state-of-the-art wireless standards, we propose a testbed of ZigBee and LoRa devices and implement the underlying protocols on their stack using correlated Bloom filters and Rake compression algorithms. Our demonstrations reveal that low-to-moderate precision localization can be achieved in fewer packets, thus making an appealing case for next-generation vehicular networks to include our methods for providing real-time security and network-diagnostics features.

However, it is now well known that LMs can demonstrate radical improvements in the presence of experimental contexts such as in-context examples and instructions. How well does this translate to previously studied meaning-sensitive tasks? We present a case-study on the extent to which experimental contexts can improve LMs' robustness in performing property inheritance -- predicting semantic properties of novel concepts, a task that they have been previously shown to fail on. Upon carefully controlling the nature of the in-context examples and the instructions, our work reveals that they can indeed lead to non-trivial property inheritance behavior in LMs. However, this ability is inconsistent: with a minimal reformulation of the task, some LMs were found to pick up on shallow, non-semantic heuristics from their inputs, suggesting that the computational principles of semantic property inference are yet to be mastered by LMs. ",

Using these incentive methods as part of instructions to LLMs augmenting text datasets, we measure their effects on generated texts' lexical diversity and downstream model performance. We compare the effects over 5 different LLMs and 6 datasets. We show that diversity is most increased by taboo words, while downstream model performance is highest when previously created paraphrases are used as hints. ",

To alleviate the impact of seizure, predictive systems have been developed that can notify such patients of an impending seizure, allowing them to take precautionary measures.

SeizNet DL algorithms are designed for efficient real-time execution at the edge, minimizing data privacy concerns, data transmission overhead, and power inefficiencies associated with cloud-based solutions. Our results indicate that SeizNet outperforms traditional single-modality and non-personalized prediction systems in all metrics, achieving up to 99% accuracy in predicting seizure, offering a promising new avenue in refractory epilepsy treatment.

However, systematic testing of compilers is infeasible, given the vast space of possible programs and the complexity of modern programming languages. In this context, differential testing offers a practical methodology as it addresses the oracle problem by comparing the output of alternative compilers given the same set of programs as input. In this paper, we investigate the effectiveness of differential testing in finding bugs within the Kotlin compilers developed at JetBrains. We propose a black-box generative approach that creates input programs for the K1 and K2 compilers. First, we build workable models of Kotlin semantic (semantic interface) and syntactic (enriched context-free grammar) language features, which are subsequently exploited to generate random code snippets. Second, we extend random sampling by introducing two genetic algorithms (GAs) that aim to generate more diverse input programs. Our case study shows that the proposed approach effectively detects bugs in K1 and K2; these bugs have been confirmed and (some) fixed by JetBrains developers. While we do not observe a significant difference w.r.t. the number of defects uncovered by the different search algorithms, random search and GAs are complementary as they find different categories of bugs. Finally, we provide insights into the relationships between the size, complexity, and fault detection capability of the generated input programs. ",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a comprehensive communication theoretic model for the physical layer of a cell-free user-centric network, formed by user equipments (UEs), radio units (RUs), and decentralized units (DUs), uniformly spatially distributed over a given coverage area. We consider RUs equipped with multiple antennas, and focus on the regime where the UE, RU, and DU densities are constant and therefore the number of such nodes grows with the coverage area. A system is said scalable if the computing load and information rate at any node in the network converges to a constant as the network size (coverage area) grows to infinity. This imposes that each UE must be processed by a (user-centric) finite-size cluster of RUs, and that such cluster processors are dynamically allocated to the DUs (e.g., as software defined virtual network functions) in order to achieve a balanced computation load. We also assume that the RUs are connected to the DUs through a packet switching network, in order to achieve adaptive routing and load balance. For this model, we define in details the dynamic cluster formation and uplink pilot allocation. As a consequence of the pilot allocation and the scalability constraint, each cluster processor has a partial view of the network channel state information. We define the condition of ``ideal partial CSI'' when the channel vectors that can be estimated are perfectly known (while the ones that cannot be estimated are not know at all). We develop two attractive cluster-based linear receiver schemes for the uplink, and an uplink-downlink duality that allows to reuse such vectors as precoders for the downlink. ",

Here, we address settings in which an important confounding variable is completely unobserved. We propose a new causal inference method that splits pre-treatment text data, infers two proxies from two zero-shot models on the separate splits, and applies these proxies in the proximal g-formula. We prove that our text-based proxy method satisfies identification conditions required by the proximal g-formula while other seemingly reasonable proposals do not. We evaluate our method in synthetic and semi-synthetic settings and find that it produces estimates with low bias. This combination of proximal causal inference and zero-shot classifiers is novel (to our knowledge) and expands the set of text-specific causal methods available to practitioners. ",

Unlike existing approaches that are based on back-propagation (BP) and chain rule gradient-based optimization (which implies iterative execution, potentially burdensome and time-consuming in some cases), the proposed approach offers the solution for weight optimization in closed-form by means of least squares (LS) methodology. In the case where the input-to-output mapping is injective, the new approach optimizes the weights in a back-propagating fashion in a single iteration by jointly optimizing a set of weights in each layer for each neuron. In the case where the input-to-output mapping is not injective (e.g., in classification problems), the proposed solution is easily adapted to obtain its final solution in a few iterations. An important advantage over the existing solutions is that these computations (for all neurons in a layer) are independent from each other; thus, they can be carried out in parallel to optimize all weights in a given layer simultaneously. Furthermore, its running time is deterministic in the sense that one can obtain the exact number of computations necessary to optimize the weights in all network layers (per iteration, in the case of non-injective mapping). Our simulation and empirical results show that the proposed scheme, BPLS, works well and is competitive with existing ones in terms of accuracy, but significantly surpasses them in terms of running time. To summarize, the new method is straightforward to implement, is competitive and computationally more efficient than the existing ones, and is well-tailored for parallel implementation. ",

    "abstract": "We introduce a highly efficient method for panoptic segmentation of large 3D point clouds by redefining this task as a scalable graph clustering problem. This approach can be trained using only local auxiliary tasks, thereby eliminating the resource-intensive instance-matching step during training. Moreover, our formulation can easily be adapted to the superpoint paradigm, further increasing its efficiency. This allows our model to process scenes with millions of points and thousands of objects in a single inference. Our method, called SuperCluster, achieves a new state-of-the-art panoptic segmentation performance for two indoor scanning datasets: $50.1$ PQ ($+7.8$) for S3DIS Area~5, and $58.7$ PQ ($+25.2$) for ScanNetV2. We also set the first state-of-the-art for two large-scale mobile mapping benchmarks: KITTI-360 and DALES. With only $209$k parameters, our model is over $30$ times smaller than the best-competing method and trains up to $15$ times faster.

    "abstract": "The advent of instruction-tuned language models that convincingly mimic human writing poses a significant risk of abuse. For example, such models could be used for plagiarism, disinformation, spam, or phishing. However, such abuse may be counteracted with the ability to detect whether a piece of text was composed by a language model rather than a human. Some previous approaches to this problem have relied on supervised methods trained on corpora of confirmed human and machine-written documents. Unfortunately, model under-specification poses an unavoidable challenge for neural network-based detectors, making them brittle in the face of data shifts, such as the release of further language models producing still more fluent text than the models used to train the detectors. Other previous approaches require access to the models that may have generated a document in question at inference or detection time, which is often impractical. In light of these challenges, we pursue a fundamentally different approach not relying on samples from language models of concern at training time. Instead, we propose to leverage representations of writing style estimated from human-authored text. Indeed, we find that features effective at distinguishing among human authors are also effective at distinguishing human from machine authors, including state of the art large language models like Llama 2, ChatGPT, and GPT-4. Furthermore, given a handful of examples composed by each of several specific language models of interest, our approach affords the ability to predict which model generated a given document. ",

However, advancements in stylometry have provided opportunities for automatic authorship and author change detection in multi-authored documents using style analysis techniques. Style analysis can serve as a primary step toward document provenance and authentication through authorship detection. This paper investigates three key tasks of style analysis: (i) classification of single and multi-authored documents, (ii) single change detection, which involves identifying the point where the author switches, and (iii) multiple author-switching detection in multi-authored documents. We formulate all three tasks as classification problems and propose a merit-based fusion framework that integrates several state-of-the-art natural language processing (NLP) algorithms and weight optimization techniques. We also explore the potential of special characters, which are typically removed during pre-processing in NLP applications, on the performance of the proposed methods for these tasks by conducting extensive experiments on both cleaned and raw datasets.

In particular, knowing if pedestrians are going to cross in front of the ego-vehicle is core to performing safe and comfortable maneuvers. Creating accurate and fast models that predict such intentions from sequential images is challenging. A factor contributing to this is the lack of datasets with diverse crossing and non-crossing (C/NC) scenarios. We address this scarceness by introducing a framework, named ARCANE, which allows programmatically generating synthetic datasets consisting of C/NC video clip samples. As an example, we use ARCANE to generate a large and diverse dataset named PedSynth. We will show how PedSynth complements widely used real-world datasets such as JAAD and PIE, so enabling more accurate models for C/NC prediction. Considering the onboard deployment of C/NC prediction models, we also propose a deep model named PedGNN, which is fast and has a very low memory footprint. PedGNN is based on a GNN-GRU architecture that takes a sequence of pedestrian skeletons as input to predict crossing intentions. ",

For the pre-training process, we designed a task for molecular canonicalization, which involves transforming ltiple generic molecular representations into canonical representations. By adjusting the granularity of molecular encoding, the trained model can improve the effects on multiple downstream tasks, such as model attribute prediction and molecule generation. Substructure-level molecular representation retains information of specific atom groups or arrangements that determine chemical properties and have similar functions, which is beneficial for tasks like property prediction. Meanwhile, atomic-level representation, combined with generative molecular canonicalization pre-training tasks, enhances the validity, novelty, and uniqueness in generative tasks. These features of AdaMR demonstrate its strong performance in numerous downstream tasks.

Each of the two main exact simulation techniques, state vector and tensor network simulators, boasts specific limitations. The exponential memory requirement of state vector simulation, when compared to the qubit register sizes of currently available quantum computers, quickly saturates the capacity of the top HPC machines currently available. Tensor network contraction approaches, which encode quantum circuits into tensor networks and then contract them over an output bit string to obtain its probability amplitude, still fall short of the inherent complexity of finding an optimal contraction path, which maps to a max-cut problem on a dense mesh, a notably NP-hard problem. This article aims at investigating the limits of current state-of-the-art simulation techniques on a test bench made of eight widely used quantum subroutines, each in 31 different configurations, with special emphasis on performance.

This paper proposes a generative adversarial network (GAN) based BWE model with parallel prediction of Amplitude and Phase spectra, named AP-BWE, which achieves both high-quality and efficient wideband speech waveform generation. The proposed AP-BWE generator is entirely based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs). It features a dual-stream architecture with mutual interaction, where the amplitude stream and the phase stream communicate with each other and respectively extend the high-frequency components from the input narrowband amplitude and phase spectra. To improve the naturalness of the extended speech signals, we employ a multi-period discriminator at the waveform level and design a pair of multi-resolution amplitude and phase discriminators at the spectral level, respectively. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed AP-BWE achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of speech quality for BWE tasks targeting sampling rates of both 16 kHz and 48 kHz. In terms of generation efficiency, due to the all-convolutional architecture and all-frame-level operations, the proposed AP-BWE can generate 48 kHz waveform samples 292.3 times faster than real-time on a single RTX 4090 GPU and 18.1 times faster than real-time on a single CPU.

    "title": "Directed network comparison using motifs",
    "abstract": "Analyzing and characterizing the differences between networks is a fundamental and challenging problem in network science. Previously, most network comparison methods that rely on topological properties have been restricted to measuring differences between two undirected networks. However, many networks, such as biological networks, social networks, and transportation networks, exhibit inherent directionality and higher-order attributes that should not be ignored when comparing networks. Therefore, we propose a motif-based directed network comparison method that captures local, global, and higher-order differences between two directed networks. Specifically, we first construct a motif distribution vector for each node, which captures the information of a node's involvement in different directed motifs. Then, the dissimilarity between two directed networks is defined on the basis of a matrix which is composed of the motif distribution vector of every node and Jensen-Shannon divergence. The performance of our method is evaluated via the comparison of six real directed networks with their null models as well as their perturbed networks based on edge perturbation. Our method is superior to the state-of-the-art baselines and is robust with different parameter settings. ",

    "abstract": "We present a boosting-based method to learn additive Structural Equation Models (SEMs) from observational data, with a focus on the theoretical aspects of determining the causal order among variables. We introduce a family of score functions based on arbitrary regression techniques, for which we establish necessary conditions to consistently favor the true causal ordering. Our analysis reveals that boosting with early stopping meets these criteria and thus offers a consistent score function for causal orderings. To address the challenges posed by high-dimensional data sets, we adapt our approach through a component-wise gradient descent in the space of additive SEMs. Our simulation study underlines our theoretical results for lower dimensions and demonstrates that our high-dimensional adaptation is competitive with state-of-the-art methods. In addition, it exhibits robustness with respect to the choice of the hyperparameters making the procedure easy to tune. ",
