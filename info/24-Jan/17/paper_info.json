    "title": "Semantic Segment Based Semantic Parsing for Question Answering over  Knowledge Graphs",
    "abstract": "In this paper, we introduce a novel method named \"graph-to-segment\" for question answering over knowledge graphs, focusing on understanding question utterances. This method centers on semantic parsing, a key approach for interpreting these utterances. Our primary challenge lies in comprehending implicit entities, relationships, and complex constraints like time, ordinality, and aggregation within questions, contextualized by the knowledge graph. Our framework employs a combination of rule-based and neural-based techniques to parse and construct highly accurate and comprehensive semantic segment sequences. These sequences form semantic query graphs, effectively representing question utterances. We approach question semantic parsing as a sequence generation task, utilizing an encoder-decoder neural network to transform natural language questions into semantic segments. Moreover, to enhance the parsing of implicit entities and relations, we incorporate a graph neural network that leverages the context of the knowledge graph to better understand question representations. Our experimental evaluations on two datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and superior performance of our model in semantic parsing for question answering. ",

    "abstract": "Social media accounts post increasingly similar content, creating a chaotic experience across platforms, which makes accessing desired information difficult. These posts can be organized by categorizing and grouping duplicates across social handles and accounts. There can be more than one duplicate of a post, however, a conventional Siamese neural network only considers a pair of inputs for duplicate text detection. In this paper, we first propose a multiple-input Siamese network, MultiSiam. This condensed network is then used to propose another model, SMCD (Social Media Classification and Duplication Model) to perform both duplicate text grouping and categorization. The MultiSiam network, just like the Siamese, can be used in multiple applications by changing the sub-network appropriately. ",

    "abstract": "The Internet is currently the largest platform for global communication including expressions of opinions, reviews, contents, images, videos and so forth. Moreover, social media has now become a very broad and highly engaging platform due to its immense popularity and swift adoption trend. Increased social networking, however, also has detrimental impacts on the society leading to a range of unwanted phenomena, such as online assault, intimidation, digital bullying, criminality and trolling. Hence, cyberbullying has become a pervasive and worrying problem that poses considerable psychological and emotional harm to the people, particularly amongst the teens and the young adults. In order to lessen its negative effects and provide victims with prompt support, a great deal of research to identify cyberbullying instances at various online platforms is emerging. In comparison to other languages, Bangla (also known as Bengali) has fewer research studies in this domain. This study demonstrates a deep learning strategy for identifying cyberbullying in Bengali, using a dataset of 12282 versatile comments from multiple social media sites. In this study, a two-layer bidirectional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM) model has been built to identify cyberbullying, using a variety of optimisers as well as 5-fold cross validation. To evaluate the functionality and efficacy of the proposed system, rigorous assessment and validation procedures have been employed throughout the project. The results of this study reveals that the proposed model's accuracy, using momentum-based stochastic gradient descent (SGD) optimiser, is 94.46%. It also reflects a higher accuracy of 95.08% and a F1 score of 95.23% using Adam optimiser as well as a better accuracy of 94.31% in 5-fold cross validation. ",

    "abstract": "The popularization of social media increases user engagements and generates a large amount of user-oriented data. Among them, text data (e.g., tweets, blogs) significantly attracts researchers and speculators to infer user attributes (e.g., age, gender, location) for fulfilling their intents. Generally, this line of work casts attribute inference as a text classification problem, and starts to leverage graph neural networks (GNNs) to utilize higher-level representations of source texts. However, these text graphs are constructed over words, suffering from high memory consumption and ineffectiveness on few labeled texts. To address this challenge, we design a text-graph-based few-shot learning model for attribute inferences on social media text data. Our model first constructs and refines a text graph using manifold learning and message passing, which offers a better trade-off between expressiveness and complexity. Afterwards, to further use cross-domain texts and unlabeled texts to improve few-shot performance, a hierarchical knowledge distillation is devised over text graph to optimize the problem, which derives better text representations, and advances model generalization ability. Experiments on social media datasets demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our model on attribute inferences with considerably fewer labeled texts. ",

Previous approaches have used prompts engineering to jailbreak LLMs and answer some toxicity questions.

To promote the further understanding of model jailbreaking by researchers, we are inspired by Representation Engineering to propose a jailbreaking method that does not require elaborate construction prompts, is not affected by model fine-tuning, and can be widely applied to any open-source LLMs in a pluggable manner. We have evaluated this method on multiple mainstream LLMs on carefully supplemented toxicity datasets, and the experimental results demonstrate the significant effectiveness of our approach. After being surprised by some interesting jailbreaking cases, we did extensive in-depth research to explore the techniques behind this method. ",

Current approaches predominantly focus on coarse-grained automatic hallucination detection or editing, overlooking nuanced error levels. In this paper, we propose a novel task -- automatic fine-grained hallucination detection -- and present a comprehensive taxonomy encompassing six hierarchically defined types of hallucination. To facilitate evaluation, we introduce a new benchmark that includes fine-grained human judgments on two LM outputs across various domains. Our analysis reveals that ChatGPT and Llama 2-Chat exhibit hallucinations in 60% and 75% of their outputs, respectively, and a majority of these hallucinations fall into categories that have been underexplored. As an initial step to address this, we train FAVA, a retrieval-augmented LM by carefully designing synthetic data generations to detect and correct fine-grained hallucinations. On our benchmark, our automatic and human evaluations show that FAVA significantly outperforms ChatGPT on fine-grained hallucination detection by a large margin though a large room for future improvement still exists. FAVA's suggested edits also improve the factuality of LM-generated text, resulting in 5-10% FActScore improvements. ",

In health applications, grounding and interpreting domain-specific and non-linguistic data is important. This paper investigates the capacity of LLMs to deliver multi-modal health predictions based on contextual information (e.g. user demographics, health knowledge) and physiological data (e.g. resting heart rate, sleep minutes). We present a comprehensive evaluation of eight state-of-the-art LLMs with diverse prompting and fine-tuning techniques on six public health datasets (PM-Data, LifeSnaps, GLOBEM, AW_FB, MIT-BIH & MIMIC-III). Our experiments cover thirteen consumer health prediction tasks in mental health, activity, metabolic, sleep, and cardiac assessment. Our fine-tuned model, Health-Alpaca exhibits comparable performance to larger models (GPT-3.5 and GPT-4), achieving the best performance in 5 out of 13 tasks. Ablation studies highlight the effectiveness of context enhancement strategies, and generalization capability of the fine-tuned models across training datasets and the size of training samples. Notably, we observe that our context enhancement can yield up to 23.8% improvement in performance. While constructing contextually rich prompts (combining user context, health knowledge and temporal information) exhibits synergistic improvement, the inclusion of health knowledge context in prompts significantly enhances overall performance.

Recent studies in MCDA have shown the relevance of considering not only current evaluations of each criterion but also past data. Past-data-based approaches carry new challenges, especially in time-varying environments. This study deals with this challenge via essential tools of signal processing, such as tensorial representations and adaptive prediction. More specifically, we structure the criteria' past data as a tensor and, by applying adaptive prediction, we compose signals with these prediction values of the criteria. Besides, we transform the prediction in the time domain into a most favorable decision making domain, called the feature domain. We present a novel extension of the MCDA method PROMETHEE II, aimed at addressing the tensor in the feature domain to obtain a ranking of alternatives. Numerical experiments were performed using real-world time series, and our approach is compared with other existing strategies. The results highlight the relevance and efficiency of our proposal, especially for nonstationary time series. ",

In this letter, we propose a novel joint code and decoder design for QLDPC codes. The constructed codes have a minimum distance of about the square root of the block length. In addition, it is, to the best of our knowledge, the first QLDPC code family where BP decoding is not impaired by short cycles of length 4. This is achieved by using an ensemble BP decoder mitigating the influence of assembled short cycles. We outline two code construction methods based on classical quasi-cyclic codes and finite geometry codes. Numerical results demonstrate outstanding decoding performance over depolarizing channels. ",

    "abstract": "Privacy poses a significant obstacle to the progress of learning analytics (LA), presenting challenges like inadequate anonymization and data misuse that current solutions struggle to address. Synthetic data emerges as a potential remedy, offering robust privacy protection. However, prior LA research on synthetic data lacks thorough evaluation, essential for assessing the delicate balance between privacy and data utility. Synthetic data must not only enhance privacy but also remain practical for data analytics. Moreover, diverse LA scenarios come with varying privacy and utility needs, making the selection of an appropriate synthetic data approach a pressing challenge. To address these gaps, we propose a comprehensive evaluation of synthetic data, which encompasses three dimensions of synthetic data quality, namely resemblance, utility, and privacy. We apply this evaluation to three distinct LA datasets, using three different synthetic data generation methods. Our results show that synthetic data can maintain similar utility (i.e., predictive performance) as real data, while preserving privacy. Furthermore, considering different privacy and data utility requirements in different LA scenarios, we make customized recommendations for synthetic data generation. This paper not only presents a comprehensive evaluation of synthetic data but also illustrates its potential in mitigating privacy concerns within the field of LA, thus contributing to a wider application of synthetic data in LA and promoting a better practice for open science.

    "abstract": "Coded caching is a technique that leverages locally cached contents at the end users to reduce the network's peak-time communication load. Coded caching has been shown to achieve significant performance gains compared to uncoded schemes and is thus considered a promising technique to boost performance in future networks by effectively trading off bandwidth for storage. The original coded caching model introduced by Maddah-Ali and Niesen does not consider the case where some users involved in the placement phase, may be offline during the delivery phase. If so, the delivery may not start or it may be wasteful to perform the delivery with fictitious demands for the offline users. In addition, the active users may require their demand to be kept private. This paper formally defines a coded caching system where some users are offline, and investigates the optimal performance with and without demand privacy against colluding users. For this novel coded caching model with offline users, achievable and converse bounds are proposed. These bounds are shown to meet under certain conditions, and otherwise to be to within a constant multiplicative gap of one another. In addition, the proposed achievable schemes have lower subpacketization and lower load compared to baseline schemes (that trivially extend known schemes so as to accommodate for privacy) in some memory regimes.

Previous research has typically focused on constant or stochastic attacks without explicitly addressing their malicious and covert characteristics. As a result, these attacks may inadvertently benefit the compromised vehicles, inconsistent with real-world scenarios. In contrast, we establish an analytical framework to model and synthesize a range of candidate attacks, offering a physical interpretation from the attacker's standpoint. Specifically, we introduce a mathematical framework that describes mixed traffic scenarios, comprising ACC vehicles and human-driven vehicles (HDVs), grounded in car-following dynamics. Within this framework, we synthesize and integrate a class of false data injection attacks into ACC sensor measurements, influencing traffic flow dynamics. As a first-of-its-kind study, this work provides an analytical characterization of attacks, emphasizing their malicious and stealthy attributes while explicitly accounting for vehicle driving behavior, thereby yielding a set of candidate attacks with physical interpretability. To demonstrate the modeling process, we perform a series of numerical simulations to holistically assess the effects of attacks on car-following dynamics, traffic efficiency, and vehicular fuel consumption. The primary findings indicate that strategically synthesized candidate attacks can cause significant disruptions to the traffic flow while altering the driving behavior of ACC vehicles in a subtle fashion to remain stealthy, which is supported by a series of analytical results.

To address this issue, this paper leverages the heterogeneous experiences of distributed units (DUs) in ORAN systems and introduces a novel approach to ORAN slicing xApp using distributed deep reinforcement learning (DDRL). Additionally, to enhance the decision-making performance of the RL agent, a prediction rApp based on long short-term memory (LSTM) is incorporated to provide additional information from the dynamic environment to the xApp. Simulation results demonstrate significant improvements in network performance, particularly in reducing QoS violations. This emphasizes the importance of using the prediction rApp and distributed actors' information jointly as part of a dynamic xApp. ",

We show that the conditioning operation transforms an SCM with the presence of an explicit latent selection mechanism into an SCM without such selection mechanism, which partially encodes the causal semantics of the selected subpopulation according to the original SCM. Furthermore, we show that this conditioning operation preserves the simplicity, acyclicity, and linearity of SCMs, and commutes with marginalization. Thanks to these properties, combined with marginalization and intervention, the conditioning operation offers a valuable tool for conducting causal reasoning tasks within causal models where latent details have been abstracted away. We demonstrate by example how classical results of causal inference can be generalized to include selection bias and how the conditioning operation helps with modeling of real-world problems. ",

    "title": "Accelerated Sampling of Rare Events using a Neural Network Bias  Potential",
    "abstract": "In the field of computational physics and material science, the efficient sampling of rare events occurring at atomic scale is crucial. It aids in understanding mechanisms behind a wide range of important phenomena, including protein folding, conformal changes, chemical reactions and materials diffusion and deformation. Traditional simulation methods, such as Molecular Dynamics and Monte Carlo, often prove inefficient in capturing the timescale of these rare events by brute force. In this paper, we introduce a practical approach by combining the idea of importance sampling with deep neural networks (DNNs) that enhance the sampling of these rare events. In particular, we approximate the variance-free bias potential function with DNNs which is trained to maximize the probability of rare event transition under the importance potential function. This method is easily scalable to high-dimensional problems and provides robust statistical guarantees on the accuracy of the estimated probability of rare event transition. Furthermore, our algorithm can actively generate and learn from any successful samples, which is a novel improvement over existing methods. Using a 2D system as a test bed, we provide comparisons between results obtained from different training strategies, traditional Monte Carlo sampling and numerically solved optimal bias potential function under different temperatures. Our numerical results demonstrate the efficacy of the DNN-based importance sampling of rare events. ",

    "abstract": "Traffic volume data collection is a crucial aspect of transportation engineering and urban planning, as it provides vital insights into traffic patterns, congestion, and infrastructure efficiency. Traditional manual methods of traffic data collection are both time-consuming and costly. However, the emergence of modern technologies, particularly Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR), has revolutionized the process by enabling efficient and accurate data collection. Despite the benefits of using LiDAR for traffic data collection, previous studies have identified two major limitations that have impeded its widespread adoption. These are the need for multiple LiDAR systems to obtain complete point cloud information of objects of interest, as well as the labor-intensive process of annotating 3D bounding boxes for object detection tasks. In response to these challenges, the current study proposes an innovative framework that alleviates the need for multiple LiDAR systems and simplifies the laborious 3D annotation process. To achieve this goal, the study employed a single LiDAR system, that aims at reducing the data acquisition cost and addressed its accompanying limitation of missing point cloud information by developing a Point Cloud Completion (PCC) framework to fill in missing point cloud information using point density. Furthermore, we also used zero-shot learning techniques to detect vehicles and pedestrians, as well as proposed a unique framework for extracting low to high features from the object of interest, such as height, acceleration, and speed. Using the 2D bounding box detection and extracted height information, this study is able to generate 3D bounding boxes automatically without human intervention. ",

First, we design a simple directed graph to represent the TTR problem, enabling the automatic extraction of informative states through graph neural networks. Second, we reformulate the construction process of TTR's solution, not only decoupling the decision model from the problem size but also ensuring the generated scheme's feasibility. Third, we design a learning curriculum for our model to handle the scenarios with different levels of delay. Finally, a simple local search method is proposed to assist the learned decision model, which can significantly improve solution quality with little additional computation cost, further enhancing the practical value of our method. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. The learned decision model can achieve better performance for various problems with varying degrees of train delay and different scales when compared to handcrafted rules and state-of-the-art solvers.

Our method involves repairing a single degraded input image using a high-quality reference image. We utilize a texture extraction and distribution framework to transfer high-quality texture features between the degraded input and reference image. However, the StyleGAN-like architecture in our framework requires high-quality latent codes to generate realistic images. The latent code extracted from the degraded input image often contains corrupted features, making it difficult to align the semantic information from the input with the high-quality textures from the reference. To overcome this challenge, we employ two special techniques. The first technique, inspired by vector quantization, replaces corrupted semantic features with high-quality code words. The second technique generates style codes that carry photorealistic texture information from a more informative latent space developed using the high-quality features in the reference image's manifold. Extensive experiments conducted on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our method produces results with more realistic contextual details and outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

We evaluate the impacts of key factors and the effectiveness of the proposed approach on the identification performance of 5 and 10 drivers.

It was pointed out recently that standard DNNs favour low frequency functions, and as a result, they often produce poor approximation for functions containing high frequency components. We addressed this issue in this study. We first developed a numerical method for solving the equation with DNNs as an approximate solution by designing a numerical quadrature that tailors to computing oscillatory integrals involving DNNs. We proved that the error of the DNN approximate solution of the equation is bounded by the training loss and the quadrature error. We then proposed a multi-grade deep learning (MGDL) model to overcome the spectral bias issue of neural networks. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the MGDL model is effective in extracting multiscale information of the oscillatory solution and overcoming the spectral bias issue from which a standard DNN model suffers.

Law enforcement agencies can effectively maintain social security and precisely combat criminal activities by analyzing the aforementioned data. In comparison to traditional data analysis methods, deep learning models, relying on the robust computational power in cloud centers, exhibit higher accuracy in extracting data features and inferring data. However, within the architecture of cloud centers, the transmission of data from end devices introduces significant latency, hindering real-time inference of data. Furthermore, low-latency edge computing architectures face limitations in direct deployment due to relatively weak computing and storage capacities of nodes. To address these challenges, a lightweight distributed knowledge graph completion architecture is proposed. Firstly, we introduce a lightweight distributed knowledge graph completion architecture that utilizes knowledge graph embedding for data analysis. Subsequently, to filter out substandard data, a personnel data quality assessment method named PDQA is proposed. Lastly, we present a model pruning algorithm that significantly reduces the model size while maximizing performance, enabling lightweight deployment. In experiments, we compare the effects of 11 advanced models on completing the knowledge graph of public security personnel information.

While using LLMs has sped up the functional development process, it poses a heavy risk to code security. Code generation with proper security measures using LLM is a significantly more challenging task than functional code generation. Security measures may include adding a pair of lines of code with the original code, consisting of null pointer checking or prepared statements for SQL injection prevention. Currently, available code repair LLMs generate code repair by supervised fine-tuning, where the model looks at cross-entropy loss. However, the original and repaired codes are mostly similar in functionality and syntactically, except for a few (1-2) lines, which act as security measures. This imbalance between the lines needed for security measures and the functional code enforces the supervised fine-tuned model to prioritize generating functional code without adding proper security measures, which also benefits the model by resulting in minimal loss. Therefore, in this work, for security hardening and strengthening of generated code from LLMs, we propose a reinforcement learning-based method for program-specific repair with the combination of semantic and syntactic reward mechanisms that focus heavily on adding security and functional measures in the code, respectively.

Secondly, a rule-based classifier is built to predict whether new code contains a hidden DP implementation. GEML has been validated over five DPs taken from a public repository recurrently adopted by machine learning studies. Then, we increase this number up to 15 diverse DPs, showing its effectiveness and robustness in terms of detection capability.

We evaluate ACAV on the Apollo ADS, finding that it can identify five distinct types of causal events in 93.64% of 110 accident recordings generated by an AV testing engine. We further evaluated ACAV on 1206 accident recordings collected from versions of Apollo injected with specific faults, finding that it can correctly identify causal events in 96.44% of the accidents triggered by prediction errors, and 85.73% of the accidents triggered by planning errors.

To analyze the potential and practicability of our proposal, we conduct a controlled experiment in which 39 participants, including academics, professional developers, and student collaborators, interact with InterEvo-TR. Our results show that the strategy to select and present intermediate results is effective for the purpose of readability assessment.

    "abstract": "The discovery of active IPv6 addresses represents a pivotal challenge in IPv6 network survey, as it is a prerequisite for downstream tasks such as network topology measurements and security analysis. With the rapid spread of IPv6 networks in recent years, many researchers have focused on improving the hit rate, efficiency, and coverage of IPv6 scanning methods, resulting in considerable advancements. However, existing approaches remain heavily dependent on seed addresses, thereby limiting their effectiveness in unseeded prefixes. Consequently, this paper proposes 6Rover, a reinforcement learning-based model for active address discovery in unseeded environments. To overcome the reliance on seeded addresses, 6Rover constructs patterns with higher generality that reflects the actual address allocation strategies of network administrators, thereby avoiding biased transfers of patterns from seeded to unseeded prefixes. After that, 6Rover employs a multi-armed bandit model to optimize the probing resource allocation when applying patterns to unseeded spaces. It models the challenge of discovering optimal patterns in unseeded spaces as an exploration-exploitation dilemma, and progressively uncover the potential patterns applied in unseeded spaces, leading to the efficient discovery of active addresses without seed address as the prior knowledge. Experiments on large-scale unseeded datasets show that 6Rover has a higher hit rate than existing methods in the absence of any seed addresses as prior knowledge. In real network environments, 6Rover achieved a 5% - 8% hit rate in seedless spaces with 100 million budget scale, representing an approximate 200\\% improvement over the existing state-of-the-art methods.

    "abstract": "Recently, many studies utilized adversarial examples (AEs) to raise the cost of malicious image editing and copyright violation powered by latent diffusion models (LDMs). Despite their successes, a few have studied the surrogate model they used to generate AEs. In this paper, from the perspective of adversarial transferability, we investigate how the surrogate model's property influences the performance of AEs for LDMs. Specifically, we view the time-step sampling in the Monte-Carlo-based (MC-based) adversarial attack as selecting surrogate models. We find that the smoothness of surrogate models at different time steps differs, and we substantially improve the performance of the MC-based AEs by selecting smoother surrogate models. In the light of the theoretical framework on adversarial transferability in image classification, we also conduct a theoretical analysis to explain why smooth surrogate models can also boost AEs for LDMs. ",

    "abstract": "While Language Models have become workhorses for NLP, their interplay with textual knowledge graphs (KGs) - structured memories of general or domain knowledge - is actively researched. Current embedding methodologies for such graphs typically either (i) linearize graphs for embedding them using sequential Language Models (LMs), which underutilize structural information, or (ii) use Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to preserve graph structure, while GNNs cannot represent textual features as well as a pre-trained LM could. In this work we introduce a novel language model, the Graph Language Model (GLM), that integrates the strengths of both approaches, while mitigating their weaknesses. The GLM parameters are initialized from a pretrained LM, to facilitate nuanced understanding of individual concepts and triplets. Simultaneously, its architectural design incorporates graph biases, thereby promoting effective knowledge distribution within the graph. Empirical evaluations on relation classification tasks on ConceptNet subgraphs reveal that GLM embeddings surpass both LM- and GNN-based baselines in supervised and zero-shot settings. ",

    "abstract": "Federated learning (FL) enables wireless terminals to collaboratively learn a shared parameter model while keeping all the training data on devices per se. Parameter sharing consists of synchronous and asynchronous ways: the former transmits parameters as blocks or frames and waits until all transmissions finish, whereas the latter provides messages about the status of pending and failed parameter transmission requests. Whatever synchronous or asynchronous parameter sharing is applied, the learning model shall adapt to distinct network architectures as an improper learning model will deteriorate learning performance and, even worse, lead to model divergence for the asynchronous transmission in resource-limited large-scale Internet-of-Things (IoT) networks. This paper proposes a decentralized learning model and develops an asynchronous parameter-sharing algorithm for resource-limited distributed IoT networks. This decentralized learning model approaches a convex function as the number of nodes increases, and its learning process converges to a global stationary point with a higher probability than the centralized FL model. Moreover, by jointly accounting for the convergence bound of federated learning and the transmission delay of wireless communications, we develop a node scheduling and bandwidth allocation algorithm to minimize the transmission delay. Extensive simulation results corroborate the effectiveness of the distributed algorithm in terms of fast learning model convergence and low transmission delay. ",

This task presents a formidable challenge to computer vision techniques due to the inherently subtle nature of cracks, which often exhibit low-level features that can be easily confounded with background textures, foreign objects, or irregularities in construction. Furthermore, the presence of issues like non-uniform lighting and construction irregularities poses significant hurdles for autonomous crack detection during building inspection and monitoring. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have emerged as a promising framework for crack detection, offering high levels of accuracy and precision. Additionally, the ability to adapt pre-trained networks through transfer learning provides a valuable tool for users, eliminating the need for an in-depth understanding of algorithm intricacies. Nevertheless, it is imperative to acknowledge the limitations and considerations when deploying CNNs, particularly in contexts where the outcomes carry immense significance, such as crack detection in buildings. In this paper, our approach to surface crack detection involves the utilization of various deep-learning models. Specifically, we employ fine-tuning techniques on pre-trained deep learning architectures: VGG19, ResNet50, Inception V3, and EfficientNetV2. These models are chosen for their established performance and versatility in image analysis tasks. We compare deep learning models using precision, recall, and F1 scores. ",

Furthermore, we enhance the LLM agent by incorporating long-term memory, which allows EHRAgent to effectively select and build upon the most relevant successful cases from past experiences. Experiments on two real-world EHR datasets show that EHRAgent outperforms the strongest LLM agent baseline by 36.48% and 12.41%, respectively. EHRAgent leverages the emerging few-shot learning capabilities of LLMs, enabling autonomous code generation and execution to tackle complex clinical tasks with minimal demonstrations. ",

    "abstract": "Logic locking proposed to protect integrated circuits from serious hardware threats has been studied extensively over a decade. In these years, many efficient logic locking techniques have been proven to be broken. The state-of-the-art logic locking techniques, including the prominent corrupt and correct (CAC) technique, are resilient to satisfiability (SAT)-based and removal attacks, but vulnerable to structural analysis attacks. To overcome this drawback, this paper introduces an improved version of CAC, called CAC 2.0, which increases the search space of structural analysis attacks using obfuscation. To do so, CAC 2.0 locks the original circuit twice, one after another, on different nodes with different number of protected primary inputs using CAC, while hiding original protected primary inputs among decoy primary inputs. This paper also introduces an open source logic locking tool, called HIID, equipped with well-known techniques including CAC 2.0. Our experiments show that CAC 2.0 is resilient to existing SAT-based, removal, and structural analysis attacks. To achieve this, it increases the number of key inputs at most 4x and the gate-level area between 30.2% and 0.8% on circuits with low and high complexity with respect to CAC. ",

This is particularly problematic in large-scale applications with sparse inputs, as is common in robotics use cases. To address these issues, we first introduce a sparse structure, \\emph{tri-quadtrees}, which represents the environment using learnable features stored in three planar quadtree projections. Secondly, we concatenate the learnable features with a Fourier feature positional encoding. The combined features are then decoded into signed distance values through a small multi-layer perceptron. We demonstrate that this approach facilitates smoother reconstruction with a higher completion ratio with fewer holes. Compared to two recent baselines, one implicit and one explicit, our approach requires only 10\\%--50\\% as much memory, while achieving competitive quality. ",

This causal and contrastive constraint minimization ensures improved generalization and adaptation to other domains.

This method leverages an arbitrary network from a different vision task as a proxy to generate adversarial noise, effectively causing the stereo network to produce erroneous predictions. Our findings highlight a notable sensitivity of stereo networks to discrepancies in shallow layer features, offering valuable insights that could guide future research in enhancing the robustness of stereo vision systems.

It has advantages over conventional cameras in those scenes with high-speed motions and challenging lighting conditions because of the high temporal resolution, high dynamic range, low bandwidth, low power consumption, and no motion blur. Therefore, several supervised monocular depth estimation from events is proposed to address scenes difficult for conventional cameras. However, depth annotation is costly and time-consuming. In this paper, to lower the annotation cost, we propose a self-supervised event-based monocular depth estimation framework named EMoDepth. EMoDepth constrains the training process using the cross-modal consistency from intensity frames that are aligned with events in the pixel coordinate. Moreover, in inference, only events are used for monocular depth prediction. Additionally, we design a multi-scale skip-connection architecture to effectively fuse features for depth estimation while maintaining high inference speed. Experiments on MVSEC and DSEC datasets demonstrate that our contributions are effective and that the accuracy can outperform existing supervised event-based and unsupervised frame-based methods. ",

To remove the need for the persistently exciting (PE) condition of a sufficiently high order on pre-collected data, a set containing all systems capable of generating such data is constructed. Then, at each time step, an upper bound of a given objective function is derived for all systems in the set, and a feedback controller is designed to minimize this bound. The optimal control gain at each time step is determined by solving a set of linear matrix inequalities. We prove that if the synthesis problem is feasible at the initial time step, it remains feasible for all future time steps. Unlike current data-driven predictive control schemes based on behavioral system theory, our approach requires less stringent conditions for the pre-collected data, facilitating easier implementation. Further, the proposed predictive control scheme features an infinite prediction horizon, potentially resulting in superior overall control performance compared to existing methods with finite prediction horizons. The effectiveness of our proposed methods is demonstrated through application to an unknown and unstable batch reactor. ",

Given this context, emotional disclosure on social media in the form of keeping a diary emerges as a popular way for individuals to express emotions and record their mental health status. However, the exploration of emotional disclosure via diary-keeping on social media during quarantine is underexplored, understanding which could be beneficial to facilitate emotional connections and enlighten health intervention measures. Focusing on this particular form of self-disclosure, this work proposes a quantitative approach to figure out the prevalence and changing patterns of emotional disclosure during quarantine, and the possible factors contributing to the negative emotions. We collected 58, 796 posts with the \"Quarantine Diary\" keyword on Weibo, a popular social media website in China. Through text classification, we capture diverse emotion categories that characterize public emotion disclosure during quarantine, such as annoyed, anxious, boring, happy, hopeful and appreciative. Based on temporal analysis, we uncover the changing patterns of emotional disclosure from long-term perspectives and period-based perspectives (e.g., the gradual decline of all negative emotions and the upsurge of the annoyed emotion near the end of quarantine). Leveraging topic modeling, we also encapsulate the possible influencing factors of negative emotions, such as freedom restriction and solitude, and uncertainty of infection and supply. We reflect on how our findings could deepen the understanding of mental health on social media and further provide practical and design implications to mitigate mental health issues during quarantine.

First, we propose a method that leverages prior knowledge for efficient causal discovery. Then, we propose an extension of this method for inferring causality in time series data. The original CAM-UV algorithm differs from other existing causal function models in that it does not seek the causal order between observed variables, but rather aims to identify the causes for each observed variable. Therefore, the first proposed method in this paper utilizes prior knowledge, such as understanding that certain variables cannot be causes of specific others. Moreover, by incorporating the prior knowledge that causes precedes their effects in time, we extend the first algorithm to the second method for causal discovery in time series data. We validate the first proposed method by using simulated data to demonstrate that the accuracy of causal discovery increases as more prior knowledge is accumulated. Additionally, we test the second proposed method by comparing it with existing time series causal discovery methods, using both simulated data and real-world data. ",

This paper introduces a novel challenge, namely 3D landmark detection on human point clouds, presenting two primary contributions. Firstly, we establish a comprehensive human point cloud dataset, named HPoint103, designed to support the 3D landmark detection community. This dataset comprises 103 human point clouds created with commercial software and actors, each manually annotated with 11 stable landmarks. Secondly, we propose a Dual Cascade Point Transformer (D-CPT) model for precise point-based landmark detection. D-CPT gradually refines the landmarks through cascade Transformer decoder layers across the entire point cloud stream, simultaneously enhancing landmark coordinates with a RefineNet over local regions. Comparative evaluations with popular point-based methods on HPoint103 and the public dataset DHP19 demonstrate the dramatic outperformance of our D-CPT.

    "abstract": "DeFi incidents stemming from various smart contract vulnerabilities have culminated in financial damages exceeding 3 billion USD. The attacks causing such incidents commonly commence with the deployment of adversarial contracts, subsequently leveraging these contracts to execute adversarial transactions that exploit vulnerabilities in victim contracts. Existing defense mechanisms leverage heuristic or machine learning algorithms to detect adversarial transactions, but they face significant challenges in detecting private adversarial transactions. Namely, attackers can send adversarial transactions directly to miners, evading visibility within the blockchain network and effectively bypassing the detection. In this paper, we propose a new direction for detecting DeFi attacks, i.e., detecting adversarial contracts instead of adversarial transactions, allowing us to proactively identify potential attack intentions, even if they employ private adversarial transactions. Specifically, we observe that most adversarial contracts follow a similar pattern, e.g., anonymous fund source, closed-source, frequent token-related function calls. Based on this observation, we build a machine learning classifier that can effectively distinguish adversarial contracts from benign ones. We build a dataset consists of features extracted from 304 adversarial contracts and 13,000 benign contracts. Based on this dataset, we evaluate different classifiers, the results of which show that our method for identifying DeFi adversarial contracts performs exceptionally well. For example, the F1-Score for LightGBM-based classifier is 0.9434, with a remarkably low false positive rate of only 0.12%. ",

    "title": "FROST-BRDF: A Fast and Robust Optimal Sampling Technique for BRDF  Acquisition",
    "abstract": "Efficient and accurate BRDF acquisition of real world materials is a challenging research problem that requires sampling millions of incident light and viewing directions. To accelerate the acquisition process, one needs to find a minimal set of sampling directions such that the recovery of the full BRDF is accurate and robust given such samples. In this paper, we formulate BRDF acquisition as a compressed sensing problem, where the sensing operator is one that performs sub-sampling of the BRDF signal according to a set of optimal sample directions. To solve this problem, we propose the Fast and Robust Optimal Sampling Technique (FROST) for designing a provably optimal sub-sampling operator that places light-view samples such that the recovery error is minimized. FROST casts the problem of designing an optimal sub-sampling operator for compressed sensing into a sparse representation formulation under the Multiple Measurement Vector (MMV) signal model. The proposed reformulation is exact, i.e. without any approximations, hence it converts an intractable combinatorial problem into one that can be solved with standard optimization techniques. As a result, FROST is accompanied by strong theoretical guarantees from the field of compressed sensing. We perform a thorough analysis of FROST-BRDF using a 10-fold cross-validation with publicly available BRDF datasets and show significant advantages compared to the state-of-the-art with respect to reconstruction quality. Finally, FROST is simple, both conceptually and in terms of implementation, it produces consistent results at each run, and it is at least two orders of magnitude faster than the prior art. ",

    "abstract": "To address the massive growth of data traffic over cellular networks, increasing spatial reuse of the frequency spectrum by the deployment of small base stations (SBSs) has been considered. For rapid deployment of SBSs in the networks, caching popular content along with new coded caching schemes are proposed. To maximize the cellular network's capacity, densifying it with small base stations is inevitable. In ultra-dense cellular networks, coverage of SBSs may overlap. To this aim, the multi-access caching system, where users potentially can access multiple cache nodes simultaneously, has attracted more attention in recent years. Most previous works on multi-access coded caching, only consider specific conditions such as cyclic wrap-around network topologies. In this paper, we investigate caching in ultra-dense cellular networks, where different users can access different numbers of caches under non-uniform content popularity distribution, and propose Multi-Access Hybrid coded-uncoded Caching (MAHC). We formulate the optimization problem of the proposed scheme for general network topologies and evaluate it for 2-SBS network scenarios. The numerical and simulation results show that the proposed MAHC scheme outperforms optimal conventional uncoded and previous multi-access coded caching (MACC) schemes. ",

    "abstract": "In an era where the silent struggle of underdiagnosed depression pervades globally, our research delves into the crucial link between mental health and social media. This work focuses on early detection of depression, particularly in extroverted social media users, using LLMs such as GPT 3.5, GPT 4 and our proposed GPT 3.5 fine-tuned model DepGPT, as well as advanced Deep learning models(LSTM, Bi-LSTM, GRU, BiGRU) and Transformer models(BERT, BanglaBERT, SahajBERT, BanglaBERT-Base). The study categorized Reddit and X datasets into \"Depressive\" and \"Non-Depressive\" segments, translated into Bengali by native speakers with expertise in mental health, resulting in the creation of the Bengali Social Media Depressive Dataset (BSMDD). Our work provides full architecture details for each model and a methodical way to assess their performance in Bengali depressive text categorization using zero-shot and few-shot learning techniques. Our work demonstrates the superiority of SahajBERT and Bi-LSTM with FastText embeddings in their respective domains also tackles explainability issues with transformer models and emphasizes the effectiveness of LLMs, especially DepGPT, demonstrating flexibility and competence in a range of learning contexts. According to the experiment results, the proposed model, DepGPT, outperformed not only Alpaca Lora 7B in zero-shot and few-shot scenarios but also every other model, achieving a near-perfect accuracy of 0.9796 and an F1-score of 0.9804, high recall, and exceptional precision. Although competitive, GPT-3.5 Turbo and Alpaca Lora 7B show relatively poorer effectiveness in zero-shot and few-shot situations. The work emphasizes the effectiveness and flexibility of LLMs in a variety of linguistic circumstances, providing insightful information about the complex field of depression detection models. ",

We then present an automated approach to assist in code review by identifying and categorizing these privacy-relevant methods in source code. Using static analysis, we identify a set of methods based on their occurrences in 50 commonly used libraries. We then rank these methods according to their frequency of invocation with actual personal data in the top 30 GitHub applications. The highest-ranked methods are the ones we designate as privacy-relevant in practice. For our evaluation, we examined 100 open-source applications and found that our approach identifies fewer than 5% of the methods as privacy-relevant for personal data processing. This reduces the time required for code reviews. Case studies on Signal Desktop and Cal.com further validate the effectiveness of our approach in aiding code reviewers to produce enhanced reports that facilitate compliance with privacy regulations.

    "abstract": "Physics-based computer models based on numerical solution of the governing equations generally cannot make rapid predictions, which in turn, limits their applications in the clinic. To address this issue, we developed a physics-informed neural network (PINN) model that encodes the physics of a closed-loop blood circulation system embedding a left ventricle (LV). The PINN model is trained to satisfy a system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) associated with a lumped parameter description of the circulatory system. The model predictions have a maximum error of less than 5% when compared to those obtained by solving the ODEs numerically. An inverse modeling approach using the PINN model is also developed to rapidly estimate model parameters (in $\\sim$ 3 mins) from single-beat LV pressure and volume waveforms. Using synthetic LV pressure and volume waveforms generated by the PINN model with different model parameter values, we show that the inverse modeling approach can recover the corresponding ground truth values, which suggests that the model parameters are unique. The PINN inverse modeling approach is then applied to estimate LV contractility indexed by the end-systolic elastance $E_{es}$ using waveforms acquired from 11 swine models, including waveforms acquired before and after administration of dobutamine (an inotropic agent) in 3 animals. The estimated $E_{es}$ is about 58% to 284% higher for the data associated with dobutamine compared to those without, which implies that this approach can be used to estimate LV contractility using single-beat measurements. The PINN inverse modeling can potentially be used in the clinic to simultaneously estimate LV contractility and other physiological parameters from single-beat measurements. ",

However, existing methods still have some limitations: 1) repetitions, transpositions, and omissions in the output synthesized speech due to limited alignment constraints between audio and phoneme tokens; 2) challenges of fine-grained control over the synthesized speech with autoregressive (AR) language model; 3) infinite silence generation due to the nature of AR-based decoding, especially under the greedy strategy. To alleviate these issues, we propose ELLA-V, a simple but efficient LM-based zero-shot text-to-speech (TTS) framework, which enables fine-grained control over synthesized audio at the phoneme level. The key to ELLA-V is interleaving sequences of acoustic and phoneme tokens, where phoneme tokens appear ahead of the corresponding acoustic tokens. The experimental findings reveal that our model outperforms VALL-E in terms of accuracy and delivers more stable results using both greedy and sampling-based decoding strategies. The code of ELLA-V will be open-sourced after cleanups. Audio samples are available at https://ereboas.github.io/ELLAV/. ",

Real-world software development, however, often involves complex code repositories (named repo) with complex dependencies and extensive documentation. To fill this gap, our research pivots towards evaluating LLMs in a more realistic setting -- real-world repo-level code generation. We introduce CodeAgentBench, a manually curated benchmark for repo-level code generation. This benchmark comprises five high-quality Python projects, encompassing a total of 101 samples. We assess nine leading LLMs on repo-level tasks and observe a decline in their performance. To tackle this, we present CodeAgent, a novel LLM-based agent framework that employs external tools for effective repo-level code generation. CodeAgent integrates five programming tools, enabling interaction with software artifacts for information retrieval, code symbol navigation, and code testing. We implement four agent strategies to optimize these tools' usage. Our experiments on CodeAgentBench show that CodeAgent enhances LLM performance significantly, with improvements ranging from 18.1\\% to 250\\%. Further tests on the HumanEval benchmark confirm CodeAgent's adaptability and efficacy across various code generation tasks. Notably, CodeAgent outperforms commercial products like Github Copilot, showcasing superior accuracy and efficiency. These results demonstrate CodeAgent's robust capabilities in code generation, highlighting its potential for real-world repo-level coding challenges. ",

    "abstract": "The absence of robust security protocols renders the VANET (Vehicle ad-hoc Networks) network open to cyber threats by compromising passengers and road safety. Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) are widely employed to detect network security threats. With vehicles' high mobility on the road and diverse environments, VANETs devise ever-changing network topologies, lack privacy and security, and have limited bandwidth efficiency. The absence of privacy precautions, End-to-End Encryption methods, and Local Data Processing systems in VANET also present many privacy and security difficulties. So, assessing whether a novel real-time processing IDS approach can be utilized for this emerging technology is crucial. The present study introduces a novel approach for intrusion detection using Federated Learning (FL) capabilities in conjunction with the BERT model for sequence classification (FL-BERT). The significance of data privacy is duly recognized. According to FL methodology, each client has its own local model and dataset. They train their models locally and then send the model's weights to the server. After aggregation, the server aggregates the weights from all clients to update a global model. After aggregation, the global model's weights are shared with the clients. This practice guarantees the secure storage of sensitive raw data on individual clients' devices, effectively protecting privacy. After conducting the federated learning procedure, we assessed our models' performance using a separate test dataset. The FL-BERT technique has yielded promising results, opening avenues for further investigation in this particular area of research. We reached the result of our approaches by comparing existing research works and found that FL-BERT is more effective for privacy and security concerns. Our results suggest that FL-BERT is a promising technique for enhancing attack detection. ",

This paper presents a novel roadway reconfiguration technique by integrating optimization based Brute Force search approach and decision support framework to rank various roadway configurations for better performance. The proposed framework incorporates a multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) approach, combining input from generated scenarios during the optimization process. By utilizing data from optimization, the model identifies total betweenness centrality (TBC), system travel time (STT), and total link traffic flow (TLTF) as the most influential decision variables. The developed framework leverages graph theory to model the transportation network topology and apply network science metrics as well as stochastic user equilibrium traffic assignment to assess the impact of each roadway configuration on the overall network performance. To rank the roadway configurations, the framework employs machine learning algorithms, such as ridge regression, to determine the optimal weights for each criterion (i.e., TBC, STT, TLTF). Moreover, the network-based analysis ensures that the selected configurations not only optimize individual roadway segments but also enhance system-level efficiency, which is particularly helpful as the increasing frequency and intensity of natural disasters and other disruptive events underscore the critical need for resilient transportation networks. By integrating multi-criteria decision analysis, machine learning, and network science metrics, the proposed framework would enable transportation planners to make informed and data-driven decisions, leading to more sustainable, efficient, and resilient roadway configurations.

The framework minimizes the overall curtailment while considering fairness by reducing disparities in curtailments among different PV owners. We model the distribution grid constraints using a conservative linear approximation (CLA) of the AC power flow equations which is computed using a set of sampled power injections from the day-ahead predicted scenarios. The proposed framework is numerically validated on a CIGRE benchmark network interfaced with a large number of PV plants. We compare the performance of the proposed framework versus an alternative formulation that does not incorporate fairness considerations. To this end, we assess tradeoffs between fairness, as quantified with the Jain Fairness Index (JFI), and the total curtailed energy. ",

This evaluation requires determining the lowest energy across various adsorption configurations on the catalytic surface. While graph neural networks (GNNs) have gained popularity as a machine learning approach for computing the energy of catalyst systems, they rely heavily on atomic spatial coordinates and often lack clarity in their interpretations. Recent advancements in language models have broadened their applicability to predicting catalytic properties, allowing us to bypass the complexities of graph representation. These models are adept at handling textual data, making it possible to incorporate observable features in a human-readable format. However, language models encounter challenges in accurately predicting the energy of adsorption configurations, typically showing a high mean absolute error (MAE) of about 0.71 eV. Our study addresses this limitation by introducing a self-supervised multi-modal learning approach, termed graph-assisted pretraining. This method significantly reduces the MAE to 0.35 eV through a combination of data augmentation, achieving comparable accuracy with DimeNet++ while using 0.4% of its training data size. Furthermore, the Transformer encoder at the core of the language model can provide insights into the feature focus through its attention scores. This analysis shows that our multimodal training effectively redirects the model's attention toward relevant adsorption configurations from adsorbate-related features, enhancing prediction accuracy and interpretability.

In this paper, I explore the potential of heterogeneous graph embedding to automatically learn the behavior features of multiple DNS entities, and to simultaneously support more than one security tasks. Considering the joint optimization of malicious domain detection and IP reputation evaluation as an example, I propose a novel joint DNS embedding (JDE) model to formulate the DNS query behavior via a similarity-enhanced graph with heterogeneous entities. The random walk technique is applied to the heterogeneous graph to comprehensively explore the hidden homogeneous and heterogeneous high-order proximities among domains and IPs. Extensive experiments on real DNS traffic demonstrate that the joint optimization of multiple tasks with the latent high-order proximities can lead to better security analysis performance for all the tasks than respectively optimizing each single task with the observable low-order proximity.

The development of automated methods for nuclei segmentation enables quantitative analysis of the wide existence and large variances in nuclei morphometry in histopathology images. However, manual annotation of tens of thousands of nuclei is tedious and time-consuming, which requires significant amount of human effort and domain-specific expertise. To alleviate this problem, in this paper, we propose a weakly-supervised nuclei segmentation method that only requires partial point labels of nuclei. Specifically, we propose a novel boundary mining framework for nuclei segmentation, named BoNuS, which simultaneously learns nuclei interior and boundary information from the point labels. To achieve this goal, we propose a novel boundary mining loss, which guides the model to learn the boundary information by exploring the pairwise pixel affinity in a multiple-instance learning manner. Then, we consider a more challenging problem, i.e., partial point label, where we propose a nuclei detection module with curriculum learning to detect the missing nuclei with prior morphological knowledge. The proposed method is validated on three public datasets, MoNuSeg, CPM, and CoNIC datasets. Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of our method to the state-of-the-art weakly-supervised nuclei segmentation methods. Code: https://github.com/hust-linyi/bonus. ",

In this paper, we proposed GACE, a graph-based cross-page ads embedding generation method.

    "abstract": "Most power systems' approaches are currently tending towards stochastic and probabilistic methods due to the high variability of renewable sources and the stochastic nature of loads. Conventional power flow (PF) approaches such as forward-backward sweep (FBS) and Newton-Raphson require a high number of iterations to solve non-linear PF equations making them computationally very intensive. PF is the most important study performed by utility, required in all stages of the power system, especially in operations and planning. This paper discusses the applications of deep learning (DL) to predict PF solutions for three-phase unbalanced power distribution grids. Three deep neural networks (DNNs); Radial Basis Function Network (RBFnet), Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), are proposed in this paper to predict PF solutions. The PF problem is formulated as a multi-output regression model where two or more output values are predicted based on the inputs. The training and testing data are generated through the OpenDSS-MATLAB COM interface. These methods are completely data-driven where the training relies on reducing the mismatch at each node without the need for the knowledge of the system. The novelty of the proposed methodology is that the models can accurately predict the PF solutions for the unbalanced distribution grids with mutual coupling and are robust to different R/X ratios, topology changes as well as generation and load variability introduced by the integration of distributed energy resources (DERs) and electric vehicles (EVs). To test the efficacy of the DNN models, they are applied to IEEE 4-node and 123-node test cases, and the American Electric Power (AEP) feeder model. The PF results for RBFnet, MLP, and CNN models are discussed in this paper demonstrating that all three DNN models provide highly accurate results in predicting PF solutions. ",

However, different from the 2D grids, the 3D points used in these detectors are often far from the ground truth center, making it challenging to accurately regress the bounding boxes. To address this issue, we propose a Cascade Voting (CascadeV) strategy that provides high-quality 3D object detection with point-based prediction. Specifically, CascadeV performs cascade detection using a novel Cascade Voting decoder that combines two new components: Instance Aware Voting (IA-Voting) and a Cascade Point Assignment (CPA) module. The IA-Voting module updates the object features of updated proposal points within the bounding box using conditional inverse distance weighting. This approach prevents features from being aggregated outside the instance and helps improve the accuracy of object detection. Additionally, since model training can suffer from a lack of proposal points with high centerness, we have developed the CPA module to narrow down the positive assignment threshold with cascade stages. This approach relaxes the dependence on proposal centerness in the early stages while ensuring an ample quantity of positives with high centerness in the later stages. Experiments show that FCAF3D with our CascadeV achieves state-of-the-art 3D object detection results with 70.4\\% mAP@0.25 and 51.6\\% mAP@0.5 on SUN RGB-D and competitive results on ScanNet.

SAM-OIL is the first application of the powerful SAM in oil spill detection. Specifically, the SAM-OIL strategy uses YOLOv8 to obtain the categories and bounding boxes of oil spill-related objects, then inputs bounding boxes into the adapted SAM to retrieve category-agnostic masks, and finally adopts the Ordered Mask Fusion (OMF) module to fuse the masks and categories. The adapted SAM, combining a frozen SAM with a learnable Adapter module, can enhance SAM's ability to segment ambiguous objects. The OMF module, a parameter-free method, can effectively resolve pixel category conflicts within SAM. Experimental results demonstrate that SAM-OIL surpasses existing semantic segmentation-based oil spill detection methods, achieving mIoU of 69.52%.

In this study, we propose a novel perspective on temporal link prediction by defining nodes as Newtonian objects and incorporating the concept of velocity to predict network dynamics. By computing more specific dynamics of each node, rather than overall dynamics, we improve both accuracy and explainability in predicting future connections. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach using two datasets, including 17 years of co-authorship data from PubMed. Experimental results show that our temporal graph embedding dynamics approach improves downstream classification models' ability to predict future collaboration efficacy in co-authorship networks by 17.34% (AUROC improvement relative to the baseline model).

However, the prediction of watch time as a target variable is often hindered by its highly imbalanced distribution with a scarcity of observations for larger target values and over-populated samples for small values. State-of-the-art watch time prediction models discretize the continuous watch time into a set of buckets in order to consider the distribution of watch time. However, it is highly uninvestigated how these discrete buckets should be created from the continuous watch time distribution, and existing discretization approaches suffer from either a large learning error or a large restoration error. To address this challenge, we propose a Classification-Restoration framework with Error-Adaptive-Discretization (CREAD) to accurately predict the watch time. The proposed framework contains a discretization module, a classification module, and a restoration module. It predicts the watch time through multiple classification problems. The discretization process is a key contribution of the CREAD framework. We theoretically analyze the impacts of the discretization on the learning error and the restoration error, and then propose the error-adaptive discretization (EAD) technique to better balance the two errors, which achieves better performance over traditional discretization approaches. We conduct detailed offline evaluations on a public dataset and an industrial dataset, both showing performance gains through the proposed approach. Moreover, We have fully launched our framework to Kwai App, an online video platform, which resulted in a significant increase in users' video watch time by 0.29% through A/B testing.

Specifically, SSOC first defines class center tokens for both known and unknown classes and autonomously learns token representations according to all samples with the cross-attention mechanism. To effectively discover novel classes, SSOC further designs a pairwise similarity loss in addition to the entropy loss, which can wisely exploit the information available in unlabeled data from instances' predictions and relationships. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SSOC outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines on multiple popular classification benchmarks. Specifically, on the ImageNet-100 dataset with a novel ratio of 90%, SSOC achieves a remarkable 22% improvement. ",

Through adversarial training, its bias generators continuously introduce biases and generate bias-conflict samples to deceive its grounding model. Meanwhile, the grounding model continuously eliminates the introduced biases, which requires it to model multi-modality alignment information. BSSARD will cover most kinds of coupling relationships and disrupt language and visual biases simultaneously. Extensive experiments on Charades-CD and ActivityNet-CD demonstrate the promising debiasing capability of BSSARD. Source codes are available at https://github.com/qzhb/BSSARD. ",

    "abstract": "Given a graph $G$, the optimization version of the graph burning problem seeks for a sequence of vertices, $(u_1,u_2,...,u_k) \\in V(G)^k$, with minimum $k$ and such that every $v \\in V(G)$ has distance at most $k-i$ to some vertex $u_i$. The length $k$ of the optimal solution is known as the burning number and is denoted by $b(G)$, an invariant that helps quantify the graph's vulnerability to contagion. This paper explores the advantages and limitations of an $\\mathcal{O}(mn + kn^2)$ deterministic greedy heuristic for this problem, where $n$ is the graph's order, $m$ is the graph's size, and $k$ is a guess on $b(G)$. This heuristic is based on the relationship between the graph burning problem and the clustered maximum coverage problem, and despite having limitations on paths and cycles, it found most of the optimal and best-known solutions of benchmark and synthetic graphs with up to 102400 vertices.

We show that this problem can be formulated as maximizing the expected reward for a stochastic multi-armed bandit with side information. We propose an algorithm to minimize the cumulative regret in general causal graphs. This algorithm trades off observations and interventions based on their costs to achieve the optimal reward. This algorithm generalizes the state-of-the-art methods by allowing non-uniform costs and hidden confounders in the causal graph. Furthermore, we develop an algorithm to minimize the simple regret in the budgeted setting with non-uniform costs and also general causal graphs. We provide theoretical guarantees, including both upper and lower bounds, as well as empirical evaluations of our algorithms.

    "abstract": "Current state-of-the-art medical image segmentation methods prioritize accuracy but often at the expense of increased computational demands and larger model sizes. Applying these large-scale models to the relatively limited scale of medical image datasets tends to induce redundant computation, complicating the process without the necessary benefits. This approach not only adds complexity but also presents challenges for the integration and deployment of lightweight models on edge devices. For instance, recent transformer-based models have excelled in 2D and 3D medical image segmentation due to their extensive receptive fields and high parameter count. However, their effectiveness comes with a risk of overfitting when applied to small datasets and often neglects the vital inductive biases of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), essential for local feature representation. In this work, we propose PMFSNet, a novel medical imaging segmentation model that effectively balances global and local feature processing while avoiding the computational redundancy typical in larger models. PMFSNet streamlines the UNet-based hierarchical structure and simplifies the self-attention mechanism's computational complexity, making it suitable for lightweight applications. It incorporates a plug-and-play PMFS block, a multi-scale feature enhancement module based on attention mechanisms, to capture long-term dependencies. Extensive comprehensive results demonstrate that even with a model (less than 1 million parameters), our method achieves superior performance in various segmentation tasks across different data scales. It achieves (IoU) metrics of 84.68%, 82.02%, and 78.82% on public datasets of teeth CT (CBCT), ovarian tumors ultrasound(MMOTU), and skin lesions dermoscopy images (ISIC 2018), respectively.

    "abstract": "Few-shot object detection (FSOD) aims at extending a generic detector for novel object detection with only a few training examples. It attracts great concerns recently due to the practical meanings. Meta-learning has been demonstrated to be an effective paradigm for this task. In general, methods based on meta-learning employ an additional support branch to encode novel examples (a.k.a. support images) into class prototypes, which are then fused with query branch to facilitate the model prediction. However, the class-level prototypes are difficult to precisely generate, and they also lack detailed information, leading to instability in performance.New methods are required to capture the distinctive local context for more robust novel object detection. To this end, we propose to distill the most representative support features into fine-grained prototypes. These prototypes are then assigned into query feature maps based on the matching results, modeling the detailed feature relations between two branches. This process is realized by our Fine-Grained Feature Aggregation (FFA) module. Moreover, in terms of high-level feature fusion, we propose Balanced Class-Agnostic Sampling (B-CAS) strategy and Non-Linear Fusion (NLF) module from differenct perspectives. They are complementary to each other and depict the high-level feature relations more effectively.

    "abstract": "In spite of the rapid advancements in unsupervised log anomaly detection techniques, the current mainstream models still necessitate specific training for individual system datasets, resulting in costly procedures and limited scalability due to dataset size, thereby leading to performance bottlenecks. Furthermore, numerous models lack cognitive reasoning capabilities, posing challenges in direct transferability to similar systems for effective anomaly detection. Additionally, akin to reconstruction networks, these models often encounter the \"identical shortcut\" predicament, wherein the majority of system logs are classified as normal, erroneously predicting normal classes when confronted with rare anomaly logs due to reconstruction errors. To address the aforementioned issues, we propose MLAD, a novel anomaly detection model that incorporates semantic relational reasoning across multiple systems. Specifically, we employ Sentence-bert to capture the similarities between log sequences and convert them into highly-dimensional learnable semantic vectors. Subsequently, we revamp the formulas of the Attention layer to discern the significance of each keyword in the sequence and model the overall distribution of the multi-system dataset through appropriate vector space diffusion. Lastly, we employ a Gaussian mixture model to highlight the uncertainty of rare words pertaining to the \"identical shortcut\" problem, optimizing the vector space of the samples using the maximum expectation model. Experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of MLAD. ",

The proposed graph-Transformer-based generator includes a novel graph Transformer encoder that combines graph convolutions and self-attentions in a Transformer to model both local and global interactions across connected and non-connected graph nodes. Specifically, the proposed connected node attention (CNA) and non-connected node attention (NNA) aim to capture the global relations across connected nodes and non-connected nodes in the input graph, respectively. The proposed graph modeling block (GMB) aims to exploit local vertex interactions based on a house layout topology. Moreover, we propose a new node classification-based discriminator to preserve the high-level semantic and discriminative node features for different house components. To maintain the relative spatial relationships between ground truth and predicted graphs, we also propose a novel graph-based cycle-consistency loss. Finally, we propose a novel self-guided pre-training method for graph representation learning. This approach involves simultaneous masking of nodes and edges at an elevated mask ratio (i.e., 40%) and their subsequent reconstruction using an asymmetric graph-centric autoencoder architecture. This method markedly improves the model's learning proficiency and expediency. Experiments on three challenging graph-constrained architectural layout generation tasks (i.e., house layout generation, house roof generation, and building layout generation) with three public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in terms of objective quantitative scores and subjective visual realism.

    "abstract": "Open-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation has emerged as a frontier topic due to its capability to segment 3D instances beyond a predefined set of categories. However, compared to significant progress in the 2D domain, methods for 3D open-vocabulary instance segmentation are hindered by the limited scale of high-quality annotated 3D data. To harness the capabilities of 2D models, recent efforts have focused on merging 2D masks based on metrics such as geometric and semantic similarity to form 3D instances. In contrast to these local metrics, we propose a novel metric called view consensus to better exploit multi-view observation. The key insight is that two 2D masks should be considered as belonging to the same instance if a considerable number of other 2D masks from other views contain both these two masks. Based on this metric, we build a global mask graph and iteratively cluster masks, prioritizing mask pairs with solid view consensus. The corresponding 3D points cluster of these 2D mask clusters can be regarded as 3D instances, along with the fused open-vocabulary features from clustered 2D masks. Through this multi-view verification and fusion mechanism, our method effectively leverages the prior instance knowledge from massive 2D masks predicted by visual foundation models, eliminating the need for training on 3D data. Experiments on publicly available datasets, including ScanNet200 and MatterPort3D, demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in both open-vocabulary instance segmentation and class-agnostic mask generation.

    "abstract": "The recommendation has been playing a key role in many industries, e.g., e-commerce, streaming media, social media, etc. Recently, a new recommendation scenario, called Trigger-Induced Recommendation (TIR), where users are able to explicitly express their instant interests via trigger items, is emerging as an essential role in many e-commerce platforms, e.g., Alibaba.com and Amazon. Without explicitly modeling the user's instant interest, traditional recommendation methods usually obtain sub-optimal results in TIR. Even though there are a few methods considering the trigger and target items simultaneously to solve this problem, they still haven't taken into account temporal information of user behaviors, the dynamic change of user instant interest when the user scrolls down and the interactions between the trigger and target items. To tackle these problems, we propose a novel method -- Deep Evolutional Instant Interest Network (DEI2N), for click-through rate prediction in TIR scenarios. Specifically, we design a User Instant Interest Modeling Layer to predict the dynamic change of the intensity of instant interest when the user scrolls down. Temporal information is utilized in user behavior modeling. Moreover, an Interaction Layer is introduced to learn better interactions between the trigger and target items. We evaluate our method on several offline and real-world industrial datasets. Experimental results show that our proposed DEI2N outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. In addition, online A/B testing demonstrates the superiority over the existing baseline in real-world production environments. ",

    "title": "Pedestrian Detection in Low-Light Conditions: A Comprehensive Survey",
    "abstract": "Pedestrian detection remains a critical problem in various domains, such as computer vision, surveillance, and autonomous driving. In particular, accurate and instant detection of pedestrians in low-light conditions and reduced visibility is of utmost importance for autonomous vehicles to prevent accidents and save lives. This paper aims to comprehensively survey various pedestrian detection approaches, baselines, and datasets that specifically target low-light conditions. The survey discusses the challenges faced in detecting pedestrians at night and explores state-of-the-art methodologies proposed in recent years to address this issue. These methodologies encompass a diverse range, including deep learning-based, feature-based, and hybrid approaches, which have shown promising results in enhancing pedestrian detection performance under challenging lighting conditions. Furthermore, the paper highlights current research directions in the field and identifies potential solutions that merit further investigation by researchers. By thoroughly examining pedestrian detection techniques in low-light conditions, this survey seeks to contribute to the advancement of safer and more reliable autonomous driving systems and other applications related to pedestrian safety. Accordingly, most of the current approaches in the field use deep learning-based image fusion methodologies (i.e., early, halfway, and late fusion) for accurate and reliable pedestrian detection. Moreover, the majority of the works in the field (approximately 48%) have been evaluated on the KAIST dataset, while the real-world video feeds recorded by authors have been used in less than six percent of the works.

    "abstract": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) micro-satellite instability (MSI) prediction on histopathology images is a challenging weakly supervised learning task that involves multi-instance learning on gigapixel images. To date, radiology images have proven to have CRC MSI information and efficient patient imaging techniques. Different data modalities integration offers the opportunity to increase the accuracy and robustness of MSI prediction. Despite the progress in representation learning from the whole slide images (WSI) and exploring the potential of making use of radiology data, CRC MSI prediction remains a challenge to fuse the information from multiple data modalities (e.g., pathology WSI and radiology CT image). In this paper, we propose $M^{2}$Fusion: a Bayesian-based multimodal multi-level fusion pipeline for CRC MSI. The proposed fusion model $M^{2}$Fusion is capable of discovering more novel patterns within and across modalities that are beneficial for predicting MSI than using a single modality alone, as well as other fusion methods. The contribution of the paper is three-fold: (1) $M^{2}$Fusion is the first pipeline of multi-level fusion on pathology WSI and 3D radiology CT image for MSI prediction; (2) CT images are the first time integrated into multimodal fusion for CRC MSI prediction; (3) feature-level fusion strategy is evaluated on both Transformer-based and CNN-based method. Our approach is validated on cross-validation of 352 cases and outperforms either feature-level (0.8177 vs. 0.7908) or decision-level fusion strategy (0.8177 vs. 0.7289) on AUC score. ",

Machine-generated text (MGT) detection is important to cope with such threats. However, it is susceptible to authorship obfuscation (AO) methods, such as paraphrasing, which can cause MGTs to evade detection. So far, this was evaluated only in monolingual settings. Thus, the susceptibility of recently proposed multilingual detectors is still unknown. We fill this gap by comprehensively benchmarking the performance of 10 well-known AO methods, attacking 37 MGT detection methods against MGTs in 11 languages (i.e., 10 $\\times$ 37 $\\times$ 11 = 4,070 combinations). We also evaluate the effect of data augmentation on adversarial robustness using obfuscated texts. The results indicate that all tested AO methods can cause detection evasion in all tested languages, where homoglyph attacks are especially successful. ",

    "abstract": "In deep learning (DL) the instability phenomenon is widespread and well documented, most commonly using the classical measure of stability, the Lipschitz constant. While a small Lipchitz constant is traditionally viewed as guarantying stability, it does not capture the instability phenomenon in DL for classification well. The reason is that a classification function -- which is the target function to be approximated -- is necessarily discontinuous, thus having an 'infinite' Lipchitz constant. As a result, the classical approach will deem every classification function unstable, yet basic classification functions a la 'is there a cat in the image?' will typically be locally very 'flat' -- and thus locally stable -- except at the decision boundary. The lack of an appropriate measure of stability hinders a rigorous theory for stability in DL, and consequently, there are no proper approximation theoretic results that can guarantee the existence of stable networks for classification functions. In this paper we introduce a novel stability measure $\\mathscr{S}(f)$, for any classification function $f$, appropriate to study the stability of discontinuous functions and their approximations. We further prove two approximation theorems: First, for any $\\epsilon > 0$ and any classification function $f$ on a \\emph{compact set}, there is a neural network (NN) $\\psi$, such that $\\psi - f \\neq 0$ only on a set of measure $< \\epsilon$, moreover, $\\mathscr{S}(\\psi) \\geq \\mathscr{S}(f) - \\epsilon$ (as accurate and stable as $f$ up to $\\epsilon$). Second, for any classification function $f$ and $\\epsilon > 0$, there exists a NN $\\psi$ such that $\\psi = f$ on the set of points that are at least $\\epsilon$ away from the decision boundary. ",

This framework incorporates two compact deep neural networks (DNNs) surrounding a multichannel neural Wiener filter (NWF). The first DNN enhances the speech signal to estimate NWF coefficients, while the second DNN refines the output from the NWF. The NWF, while conceptually similar to the traditional frequency-domain Wiener filter, undergoes a training process optimized for low-latency speech enhancement, involving fine-tuning of both analysis and synthesis transforms. Our research results illustrate that the NWF output, having minimal nonlinear distortions, attains performance levels akin to those of the first DNN, deviating from conventional Wiener filter paradigms. Training all components jointly outperforms sequential training, despite its simplicity. Consequently, this framework achieves superior performance with fewer parameters and reduced computational demands, making it a compelling solution for resource-efficient multichannel speech enhancement.

    "abstract": "Planning and reasoning about actions and processes, in addition to reasoning about propositions, are important issues in recent logical and computer science studies. The widespread use of actions in everyday life such as IoT, semantic web services, etc., and the limitations and issues in the action formalisms are two factors that lead us to study about how actions are represented. Since 2007, there was some ideas to integrate Description Logic (DL) and action formalisms for representing both static and dynamic knowledge. In meanwhile, time is an important factor in dynamic situations, and actions change states over time. In this study, on the one hand, we examined related logical structures such as extensions of description logics (DLs), temporal formalisms, and action formalisms. On the other hand, we analyzed possible tools for designing and developing the Knowledge and Action Base (KAB). For representation and reasoning about actions, we embedded actions into DLs (such as Dynamic-ALC and its extensions). We propose a terminable algorithm for action projection, planning, checking the satisfiability, consistency, realizability, and executability, and also querying from KAB. Actions in this framework were modeled with SPIN and added to state space. This framework has also been implemented as a plugin for the Prot\\'eg\\'e ontology editor. During the last two decades, various algorithms have been presented, but due to the high computational complexity, we face many problems in implementing dynamic ontologies. In addition, an algorithm to detect the inconsistency of actions' effects was not explicitly stated. In the proposed strategy, the interactions of actions with other parts of modeled knowledge, and a method to check consistency between the effects of actions are presented. With this framework, the ramification problem can be well handled in future works. ",

    "abstract": "Recently, the representation of emotions in the Valence, Arousal and Dominance (VAD) space has drawn enough attention. However, the complex nature of emotions and the subjective biases in self-reported values of VAD make the emotion model too specific to a particular experiment. This study aims to develop a generic model representing emotions using a fuzzy VAD space and improve emotion recognition by utilizing this representation. We partitioned the crisp VAD space into a fuzzy VAD space using low, medium and high type-2 fuzzy dimensions to represent emotions. A framework that integrates fuzzy VAD space with EEG data has been developed to recognize emotions. The EEG features were extracted using spatial and temporal feature vectors from time-frequency spectrograms, while the subject-reported values of VAD were also considered. The study was conducted on the DENS dataset, which includes a wide range of twenty-four emotions, along with EEG data and subjective ratings. The study was validated using various deep fuzzy framework models based on type-2 fuzzy representation, cuboid probabilistic lattice representation and unsupervised fuzzy emotion clusters. These models resulted in emotion recognition accuracy of 96.09\\%, 95.75\\% and 95.31\\%, respectively, for the classes of 24 emotions. The study also included an ablation study, one with crisp VAD space and the other without VAD space. The result with crisp VAD space performed better, while the deep fuzzy framework outperformed both models. The model was extended to predict cross-subject cases of emotions, and the results with 78.37\\% accuracy are promising, proving the generality of our model. The generic nature of the developed model, along with its successful cross-subject predictions, gives direction for real-world applications in the areas such as affective computing, human-computer interaction, and mental health monitoring.

We present new configuration-generation algorithms that leverage constraint solving (SAT and MaxSAT) and configuration fuzzing, and implement our approach in a configuration-generation framework, CONFIZZ. CONFIZZ both enables the generation of maximal configurations (maximal sets of presence conditions that can be satisfied together) and performs code-metric guided configuration fuzzing. Results from evaluation on BusyBox, a highly configurable benchmark, show that our MaxSAT-based configuration generation achieves better coverage for several code metrics.

    "abstract": "Motivation. Large language models (LLMs) have exhibited remarkable proficiency in diverse software engineering (SE) tasks. Handling such tasks typically involves acquiring foundational coding knowledge on large, general-purpose datasets during a pre-training phase, and subsequently refining on smaller, task-specific datasets as part of a fine-tuning phase. Problem statement. Data leakage is a well-known issue in training of machine learning models. A manifestation of this issue is the intersection of the training and testing splits. While intra-dataset code duplication examines this intersection within a given dataset and has been addressed in prior research, inter-dataset code duplication, which gauges the overlap between different datasets, remains largely unexplored. If this phenomenon exists, it could compromise the integrity of LLM evaluations because of the inclusion of fine-tuning test samples that were already encountered during pre-training, resulting in inflated performance metrics. Contribution. This paper explores the phenomenon of inter-dataset code duplication and its impact on evaluating LLMs across diverse SE tasks. Study design. We conduct an empirical study using the CSN dataset, a widely adopted pre-training dataset, and five fine-tuning datasets used for various SE tasks. We first identify the intersection between the pre-training and fine-tuning datasets using a deduplication process. Then, we fine-tune four models pre-trained on CSN to evaluate their performance on samples encountered during pre-training and those unseen during that phase. Results. Our findings reveal a potential threat to the evaluation of various LLMs across multiple SE tasks, stemming from the inter-dataset code duplication phenomenon. Moreover, we demonstrate that this threat is accentuated by factors like the LLM's size and the chosen fine-tuning technique. ",

While VSP has drawn benefits from spatio-temporal transformers, finding the most effective way for aggregating temporal features is still challenging. To address this concern, we propose a transformer-based video saliency prediction approach with high temporal dimension decoding network (THTD-Net). This strategy accounts for the lack of complex hierarchical interactions between features that are extracted from the transformer-based spatio-temporal encoder: in particular, it does not require multiple decoders and aims at gradually reducing temporal features' dimensions in the decoder. This decoder-based architecture yields comparable performance to multi-branch and over-complicated models on common benchmarks such as DHF1K, UCF-sports and Hollywood-2. ",

While several studies have addressed this challenging task from a sequence-to-sequence perspective, most of them have focused on a single area without considering the existing correlation between multiple disjoint regions. In this paper, we formulate precipitation nowcasting as a spatiotemporal graph sequence nowcasting problem. In particular, we introduce Graph Dual-stream Convolutional Attention Fusion (GD-CAF), a novel approach designed to learn from historical spatiotemporal graph of precipitation maps and nowcast future time step ahead precipitation at different spatial locations. GD-CAF consists of spatio-temporal convolutional attention as well as gated fusion modules which are equipped with depthwise-separable convolutional operations. This enhancement enables the model to directly process the high-dimensional spatiotemporal graph of precipitation maps and exploits higher-order correlations between the data dimensions. We evaluate our model on seven years of precipitation maps across Europe and its neighboring areas collected from the ERA5 dataset, provided by Copernicus. The model receives a fully connected graph in which each node represents historical observations from a specific region on the map. Consequently, each node contains a 3D tensor with time, height, and width dimensions. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed GD-CAF model outperforms the other examined models. Furthermore, the averaged seasonal spatial and temporal attention scores over the test set are visualized to provide additional insights about the strongest connections between different regions or time steps.

    "abstract": "Homelessness is a social and health problem with great repercussions in Europe. Many non-governmental organisations help homeless people by collecting and analysing large amounts of information about them. However, these tasks are not always easy to perform, and hinder other of the organisations duties. The SINTECH project was created to tackle this issue proposing two different tools: a mobile application to quickly and easily collect data; and a software based on artificial intelligence which obtains interesting information from the collected data. The first one has been distributed to some Spanish organisations which are using it to conduct surveys of homeless people. The second tool implements different feature selection and association rules mining methods. These artificial intelligence techniques have allowed us to identify the most relevant features and some interesting association rules from previously collected homeless data. ",

    "abstract": "While Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) excel at learning complex latent-space representations, their over-parameterization can lead to overfitting and reduced performance, particularly with limited data. This, alongside their high computational and memory demands, limits the applicability of CNNs for edge deployment. Low-rank matrix approximation has emerged as a promising approach to reduce CNN parameters, but its application presents challenges including rank selection and performance loss. To address these issues, we propose an efficient training method for CNN compression via dynamic parameter rank pruning. Our approach integrates efficient matrix factorization and novel regularization techniques, forming a robust framework for dynamic rank reduction and model compression. We use Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to model low-rank convolutional filters and dense weight matrices and we achieve model compression by training the SVD factors with back-propagation in an end-to-end way. We evaluate our method on an array of modern CNNs, including ResNet-18, ResNet-20, and ResNet-32, and datasets like CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet (2012), showcasing its applicability in computer vision. Our experiments show that the proposed method can yield substantial storage savings while maintaining or even enhancing classification performance. ",

    "title": "Small Object Detection by DETR via Information Augmentation and Adaptive  Feature Fusion",
    "abstract": "The main challenge for small object detection algorithms is to ensure accuracy while pursuing real-time performance. The RT-DETR model performs well in real-time object detection, but performs poorly in small object detection accuracy. In order to compensate for the shortcomings of the RT-DETR model in small object detection, two key improvements are proposed in this study. Firstly, The RT-DETR utilises a Transformer that receives input solely from the final layer of Backbone features. This means that the Transformer's input only receives semantic information from the highest level of abstraction in the Deep Network, and ignores detailed information such as edges, texture or color gradients that are critical to the location of small objects at lower levels of abstraction. Including only deep features can introduce additional background noise. This can have a negative impact on the accuracy of small object detection. To address this issue, we propose the fine-grained path augmentation method. This method helps to locate small objects more accurately by providing detailed information to the deep network. So, the input to the transformer contains both semantic and detailed information. Secondly, In RT-DETR, the decoder takes feature maps of different levels as input after concatenating them with equal weight. However, this operation is not effective in dealing with the complex relationship of multi-scale information captured by feature maps of different sizes. Therefore, we propose an adaptive feature fusion algorithm that assigns learnable parameters to each feature map from different levels. This allows the model to adaptively fuse feature maps from different levels and effectively integrate feature information from different scales. This enhances the model's ability to capture object features at different scales, thereby improving the accuracy of detecting small objects. ",

A total of 15 participants (7 females and 8 males) performed a typing task with and without virtual hand representations. The optical motion capture data was utilized to capture the upper extremity angles, and electromyography device was used to collect the neck muscle activities (left and right splenius capitis). The results showed that the typing performance, upper extremity angle, neck muscle activity, and usability were significantly different with and without virtual hand representations. With the virtual hand representation, net typing speed (WPM) and usability increased significantly by 171.4% and 25% compared to the without hand representation. Without the virtual hand representation, participants showed increased wrist extension, and decreased right shoulder abduction angles. The variability of the neck rotation was increased while typing without the virtual hand representation. The neck muscle activities were increased with the virtual hand representation. The results suggest that typing with the virtual hand representation could positively affect the typing performance and usability and reduce the risk of the musculoskeletal disorders of the upper extremity. Future study could explore the effect of the virtual hand representation for users with varying levels of typing skills. ",

Researchers in domains such as cognitive psychology and healthcare often use logistically expensive experiments to understand causal beliefs and illusions. In this paper, we propose Belief Miner, a crowdsourcing method for evaluating people's causal beliefs and illusions. Our method uses the (dis)similarities between the causal relations collected from the crowds and experts to surface the causal beliefs and illusions. Through an iterative design process, we developed a web-based interface for collecting causal relations from a target population. We then conducted a crowdsourced experiment with 101 workers on Amazon Mechanical Turk and Prolific using this interface and analyzed the collected data with Belief Miner. We discovered a variety of causal beliefs and potential illusions, and we report the design implications for future research. ",

    "abstract": "As 5G technology becomes increasingly established, the anticipation for 6G is growing, which promises to deliver faster and more reliable wireless connections via cutting-edge radio technologies. However, efficient management method of the large-scale antenna arrays deployed by those radio technologies is crucial. Traditional management methods are mainly reactive, usually based on feedback from users to adapt to the dynamic wireless channel. However, a more promising approach lies in the prediction of spatial channel state information (spatial-CSI), which is an all-inclusive channel characterization and consists of all the feasible line-of-sight (LoS) and non-line-of-sight (NLoS) paths between the transmitter (Tx) and receiver (Rx), with the three-dimension (3D) trajectory, attenuation, phase shift, delay, and polarization of each path. Advances in hardware and neural networks make it possible to predict such spatial-CSI using precise environmental information, and further look into the possibility of holographic communication, which implies complete control over every aspect of the radio waves emitted. Based on the integration of holographic communication and digital twin, we proposed a new framework, digital radio twin, which takes advantages from both the digital world and deterministic control over radio waves, supporting a wide range of high-level applications. As a preliminary attempt towards this visionary direction, in this paper, we explore the use of generative artificial intelligence (AI) to pinpoint the valid paths in a given environment, demonstrating promising results, and highlighting the potential of this approach in driving forward the evolution of 6G wireless communication technologies.

    "abstract": "3D lanes offer a more comprehensive understanding of the road surface geometry than 2D lanes, thereby providing crucial references for driving decisions and trajectory planning. While many efforts aim to improve prediction accuracy, we recognize that an efficient network can bring results closer to lane modeling. However, if the modeling data is imprecise, the results might not accurately capture the real-world scenario. Therefore, accurate lane modeling is essential to align prediction results closely with the environment. This study centers on efficient and accurate lane modeling, proposing a joint modeling approach that combines Bezier curves and interpolation methods. Furthermore, based on this lane modeling approach, we developed a Global2Local Lane Matching method with Bezier Control-Point and Key-Point, which serve as a comprehensive solution that leverages hierarchical features with two mathematical models to ensure a precise match. We also introduce a novel 3D Spatial Constructor, representing an exploration of 3D surround-view lane detection research. The framework is suitable for front-view or surround-view 3D lane detection. By directly outputting the key points of lanes in 3D space, it overcomes the limitations of anchor-based methods, enabling accurate prediction of closed-loop or U-shaped lanes and effective adaptation to complex road conditions. This innovative method establishes a new benchmark in front-view 3D lane detection on the Openlane dataset and achieves competitive performance in surround-view 2D lane detection on the Argoverse2 dataset.

    "abstract": "While IoT sensors in physical spaces have provided utility and comfort in our lives, their instrumentation in private and personal spaces has led to growing concerns regarding privacy. The existing notion behind IoT privacy is that the sensors whose data can easily be understood and interpreted by humans (such as cameras) are more privacy-invasive than sensors that are not human-understandable, such as RF (radio-frequency) sensors. However, given recent advancements in machine learning, we can not only make sensitive inferences on RF data but also translate between modalities. Thus, the existing notions of privacy for IoT sensors need to be revisited. In this paper, our goal is to understand what factors affect the privacy notions of a non-expert user (someone who is not well-versed in privacy concepts). To this regard, we conduct an online study of 162 participants from the USA to find out what factors affect the privacy perception of a user regarding an RF-based device or a sensor. Our findings show that a user's perception of privacy not only depends upon the data collected by the sensor but also on the inferences that can be made on that data, familiarity with the device and its form factor as well as the control a user has over the device design and its data policies. When the data collected by the sensor is not human-interpretable, it is the inferences that can be made on the data and not the data itself that users care about when making informed decisions regarding device privacy.

To address these challenges, we present Calpric , which combines automatic text selection and segmentation, active learning and the use of crowdsourced annotators to generate a large, balanced training set for privacy policies at low cost. Automated text selection and segmentation simplifies the labeling task, enabling untrained annotators from crowdsourcing platforms, like Amazon's Mechanical Turk, to be competitive with trained annotators, such as law students, and also reduces inter-annotator agreement, which decreases labeling cost. Having reliable labels for training enables the use of active learning, which uses fewer training samples to efficiently cover the input space, further reducing cost and improving class and data category balance in the data set. The combination of these techniques allows Calpric to produce models that are accurate over a wider range of data categories, and provide more detailed, fine-grain labels than previous work. Our crowdsourcing process enables Calpric to attain reliable labeled data at a cost of roughly $0.92-$1.71 per labeled text segment. Calpric 's training process also generates a labeled data set of 16K privacy policy text segments across 9 Data categories with balanced positive and negative samples. ",

    "abstract": "The emergence of large language models (LLMs), such as Generative Pre-trained Transformer 4 (GPT-4) used by ChatGPT, has profoundly impacted the academic and broader community. While these models offer numerous advantages in terms of revolutionizing work and study methods, they have also garnered significant attention due to their potential negative consequences. One example is generating academic reports or papers with little to no human contribution. Consequently, researchers have focused on developing detectors to address the misuse of LLMs. However, most existing methods prioritize achieving higher accuracy on restricted datasets, neglecting the crucial aspect of generalizability. This limitation hinders their practical application in real-life scenarios where reliability is paramount. In this paper, we present a comprehensive analysis of the impact of prompts on the text generated by LLMs and highlight the potential lack of robustness in one of the current state-of-the-art GPT detectors. To mitigate these issues concerning the misuse of LLMs in academic writing, we propose a reference-based Siamese detector named Synthetic-Siamese which takes a pair of texts, one as the inquiry and the other as the reference. Our method effectively addresses the lack of robustness of previous detectors (OpenAI detector and DetectGPT) and significantly improves the baseline performances in realistic academic writing scenarios by approximately 67% to 95%.

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a novel positioning technique suitable for use in mobile robots in urban environments in which large global navigation satellite system (GNSS) positioning errors occur because of multipath signals. During GNSS positioning, the GNSS satellites that are obstructed by buildings emit reflection and diffraction signals, which are called non-line-of-sight (NLOS) multipath signals. These multipath signals cause major positioning errors. The key concept considered in this paper is the estimation of a user's position using the likelihood of the position hypotheses computed from the GNSS pseudoranges, consisting only of LOS signals based on the analysis of the pseudorange residuals. To determine the NLOS GNSS signals from the pseudorange residuals at the user's position, it is necessary to accurately determine the position before the computation of the pseudorange residuals. This problem is solved using a particle filter. We propose a likelihood estimation method using the Mahalanobis distance between the hypotheses of the user's position computed from only the LOS pseudoranges and the particles. To confirm the effectiveness of the proposed technique, a positioning test was performed in a real-world urban environment. The results demonstrated that the proposed method is effective for accurately estimating the user's position in urban canyons. ",

    "abstract": "Precise detection of tiny objects in remote sensing imagery remains a significant challenge due to their limited visual information and frequent occurrence within scenes. This challenge is further exacerbated by the practical burden and inherent errors associated with manual annotation: annotating tiny objects is laborious and prone to errors (i.e., label noise). Training detectors for such objects using noisy labels often leads to suboptimal performance, with networks tending to overfit on noisy labels. In this study, we address the intricate issue of tiny object detection under noisy label supervision. We systematically investigate the impact of various types of noise on network training, revealing the vulnerability of object detectors to class shifts and inaccurate bounding boxes for tiny objects. To mitigate these challenges, we propose a DeNoising Tiny Object Detector (DN-TOD), which incorporates a Class-aware Label Correction (CLC) scheme to address class shifts and a Trend-guided Learning Strategy (TLS) to handle bounding box noise. CLC mitigates inaccurate class supervision by identifying and filtering out class-shifted positive samples, while TLS reduces noisy box-induced erroneous supervision through sample reweighting and bounding box regeneration. Additionally, Our method can be seamlessly integrated into both one-stage and two-stage object detection pipelines. Comprehensive experiments conducted on synthetic (i.e., noisy AI-TOD-v2.0 and DOTA-v2.0) and real-world (i.e., AI-TOD) noisy datasets demonstrate the robustness of DN-TOD under various types of label noise. Notably, when applied to the strong baseline RFLA, DN-TOD exhibits a noteworthy performance improvement of 4.9 points under 40% mixed noise.

This is a retrospective study of 491 non-contrast head CTs from the CQ500 dataset, in which three senior radiologists annotated slices containing intracranial hemorrhage (ICH). The dataset was split into definite and challenging subsets, where challenging images were defined to those in which there was disagreement among readers. A DL model was trained on 146 patients (10,815 slices) from the definite data (training dataset) to perform ICH localization and classification for five classes of ICH. To develop an uncertainty-aware DL model, 1,546 cases of the definite data (calibration dataset) was used for Mondrian conformal prediction (MCP). The uncertainty-aware DL model was tested on 8,401 definite and challenging cases to assess its ability to identify challenging cases. After the MCP procedure, the model achieved an F1 score of 0.920 for ICH classification on the test dataset. Additionally, it correctly identified 6,837 of the 6,856 total challenging cases as challenging (99.7% accuracy). It did not incorrectly label any definite cases as challenging.

Recently, deep neural networks such as Convolutional neural networks (CNN) and Transformers have been introduced for vein recognition and achieved state-of-the-art performance. Despite the recent advances, however, existing solutions for finger-vein feature extraction are still not optimal due to scarce training image samples. To overcome this problem, in this paper, we propose an adversarial masking contrastive learning (AMCL) approach, that generates challenging samples to train a more robust contrastive learning model for the downstream palm-vein recognition task, by alternatively optimizing the encoder in the contrastive learning model and a set of latent variables. First, a huge number of masks are generated to train a robust generative adversarial network (GAN). The trained generator transforms a latent variable from the latent variable space into a mask space. Then, we combine the trained generator with a contrastive learning model to obtain our AMCL, where the generator produces challenging masking images to increase the contrastive loss and the contrastive learning model is trained based on the harder images to learn a more robust feature representation. After training, the trained encoder in the contrastive learning model is combined with a classification layer to build a classifier, which is further fine-tuned on labeled training data for vein recognition. The experimental results on three databases demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing contrastive learning approaches in terms of improving identification accuracy of vein classifiers and achieves state-of-the-art recognition results.

    "title": "Hardware Acceleration for Real-Time Wildfire Detection Onboard Drone  Networks",
    "abstract": "Early wildfire detection in remote and forest areas is crucial for minimizing devastation and preserving ecosystems. Autonomous drones offer agile access to remote, challenging terrains, equipped with advanced imaging technology that delivers both high-temporal and detailed spatial resolution, making them valuable assets in the early detection and monitoring of wildfires. However, the limited computation and battery resources of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) pose significant challenges in implementing robust and efficient image classification models. Current works in this domain often operate offline, emphasizing the need for solutions that can perform inference in real time, given the constraints of UAVs. To address these challenges, this paper aims to develop a real-time image classification and fire segmentation model. It presents a comprehensive investigation into hardware acceleration using the Jetson Nano P3450 and the implications of TensorRT, NVIDIA's high-performance deep-learning inference library, on fire classification accuracy and speed. The study includes implementations of Quantization Aware Training (QAT), Automatic Mixed Precision (AMP), and post-training mechanisms, comparing them against the latest baselines for fire segmentation and classification. All experiments utilize the FLAME dataset - an image dataset collected by low-altitude drones during a prescribed forest fire. This work contributes to the ongoing efforts to enable real-time, on-board wildfire detection capabilities for UAVs, addressing speed and the computational and energy constraints of these crucial monitoring systems. The results show a 13% increase in classification speed compared to similar models without hardware optimization. Comparatively, loss and accuracy are within 1.225% of the original values. ",

However, the limited endurance obstacles its further applications in storage class memory (SCM) and to proceed endurance-required computing-in-memory (CIM) tasks. In this work, the optimization strategies have been studied to tackle this concern. It is shown that by adopting the channel hot electrons injection (CHEI) and hot hole injection (HHI) to implement program/erase (PE) cycling together with a balanced memory window (MW) at the high-Vth (HV) mode, impressively, the endurance can be greatly extended to 1010 PE cycles, which is a record-high value in flash memory. Moreover, by using the proposed electric-field-assisted relaxation (EAR) scheme, the degradation of flash cells can be well suppressed with better subthreshold swings (SS) and lower leakage currents (sub-10pA after 1010 PE cycles). Our results shed light on the optimization strategy of flash memory to serve as SCM and implementendurance-required CIM tasks. ",

Physics-based vulnerabilities may exist due to the inherent physics properties and behavior of quantum technologies such as Quantum Key Distribution (QKD), thus resulting in new threats that may emerge with attackers exploiting the physics-based vulnerabilities. There were many studies and experiments done to demonstrate the threat of physics-based attacks on quantum links. However, there is a lack of a framework that provides a common language to communicate about the threats and type of adversaries being dealt with for physics-based attacks. This paper is a review of physics-based attacks that were being investigated and attempt to initialize a framework based on the attack objectives and methodologies, referencing the concept from the well-established MITRE ATT&CK, therefore pioneering the classification of Indicator of Compromises (IoCs) for physics-based attacks. This paper will then pave the way for future work in the development of a forensic tool for the different classification of IoCs, with the methods of evidence collections and possible points of extractions for analysis being further investigated.

    "abstract": "Recent years have witnessed a growing focus on automated software vulnerability detection. Notably, deep learning (DL)-based methods, which employ source code for the implicit acquisition of vulnerability patterns, have demonstrated superior performance compared to other approaches. However, the DL-based approaches are still hard to capture the vulnerability-related information from the whole code snippet, since the vulnerable parts usually account for only a small proportion. As evidenced by our experiments, the approaches tend to excessively emphasize semantic information, potentially leading to limited vulnerability detection performance in practical scenarios. First, they cannot well distinguish between the code snippets before (i.e., vulnerable code) and after (i.e., non-vulnerable code) developers' fixes due to the minimal code changes. Besides, substituting user-defined identifiers with placeholders (e.g., \"VAR1\" and \"FUN1\") in obvious performance degradation at up to 14.53% with respect to the F1 score. To mitigate these issues, we propose to leverage the vulnerable and corresponding fixed code snippets, in which the minimal changes can provide hints about semantic-agnostic features for vulnerability detection. In this paper, we propose a software vulneRability dEteCtion framework with zerO-sum game and prototype learNing, named RECON. In RECON, we propose a zero-sum game construction module. Distinguishing the vulnerable code from the corresponding fixed code is regarded as one player (i.e. Calibrator), while the conventional vulnerability detection is another player (i.e. Detector) in the zero-sum game. The goal is to capture the semantic-agnostic features of the first player for enhancing the second player's performance for vulnerability detection. Experiments on the public benchmark dataset show that RECON outperforms the state-of-the-art baseline by 6.29% in F1 score. ",

One of the significant threats to VANET is the presence of blackhole attacks, where malicious nodes disrupt the network's functionality and compromise data confidentiality, integrity, and availability. In this paper, we propose a machine learning-based approach for blackhole detection in VANET. To achieve this task, we first create a comprehensive dataset comprising normal and malicious traffic flows. Afterward, we study and define a promising set of features to discriminate the blackhole attacks. Finally, we evaluate various machine learning algorithms, including Gradient Boosting, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines, k-Nearest Neighbors, Gaussian Naive Bayes, and Logistic Regression. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of these algorithms in distinguishing between normal and malicious nodes. Our findings also highlight the potential of machine learning based approach in enhancing the security of VANET by detecting and mitigating blackhole attacks. ",

    "abstract": "In trigger-action IoT platforms, IoT devices report event conditions to IoT hubs notifying their cyber states and let the hubs invoke actions in other IoT devices based on functional dependencies defined as rules in a rule engine. These functional dependencies create a chain of interactions that help automate network tasks. Adversaries exploit this chain to report fake event conditions to IoT hubs and perform remote injection attacks upon a smart environment to indirectly control targeted IoT devices. Existing defense efforts usually depend on static analysis over IoT apps to develop rule-based anomaly detection mechanisms. We also see ML-based defense mechanisms in the literature that harness physical event fingerprints to determine anomalies in an IoT network. However, these methods often demonstrate long response time and lack of adaptability when facing complicated attacks. In this paper, we propose to build a deep reinforcement learning based real-time defense system for injection attacks. We define the reward functions for defenders and implement a deep Q-network based approach to identify the optimal defense policy. Our experiments show that the proposed mechanism can effectively and accurately identify and defend against injection attacks with reasonable computation overhead. ",

Depending on whether the sequence is periodic or ultimately periodic, all states in the domain can be attributed to two types of objects: some cycles of different lengths and one unilateral connected digraph whose structure remains unchanged concerning parameter $e$. The graph structure of the generator over the ring $\\mathbb{Z}_e$ is precisely disclosed with rigorous theoretical analysis and verified experimentally. The adopted analysis methodology can be extended to study the graph structure of other nonlinear maps. ",

    "abstract": "Linear Array Pushbroom (LAP) imaging technology is widely used in the realm of remote sensing. However, images acquired through LAP always suffer from distortion and blur because of camera jitter. Traditional methods for restoring LAP images, such as algorithms estimating the point spread function (PSF), exhibit limited performance. To tackle this issue, we propose a Jitter-Aware Restoration Network (JARNet), to remove the distortion and blur in two stages. In the first stage, we formulate an Optical Flow Correction (OFC) block to refine the optical flow of the degraded LAP images, resulting in pre-corrected images where most of the distortions are alleviated. In the second stage, for further enhancement of the pre-corrected images, we integrate two jitter-aware techniques within the Spatial and Frequency Residual (SFRes) block: 1) introducing Coordinate Attention (CoA) to the SFRes block in order to capture the jitter state in orthogonal direction; 2) manipulating image features in both spatial and frequency domains to leverage local and global priors. Additionally, we develop a data synthesis pipeline, which applies Continue Dynamic Shooting Model (CDSM) to simulate realistic degradation in LAP images. Both the proposed JARNet and LAP image synthesis pipeline establish a foundation for addressing this intricate challenge. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed two-stage method outperforms state-of-the-art image restoration models. Code is available at https://github.com/JHW2000/JARNet. ",

In this paper, we address this challenge by enriching the data landscape and introducing a novel math dataset, enhanced with a capability to utilize a Python code interpreter. This dataset is derived from GSM8K and MATH and has been further refined through a combination of GPT-4 annotations, human review, and self-training processes, where the errors in the original GSM8K training set have been fixed. Additionally, we propose a tentative, easily replicable protocol for the fine-tuning of math-specific LLMs, which has led to a significant improvement in the performance of a 7B-parameter LLM on the GSM8K and MATH datasets. We are committed to advancing the field of mathematical reasoning in LLMs and, to that end, we have made the model checkpoints and will make the dataset publicly available.

    "abstract": "Federated learning (FL) is vulnerable to poisoning attacks, where malicious clients manipulate their updates to affect the global model. Although various methods exist for detecting those clients in FL, identifying malicious clients requires sufficient model updates, and hence by the time malicious clients are detected, FL models have been already poisoned. Thus, a method is needed to recover an accurate global model after malicious clients are identified. Current recovery methods rely on (i) all historical information from participating FL clients and (ii) the initial model unaffected by the malicious clients, leading to a high demand for storage and computational resources. In this paper, we show that highly effective recovery can still be achieved based on (i) selective historical information rather than all historical information and (ii) a historical model that has not been significantly affected by malicious clients rather than the initial model. In this scenario, while maintaining comparable recovery performance, we can accelerate the recovery speed and decrease memory consumption. Following this concept, we introduce Crab, an efficient and certified recovery method, which relies on selective information storage and adaptive model rollback. Theoretically, we demonstrate that the difference between the global model recovered by Crab and the one recovered by train-from-scratch can be bounded under certain assumptions. Our empirical evaluation, conducted across three datasets over multiple machine learning models, and a variety of untargeted and targeted poisoning attacks reveals that Crab is both accurate and efficient, and consistently outperforms previous approaches in terms of both recovery speed and memory consumption.

We defined These data forms as \"Indefinite Data\", characterized by multi-structure data and multi-value representations. Unlike existing adaptable data forms, Indefinite Data still faces gaps in datasets and methods. To address the dataset gap, we release two high-quality datasets - Causalogue and Causaction, containing text dialogue samples and video action samples with causal annotations respectively. Moreover, the method gap arises from the coexistence of multi-structure data and multi-value representations, breaking the assumptions of all current methods and rendering them infeasible on Indefinite Data. To this end, we propose a probabilistic framework as a baseline, incorporating three designed highlights for this gap: 1) establishing Causation Condition of representations using the independence of noise terms under non-fixed causal structures, 2) treating causal strength as a latent variable and measuring the reconstruction loss in the correlation space, and 3) estimating the effects of latent confounders. These highpoints make the probabilistic model capable of overcoming challenges brought by the coexistence of multi-structure data and multi-value representations and pave the way for the extension of latent confounders.

However, despite their effectiveness, the noise present in the collected data remains a significant challenge. This noise has the potential to diminish the performance of these algorithms, leading to inaccurate predictions. In response to this, this study explores a novel feature engineering approach. This approach involves altering the data input shape in both Convolutional Neural Network-Long Short-Term Memory (CNN-LSTM) and Autoregressive models for various forecasting horizons. The results reveal substantial enhancements in model resilience against noise resulting from step increases in data. The approach could achieve an impressive 83% accuracy in predicting unseen data up to the 24th steps. Furthermore, this method consistently provides high accuracy for short, mid, and long-term forecasts, outperforming the performance of individual models. These findings pave the way for further research on noise reduction strategies at different forecasting horizons through shape-wise feature engineering. ",

The parameter $k$ represents the number of neighbors that are connected to the target node; however, its appropriate selection is still a challenging problem. Therefore, most $k$NNGs use ad hoc selection methods for $k$. In the proposed method, we assume that a different $k$ can be chosen for each node. We formulate a discrete optimization problem to seek the best $k$ with a constraint on the sum of distances of the connected nodes. The optimal $k$ values are efficiently obtained without solving a complex optimization. Furthermore, we reveal that the proposed method is closely related to existing graph learning methods. In experiments on real datasets, we demonstrate that the $k$NNGs obtained with our method are sparse and can determine an appropriate variable number of edges per node. We validate the effectiveness of the proposed method for point cloud denoising, comparing our denoising performance with achievable graph construction methods that can be scaled to typical point cloud sizes (e.g., thousands of nodes).

    "abstract": "Current adversarial attack algorithms, where an adversary changes a text to fool a victim model, have been repeatedly shown to be effective against text classifiers. These attacks, however, generally assume that the victim model is monolingual and cannot be used to target multilingual victim models, a significant limitation given the increased use of these models. For this reason, in this work we propose an approach to fine-tune a multilingual paraphrase model with an adversarial objective so that it becomes able to generate effective adversarial examples against multilingual classifiers. The training objective incorporates a set of pre-trained models to ensure text quality and language consistency of the generated text. In addition, all the models are suitably connected to the generator by vocabulary-mapping matrices, allowing for full end-to-end differentiability of the overall training pipeline. The experimental validation over two multilingual datasets and five languages has shown the effectiveness of the proposed approach compared to existing baselines, particularly in terms of query efficiency. We also provide a detailed analysis of the generated attacks and discuss limitations and opportunities for future research. ",

    "abstract": "Wireless systems beyond 5G evolve towards embracing both sensing and communication, resulting in increased convergence of the digital and the physical world. The existence of fused digital-physical realms raises critical questions regarding temporal ordering, causality, and the synchronization of events. This paper addresses the temporal challenges arising from the fact that the wireless infrastructure becomes an entity with multisensory perception. With the growing reliance on real-time interactions and applications such as digital twins, extended reality, and the metaverse, the need for accurate timestamping and temporal forensics becomes crucial. The paper introduces a model that incorporates Temporal Windows of Integration (TWI) to emulate human multisensory perception and discusses the implications for setting timing constraints in real-time applications and enabling temporal forensics. The analysis explores trade-offs, probabilities, and bounds for simultaneity and causality violation in the context of wireless systems evolving towards perceptive networks. This work underscores the significance of timestamping in the evolving wireless landscape, provide insights into system-level implications, and points out new research avenues for systems that combine sensing and communications.

Unfortunately, these methods usually produce watermarks susceptible to model stealing attacks. In our research, we introduce a novel trigger set-based watermarking approach that demonstrates resilience against functionality stealing attacks, particularly those involving extraction and distillation. Our approach does not require additional model training and can be applied to any model architecture. The key idea of our method is to compute the trigger set, which is transferable between the source model and the set of proxy models with a high probability. In our experimental study, we show that if the probability of the set being transferable is reasonably high, it can be effectively used for ownership verification of the stolen model. We evaluate our method on multiple benchmarks and show that our approach outperforms current state-of-the-art watermarking techniques in all considered experimental setups. ",

However, with the evolution of Search Engine Result Pages (SERPs), now comprising a variety of result cards, the manner in which these results are presented is pivotal in influencing user engagement and satisfaction. This shift prompts the question: How does the PRP and its user-centric counterpart, the Interactive Probability Ranking Principle (iPRP), compare in the context of these heterogeneous SERPs? Our study draws a comparison between the PRP and the iPRP, revealing significant differences in their output. The iPRP, accounting for item-specific costs and interaction probabilities to determine the ``Expected Perceived Utility\" (EPU), yields different result orderings compared to the PRP. We evaluate the effect of the EPU on the ordering of results by observing changes in the ranking within a heterogeneous SERP compared to the traditional ``ten blue links''. We find that changing the presentation affects the ranking of items according to the (iPRP) by up to 48\\% (with respect to DCG, TBG and RBO) in ad-hoc search tasks on the TREC WaPo Collection. This work suggests that the iPRP should be employed when ranking heterogeneous SERPs to provide a user-centric ranking that adapts the ordering based on the presentation and user engagement. ",

    "abstract": "Tool learning has generated widespread interest as a vital means of interaction between Large Language Models (LLMs) and the physical world. Current research predominantly emphasizes LLMs' capacity to utilize tools in well-structured environments while overlooking their stability when confronted with the inevitable noise of the real world. To bridge this gap, we introduce RoTBench, a multi-level benchmark for evaluating the robustness of LLMs in tool learning. Specifically, we establish five external environments, each featuring varying levels of noise (i.e., Clean, Slight, Medium, Heavy, and Union), providing an in-depth analysis of the model's resilience across three critical phases: tool selection, parameter identification, and content filling. Experiments involving six widely-used models underscore the urgent necessity for enhancing the robustness of LLMs in tool learning. For instance, the performance of GPT-4 even drops significantly from 80.00 to 58.10 when there is no substantial change in manual accuracy. More surprisingly, the noise correction capability inherent in the GPT family paradoxically impedes its adaptability in the face of mild noise. In light of these findings, we propose RoTTuning, a strategy that enriches the diversity of training environments to bolster the robustness of LLMs in tool learning.

    "abstract": "Knowledge distillation is the process of transferring knowledge from a more powerful large model (teacher) to a simpler counterpart (student). Numerous current approaches involve the student imitating the knowledge of the teacher directly. However, redundancy still exists in the learned representations through these prevalent methods, which tend to learn each spatial location's features indiscriminately. To derive a more compact representation (concept feature) from the teacher, inspired by human cognition, we suggest an innovative method, termed Generative Denoise Distillation (GDD), where stochastic noises are added to the concept feature of the student to embed them into the generated instance feature from a shallow network. Then, the generated instance feature is aligned with the knowledge of the instance from the teacher. We extensively experiment with object detection, instance segmentation, and semantic segmentation to demonstrate the versatility and effectiveness of our method. Notably, GDD achieves new state-of-the-art performance in the tasks mentioned above. We have achieved substantial improvements in semantic segmentation by enhancing PspNet and DeepLabV3, both of which are based on ResNet-18, resulting in mIoU scores of 74.67 and 77.69, respectively, surpassing their previous scores of 69.85 and 73.20 on the Cityscapes dataset of 20 categories.

In response to this challenge, our research expands the range of conflict resolution strategies beyond the established Nash Bargaining Solution (NBS), to incorporate the Weighted Nash Bargaining Solution (WNBS), the Kalai-Smorodinsky Bargaining Solution (KSBS), and the Shannon Entropy Bargaining Solution (SEBS). These methods are employed with the objective to identify optimal parameter values, aiming to ensure fairness in conflict resolution. Through simulations, it is demonstrated that distinct antenna tilt values are yielded as the respective solutions for each method. Ultimately, based on Jain Fairness Index, the KSBS is identified as the most equitable method under the given conditions. ",

Various techniques are available for preemptively categorizing zero-day phishing URLs by distilling unique attributes and constructing predictive models. However, these existing techniques encounter unresolved issues. This proposal delves into persistent challenges within phishing detection solutions, particularly concentrated on the preliminary phase of assembling comprehensive datasets, and proposes a potential solution in the form of a tool engineered to alleviate bias in ML models. Such a tool can generate phishing webpages for any given set of legitimate URLs, infusing randomly selected content and visual-based phishing features.

However, in dealing with noisy data, kernel interpolation frequently behaves not so well due to the large condition number of the kernel matrix and instability of the interpolation process. In this paper, we introduce a weighted spectral filter approach to reduce the condition number of the kernel matrix and then stabilize kernel interpolation. The main building blocks of the proposed method are the well developed spherical positive quadrature rules and high-pass spectral filters. Using a recently developed integral operator approach for spherical data analysis, we theoretically demonstrate that the proposed weighted spectral filter approach succeeds in breaking through the bottleneck of kernel interpolation, especially in fitting noisy data. We provide optimal approximation rates of the new method to show that our approach does not compromise the predicting accuracy. Furthermore, we conduct both toy simulations and two real-world data experiments with synthetically added noise in geophysical image reconstruction and climate image processing to verify our theoretical assertions and show the feasibility of the weighted spectral filter approach.

However, the reduced availability of in-domain TMs, as compared to in-domain monolingual corpora, limits its adoption for a number of translation tasks.

Our approach relies on cross-lingual sentence embeddings to retrieve translation proposals from TL monolingual corpora, and on a neural model to estimate their post-editing effort. The paper presents an automatic evaluation of these techniques on four language pairs that shows that our approach can successfully exploit monolingual texts in a TM-based CAT environment, increasing the amount of useful translation proposals, and that our neural model for estimating the post-editing effort enables the combination of translation proposals obtained from monolingual corpora and from TMs in the usual way. A human evaluation performed on a single language pair confirms the results of the automatic evaluation and seems to indicate that the translation proposals retrieved with our approach are more useful than what the automatic evaluation shows.

Finally, we analyze the Edge of Stability problem, where we show that all convex, non-smooth, Lipschitz continuous functions display unstable convergence, and provide an example of a result derived using twice differentiable functions which fails in the once differentiable setting.

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a dynamic capacitance matching (DCM)-based RC current response algorithm for calculating the current waveform of a signal line without performing SPICE simulation. Specifically, unlike previous method such as CCS model, driver linear representation, waveform functional fitting or equivalent load capacitance, our algorithm does not rely on fixed reduced model of both standard cell driver and RC load. Instead, our algorithm approaches the current waveform dynamically by computing current responses of the target driver for various load scenarios. Besides, we creatively use symbolic expression to combine the y-parameter of RC network with the pre-characterized driver library in order to perform capacitance matching by considering over/under-shoot effect. Our algorithm is experimentally verified on 40nm CMOS technology and has been partially adopted by latest commercial tool for other nodes. Experimental results show that our algorithm has excellent resolution and promising efficiency compared with traditional methods and SPICE golden result, especially for application in computing delay, power and signal line electromigration.

    "abstract": "Co-existence of terrestrial and non-terrestrial networks (NTN) is foreseen as an important component to fulfill the global coverage promised for sixth-generation (6G) of cellular networks. Due to ever rising spectrum demand, using dedicated frequency bands for terrestrial network (TN) and NTN may not be feasible. As a result, certain S-band frequency bands allocated by radio regulations to NTN networks are overlapping with those already utilized by cellular TN, leading to significant performance degradation due to the potential co-channel interference. Early simulation-based studies on different co-existence scenarios failed to offer a comprehensive and insightful understanding of these networks' overall performance. Besides, the complexity of a brute force performance evaluation increases exponentially with the number of nodes and their possible combinations in the network. In this paper, we utilize stochastic geometry to analytically derive the performance of TN-NTN integrated networks in terms of the probability of coverage and average achievable data rate for two co-existence scenarios. From the numerical results, it can be observed that, depending on the network parameters, TN and NTN users' distributions, and traffic load, one co-existence case may outperform the other, resulting in optimal performance of the integrated network. The analytical results presented herein pave the way for designing state-of-the-art methods for spectrum sharing between TN and NTN and optimizing the integrated network performance. ",

The concept representations of each agent are individually constructed yet compatible on a communicative level. Through a range of experiments, we show (i) that the methodology enables a population to converge on a communicatively effective, coherent and human-interpretable linguistic convention, (ii) that it is naturally robust against sensor defects in individual agents, (iii) that it can effectively deal with noisy observations, uncalibrated sensors and heteromorphic populations, (iv) that the method is adequate for continual learning, and (v) that the convention self-adapts to changes in the environment and communicative needs of the agents.

Hence, many of the optimizations and tricks that have been successful in natural language generation may not be effective for code tasks. In this work, we propose a new approach to code generation by LLMs, which we call AlphaCodium - a test-based, multi-stage, code-oriented iterative flow, that improves the performances of LLMs on code problems. We tested AlphaCodium on a challenging code generation dataset called CodeContests, which includes competitive programming problems from platforms such as Codeforces. The proposed flow consistently and significantly improves results. On the validation set, for example, GPT-4 accuracy (pass@5) increased from 19% with a single well-designed direct prompt to 44% with the AlphaCodium flow.

    "abstract": "Designing expressive Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) is a fundamental topic in the graph learning community. So far, GNN expressiveness has been primarily assessed via the Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) hierarchy. However, such an expressivity measure has notable limitations: it is inherently coarse, qualitative, and may not well reflect practical requirements (e.g., the ability to encode substructures). In this paper, we introduce a unified framework for quantitatively studying the expressiveness of GNN architectures, addressing all the above limitations. Specifically, we identify a fundamental expressivity measure termed homomorphism expressivity, which quantifies the ability of GNN models to count graphs under homomorphism. Homomorphism expressivity offers a complete and practical assessment tool: the completeness enables direct expressivity comparisons between GNN models, while the practicality allows for understanding concrete GNN abilities such as subgraph counting. By examining four classes of prominent GNNs as case studies, we derive simple, unified, and elegant descriptions of their homomorphism expressivity for both invariant and equivariant settings. Our results provide novel insights into a series of previous work, unify the landscape of different subareas in the community, and settle several open questions. Empirically, extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world tasks verify our theory, showing that the practical performance of GNN models aligns well with the proposed metric. ",

Among explainability approaches, chatbots offer the potential to engage the student in a conversation, similar to a discussion with a peer or a mentor. The capabilities of chatbots, however, are still not sufficient to replace a human mentor, despite the advancements of generative AI (GenAI) and large language models (LLM). Therefore, we propose an approach to utilize chatbots as mediators of the conversation and sources of limited and controlled generation of explanations, to harvest the potential of LLMs while reducing their potential risks at the same time. The proposed LLM-based chatbot supports students in understanding learning-paths recommendations. We use a knowledge graph (KG) as a human-curated source of information, to regulate the LLM's output through defining its prompt's context. A group chat approach is developed to connect students with human mentors, either on demand or in cases that exceed the chatbot's pre-defined tasks. We evaluate the chatbot with a user study, to provide a proof-of-concept and highlight the potential requirements and limitations of utilizing chatbots in conversational explainability. ",

    "abstract": "We study the implications of the modeling choice to use a graph, instead of a hypergraph, to represent real-world interconnected systems whose constituent relationships are of higher order by nature. Such a modeling choice typically involves an underlying projection process that maps the original hypergraph onto a graph, and is common in graph-based analysis. While hypergraph projection can potentially lead to loss of higher-order relations, there exists very limited studies on the consequences of doing so, as well as its remediation. This work fills this gap by doing two things: (1) we develop analysis based on graph and set theory, showing two ubiquitous patterns of hyperedges that are root to structural information loss in all hypergraph projections; we also quantify the combinatorial impossibility of recovering the lost higher-order structures if no extra help is provided; (2) we still seek to recover the lost higher-order structures in hypergraph projection, and in light of (1)'s findings we propose to relax the problem into a learning-based setting. Under this setting, we develop a learning-based hypergraph reconstruction method based on an important statistic of hyperedge distributions that we find. Our reconstruction method is evaluated on 8 real-world datasets under different settings, and exhibits consistently good performance. We also demonstrate benefits of the reconstructed hypergraphs via use cases of protein rankings and link predictions. ",

The emergence of flash loans has further amplified these risks, enabling increasingly complex oracle manipulation attacks that can lead to significant financial losses. Responding to this threat, we first dissect the attack mechanism by formalizing the standard operational and adversary models for PLFs. Based on our analysis, we propose SecPLF, a robust and practical solution designed to counteract oracle manipulation attacks efficiently. SecPLF operates by tracking a price state for each crypto-asset, including the recent price and the timestamp of its last update. By imposing price constraints on the price oracle usage, SecPLF ensures a PLF only engages a price oracle if the last recorded price falls within a defined threshold, thereby negating the profitability of potential attacks. Our evaluation based on historical market data confirms SecPLF's efficacy in providing high-confidence prevention against arbitrage attacks that arise due to minor price differences. SecPLF delivers proactive protection against oracle manipulation attacks, offering ease of implementation, oracle-agnostic property, and resource and cost efficiency. ",

Moreover, the causal relations between these concepts should be captured by the explainer to allow for reasoning about the explanations. Lastly, explanation methods should be efficient and not compromise the performance of the predictive task. Despite the rapid advances in AI explainability in recent years, as far as we know to date, no method fulfills these three properties. Indeed, mainstream methods for local concept explainability do not produce causal explanations and incur a trade-off between explainability and prediction performance. We present DiConStruct, an explanation method that is both concept-based and causal, with the goal of creating more interpretable local explanations in the form of structural causal models and concept attributions. Our explainer works as a distillation model to any black-box machine learning model by approximating its predictions while producing the respective explanations. Because of this, DiConStruct generates explanations efficiently while not impacting the black-box prediction task. We validate our method on an image dataset and a tabular dataset, showing that DiConStruct approximates the black-box models with higher fidelity than other concept explainability baselines, while providing explanations that include the causal relations between the concepts.

However, the measurement noises of inputs and outputs will bias the Koopman model identification and cause model mismatch from the actual nonlinear dynamics. The current work evaluates the bounds of the noise-induced model bias of the Koopman operator model and proposes a data-driven robust dual-loop control framework (Koopman based robust control-KROC) for the biased model. First, the model mismatch is found bounded under radial basis functions (RBF) and the bounded noises, and the bound of model mismatch is assessed. Second, the pitfalls of linear quadratic Gaussian (LQG) control based on the biased Koopman model of Van Der Pol oscillator are shown. Motivated from the pitfalls, the dual-loop control is proposed, which consist of an observer-based state-feedback control based on the nominal Koopman model and an additional robust loop to compensate model mismatch. A linear matrix inequality (LMI) is derived, which can guarantee robust stability and performance under bounded noises for the finite-dimensional Koopman operator model. Finally, the proposed framework is implemented to a nonlinear Van Der Pol oscillator to demonstrate enhanced control performance by the dual-loop robust control. ",

Further, the enrichment functions for adaptive refinements are often not readily available in general applications. This work introduces a novel neural network-enriched Partition of Unity (NN-PU) approach for solving boundary value problems via artificial neural networks with a potential energy-based loss function minimization. The flexibility and adaptivity of the NN function space are utilized to capture complex solution patterns that the conventional Galerkin methods fail to capture. The NN enrichment is constructed by combining pre-trained feature-encoded NN blocks with an additional untrained NN block. The pre-trained NN blocks learn specific local features during the offline stage, enabling efficient enrichment of the approximation space during the online stage through the Ritz-type energy minimization. The NN enrichment is introduced under the Partition of Unity (PU) framework, ensuring convergence of the proposed method. The proposed NN-PU approximation and feature-encoded transfer learning forms an adaptive approximation framework, termed the neural-refinement (n-refinement), for solving boundary value problems. Demonstrated by solving various elasticity problems, the proposed method offers accurate solutions while notably reducing the computational cost compared to the conventional adaptive refinement in the mesh-based methods.

    "abstract": "We propose RoHM, an approach for robust 3D human motion reconstruction from monocular RGB(-D) videos in the presence of noise and occlusions. Most previous approaches either train neural networks to directly regress motion in 3D or learn data-driven motion priors and combine them with optimization at test time. The former do not recover globally coherent motion and fail under occlusions; the latter are time-consuming, prone to local minima, and require manual tuning. To overcome these shortcomings, we exploit the iterative, denoising nature of diffusion models. RoHM is a novel diffusion-based motion model that, conditioned on noisy and occluded input data, reconstructs complete, plausible motions in consistent global coordinates. Given the complexity of the problem -- requiring one to address different tasks (denoising and infilling) in different solution spaces (local and global motion) -- we decompose it into two sub-tasks and learn two models, one for global trajectory and one for local motion. To capture the correlations between the two, we then introduce a novel conditioning module, combining it with an iterative inference scheme. We apply RoHM to a variety of tasks -- from motion reconstruction and denoising to spatial and temporal infilling. Extensive experiments on three popular datasets show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches qualitatively and quantitatively, while being faster at test time.

    "abstract": "Lattice gauge-equivariant convolutional neural networks (L-CNNs) can be used to form arbitrarily shaped Wilson loops and can approximate any gauge-covariant or gauge-invariant function on the lattice. Here we use L-CNNs to describe fixed point (FP) actions which are based on renormalization group transformations. FP actions are classically perfect, i.e., they have no lattice artifacts on classical gauge-field configurations satisfying the equations of motion, and therefore possess scale invariant instanton solutions. FP actions are tree-level Symanzik-improved to all orders in the lattice spacing and can produce physical predictions with very small lattice artifacts even on coarse lattices. We find that L-CNNs are much more accurate at parametrizing the FP action compared to older approaches. They may therefore provide a way to circumvent critical slowing down and topological freezing towards the continuum limit. ",

They provide a possible way to extract continuum physics with coarser lattices, thereby allowing to circumvent problems with critical slowing down and topological freezing toward the continuum limit. A crucial ingredient for practical applications is to find an accurate and compact parametrization of a fixed point action, since many of its properties are only implicitly defined. Here we use machine learning methods to revisit the question of how to parametrize fixed point actions. In particular, we obtain a fixed point action for four-dimensional SU(3) gauge theory using convolutional neural networks with exact gauge invariance. The large operator space allows us to find superior parametrizations compared to previous studies, a necessary first step for future Monte Carlo simulations. ",

    "abstract": "In recent years, deep learning has demonstrated promising results in de novo drug design. However, the proposed techniques still lack an efficient exploration of the large chemical space. Most of these methods explore a small fragment of the chemical space of known drugs, if the desired molecules were not found, the process ends. In this work, we introduce a curiosity-driven method to force the model to navigate many parts of the chemical space, therefore, achieving higher desirability and diversity as well. At first, we train a recurrent neural network-based general molecular generator (G), then we fine-tune G to maximize curiosity and desirability. We define curiosity as the Tanimoto similarity between two generated molecules, a first molecule generated by G, and a second one generated by a copy of G (Gcopy). We only backpropagate the loss through G while keeping Gcopy unchanged. We benchmarked our approach against two desirable chemical properties related to drug-likeness and showed that the discovered chemical space can be significantly expanded, thus, discovering a higher number of desirable molecules with more diversity and potentially easier to synthesize.

    "abstract": "The early detection of Alzheimer's Disease is imperative to ensure early treatment and improve patient outcomes. There has consequently been extenstive research into detecting AD and its intermediate phase, mild cognitive impairment (MCI). However, there is very small literature in predicting the conversion to AD and MCI from normal cognitive condition. Recently, multiple studies have applied convolutional neural networks (CNN) which integrate Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and Positron Emission Tomography (PET) to classify MCI and AD. However, in these works, the fusion of MRI and PET features are simply achieved through concatenation, resulting in a lack of cross-modal interactions. In this paper, we propose a novel multimodal neuroimaging attention-based CNN architecture, MNA-net, to predict whether cognitively normal (CN) individuals will develop MCI or AD within a period of 10 years. To address the lack of interactions across neuroimaging modalities seen in previous works, MNA-net utilises attention mechanisms to form shared representations of the MRI and PET images. The proposed MNA-net is tested in OASIS-3 dataset and is able to predict CN individuals who converted to MCI or AD with an accuracy of 83%, true negative rate of 80%, and true positive rate of 86%. The new state of the art results improved by 5% and 10% for accuracy and true negative rate by the use of attention mechanism. These results demonstrate the potential of the proposed model to predict cognitive impairment and attention based mechanisms in the fusion of different neuroimaging modalities to improve the prediction of cognitive decline.

In [Shinar, Alon, and Feinberg. \"Sensitivity and robustness in chemical reaction networks.\" SIAM J App Math (2009): 977-998.], the responses of CRN to changes in the linear conserved quantities, called sensitivities, were studied in and the question of how to construct absolute, i.e., basis-independent, sensitivities was raised. In this article, by applying information geometric methods, such a construction is provided. The idea is to track how concentration changes in a particular chemical propagate to changes of all the other chemicals within a steady state. This is encoded in the matrix of absolute sensitivites. A linear algebraic characterization of the matrix of absolute sensitivities for quasi-thermostatic CRN is derived via a Cramer-Rao bound for CRN, which is based on the the analogy between quasi-thermostatic steady states and the exponential family of probability distributions.

The economy is characterised by heterogeneous agents, acting out of local or imperfect information, monopolistic competition, perfect product differentiation, allowance for increasing returns to scale technology and trade in disequilibrium. An algorithm for economic activity in each period is devised and a general purpose open source agent-based model is developed which allows for counterfactual inquiries, testing out treatments, analysing causality of various economic processes, outcomes and studying emergent properties. 10,000 simulations, with 10 firms and 80 consumers are run with varying parameters and the results show that from only a few initial conditions the economy reaches equilibrium while in most of the other cases it remains in perpetual disequilibrium. It also shows that from a few initial conditions the economy reaches a disaster where all the consumer wealth falls to zero or only a single producer remains. Furthermore, from some initial conditions, an ideal economy with high wage rate, high consumer utility and no unemployment is also reached. It was also observed that starting from an equal endowment of wealth in consumers and in producers, inequality emerged in the economy. In majority of the cases most of the firms(6-7) shut down because they were not profitable enough and only a few firms remained. Our results highlight that all these varying outcomes are possible for a decentralized market economy with rational optimizing agents. ",

Our network enables parallel processing, enhancing computational speed compared to sequential or pulse-coded binary systems.

Here, we demonstrate, how physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) can be used to infer the parameters of predictive, dynamical GRNs that provide mechanistic understanding of biological processes. Specifically we study GRNs that exhibit bifurcation behavior and can therefore model cell differentiation. We show that PINNs outperform regular feed-forward neural networks on the parameter inference task and analyze two relevant experimental scenarios: 1. a system with cell communication for which gene expression trajectories are available and 2. snapshot measurements of a cell population in which cell communication is absent. Our analysis will inform the design of future experiments to be analyzed with PINNs and provides a starting point to explore this powerful class of neural network models further. ",

Self-supervised pretraining, which doesn't rely on labeled data, can enhance robustness against noisy labels. However, this robustness varies based on factors like the number of classes, dataset complexity, and training size. In medical images, subtle inter-class differences and modality-specific characteristics add complexity. Previous research hasn't comprehensively explored the interplay between self-supervised learning and robustness against noisy labels in medical image classification, considering all these factors. In this study, we address three key questions: i) How does label noise impact various medical image classification datasets? ii) Which types of medical image datasets are more challenging to learn and more affected by label noise? iii) How do different self-supervised pretraining methods enhance robustness across various medical image datasets? Our results show that DermNet, among five datasets (Fetal plane, DermNet, COVID-DU-Ex, MURA, NCT-CRC-HE-100K), is the most challenging but exhibits greater robustness against noisy labels. Additionally, contrastive learning stands out among the eight self-supervised methods as the most effective approach to enhance robustness against noisy labels. ",

We propose a mechanistic model of trust that is grounded in the modern neuroscience of decision making. Since trust requires anticipating the future actions of others, any mechanistic model must be built upon up-to-date theories on how the brain learns, represents, and processes information about the future within its decision-making systems. Contemporary neuroscience has revealed that decision making arises from multiple parallel systems that perform distinct, complementary information processing. Each system represents information in different forms, and therefore learns via different mechanisms. When an act of trust is reciprocated or violated, this provides new information that can be used to anticipate future actions. The taxonomy of neural information representations that is the basis for the system boundaries between neural decision-making systems provides a taxonomy for categorizing different forms of trust and generating mechanistic predictions about how these forms of trust are learned and manifested in human behavior. Three key predictions arising from our model are (1) strategic risk-taking can reveal how to best proceed in a relationship, (2) human organizations and environments can be intentionally designed to encourage trust among their members, and (3) violations of trust need not always degrade trust, but can also provide opportunities to build trust.

However, MRRs are highly sensitive to ambient disturbance, with even slight resonance drifts of tens of picometers potentially compromising MRRs-based PNNs. Current solutions often rely on complex control methods, resulting in high hardware complexity impractical for large-scale PNNs. Here, we propose a novel hardware-aware training and pruning approach. The core idea is to train the parameters of a physical neural network towards its noise-robust and energy-efficient region. This innovation enables control-free and energy-efficient photonic computing. Experimentally, this method improves computing precision by 4 bits without requiring intricate MRR control or power-consuming temperature stabilization circuits. It notably increases the accuracy of experimental handwritten digit classification from 67.0%, initially impacted by the thermal variances, to 95.0%, a figure comparable to the theoretical value and achieved without a thermoelectric controller. Additionally, this approach reduces the energy required to tune the MRRs ten-fold. Furthermore, our numerical verification indicates that this method is broadly applicable across various NN sizes and machine-learning tasks. Its effectiveness is particularly marked in larger NNs, where it boosts accuracy from 10.9% to 98.0% and slashes power consumption by 160 times. This advancement represents a significant step towards the practical, energy-efficient, and noise-resilient implementation of large-scale integrated PNNs. ",

In the first phase, the BS transmits ambient signals to the symbiotic backscatter devices (SBDs), and after harvesting the energy and modulating their information onto the signal carrier, the SBDs send Backscatter signals back to the BS. In this scheme, we employ the Backscatter Relay system to facilitate the transmission of information from the SBDs to the symbiotic User Equipments (SUEs) with the assistance of the BS. In the second phase, the BS transmits information signals to the SUEs after eliminating interference using the Successive Interference Cancellation (SIC) method. ASRIS is employed to establish communication among SUEs lacking a line of sight (LoS) and to amplify power signals for SUEs with a LoS connection to the BS. It is worth noting that we use NOMA for multiple access in all network. The main goal of this paper is to maximize the sum throughput between all users. To achieve this, we formulate an optimization problem with variables including active beamforming coefficients at the BS and ASRIS, as well as the phase adjustments of ASRIS and scheduling parameters between the first and second phases. To model this optimization problem, we employ three deep reinforcement learning (DRL) methods, namely PPO, TD3, and A3C. Finally, the mentioned methods are simulated and compared with each other. ",

    "title": "Faster ISNet for Background Bias Mitigation on Deep Neural Networks",
    "abstract": "Image background features can constitute background bias (spurious correlations) and impact deep classifiers decisions, causing shortcut learning (Clever Hans effect) and reducing the generalization skill on real-world data. The concept of optimizing Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) heatmaps, to improve classifier behavior, was recently introduced by a neural network architecture named ISNet. It minimizes background relevance in LRP maps, to mitigate the influence of image background features on deep classifiers decisions, hindering shortcut learning and improving generalization. For each training image, the original ISNet produces one heatmap per possible class in the classification task, hence, its training time scales linearly with the number of classes. Here, we introduce reformulated architectures that allow the training time to become independent from this number, rendering the optimization process much faster. We challenged the enhanced models utilizing the MNIST dataset with synthetic background bias, and COVID-19 detection in chest X-rays, an application that is prone to shortcut learning due to background bias. The trained models minimized background attention and hindered shortcut learning, while retaining high accuracy. Considering external (out-of-distribution) test datasets, they consistently proved more accurate than multiple state-of-the-art deep neural network architectures, including a dedicated image semantic segmenter followed by a classifier. The architectures presented here represent a potentially massive improvement in training speed over the original ISNet, thus introducing LRP optimization into a gamut of applications that could not be feasibly handled by the original model.

    "title": "Expanding Hardware-Efficiently Manipulable Hilbert Space via Hamiltonian  Embedding",
    "abstract": "Many promising quantum applications depend on the efficient quantum simulation of an exponentially large sparse Hamiltonian, a task known as sparse Hamiltonian simulation, which is fundamentally important in quantum computation. Although several theoretically appealing quantum algorithms have been proposed for this task, they typically require a black-box query model of the sparse Hamiltonian, rendering them impractical for near-term implementation on quantum devices. In this paper, we propose a technique named Hamiltonian embedding. This technique simulates a desired sparse Hamiltonian by embedding it into the evolution of a larger and more structured quantum system, allowing for more efficient simulation through hardware-efficient operations. We conduct a systematic study of this new technique and demonstrate significant savings in computational resources for implementing prominent quantum applications. As a result, we can now experimentally realize quantum walks on complicated graphs (e.g., binary trees, glued-tree graphs), quantum spatial search, and the simulation of real-space Schr\\\"odinger equations on current trapped-ion and neutral-atom platforms. Given the fundamental role of Hamiltonian evolution in the design of quantum algorithms, our technique markedly expands the horizon of implementable quantum advantages in the NISQ era. ",
