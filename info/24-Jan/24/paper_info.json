    "abstract": "We propose an approach for curating multimodal data that we used for our entry in the 2023 DataComp competition filtering track. Our technique combines object detection and weak supervision-based ensembling. In the first of two steps in our approach, we employ an out-of-the-box zero-shot object detection model to extract granular information and produce a variety of filter designs. In the second step, we employ weak supervision to ensemble filtering rules. This approach results in a 4% performance improvement when compared to the best-performing baseline, producing the top-ranking position in the small scale track at the time of writing. Furthermore, in the medium scale track, we achieve a noteworthy 4.2% improvement over the baseline by simply ensembling existing baselines with weak supervision. ",

    "title": "Disentangled Condensation for Large-scale Graphs",
    "abstract": "Graph condensation has emerged as an intriguing technique to provide Graph Neural Networks for large-scale graphs with a more compact yet informative small graph to save the expensive costs of large-scale graph learning. Despite the promising results achieved, previous graph condensation methods often employ an entangled condensation strategy that involves condensing nodes and edges simultaneously, leading to substantial GPU memory demands. This entangled strategy has considerably impeded the scalability of graph condensation, impairing its capability to condense extremely large-scale graphs and produce condensed graphs with high fidelity. Therefore, this paper presents Disentangled Condensation for large-scale graphs, abbreviated as DisCo, to provide scalable graph condensation for graphs of varying sizes. At the heart of DisCo are two complementary components, namely node and edge condensation modules, that realize the condensation of nodes and edges in a disentangled manner. In the node condensation module, we focus on synthesizing condensed nodes that exhibit a similar node feature distribution to original nodes using a pre-trained node classification model while incorporating class centroid alignment and anchor attachment regularizers. After node condensation, in the edge condensation module, we preserve the topology structure by transferring the link prediction model of the original graph to the condensed nodes, generating the corresponding condensed edges. Based on the disentangled strategy, the proposed DisCo can successfully scale up to the ogbn-papers100M graph with over 100 million nodes and 1 billion edges with flexible reduction rates. Extensive experiments on five common datasets further demonstrate that the proposed DisCo yields results superior to state-of-the-art counterparts by a significant margin.

    "abstract": "Self-supervised learning (SSL) has recently received significant attention due to its ability to train high-performance encoders purely on unlabeled data-often scraped from the internet. This data can still be sensitive and empirical evidence suggests that SSL encoders memorize private information of their training data and can disclose them at inference time. Since existing theoretical definitions of memorization from supervised learning rely on labels, they do not transfer to SSL. To address this gap, we propose SSLMem, a framework for defining memorization within SSL. Our definition compares the difference in alignment of representations for data points and their augmented views returned by both encoders that were trained on these data points and encoders that were not. Through comprehensive empirical analysis on diverse encoder architectures and datasets we highlight that even though SSL relies on large datasets and strong augmentations-both known in supervised learning as regularization techniques that reduce overfitting-still significant fractions of training data points experience high memorization. Through our empirical results, we show that this memorization is essential for encoders to achieve higher generalization performance on different downstream tasks. ",

    "abstract": "Reinforcement learning is an emerging approaches to facilitate multi-stage sequential decision-making problems. This paper studies a real-time multi-stage stochastic power dispatch considering multivariate uncertainties. Current researches suffer from low generalization and practicality, that is, the learned dispatch policy can only handle a specific dispatch scenario, its performance degrades significantly if actual samples and training samples are inconsistent. To fill these gaps, a novel contextual meta graph reinforcement learning (Meta-GRL) for a highly generalized multi-stage optimal dispatch policy is proposed. Specifically, a more general contextual Markov decision process (MDP) and scalable graph representation are introduced to achieve a more generalized multi-stage stochastic power dispatch modeling. An upper meta-learner is proposed to encode context for different dispatch scenarios and learn how to achieve dispatch task identification while the lower policy learner learns context-specified dispatch policy. After sufficient offline learning, this approach can rapidly adapt to unseen and undefined scenarios with only a few updations of the hypothesis judgments generated by the meta-learner. Numerical comparisons with state-of-the-art policies and traditional reinforcement learning verify the optimality, efficiency, adaptability, and scalability of the proposed Meta-GRL. ",

    "abstract": "Recent empirical and theoretical studies have established the generalization capabilities of large machine learning models that are trained to (approximately or exactly) fit noisy data. In this work, we prove a surprising result that even if the ground truth itself is robust to adversarial examples, and the benignly overfitted model is benign in terms of the ``standard'' out-of-sample risk objective, this benign overfitting process can be harmful when out-of-sample data are subject to adversarial manipulation. More specifically, our main results contain two parts: (i) the min-norm estimator in overparameterized linear model always leads to adversarial vulnerability in the ``benign overfitting'' setting; (ii) we verify an asymptotic trade-off result between the standard risk and the ``adversarial'' risk of every ridge regression estimator, implying that under suitable conditions these two items cannot both be small at the same time by any single choice of the ridge regularization parameter. Furthermore, under the lazy training regime, we demonstrate parallel results on two-layer neural tangent kernel (NTK) model, which align with empirical observations in deep neural networks. Our finding provides theoretical insights into the puzzling phenomenon observed in practice, where the true target function (e.g., human) is robust against adverasrial attack, while beginly overfitted neural networks lead to models that are not robust.

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are shown to benefit from chain-of-thought (COT) prompting, particularly when tackling tasks that require systematic reasoning processes. On the other hand, COT prompting also poses new vulnerabilities in the form of backdoor attacks, wherein the model will output unintended malicious content under specific backdoor-triggered conditions during inference. Traditional methods for launching backdoor attacks involve either contaminating the training dataset with backdoored instances or directly manipulating the model parameters during deployment. However, these approaches are not practical for commercial LLMs that typically operate via API access. In this paper, we propose BadChain, the first backdoor attack against LLMs employing COT prompting, which does not require access to the training dataset or model parameters and imposes low computational overhead. BadChain leverages the inherent reasoning capabilities of LLMs by inserting a backdoor reasoning step into the sequence of reasoning steps of the model output, thereby altering the final response when a backdoor trigger exists in the query prompt. Empirically, we show the effectiveness of BadChain for two COT strategies across four LLMs (Llama2, GPT-3.5, PaLM2, and GPT-4) and six complex benchmark tasks encompassing arithmetic, commonsense, and symbolic reasoning. Moreover, we show that LLMs endowed with stronger reasoning capabilities exhibit higher susceptibility to BadChain, exemplified by a high average attack success rate of 97.0% across the six benchmark tasks on GPT-4. Finally, we propose two defenses based on shuffling and demonstrate their overall ineffectiveness against BadChain. Therefore, BadChain remains a severe threat to LLMs, underscoring the urgency for the development of robust and effective future defenses. ",

    "abstract": "The simulation of nanophotonic structures relies on electromagnetic solvers, which play a crucial role in understanding their behavior. However, these solvers often come with a significant computational cost, making their application in design tasks, such as optimization, impractical. To address this challenge, machine learning techniques have been explored for accurate and efficient modeling and design of photonic devices. Deep neural networks, in particular, have gained considerable attention in this field. They can be used to create both forward and inverse models. An inverse modeling approach avoids the need for coupling a forward model with an optimizer and directly performs the prediction of the optimal design parameters values. In this paper, we propose an inverse modeling method for nanophotonic structures, based on a mixture density network model enhanced by transfer learning. Mixture density networks can predict multiple possible solutions at a time including their respective importance as Gaussian distributions. However, multiple challenges exist for mixture density network models. An important challenge is that an upper bound on the number of possible simultaneous solutions needs to be specified in advance. Also, another challenge is that the model parameters must be jointly optimized, which can result computationally expensive. Moreover, optimizing all parameters simultaneously can be numerically unstable and can lead to degenerate predictions. The proposed approach allows overcoming these limitations using transfer learning-based techniques, while preserving a high accuracy in the prediction capability of the design solutions given an optical response as an input. A dimensionality reduction step is also explored. Numerical results validate the proposed method. ",

Meanwhile, XAI applies algorithms that approximate inputs to outputs post-hoc to identify the contributing features. Adversarial perturbations may also degrade the utility of XAI explanations that require further investigation. In this paper, we present an integrated process designed for downstream evaluation tasks, including validating AI model accuracy, evaluating robustness with benchmark perturbations, comparing explanation utility, and assessing overhead. We demonstrate an evaluation scenario involving six computer vision models, which include CNN-based, Transformer-based, and hybrid architectures, three types of perturbations, and five XAI methods, resulting in ninety unique combinations. The process reveals the explanation utility among the XAI methods in terms of the identified key areas responding to the adversarial perturbation.

Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) play a critical role in protecting interconnected networks by detecting malicious actors and activities. Machine Learning (ML)-based behavior analysis within the IDS has considerable potential for detecting dynamic cyber threats, identifying abnormalities, and identifying malicious conduct within the network. However, as the number of data grows, dimension reduction becomes an increasingly difficult task when training ML models. Addressing this, our paper introduces a novel ML-based network intrusion detection model that uses Random Oversampling (RO) to address data imbalance and Stacking Feature Embedding based on clustering results, as well as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimension reduction and is specifically designed for large and imbalanced datasets. This model's performance is carefully evaluated using three cutting-edge benchmark datasets: UNSW-NB15, CIC-IDS-2017, and CIC-IDS-2018. On the UNSW-NB15 dataset, our trials show that the RF and ET models achieve accuracy rates of 99.59% and 99.95%, respectively. Furthermore, using the CIC-IDS2017 dataset, DT, RF, and ET models reach 99.99% accuracy, while DT and RF models obtain 99.94% accuracy on CIC-IDS2018. These performance results continuously outperform the state-of-art, indicating significant progress in the field of network intrusion detection. This achievement demonstrates the efficacy of the suggested methodology, which can be used practically to accurately monitor and identify network traffic intrusions, thereby blocking possible threats.

    "abstract": "Social robot navigation can be helpful in various contexts of daily life but requires safe human-robot interactions and efficient trajectory planning. While modeling pairwise relations has been widely studied in multi-agent interacting systems, the ability to capture larger-scale group-wise activities is limited. In this paper, we propose a systematic relational reasoning approach with explicit inference of the underlying dynamically evolving relational structures, and we demonstrate its effectiveness for multi-agent trajectory prediction and social robot navigation. In addition to the edges between pairs of nodes (i.e., agents), we propose to infer hyperedges that adaptively connect multiple nodes to enable group-wise reasoning in an unsupervised manner. Our approach infers dynamically evolving relation graphs and hypergraphs to capture the evolution of relations, which the trajectory predictor employs to generate future states. Meanwhile, we propose to regularize the sharpness and sparsity of the learned relations and the smoothness of the relation evolution, which proves to enhance training stability and model performance. The proposed approach is validated on synthetic crowd simulations and real-world benchmark datasets. Experiments demonstrate that the approach infers reasonable relations and achieves state-of-the-art prediction performance. In addition, we present a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework for social robot navigation, which incorporates relational reasoning and trajectory prediction systematically. In a group-based crowd simulation, our method outperforms the strongest baseline by a significant margin in terms of safety, efficiency, and social compliance in dense, interactive scenarios. ",

A key bottleneck in quantitative analysis is that the values are usually not known exactly, due to insufficient data and/or lack of knowledge. Fuzzy logic is a prominent framework to handle such uncertain values, with applications in numerous domains. While several studies proposed fuzzy approaches to attack tree analysis, none of them provided a firm definition of fuzzy metric values or generic algorithms for computation of fuzzy metrics. In this work, we define a generic formulation for fuzzy metric values that applies to most quantitative metrics. The resulting metric value is a fuzzy number obtained by following Zadeh's extension principle, obtained when we equip the basis attack steps, i.e., the leaves of the attack trees, with fuzzy numbers. In addition, we prove a modular decomposition theorem that yields a bottom-up algorithm to efficiently calculate the top fuzzy metric value. ",

However, we observe that several important emerging classes of workloads, including simulation engines for deep reinforcement learning and dynamic neural networks, are unable to fully utilize the massive parallelism that GPUs offer. These applications tend to have kernels that are small in size, i.e., have few thread blocks that do not saturate compute resources. Executing independent kernels concurrently is a promising approach to improve parallelism and utilization. However, this inter-kernel concurrency is difficult to leverage in such workloads with existing approaches: First, the inter-kernel dependencies and computational graph are input-dependent and vary each time the application is executed. Second, the computational graphs tend to be irregular, requiring fine-grain scheduling and synchronization; thus incurring significant synchronization overheads if kernel execution is parallelized. In this work, we propose ACS, a framework that enables lightweight detection of inter-kernel dependencies and low overhead kernel scheduling at runtime. The key idea behind ACS is to perform inter-kernel dependency checks for a small window of kernels at runtime, similar to out-of order instruction scheduling. This enables concurrent execution of kernels in applications whose computational graphs are input dependent and require fine-grained scheduling. We propose ACS-SW, a software-only open-source implementation of ACS and ACS-HW, a hardware-software cooperative implementation. ACS-HW further reduces synchronization overheads by reducing communication between the CPU and GPU. We evaluate ACS for deep RL simulation and dynamic DNNs on both real hardware and a GPU simulator. We demonstrate speedups of up to 2.19x (1.56x on average) by improving GPU utilization with concurrent kernel execution. ",

    "abstract": "Multi-legged robots offer enhanced stability in complex terrains, yet autonomously learning natural and robust motions in such environments remains challenging. Drawing inspiration from animals' progressive learning patterns, from simple to complex tasks, we introduce a universal two-stage learning framework with two-step reward setting based on self-acquired experience, which efficiently enables legged robots to incrementally learn natural and robust movements. In the first stage, robots learn through gait-related rewards to track velocity on flat terrain, acquiring natural, robust movements and generating effective motion experience data. In the second stage, mirroring animal learning from existing experiences, robots learn to navigate challenging terrains with natural and robust movements using adversarial imitation learning. To demonstrate our method's efficacy, we trained both quadruped robots and a hexapod robot, and the policy were successfully transferred to a physical quadruped robot GO1, which exhibited natural gait patterns and remarkable robustness in various terrains.

    "abstract": "Bayesian Neural Networks (BayNNs) naturally provide uncertainty in their predictions, making them a suitable choice in safety-critical applications. Additionally, their realization using memristor-based in-memory computing (IMC) architectures enables them for resource-constrained edge applications. In addition to predictive uncertainty, however, the ability to be inherently robust to noise in computation is also essential to ensure functional safety. In particular, memristor-based IMCs are susceptible to various sources of non-idealities such as manufacturing and runtime variations, drift, and failure, which can significantly reduce inference accuracy. In this paper, we propose a method to inherently enhance the robustness and inference accuracy of BayNNs deployed in IMC architectures. To achieve this, we introduce a novel normalization layer combined with stochastic affine transformations. Empirical results in various benchmark datasets show a graceful degradation in inference accuracy, with an improvement of up to $58.11\\%$. ",

Leveraging the potential of unlabeled data, AdaEmbed facilitates the transfer of knowledge from a labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain by learning a shared embedding space. By generating accurate and uniform pseudo-labels based on the established embedding space, the model overcomes the limitations of conventional SSDA, thus enhancing performance significantly. Our method's effectiveness is validated through extensive experiments on benchmark datasets such as DomainNet, Office-Home, and VisDA-C, where AdaEmbed consistently outperforms all the baselines, setting a new state of the art for SSDA. With its straightforward implementation and high data efficiency, AdaEmbed stands out as a robust and pragmatic solution for real-world scenarios, where labeled data is scarce.

Existing methods for constructing 3D volumes often rely on depth estimation, device-specific operators, or transformer queries, which hinders the widespread adoption of 3D occupancy models. In contrast, our approach leverages two projection matrices to store the static mapping relationships and matrix multiplications to efficiently generate global Bird's Eye View (BEV) features and local 3D feature volumes. Specifically, we achieve this by performing matrix multiplications between multi-view image feature maps and two sparse projection matrices. We introduce a sparse matrix handling technique for the projection matrices to optimise GPU memory usage. Moreover, a global-local attention fusion module is proposed to integrate the global BEV features with the local 3D feature volumes to obtain the final 3D volume. We also employ a multi-scale supervision mechanism to further enhance performance. Comprehensive experiments on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate the simplicity and effectiveness of our method.

    "abstract": "The brain extracellular space (ECS), an irregular, extremely tortuous nanoscale space located between cells or between cells and blood vessels, is crucial for nerve cell survival. It plays a pivotal role in high-level brain functions such as memory, emotion, and sensation. However, the specific form of molecular transport within the ECS remain elusive. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a novel approach to quantitatively analyze the molecular transport within the ECS by solving an inverse problem derived from the advection-diffusion equation (ADE) using a physics-informed neural network (PINN). PINN provides a streamlined solution to the ADE without the need for intricate mathematical formulations or grid settings. Additionally, the optimization of PINN facilitates the automatic computation of the diffusion coefficient governing long-term molecule transport and the velocity of molecules driven by advection. Consequently, the proposed method allows for the quantitative analysis and identification of the specific pattern of molecular transport within the ECS through the calculation of the Peclet number. Experimental validation on two datasets of magnetic resonance images (MRIs) captured at different time points showcases the effectiveness of the proposed method. Notably, our simulations reveal identical molecular transport patterns between datasets representing rats with tracer injected into the same brain region. These findings highlight the potential of PINN as a promising tool for comprehensively exploring molecular transport within the ECS. ",

We show and prove that WDP has 13 excellent properties, which can be theoretical supports for the better performance of WDP than other DP frameworks. In addition, we derive a general privacy accounting method called Wasserstein accountant, which enables WDP to be applied in stochastic gradient descent (SGD) scenarios containing sub-sampling. Experiments on basic mechanisms, compositions and deep learning show that the privacy budgets obtained by Wasserstein accountant are relatively stable and less influenced by order. Moreover, the overestimation on privacy budgets can be effectively alleviated. The code is available at https://github.com/Hifipsysta/WDP. ",

Specifically, our approach, named NCLR, focuses on 2D-3D neural calibration, a novel pretext task that estimates the rigid transformation aligning camera and LiDAR coordinate systems. First, we propose the learnable transformation alignment to bridge the domain gap between image and point cloud data, converting features into a unified representation space for effective comparison and matching. Second, we identify the overlapping area between the image and point cloud with the fused features. Third, we establish dense 2D-3D correspondences to estimate the rigid transformation. The framework not only learns fine-grained matching from points to pixels but also achieves alignment of the image and point cloud at a holistic level, understanding their relative pose. We demonstrate NCLR's efficacy by applying the pre-trained backbone to downstream tasks, such as LiDAR-based 3D semantic segmentation, object detection, and panoptic segmentation. Comprehensive experiments on various datasets illustrate the superiority of NCLR over existing self-supervised methods. The results confirm that joint learning from different modalities significantly enhances the network's understanding abilities and effectiveness of learned representation.

We delve into adversarial training in the embedding space and propose a Fast Adversarial Training (FAT) method to improve the model robustness in the synonym-unaware scenario from the perspective of single-step perturbation generation and perturbation initialization. Based on the observation that the adversarial perturbations crafted by single-step and multi-step gradient ascent are similar, FAT uses single-step gradient ascent to craft adversarial examples in the embedding space to expedite the training process. Based on the observation that the perturbations generated on the identical training sample in successive epochs are similar, FAT fully utilizes historical information when initializing the perturbation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FAT significantly boosts the robustness of BERT models in the synonym-unaware scenario, and outperforms the defense baselines under various attacks with character-level and word-level modifications.

Existing dynamic SGG methods usually suffer from several issues, including 1) Contextual noise, as some frames might contain occluded and blurred objects. 2) Label bias, primarily due to the high imbalance between a few positive relationship samples and numerous negative ones. Additionally, the distribution of relationships exhibits a long-tailed pattern. To address the above problems, in this paper, we introduce a network named TD$^2$-Net that aims at denoising and debiasing for dynamic SGG. Specifically, we first propose a denoising spatio-temporal transformer module that enhances object representation with robust contextual information. This is achieved by designing a differentiable Top-K object selector that utilizes the gumbel-softmax sampling strategy to select the relevant neighborhood for each object. Second, we introduce an asymmetrical reweighting loss to relieve the issue of label bias. This loss function integrates asymmetry focusing factors and the volume of samples to adjust the weights assigned to individual samples. Systematic experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed TD$^2$-Net over existing state-of-the-art approaches on Action Genome databases. In more detail, TD$^2$-Net outperforms the second-best competitors by 12.7 \\% on mean-Recall@10 for predicate classification. ",

Persona can function as the prior knowledge for maintaining the personality consistency of dialogue systems, which makes it perform well on accuracy.

In contrast, the application of metamorphic testing offers a more profound insight into the model's distinct capabilities without necessitating supplementary annotation labels. This approach furnishes a more comprehensive portrayal of the model's intricacies and exposes intricacies concealed within reference-based validation techniques. Consequently, we introduce a persona-centric metamorphic relation construction for metamorphic testing, aimed at evaluating both the persona consistency and robustness of personalized dialogue models. For that reason, this work evaluates several widely used training paradigms including learning from scratch, pretrain + fine-tune and prompt learning in personalized dialogue retrieval to know if they are more robust or if they have the same flaws as their predecessor. Under three kinds of designed metamorphic relations with consistent outputs, our experimental results reveal that prompt learning shows stronger robustness compared to training from scratch and fine-tune. Although tested retrieval models gain competitively high retrieval accuracy according to the traditional reference-based validation, they are still fragile and demonstrate various unexpected behaviors, thus there is still room for future improvement in personalized dialogue retrieval.

This paper introduces Causal Bisimulation Modeling (CBM), a method that learns the causal relationships in the dynamics and reward functions for each task to derive a minimal, task-specific abstraction. CBM leverages and improves implicit modeling to train a high-fidelity causal dynamics model that can be reused for all tasks in the same environment. Empirical validation on manipulation environments and Deepmind Control Suite reveals that CBM's learned implicit dynamics models identify the underlying causal relationships and state abstractions more accurately than explicit ones. Furthermore, the derived state abstractions allow a task learner to achieve near-oracle levels of sample efficiency and outperform baselines on all tasks. ",

We further provide a partial converse that matches our inner bound for a certain class of codes. This implies that the SQS detection strategy is asymptotically optimal for our codes as the false alarm rate constraint vanishes. We also present some canonical examples of the tradeoff region for a binary channel, a scalar Gaussian channel, and a MIMO Gaussian channel. ",

Unlike many other agent-based methods in this space, information sharing between users in our framework is sensitive to topic of discussion, user preferences, and online community dynamics.

In contrast, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can achieve state-of-the-art performance by leveraging their architectural inductive bias. In this paper, we investigate whether this inductive bias can be reinterpreted as an initialization bias within a vision transformer network. Our approach is motivated by the finding that random impulse filters can achieve almost comparable performance to learned filters in CNNs. We introduce a novel initialization strategy for transformer networks that can achieve comparable performance to CNNs on small datasets while preserving its architectural flexibility. ",

    "abstract": "Recent studies have introduced a new class of generative models for synthesizing implicit neural representations (INRs) that capture arbitrary continuous signals in various domains. These models opened the door for domain-agnostic generative models, but they often fail to achieve high-quality generation. We observed that the existing methods generate the weights of neural networks to parameterize INRs and evaluate the network with fixed positional embeddings (PEs). Arguably, this architecture limits the expressive power of generative models and results in low-quality INR generation. To address this limitation, we propose Domain-agnostic Latent Diffusion Model for INRs (DDMI) that generates adaptive positional embeddings instead of neural networks' weights. Specifically, we develop a Discrete-to-continuous space Variational AutoEncoder (D2C-VAE), which seamlessly connects discrete data and the continuous signal functions in the shared latent space. Additionally, we introduce a novel conditioning mechanism for evaluating INRs with the hierarchically decomposed PEs to further enhance expressive power. Extensive experiments across four modalities, e.g., 2D images, 3D shapes, Neural Radiance Fields, and videos, with seven benchmark datasets, demonstrate the versatility of DDMI and its superior performance compared to the existing INR generative models.

Existing methodologies aimed to enhance robust fairness by sacrificing the model's performance on easier classes in order to improve its performance on harder ones. However, we observe that under adversarial attacks, the majority of the model's predictions for samples from the worst class are biased towards classes similar to the worst class, rather than towards the easy classes. Through theoretical and empirical analysis, we demonstrate that robust fairness deteriorates as the distance between classes decreases. Motivated by these insights, we introduce the Distance-Aware Fair Adversarial training (DAFA) methodology, which addresses robust fairness by taking into account the similarities between classes. Specifically, our method assigns distinct loss weights and adversarial margins to each class and adjusts them to encourage a trade-off in robustness among similar classes. Experimental results across various datasets demonstrate that our method not only maintains average robust accuracy but also significantly improves the worst robust accuracy, indicating a marked improvement in robust fairness compared to existing methods.

However, these strategies face challenges in addressing the \"unknown dilemma\" concerning whether the exact output region or the introduced approximation error violates the property in question. To address this, this paper introduces the UR4NNV verification framework, which utilizes under-approximation reachability analysis for DNN verification for the first time. UR4NNV focuses on DNNs with Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activations and employs a binary tree branch-based under-approximation algorithm. In each epoch, UR4NNV under-approximates a sub-polytope of the reachable set and verifies this polytope against the given property. Through a trial-and-error approach, UR4NNV effectively falsifies DNN properties while providing confidence levels when reaching verification epoch bounds and failing falsifying properties. Experimental comparisons with existing verification methods demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of UR4NNV, significantly reducing the impact of the \"unknown dilemma\". ",

GCL is usually believed to learn the invariant representation. However, does this understanding always hold in practice? In this paper, we first study GCL from the perspective of causality. By analyzing GCL with the structural causal model (SCM), we discover that traditional GCL may not well learn the invariant representations due to the non-causal information contained in the graph. How can we fix it and encourage the current GCL to learn better invariant representations? The SCM offers two requirements and motives us to propose a novel GCL method. Particularly, we introduce the spectral graph augmentation to simulate the intervention upon non-causal factors. Then we design the invariance objective and independence objective to better capture the causal factors. Specifically, (i) the invariance objective encourages the encoder to capture the invariant information contained in causal variables, and (ii) the independence objective aims to reduce the influence of confounders on the causal variables. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on node classification tasks. ",

    "abstract": "Talking face synthesis driven by audio is one of the current research hotspots in the fields of multidimensional signal processing and multimedia. Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) has recently been brought to this research field in order to enhance the realism and 3D effect of the generated faces. However, most existing NeRF-based methods either burden NeRF with complex learning tasks while lacking methods for supervised multimodal feature fusion, or cannot precisely map audio to the facial region related to speech movements. These reasons ultimately result in existing methods generating inaccurate lip shapes. This paper moves a portion of NeRF learning tasks ahead and proposes a talking face synthesis method via NeRF with attention-based disentanglement (NeRF-AD). In particular, an Attention-based Disentanglement module is introduced to disentangle the face into Audio-face and Identity-face using speech-related facial action unit (AU) information. To precisely regulate how audio affects the talking face, we only fuse the Audio-face with audio feature. In addition, AU information is also utilized to supervise the fusion of these two modalities. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that our NeRF-AD outperforms state-of-the-art methods in generating realistic talking face videos, including image quality and lip synchronization.

To this end, we propose PolyCF, a flexible graph signal filter that leverages polynomial graph filters to process interaction signals. PolyCF exhibits the capability to capture spectral features across multiple eigenspaces through a series of Generalized Gram filters and is able to approximate the optimal polynomial response function for recovering missing interactions. A graph optimization objective and a pair-wise ranking objective are jointly used to optimize the parameters of the convolution kernel. Experiments on three widely adopted datasets demonstrate the superiority of PolyCF over current state-of-the-art CF methods.

In the present work, we explore a link between this phenomenon and the increase of complexity and sensitivity of the function represented by neural networks. In particular, we study the Boolean mean dimension (BMD), a metric developed in the context of Boolean function analysis. Focusing on a simple teacher-student setting for the random feature model, we derive a theoretical analysis based on the replica method that yields an interpretable expression for the BMD, in the high dimensional regime where the number of data points, the number of features, and the input size grow to infinity. We find that, as the degree of overparameterization of the network is increased, the BMD reaches an evident peak at the interpolation threshold, in correspondence with the generalization error peak, and then slowly approaches a low asymptotic value. The same phenomenology is then traced in numerical experiments with different model classes and training setups. Moreover, we find empirically that adversarially initialized models tend to show higher BMD values, and that models that are more robust to adversarial attacks exhibit a lower BMD. ",

We address this issue by efficiently approximating the posteriors using the belief propagation (BP) algorithm on a suitable factor graph. By interweaving the iterations of BP and EM, the detection complexity can be further reduced to a single BP iteration per EM step. In addition, we propose a data-driven version of our algorithm that introduces momentum in the BP updates and learns a suitable EM parameter update schedule, thereby significantly improving the performance-complexity tradeoff with a few offline training samples. Our numerical experiments demonstrate the excellent performance of the proposed blind detector and show that it even outperforms coherent BP detection in high signal-to-noise scenarios. ",

This so-called BCJRNet algorithm utilizes neural networks to calculate channel likelihoods. BCJRNet has demonstrated resilience against inaccurate channel tap estimations when applied to a time-invariant channel with ideal exponential decay profiles. However, its generalization capabilities for practically-relevant time-varying channels, where the receiver can only access incorrect channel parameters, remain largely unexplored. The primary contribution of this paper is to expand upon the results from existing literature to encompass a variety of imperfect channel knowledge cases that appear in real-world transmissions. Our findings demonstrate that BCJRNet significantly outperforms the conventional BCJR algorithm for stationary transmission scenarios when learning from noisy channel data and with imperfect channel decay profiles. However, this advantage is shown to diminish when the operating channel is also rapidly time-varying. Our results also show the importance of memory assumptions for conventional BCJR and BCJRNet. An underestimation of the memory largely degrades the performance of both BCJR and BCJRNet, especially in a slow-decaying channel. To mimic a situation closer to a practical scenario, we also combined channel tap uncertainty with imperfect channel memory knowledge. Somewhat surprisingly, our results revealed improved performance when employing the conventional BCJR with an underestimated memory assumption. BCJRNet, on the other hand, showed a consistent performance improvement as the level of accurate memory knowledge increased. ",

    "abstract": "With the increasing deployment of machine learning models in many socially-sensitive tasks, there is a growing demand for reliable and trustworthy predictions. One way to accomplish these requirements is to allow a model to abstain from making a prediction when there is a high risk of making an error. This requires adding a selection mechanism to the model, which selects those examples for which the model will provide a prediction. The selective classification framework aims to design a mechanism that balances the fraction of rejected predictions (i.e., the proportion of examples for which the model does not make a prediction) versus the improvement in predictive performance on the selected predictions. Multiple selective classification frameworks exist, most of which rely on deep neural network architectures. However, the empirical evaluation of the existing approaches is still limited to partial comparisons among methods and settings, providing practitioners with little insight into their relative merits. We fill this gap by benchmarking 18 baselines on a diverse set of 44 datasets that includes both image and tabular data. Moreover, there is a mix of binary and multiclass tasks. We evaluate these approaches using several criteria, including selective error rate, empirical coverage, distribution of rejected instance's classes, and performance on out-of-distribution instances. The results indicate that there is not a single clear winner among the surveyed baselines, and the best method depends on the users' objectives. ",

    "abstract": "Increased availability of open-source software repositories and recent advances in code analysis using large language models (LLMs) has triggered a wave of new work to automate software engineering tasks that were previously very difficult to automate. In this paper, we investigate a recent line of work that hypothesises that comparing the probability of code generated by LLMs with the probability the current code would have had can indicate potential quality problems. We investigate the association between the cross-entropy of code generated by ten different models (based on GPT2 and Llama2) and the following quality aspects: readability, understandability, complexity, modularisation, and overall maintainability assessed by experts and available in an benchmark dataset. Our results show that, controlling for the number of logical lines of codes (LLOC), cross-entropy computed by LLMs is indeed a predictor of maintainability on a class level (the higher the cross-entropy the lower the maintainability). However, this relation is reversed when one does not control for LLOC (e.g., comparing small classes with longer ones). Furthermore, while the complexity of LLMs affects the range of cross-entropy (smaller models tend to have a wider range of cross-entropy), this plays a significant role in predicting maintainability aspects. Our study limits itself on ten different pretrained models (based on GPT2 and Llama2) and on maintainability aspects collected by Schnappinger et al. When controlling for logical lines of code (LLOC), cross-entropy is a predictor of maintainability. However, while related work has shown the potential usefulness of cross-entropy at the level of tokens or short sequences, at the class level this criterion alone may prove insufficient to predict maintainability and further research is needed to make best use of this information in practice.

    "abstract": "Object Detection (OD) has proven to be a significant computer vision method in extracting localized class information and has multiple applications in the industry. Although many of the state-of-the-art (SOTA) OD models perform well on medium and large sized objects, they seem to under perform on small objects. In most of the industrial use cases, it is difficult to collect and annotate data for small objects, as it is time-consuming and prone to human errors. Additionally, those datasets are likely to be unbalanced and often result in an inefficient model convergence. To tackle this challenge, this study presents a novel approach that injects additional data points to improve the performance of the OD models. Using synthetic data generation, the difficulties in data collection and annotations for small object data points can be minimized and to create a dataset with balanced distribution. This paper discusses the effects of a simple proportional class-balancing technique, to enable better anchor matching of the OD models. A comparison was carried out on the performances of the SOTA OD models: YOLOv5, YOLOv7 and SSD, for combinations of real and synthetic datasets within an industrial use case. ",

    "abstract": "Cross-domain recommendation (CDR) has been proven as a promising way to tackle the user cold-start problem, which aims to make recommendations for users in the target domain by transferring the user preference derived from the source domain. Traditional CDR studies follow the embedding and mapping (EMCDR) paradigm, which transfers user representations from the source to target domain by learning a user-shared mapping function, neglecting the user-specific preference. Recent CDR studies attempt to learn user-specific mapping functions in meta-learning paradigm, which regards each user's CDR as an individual task, but neglects the preference correlations among users, limiting the beneficial information for user representations. Moreover, both of the paradigms neglect the explicit user-item interactions from both domains during the mapping process. To address the above issues, this paper proposes a novel CDR framework with neural process (NP), termed as CDRNP. Particularly, it develops the meta-learning paradigm to leverage user-specific preference, and further introduces a stochastic process by NP to capture the preference correlations among the overlapping and cold-start users, thus generating more powerful mapping functions by mapping the user-specific preference and common preference correlations to a predictive probability distribution. In addition, we also introduce a preference remainer to enhance the common preference from the overlapping users, and finally devises an adaptive conditional decoder with preference modulation to make prediction for cold-start users with items in the target domain. Experimental results demonstrate that CDRNP outperforms previous SOTA methods in three real-world CDR scenarios. ",

This problem is particularly pronounced in many practical applications. In this paper, we address a special and important scenario of monitoring suicidal ideation, where time-series data, such as photoplethysmography (PPG), is susceptible to such noise. Current methods predominantly focus on image and text data or address artificially introduced noise, neglecting the complexities of natural noise in time-series analysis. To tackle this, we introduce a novel neural network model tailored for analyzing noisy physiological time-series data, named TNANet, which merges advanced encoding techniques with confidence learning, enhancing prediction accuracy. Another contribution of our work is the collection of a specialized dataset of PPG signals derived from real-world environments for suicidal ideation prediction. Employing this dataset, our TNANet achieves the prediction accuracy of 63.33% in a binary classification task, outperforming state-of-the-art models. Furthermore, comprehensive evaluations were conducted on three other well-known public datasets with artificially introduced noise to rigorously test the TNANet's capabilities. These tests consistently demonstrated TNANet's superior performance by achieving an accuracy improvement of more than 10% compared to baseline methods. ",

Thus, it is unwise to simply enlarge the convolutional kernel size. In this paper, we reveal that small convolutional kernels and convolution operations can achieve the closing effects of large kernel sizes. Then, we propose a shift-wise operator that ensures the CNNs capture long-range dependencies with the help of the sparse mechanism, while remaining hardware-friendly.

    "abstract": "Surface reconstruction has traditionally relied on the Multi-View Stereo (MVS)-based pipeline, which often suffers from noisy and incomplete geometry. This is due to that although MVS has been proven to be an effective way to recover the geometry of the scenes, especially for locally detailed areas with rich textures, it struggles to deal with areas with low texture and large variations of illumination where the photometric consistency is unreliable. Recently, Neural Implicit Surface Reconstruction (NISR) combines surface rendering and volume rendering techniques and bypasses the MVS as an intermediate step, which has emerged as a promising alternative to overcome the limitations of traditional pipelines. While NISR has shown impressive results on simple scenes, it remains challenging to recover delicate geometry from uncontrolled real-world scenes which is caused by its underconstrained optimization. To this end, the framework PSDF is proposed which resorts to external geometric priors from a pretrained MVS network and internal geometric priors inherent in the NISR model to facilitate high-quality neural implicit surface learning. Specifically, the visibility-aware feature consistency loss and depth prior-assisted sampling based on external geometric priors are introduced. These proposals provide powerfully geometric consistency constraints and aid in locating surface intersection points, thereby significantly improving the accuracy and delicate reconstruction of NISR. Meanwhile, the internal prior-guided importance rendering is presented to enhance the fidelity of the reconstructed surface mesh by mitigating the biased rendering issue in NISR. Extensive experiments on the Tanks and Temples dataset show that PSDF achieves state-of-the-art performance on complex uncontrolled scenes. ",

In the literature, most GSL solutions either primarily focus on structure refinement with task-specific supervision (i.e., node classification), or overlook the inherent weakness of GNNs themselves (e.g., over-squashing), resulting in suboptimal performance despite sophisticated designs. In light of these limitations, we propose to study self-supervised graph structure-feature co-refinement for effectively alleviating the issue of over-squashing in typical GNNs. In this paper, we take a fundamentally different perspective of the Ricci curvature in Riemannian geometry, in which we encounter the challenges of modeling, utilizing and computing Ricci curvature. To tackle these challenges, we present a self-supervised Riemannian model, DeepRicci. Specifically, we introduce a latent Riemannian space of heterogeneous curvatures to model various Ricci curvatures, and propose a gyrovector feature mapping to utilize Ricci curvature for typical GNNs. Thereafter, we refine node features by geometric contrastive learning among different geometric views, and simultaneously refine graph structure by backward Ricci flow based on a novel formulation of differentiable Ricci curvature. Finally, extensive experiments on public datasets show the superiority of DeepRicci, and the connection between backward Ricci flow and over-squashing.

By embedding the physical information described by PDEs into feedforward neural networks, PINNs are trained as surrogate models to approximate solutions without the need for label data. Nevertheless, even though PINNs have shown remarkable performance, they can face difficulties, especially when dealing with equations featuring rapidly changing solutions. These difficulties encompass slow convergence, susceptibility to becoming trapped in local minima, and reduced solution accuracy. To address these issues, we propose a binary structured physics-informed neural network (BsPINN) framework, which employs binary structured neural network (BsNN) as the neural network component. By leveraging a binary structure that reduces inter-neuron connections compared to fully connected neural networks, BsPINNs excel in capturing the local features of solutions more effectively and efficiently. These features are particularly crucial for learning the rapidly changing in the nature of solutions. In a series of numerical experiments solving Burgers equation, Euler equation, Helmholtz equation, and high-dimension Poisson equation, BsPINNs exhibit superior convergence speed and heightened accuracy compared to PINNs. From these experiments, we discover that BsPINNs resolve the issues caused by increased hidden layers in PINNs resulting in over-smoothing, and prevent the decline in accuracy due to non-smoothness of PDEs solutions.

In this process, the unsupervised downstream tasks are recognized as one of the evaluation methods to validate the quality of visual features learned with a self-supervised training scheme. However, unsupervised dense semantic segmentation has not been explored as a downstream task, which can utilize and evaluate the quality of semantic information introduced in patch-level feature representations during self-supervised training of a vision transformer. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel data-driven approach for unsupervised semantic segmentation (DatUS^2) as a downstream task. DatUS^2 generates semantically consistent and dense pseudo annotate segmentation masks for the unlabeled image dataset without using any visual-prior or synchronized data. We compare these pseudo-annotated segmentation masks with ground truth masks for evaluating recent self-supervised training schemes to learn shared semantic properties at the patch level and discriminative semantic properties at the segment level. Finally, we evaluate existing state-of-the-art self-supervised training schemes with our proposed downstream task, i.e., DatUS^2. Also, the best version of DatUS^2 outperforms the existing state-of-the-art method for the unsupervised dense semantic segmentation task with 15.02% MiOU and 21.47% Pixel accuracy on the SUIM dataset. It also achieves a competitive level of accuracy for a large-scale and complex dataset, i.e., the COCO dataset. ",

Existing fair graph learning typically favors pairwise constraints to achieve fairness but fails to cast off dimensional limitations and generalize them into multiple sensitive attributes; besides, most studies focus on in-processing techniques to enforce and calibrate fairness, constructing a model-agnostic debiasing GNN framework at the pre-processing stage to prevent downstream misuses and improve training reliability is still largely under-explored.

The existing network management schemes mainly rely on the sequential buffering principle and general quality of experience (QoE) model, which may deteriorate QoE when users' swipe behaviors exhibit distinct spatiotemporal variation. In this paper, we propose a digital twin (DT)-based network management scheme to enhance QoE. Firstly, user status emulated by the DT is utilized to estimate the transmission capabilities and watching probability distributions of sub-multicast groups (SMGs) for an adaptive segment buffering. The SMGs' buffers are aligned to the unique virtual buffers managed by the DT for a fine-grained buffer update. Then, a multicast QoE model consisting of rebuffering time, video quality, and quality variation is developed, by considering the mutual influence of segment buffering among SMGs. Finally, a joint optimization problem of segment version selection and slot division is formulated to maximize QoE. To efficiently solve the problem, a data-model-driven algorithm is proposed by integrating a convex optimization method and a deep reinforcement learning algorithm. Simulation results based on the real-world dataset demonstrate that the proposed DT-based network management scheme outperforms benchmark schemes in terms of QoE improvement. ",

When restricting to concrete classes of graphs and assuming SETH, planar graphs and minor-free graphs admit truly subquadratic algorithms, while geometric intersection graphs of unit balls, congruent equilateral triangles, and unit segments do not. Unit-disk graphs are one of the major open cases where the complexity of diameter computation remains unknown. More generally, it is conjectured that a truly subquadratic time algorithm exists for pseudo-disk graphs. In this paper, we show a truly subquadratic algorithm of running time $\\tilde{O}(n^{2-1/18})$, for finding the diameter in a unit-disk graph, whose output differs from the optimal solution by at most 2. This is the first algorithm that provides an additive guarantee in distortion, independent of the size or the diameter of the graph. Our algorithm requires two important technical elements. First, we show that for the intersection graph of pseudo-disks, the graph VC-dimension, either of $k$-hop balls or the distance encoding vectors, is 4. This contracts to the VC dimension of the pseudo-disks themselves as geometric ranges (which is known to be 3). Second, we introduce a clique-based $r$-clustering for geometric intersection graphs, which is an analog of the $r$-division construction for planar graphs. We also showcase the new techniques by establishing new results for distance oracles for unit-disk graphs with subquadratic storage and $O(1)$ query time. The results naturally extend to unit $L_1$ or $L_\\infty$-disks and fat pseudo-disks of similar size. Last, if the pseudo-disks additionally have bounded ply, we have a truly subquadratic algorithm to find the exact diameter. ",

    "abstract": "Due to the ability of modeling relationships between two different types of entities, bipartite graphs are naturally employed in many real-world applications. Community Search in bipartite graphs is a fundamental problem and has gained much attention. However, existing studies focus on measuring the structural cohesiveness between two sets of vertices, while either completely ignoring the edge attributes or only considering one-dimensional importance in forming communities. In this paper, we introduce a novel community model, named edge-attributed skyline community (ESC), which not only preserves the structural cohesiveness but unravels the inherent dominance brought about by multi-dimensional attributes on the edges of bipartite graphs. To search the ESCs, we develop an elegant peeling algorithm by iteratively deleting edges with the minimum attribute in each dimension. In addition, we also devise a more efficient expanding algorithm to further reduce the search space and speed up the filtering of unpromising vertices, where a upper bound is proposed and proven. Extensive experiments on real-world large-scale datasets demonstrate the efficiency, effectiveness, and scalability of the proposed ESC search algorithms. A case study was conducted to compare with existing community models, substantiating that our approach facilitates the precision and diversity of results. ",

The distributed APs are used to jointly serve the communication needs of user equipments (UEs) while sensing a target, assumed to be an eavesdropper (Eve). To increase the system's robustness towards said Eve, we develop an ISAC waveform model that includes artificial noise (AN) aimed at degrading the Eve channel quality. The central processing unit receives the observations from each AP and calculates the optimal precoding and AN covariance matrices by solving a semi-definite relaxation of a constrained Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) minimization problem. Simulation results highlight an underlying trade-off between sensing and communication performances: in particular, the UEs signal-to-noise and interference ratio and the maximum Eve's signal to noise ratio are directly proportional to the CRB. Furthermore, the optimal AN covariance matrix is rank-1 and has a peak in the eve's direction, leading to a surprising inverse-proportionality between the UEs-Eve distance and optimal-CRB magnitude.

    "abstract": "Truck parking on freight corridors faces various challenges, such as insufficient parking spaces and compliance with Hour-of-Service (HOS) regulations. These constraints often result in unauthorized parking practices, causing safety concerns. To enhance the safety of freight operations, providing accurate parking usage prediction proves to be a cost-effective solution. Despite the existing research demonstrating satisfactory accuracy for predicting individual truck parking site usage, few approaches have been proposed for predicting usage with spatial dependencies of multiple truck parking sites. We present the Regional Temporal Graph Neural Network (RegT-GCN) as a predictive framework for assessing parking usage across the entire state to provide better truck parking information and mitigate unauthorized parking. The framework leverages the topological structures of truck parking site distributions and historical parking data to predict occupancy rates across a state. To achieve this, we introduce a Regional Decomposition approach, which effectively captures the geographical characteristics. We also introduce the spatial module working efficiently with the temporal module. Evaluation results demonstrate that the proposed model surpasses other baseline models, improving the performance by more than $20\\%$ compared with the original model. The proposed model allows truck parking sites' percipience of the topological structures and provides higher performance. ",

    "abstract": "Cross-corpus speech emotion recognition (SER) aims to transfer emotional knowledge from a labeled source corpus to an unlabeled corpus. However, prior methods require access to source data during adaptation, which is unattainable in real-life scenarios due to data privacy protection concerns. This paper tackles a more practical task, namely source-free cross-corpus SER, where a pre-trained source model is adapted to the target domain without access to source data. To address the problem, we propose a novel method called emotion-aware contrastive adaptation network (ECAN). The core idea is to capture local neighborhood information between samples while considering the global class-level adaptation. Specifically, we propose a nearest neighbor contrastive learning to promote local emotion consistency among features of highly similar samples. Furthermore, relying solely on nearest neighborhoods may lead to ambiguous boundaries between clusters. Thus, we incorporate supervised contrastive learning to encourage greater separation between clusters representing different emotions, thereby facilitating improved class-level adaptation. Extensive experiments indicate that our proposed ECAN significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods under the source-free cross-corpus SER setting on several speech emotion corpora. ",

Higher peer acknowledgements correlate with increased initiation of annotations and responses to peer annotations. By applying text mining techniques and calculating Shapley values to analyze 1,969 social annotation entries, we identified prominent psychological themes within three dimensions (i.e., affect, cognition, and motivation) that foster peer acknowledgment in digital social annotation. These themes include positive affect, openness to learning and discussion, and expression of motivation. The findings assist educators in improving online learning communities and provide guidance to technology developers in designing effective prompts, drawing from both implicit psychological cues and explicit learning behaviours.

To fortify our inquiry, we expand an existing dataset with emoji annotations, guided by existing research on GitHub emoji usage, and re-evaluate the CR comments accordingly. Our models, which incorporate textual and emoji-based sentiment features and semantic understandings of emojis, substantially outperform baseline metrics.

    "abstract": "To render each generated token in real time, the LLM server generates response tokens one by one and streams each generated token (or group of a few tokens) through the network to the user right after it is generated, which we refer to as LLM token streaming. However, under unstable network conditions, the LLM token streaming experience could suffer greatly from stalls since one packet loss could block the rendering of tokens contained in subsequent packets even if they arrive on time. With a real-world measurement study, we show that current applications including ChatGPT, Claude, and Bard all suffer from increased stall under unstable network. For this emerging token streaming problem in LLM Chatbots, we propose a novel transport layer scheme, called Chatterbox, which puts new generated tokens as well as currently unacknowledged tokens in the next outgoing packet. This ensures that each packet contains some new tokens and can be independently rendered when received, thus avoiding aforementioned stalls caused by missing packets. Through simulation under various network conditions, we show Chatterbox reduces stall ratio (proportion of token rendering wait time) by 71.0% compared to the token streaming method commonly used by real chatbot applications and by 31.6% compared to a custom packet duplication scheme. By tailoring Chatterbox to fit the token-by-token generation of LLM, we enable the Chatbots to respond like an eloquent speaker for users to better enjoy pervasive AI. ",

Further, we focus on a special class of age-agnostic policies, called cyclic schedulers, where each source is scheduled based on a fixed cyclic pattern. We use weighted average age of information (AoI) to quantify the timeliness of communication. We develop a Markov chain formulation to compute the exact mean AoI for the case of two-source cyclic schedulers. Based on the obtained age expression, we develop an algorithm that generates near-optimal cyclic schedulers to minimize the weighted average AoI for two heterogeneous sources, in the presence of channel errors.

While state of the art methods for human goal prediction utilize learned models to account for the uncertainty of human motion data, that data is inherently stochastic and high variance, hindering those models' utility for interactions requiring coordination, including safety-critical or close-proximity tasks. Our key insight is that robot teammates can deliberately configure shared workspaces prior to interaction in order to reduce the variance in human motion, realizing classifier-agnostic improvements in goal prediction. In this work, we present an algorithmic approach for a robot to arrange physical objects and project \"virtual obstacles\" using augmented reality in shared human-robot workspaces, optimizing for human legibility over a given set of tasks. We compare our approach against other workspace arrangement strategies using two human-subjects studies, one in a virtual 2D navigation domain and the other in a live tabletop manipulation domain involving a robotic manipulator arm. We evaluate the accuracy of human motion prediction models learned from each condition, demonstrating that our workspace optimization technique with virtual obstacles leads to higher robot prediction accuracy using less training data.

To support this asymmetric SID where each of the two models can be updated independently, we propose using a lightweight neural network to map the embeddings from the two independent models to a shared speaker embedding space. Our results show that this approach significantly outperforms cosine scoring in a shared speaker logit space for models that were trained with a contrastive loss on large datasets with many speaker identities. This proposed Neural Embedding Speaker Space Alignment (NESSA) combined with an asymmetric update of only one of the models delivers at least 60% of the performance gain achieved by updating both models in the standard symmetric SID approach.

However, these devices often face power consumption and computing resource limitations, making it challenging to apply many deep learning-based image compression algorithms in this field. Implicit Neural Representation (INR) for image compression is an emerging technology that offers two key benefits compared to cutting-edge autoencoder models: low computational complexity and parameter-free decoding. It also outperforms many traditional and early neural compression methods in terms of quality. In this study, we introduce a new Mixed Autoregressive Model (MARM) to significantly reduce the decoding time for the current INR codec, along with a new synthesis network to enhance reconstruction quality. MARM includes our proposed Autoregressive Upsampler (ARU) blocks, which are highly computationally efficient, and ARM from previous work to balance decoding time and reconstruction quality. We also propose enhancing ARU's performance using a checkerboard two-stage decoding strategy. Moreover, the ratio of different modules can be adjusted to maintain a balance between quality and speed. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly improves computational efficiency while preserving image quality. With different parameter settings, our method can outperform popular AE-based codecs in constrained environments in terms of both quality and decoding time, or achieve state-of-the-art reconstruction quality compared to other INR codecs.

The method addresses one of the most challenging problems of highly skewed class distributions in gene expression datasets that adversely affect the performance of classification algorithms. First, the training dataset is balanced by synthetically generating data points from minority class observations. Second, a minimum subset of genes is selected using a greedy search approach. Third, a novel weighted robust score, where the weights are computed by support vectors, is introduced to obtain a refined set of genes. The highest-scoring genes based on this approach are combined with the minimum subset of genes selected by the greedy search approach to form the final set of genes. The novel method ensures the selection of the most discriminative genes, even in the presence of skewed class distribution, thus improving the performance of the classifiers. The performance of the proposed ROWSU method is evaluated on $6$ gene expression datasets. Classification accuracy and sensitivity are used as performance metrics to compare the proposed ROWSU algorithm with several other state-of-the-art methods. Boxplots and stability plots are also constructed for a better understanding of the results. The results show that the proposed method outperforms the existing feature selection procedures based on classification performance from k nearest neighbours (kNN) and random forest (RF) classifiers.

The training dataset thus created is used in a process stack of sequential application of data processing methods and ensemble machine learning algorithms. As a result, a cube of calibrated probabilities of belonging of the study space to gas reservoirs was obtained. The high efficiency of this approach is shown on a delayed test sample of three wells (blind wells). The final value of the gas reservoir prediction quality metric f1 score was 0.893846. ",

We prove that a graph is contraction perfect if and only if it is perfect and the contraction of any single edge preserves its perfection. This yields a characterization of contraction perfect graphs in terms of forbidden induced subgraphs, and a polynomial algorithm to recognize them. We also define the utter graph $u(G)$ which is the graph whose stable sets are in bijection with the co-2-plexes of $G$, and prove that $u(G)$ is perfect if and only if $G$ is contraction perfect. ",

    "abstract": "Speaker diarization, the task of segmenting an audio recording based on speaker identity, constitutes an important speech pre-processing step for several downstream applications. The conventional approach to diarization involves multiple steps of embedding extraction and clustering, which are often optimized in an isolated fashion. While end-to-end diarization systems attempt to learn a single model for the task, they are often cumbersome to train and require large supervised datasets. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end supervised hierarchical clustering algorithm based on graph neural networks (GNN), called End-to-end Supervised HierARchical Clustering (E-SHARC). The E-SHARC approach uses front-end mel-filterbank features as input and jointly learns an embedding extractor and the GNN clustering module, performing representation learning, metric learning, and clustering with end-to-end optimization. Further, with additional inputs from an external overlap detector, the E-SHARC approach is capable of predicting the speakers in the overlapping speech regions. The experimental evaluation on several benchmark datasets like AMI, VoxConverse and DISPLACE, illustrates that the proposed E-SHARC framework improves significantly over the state-of-art diarization systems.

    "abstract": "Most existing neural network-based approaches for solving stochastic optimal control problems using the associated backward dynamic programming principle rely on the ability to simulate the underlying state variables. However, in some problems, this simulation is infeasible, leading to the discretization of state variable space and the need to train one neural network for each data point. This approach becomes computationally inefficient when dealing with large state variable spaces. In this paper, we consider a class of this type of stochastic optimal control problems and introduce an effective solution employing multitask neural networks. To train our multitask neural network, we introduce a novel scheme that dynamically balances the learning across tasks. Through numerical experiments on real-world derivatives pricing problems, we prove that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches. ",

    "abstract": "This article delves into the analysis of performance and utilization of Support Vector Machines (SVMs) for the critical task of forest fire detection using image datasets. With the increasing threat of forest fires to ecosystems and human settlements, the need for rapid and accurate detection systems is of utmost importance. SVMs, renowned for their strong classification capabilities, exhibit proficiency in recognizing patterns associated with fire within images. By training on labeled data, SVMs acquire the ability to identify distinctive attributes associated with fire, such as flames, smoke, or alterations in the visual characteristics of the forest area. The document thoroughly examines the use of SVMs, covering crucial elements like data preprocessing, feature extraction, and model training. It rigorously evaluates parameters such as accuracy, efficiency, and practical applicability. The knowledge gained from this study aids in the development of efficient forest fire detection systems, enabling prompt responses and improving disaster management. Moreover, the correlation between SVM accuracy and the difficulties presented by high-dimensional datasets is carefully investigated, demonstrated through a revealing case study. The relationship between accuracy scores and the different resolutions used for resizing the training datasets has also been discussed in this article. These comprehensive studies result in a definitive overview of the difficulties faced and the potential sectors requiring further improvement and focus. ",

    "abstract": "The reconstruction of cortical surfaces is a prerequisite for quantitative analyses of the cerebral cortex in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Existing segmentation-based methods separate the surface registration from the surface extraction, which is computationally inefficient and prone to distortions. We introduce Vox2Cortex-Flow (V2C-Flow), a deep mesh-deformation technique that learns a deformation field from a brain template to the cortical surfaces of an MRI scan. To this end, we present a geometric neural network that models the deformation-describing ordinary differential equation in a continuous manner. The network architecture comprises convolutional and graph-convolutional layers, which allows it to work with images and meshes at the same time. V2C-Flow is not only very fast, requiring less than two seconds to infer all four cortical surfaces, but also establishes vertex-wise correspondences to the template during reconstruction. In addition, V2C-Flow is the first approach for cortex reconstruction that models white matter and pial surfaces jointly, therefore avoiding intersections between them. Our comprehensive experiments on internal and external test data demonstrate that V2C-Flow results in cortical surfaces that are state-of-the-art in terms of accuracy. Moreover, we show that the established correspondences are more consistent than in FreeSurfer and that they can directly be utilized for cortex parcellation and group analyses of cortical thickness.
