    "abstract": "Metasurfaces have widespread applications in fifth-generation (5G) microwave communication. Among the metasurface family, free-form metasurfaces excel in achieving intricate spectral responses compared to regular-shape counterparts. However, conventional numerical methods for free-form metasurfaces are time-consuming and demand specialized expertise. Alternatively, recent studies demonstrate that deep learning has great potential to accelerate and refine metasurface designs. Here, we present XGAN, an extended generative adversarial network (GAN) with a surrogate for high-quality free-form metasurface designs. The proposed surrogate provides a physical constraint to XGAN so that XGAN can accurately generate metasurfaces monolithically from input spectral responses. In comparative experiments involving 20000 free-form metasurface designs, XGAN achieves 0.9734 average accuracy and is 500 times faster than the conventional methodology. This method facilitates the metasurface library building for specific spectral responses and can be extended to various inverse design problems, including optical metamaterials, nanophotonic devices, and drug discovery.

    "abstract": "In recent studies, the focus has been on enhancing knowledge graph embedding learning, which encodes entities and relations in knowledge graphs into low-dimensional vector spaces. While current models mainly consider the structural aspects of these graphs, there's a wealth of contextual and literal information in knowledge graphs that can be utilized for more effective embeddings. This paper introduces a novel model that incorporates both contextual and literal information into entity and relation embeddings, utilizing graph convolutional networks. Specifically, for contextual information, we assess its significance through confidence and relatedness metrics. A unique rule-based method is developed to calculate the confidence metric, and the relatedness metric is derived from the literal information's representations. We validated our model's performance with thorough experiments on two established benchmark datasets. ",

Embedding models represent words and contexts as vectors whose spatial configuration is derived from the distribution of words in large text corpora.

In this article, we investigate this uncertainty for the domain of characterizations of expressive piano performance. Using a music research dataset of free text performance characterizations and a follow-up study sorting the annotations into clusters, we derive a ground truth for a domain-specific semantic similarity structure. We test five embedding models and their similarity structure for correspondence with the ground truth. We further assess the effects of contextualizing prompts, hubness reduction, cross-modal similarity, and k-means clustering. The quality of embedding models shows great variability with respect to this task; more general models perform better than domain-adapted ones and the best model configurations reach human-level agreement.

    "abstract": "Retrieval-based augmentations that aim to incorporate knowledge from an external database into language models have achieved great success in various knowledge-intensive (KI) tasks, such as question-answering and text generation. However, integrating retrievals in non-knowledge-intensive (NKI) tasks, such as text classification, is still challenging. Existing works focus on concatenating retrievals to inputs as context to form the prompt-based inputs. Unfortunately, such methods require language models to have the capability to handle long texts. Besides, inferring such concatenated data would also consume a significant amount of computational resources. To solve these challenges, we propose \\textbf{ReFusion} in this paper, a computation-efficient \\textbf{Re}trieval representation \\textbf{Fusion} with neural architecture search. The main idea is to directly fuse the retrieval representations into the language models. Specifically, we first propose an online retrieval module that retrieves representations of similar sentences. Then, we present a retrieval fusion module including two effective ranking schemes, i.e., reranker-based scheme and ordered-mask-based scheme, to fuse the retrieval representations with hidden states. Furthermore, we use Neural Architecture Search (NAS) to seek the optimal fusion structure across different layers. Finally, we conduct comprehensive experiments, and the results demonstrate our ReFusion can achieve superior and robust performance on various NKI tasks. ",

    "abstract": "Ultra-reliable low-latency communication (URLLC) is the cornerstone for a broad range of emerging services in next-generation wireless networks. URLLC fundamentally relies on the network's ability to proactively determine whether sufficient resources are available to support the URLLC traffic, and thus, prevent so-called cell overloads. Nonetheless, achieving accurate quality-of-service (QoS) predictions for URLLC user equipment (UEs) and preventing cell overloads are very challenging tasks. This is due to dependency of the QoS metrics (latency and reliability) on traffic and channel statistics, users' mobility, and interdependent performance across UEs. In this paper, a new QoS-aware UE admission control approach is developed to proactively estimate QoS for URLLC UEs, prior to associating them with a cell, and accordingly, admit only a subset of UEs that do not lead to a cell overload. To this end, an optimization problem is formulated to find an efficient UE admission control policy, cognizant of UEs' QoS requirements and cell-level load dynamics. To solve this problem, a new machine learning based method is proposed that builds on (deep) neural contextual bandits, a suitable framework for dealing with nonlinear bandit problems. In fact, the UE admission controller is treated as a bandit agent that observes a set of network measurements (context) and makes admission control decisions based on context-dependent QoS (reward) predictions. The simulation results show that the proposed scheme can achieve near-optimal performance and yield substantial gains in terms of cell-level service reliability and efficient resource utilization. ",

To address these challenges, we propose TA$\\mathbb{CO}$, a (t)opology-(a)ware graph (co)arsening and (co)ntinual learning framework that stores information from previous tasks as a reduced graph. At each time period, this reduced graph expands by combining with a new graph and aligning shared nodes, and then it undergoes a \"zoom out\" process by reduction to maintain a stable size. We design a graph coarsening algorithm based on node representation proximities to efficiently reduce a graph and preserve topological information. We empirically demonstrate the learning process on the reduced graph can approximate that of the original graph. Our experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework on three real-world datasets using different backbone GNN models. ",

This presents a challenge which puts a genuine signer at risk of being denied access, while a forge signer is granted access.

Existing work have only scratched the surface of signature verification because the misclassification error remains high. In this paper, a consensus-threshold distance-based classifier criterion is proposed for offline writer-dependent signature verification. Using features extracted from SigNet and SigNet-F deep convolutional neural network models, the proposed classifier minimizes FAR. This is demonstrated via experiments on four datasets: GPDS-300, MCYT, CEDAR and Brazilian PUC-PR datasets. On GPDS-300, the consensus threshold classifier improves the state-of-the-art performance by achieving a 1.27% FAR compared to 8.73% and 17.31% recorded in literature.

To address these challenges, we introduce a novel approach called the Finite Expression Method (FEX) and its fast algorithm for this learning problem on complex networks. FEX represents dynamics on complex networks using binary trees composed of finite mathematical operators. The nodes within these trees are trained through a combinatorial optimization process guided by reinforcement learning techniques.

    "abstract": "Neural growth is the process of growing a small neural network to a large network and has been utilized to accelerate the training of deep neural networks. One crucial aspect of neural growth is determining the optimal growth timing. However, few studies investigate this systematically. Our study reveals that neural growth inherently exhibits a regularization effect, whose intensity is influenced by the chosen policy for growth timing. While this regularization effect may mitigate the overfitting risk of the model, it may lead to a notable accuracy drop when the model underfits. Yet, current approaches have not addressed this issue due to their lack of consideration of the regularization effect from neural growth. Motivated by these findings, we propose an under/over fitting risk-aware growth timing policy, which automatically adjusts the growth timing informed by the level of potential under/overfitting risks to address both risks. Comprehensive experiments conducted using CIFAR-10/100 and ImageNet datasets show that the proposed policy achieves accuracy improvements of up to 1.3% in models prone to underfitting while achieving similar accuracies in models suffering from overfitting compared to the existing methods.

    "abstract": "As a powerful tool for modeling graph data, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have received increasing attention in both academia and industry. Nevertheless, it is notoriously difficult to deploy GNNs on industrial scale graphs, due to their huge data size and complex topological structures. In this paper, we propose GLISP, a sampling based GNN learning system for industrial scale graphs. By exploiting the inherent structural properties of graphs, such as power law distribution and data locality, GLISP addresses the scalability and performance issues that arise at different stages of the graph learning process. GLISP consists of three core components: graph partitioner, graph sampling service and graph inference engine. The graph partitioner adopts the proposed vertex-cut graph partitioning algorithm AdaDNE to produce balanced partitioning for power law graphs, which is essential for sampling based GNN systems. The graph sampling service employs a load balancing design that allows the one hop sampling request of high degree vertices to be handled by multiple servers. In conjunction with the memory efficient data structure, the efficiency and scalability are effectively improved. The graph inference engine splits the $K$-layer GNN into $K$ slices and caches the vertex embeddings produced by each slice in the data locality aware hybrid caching system for reuse, thus completely eliminating redundant computation caused by the data dependency of graph. Extensive experiments show that GLISP achieves up to $6.53\\times$ and $70.77\\times$ speedups over existing GNN systems for training and inference tasks, respectively, and can scale to the graph with over 10 billion vertices and 40 billion edges with limited resources.

While existing adversarial perturbations are primarily applied to uncompressed images or compressed images by the traditional image compression method, i.e., JPEG, limited studies have investigated the robustness of models for image classification in the context of DNN-based image compression. With the rapid evolution of advanced image compression, DNN-based learned image compression has emerged as the promising approach for transmitting images in many security-critical applications, such as cloud-based face recognition and autonomous driving, due to its superior performance over traditional compression. Therefore, there is a pressing need to fully investigate the robustness of a classification system post-processed by learned image compression. To bridge this research gap, we explore the adversarial attack on a new pipeline that targets image classification models that utilize learned image compressors as pre-processing modules. Furthermore, to enhance the transferability of perturbations across various quality levels and architectures of learned image compression models, we introduce a saliency score-based sampling method to enable the fast generation of transferable perturbation. Extensive experiments with popular attack methods demonstrate the enhanced transferability of our proposed method when attacking images that have been post-processed with different learned image compression models.

    "title": "Advancing DDoS Attack Detection: A Synergistic Approach Using Deep  Residual Neural Networks and Synthetic Oversampling",
    "abstract": "Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks pose a significant threat to the stability and reliability of online systems. Effective and early detection of such attacks is pivotal for safeguarding the integrity of networks. In this work, we introduce an enhanced approach for DDoS attack detection by leveraging the capabilities of Deep Residual Neural Networks (ResNets) coupled with synthetic oversampling techniques. Because of the inherent class imbalance in many cyber-security datasets, conventional methods often struggle with false negatives, misclassifying subtle DDoS patterns as benign. By applying the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) to the CICIDS dataset, we balance the representation of benign and malicious data points, enabling the model to better discern intricate patterns indicative of an attack. Our deep residual network, tailored for this specific task, further refines the detection process. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate that our approach achieves an accuracy of 99.98%, significantly outperforming traditional methods. This work underscores the potential of combining advanced data augmentation techniques with deep learning models to bolster cyber-security defenses. ",

    "abstract": "Novice programmers need to learn how to write basic code but often face difficulties when coding independently. To assist struggling students, we have recently implemented personalized Parsons problems as a pop-up scaffolding. Students found them to be more engaging and helpful for learning compared to simply receiving the correct answer, such as the response they might get from Large Language Model (LLM) tools like ChatGPT. However, a drawback of using Parsons problems as scaffolding is that students may be able to put the code blocks back in place without fully understanding the rationale of the correct solution. As a result, the learning benefits of such scaffolding are compromised. Our goal is to enhance the advantages of using personalized Parsons problems as scaffolding by improving their comprehension through code explanations. In this poster, we propose designs that incorporate multiple levels of textual explanations in the Parsons problems. This design will be used for future technical evaluation and classroom experiments. These experiments will explore the effectiveness of adding textual explanations to Parsons problems to improve instructional benefits. ",

    "abstract": "Industrial anomaly detection is generally addressed as an unsupervised task that aims at locating defects with only normal training samples. Recently, numerous 2D anomaly detection methods have been proposed and have achieved promising results, however, using only the 2D RGB data as input is not sufficient to identify imperceptible geometric surface anomalies. Hence, in this work, we focus on multi-modal anomaly detection. Specifically, we investigate early multi-modal approaches that attempted to utilize models pre-trained on large-scale visual datasets, i.e., ImageNet, to construct feature databases. And we empirically find that directly using these pre-trained models is not optimal, it can either fail to detect subtle defects or mistake abnormal features as normal ones. This may be attributed to the domain gap between target industrial data and source data.Towards this problem, we propose a Local-to-global Self-supervised Feature Adaptation (LSFA) method to finetune the adaptors and learn task-oriented representation toward anomaly detection.Both intra-modal adaptation and cross-modal alignment are optimized from a local-to-global perspective in LSFA to ensure the representation quality and consistency in the inference stage.Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method not only brings a significant performance boost to feature embedding based approaches, but also outperforms previous State-of-The-Art (SoTA) methods prominently on both MVTec-3D AD and Eyecandies datasets, e.g., LSFA achieves 97.1% I-AUROC on MVTec-3D, surpass previous SoTA by +3.4%.

At present, the primary approach for detecting anomalies in log data is through supervised anomaly detection. Nonetheless, existing supervised methods heavily rely on labeled data, which can be frequently limited in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we propose a semi-supervised log anomaly detection method that combines the DQN algorithm from deep reinforcement learning, which is called DQNLog. DQNLog leverages a small amount of labeled data and a large-scale unlabeled dataset, effectively addressing the challenges of imbalanced data and limited labeling. This approach not only learns known anomalies by interacting with an environment biased towards anomalies but also discovers unknown anomalies by actively exploring the unlabeled dataset. Additionally, DQNLog incorporates a cross-entropy loss term to prevent model overestimation during Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). Our evaluation on three widely-used datasets demonstrates that DQNLog significantly improves recall rate and F1-score while maintaining precision, validating its practicality. ",

In this paper, we fill this gap by providing generalization bounds for stochastic gradient descent-based adversarial training that incorporate data distribution information. We utilize the concepts of on-average stability and high-order approximate Lipschitz conditions to examine how changes in data distribution and adversarial budget can affect robust generalization gaps. Our derived generalization bounds for both convex and non-convex losses are at least as good as the uniform stability-based counterparts which do not include data distribution information.

The learned embeddings are then utilized to seamlessly integrate QoS considerations into the recommendation process. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our QAGCL model over several existing models, highlighting its effectiveness in addressing data sparsity and the cold-start problem in QoS-aware service recommendations.

We leverage a graph neural partial differential equation (PDE) based on Beltrami flow to obtain high-dimensional features and position embeddings for point clouds. We incorporate position embeddings into a Transformer module based on a neural ordinary differential equation (ODE) to efficiently represent patches within points. We employ the multi-level correspondence derived from the high feature similarity scores to facilitate alignment between point clouds. Subsequently, we use registration methods such as SVD-based algorithms to predict the transformation using corresponding point pairs. We evaluate PosDiffNet on several 3D point cloud datasets, verifying that it achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance for point cloud registration in large fields of view with perturbations.

The prevalence of depression among adolescents is steadily increasing, and traditional diagnostic methods, which rely on scales or interviews, prove particularly inadequate for detecting depression in young people. Addressing these challenges, numerous AI-based methods for assisting in the diagnosis of mental health issues have emerged. However, most of these methods center around fundamental issues with scales or use multimodal approaches like facial expression recognition. Diagnosis of depression risk based on everyday habits and behaviors has been limited to small-scale qualitative studies. Our research leverages adolescent census data to predict depression risk, focusing on children's experiences with depression and their daily life situations. We introduced a method for managing severely imbalanced high-dimensional data and an adaptive predictive approach tailored to data structure characteristics. Furthermore, we proposed a cloud-based architecture for automatic online learning and data updates. This study utilized publicly available NSCH youth census data from 2020 to 2022, encompassing nearly 150,000 data entries. We conducted basic data analyses and predictive experiments, demonstrating significant performance improvements over standard machine learning and deep learning algorithms. This affirmed our data processing method's broad applicability in handling imbalanced medical data. Diverging from typical predictive method research, our study presents a comprehensive architectural solution, considering a wider array of user needs. ",

    "abstract": "Text-video retrieval is a challenging task that aims to identify relevant videos given textual queries. Compared to conventional textual retrieval, the main obstacle for text-video retrieval is the semantic gap between the textual nature of queries and the visual richness of video content. Previous works primarily focus on aligning the query and the video by finely aggregating word-frame matching signals. Inspired by the human cognitive process of modularly judging the relevance between text and video, the judgment needs high-order matching signal due to the consecutive and complex nature of video contents. In this paper, we propose chunk-level text-video matching, where the query chunks are extracted to describe a specific retrieval unit, and the video chunks are segmented into distinct clips from videos. We formulate the chunk-level matching as n-ary correlations modeling between words of the query and frames of the video and introduce a multi-modal hypergraph for n-ary correlation modeling. By representing textual units and video frames as nodes and using hyperedges to depict their relationships, a multi-modal hypergraph is constructed. In this way, the query and the video can be aligned in a high-order semantic space. In addition, to enhance the model's generalization ability, the extracted features are fed into a variational inference component for computation, obtaining the variational representation under the Gaussian distribution. The incorporation of hypergraphs and variational inference allows our model to capture complex, n-ary interactions among textual and visual contents. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the text-video retrieval task. ",

However, recent deep learning algorithms have predominantly focused on detecting cloud regions in satellite imagery, with insufficient attention to the specificity required for accurate cloud recognition.

Given the complexity and diversity of cloud formations, we have thoroughly analyzed the challenges inherent to cloud recognition tasks, examining the intricate characteristics and distribution of the data. To effectively address these challenges, we designed a Distribution-aware Interactive-Attention Network (DIAnet), which preserves pixel-level details through a high-resolution branch and a parallel multi-resolution cross-branch. We also integrated a distribution-aware loss (DAL) to mitigate the imbalance across cloud categories. An Interactive Attention Module (IAM) further enhances the robustness of feature extraction combined with spatial and channel information. Empirical evaluations on the FYH dataset demonstrate that our method outperforms other cloud recognition networks, achieving superior performance in terms of mean Intersection over Union (mIoU).

However, existing works ignore defeasibility in causal reasoning and fail to evaluate existing causal strength metrics in defeasible settings. In this work, we present {\\delta}-CAUSAL, the first benchmark dataset for studying defeasibility in causal reasoning. {\\delta}-CAUSAL includes around 11K events spanning ten domains, featuring defeasible causality pairs, i.e., cause-effect pairs accompanied by supporters and defeaters. We further show current causal strength metrics fail to reflect the change of causal strength with the incorporation of supporters or defeaters in {\\delta}-CAUSAL. To this end, we propose CESAR (Causal Embedding aSsociation with Attention Rating), a metric that measures causal strength based on token-level causal relationships. CESAR achieves a significant 69.7% relative improvement over existing metrics, increasing from 47.2% to 80.1% in capturing the causal strength change brought by supporters and defeaters. We further demonstrate even Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-3.5 still lag 4.5 and 10.7 points behind humans in generating supporters and defeaters, emphasizing the challenge posed by {\\delta}-CAUSAL.

There are only a few theoretical works on data representation learnability, and many of those focus on final data representation, treating the nonlinear neural network as a ``black box\". However, the accurate learning results of neural networks are crucial for describing the data distribution features learned by SSL models. Our paper is the first to analyze the learning results of the nonlinear SSL model accurately. We consider a toy data distribution that contains two features: the label-related feature and the hidden feature. Unlike previous linear setting work that depends on closed-form solutions, we use the gradient descent algorithm to train a 1-layer nonlinear SSL model with a certain initialization region and prove that the model converges to a local minimum. Furthermore, different from the complex iterative analysis, we propose a new analysis process which uses the exact version of Inverse Function Theorem to accurately describe the features learned by the local minimum. With this local minimum, we prove that the nonlinear SSL model can capture the label-related feature and hidden feature at the same time. In contrast, the nonlinear supervised learning (SL) model can only learn the label-related feature. We also present the learning processes and results of the nonlinear SSL and SL model via simulation experiments. ",

Our research addresses the critical gaps in the analysis of MiniApps' privacy practices, especially focusing on WeChat MiniApps in the Android ecosystem. Despite existing privacy regulations and platform guidelines, there is a lack of effective mechanisms to safeguard user privacy fully. We introduce MiniScope, a novel two-phase hybrid analysis approach, specifically designed for the MiniApp environment. This approach overcomes the limitations of existing static analysis techniques by incorporating dynamic UI exploration for complete code coverage and accurate privacy practice identification. Our methodology includes modeling UI transition states, resolving cross-package callback control flows, and automated iterative UI exploration. This allows for a comprehensive understanding of MiniApps' privacy practices, addressing the unique challenges of sub-package loading and event-driven callbacks. Our empirical evaluation of over 120K MiniApps using MiniScope demonstrates its effectiveness in identifying privacy inconsistencies. The results reveal significant issues, with 5.7% of MiniApps over-collecting private data and 33.4% overclaiming data collection.

Efficient parallel algorithms for updating PageRank on dynamic graphs is crucial for various applications, especially as dataset sizes have reached substantial scales. This technical report presents our Dynamic Frontier approach. Given a batch update of edge deletion and insertions, it progressively identifies affected vertices that are likely to change their ranks with minimal overhead. On a server equipped with a 64-core AMD EPYC-7742 processor, our Dynamic Frontier PageRank outperforms Static, Naive-dynamic, and Dynamic Traversal PageRank by 7.8x, 2.9x, and 3.9x respectively - on uniformly random batch updates of size 10^-7 |E| to 10^-3 |E|. In addition, our approach improves performance at an average rate of 1.8x for every doubling of threads. ",

    "abstract": "Recent work on Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) exploits multi-view 3D consistency, achieving impressive results in 3D scene modeling and high-fidelity novel-view synthesis. However, there are limitations. First, existing methods assume enough high-quality images are available for training the NeRF model, ignoring real-world image degradation. Second, previous methods struggle with ambiguity in the training set due to unmodeled inconsistencies among different views. In this work, we present RustNeRF for real-world high-quality NeRF. To improve NeRF's robustness under real-world inputs, we train a 3D-aware preprocessing network that incorporates real-world degradation modeling. We propose a novel implicit multi-view guidance to address information loss during image degradation and restoration. Extensive experiments demonstrate RustNeRF's advantages over existing approaches under real-world degradation. The code will be released. ",

    "abstract": "One of the most important problems in computer vision and remote sensing is object detection, which identifies particular categories of diverse things in pictures. Two crucial data sources for public security are the thermal infrared (TIR) remote sensing multi-scenario photos and videos produced by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Due to the small scale of the target, complex scene information, low resolution relative to the viewable videos, and dearth of publicly available labeled datasets and training models, their object detection procedure is still difficult. A UAV TIR object detection framework for pictures and videos is suggested in this study. The Forward-looking Infrared (FLIR) cameras used to gather ground-based TIR photos and videos are used to create the ``You Only Look Once'' (YOLO) model, which is based on CNN architecture. Results indicated that in the validating task, detecting human object had an average precision at IOU (Intersection over Union) = 0.5, which was 72.5\\%, using YOLOv7 (YOLO version 7) state of the art model \\cite{1}, while the detection speed around 161 frames per second (FPS/second). The usefulness of the YOLO architecture is demonstrated in the application, which evaluates the cross-detection performance of people in UAV TIR videos under a YOLOv7 model in terms of the various UAVs' observation angles. The qualitative and quantitative evaluation of object detection from TIR pictures and videos using deep-learning models is supported favorably by this work. ",

It employs an attention-based mechanism, akin to the deep transformer model, with key architectural modifications for predicting the next time step window in the autoencoder's latent space. The model utilizes a threshold from the validation dataset for anomaly detection and introduces an alternative method based on analyzing the first statistical moment of error, improving accuracy without dependence on a validation dataset.

However, these methods confront the challenge of inherent data scarcity, which is often the case in anomaly detection tasks.

    "abstract": "Hate speech has emerged as a major problem plaguing our social spaces today. While there have been significant efforts to address this problem, existing methods are still significantly limited in effectively detecting hate speech online. A major limitation of existing methods is that hate speech detection is a highly contextual problem, and these methods cannot fully capture the context of hate speech to make accurate predictions. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in several natural language tasks. LLMs have undergone extensive training using vast amounts of natural language data, enabling them to grasp intricate contextual details. Hence, they could be used as knowledge bases for context-aware hate speech detection. However, a fundamental problem with using LLMs to detect hate speech is that there are no studies on effectively prompting LLMs for context-aware hate speech detection. In this study, we conduct a large-scale study of hate speech detection, employing five established hate speech datasets. We discover that LLMs not only match but often surpass the performance of current benchmark machine learning models in identifying hate speech. By proposing four diverse prompting strategies that optimize the use of LLMs in detecting hate speech. Our study reveals that a meticulously crafted reasoning prompt can effectively capture the context of hate speech by fully utilizing the knowledge base in LLMs, significantly outperforming existing techniques. Furthermore, although LLMs can provide a rich knowledge base for the contextual detection of hate speech, suitable prompting strategies play a crucial role in effectively leveraging this knowledge base for efficient detection.

    "abstract": "While graph neural networks (GNNs) are widely used for node and graph representation learning tasks, the reliability of GNN uncertainty estimates under distribution shifts remains relatively under-explored. Indeed, while post-hoc calibration strategies can be used to improve in-distribution calibration, they need not also improve calibration under distribution shift. However, techniques which produce GNNs with better intrinsic uncertainty estimates are particularly valuable, as they can always be combined with post-hoc strategies later. Therefore, in this work, we propose G-$\\Delta$UQ, a novel training framework designed to improve intrinsic GNN uncertainty estimates. Our framework adapts the principle of stochastic data centering to graph data through novel graph anchoring strategies, and is able to support partially stochastic GNNs. While, the prevalent wisdom is that fully stochastic networks are necessary to obtain reliable estimates, we find that the functional diversity induced by our anchoring strategies when sampling hypotheses renders this unnecessary and allows us to support G-$\\Delta$UQ on pretrained models. Indeed, through extensive evaluation under covariate, concept and graph size shifts, we show that G-$\\Delta$UQ leads to better calibrated GNNs for node and graph classification. Further, it also improves performance on the uncertainty-based tasks of out-of-distribution detection and generalization gap estimation. Overall, our work provides insights into uncertainty estimation for GNNs, and demonstrates the utility of G-$\\Delta$UQ in obtaining reliable estimates. ",

    "abstract": "Demands for pneumatic-driven soft robots are constantly rising for various applications. However, they are often designed manually due to the lack of systematic methods. Moreover, design-dependent characteristics of pneumatic actuation pose distinctive challenges. This paper provides a compact MATLAB code, named SoRoTop, and its various extensions for designing pneumatic-driven soft robots using topology optimization. The code uses the method of moving asymptotes as the optimizer and builds upon the approach initially presented in Kumar et al.(Struct Multidiscip Optim 61 (4): 1637-1655, 2020). The pneumatic load is modeled using Darcy's law with a conceptualized drainage term. Consistent nodal loads are determined from the resultant pressure field using the conventional finite element approach. The robust formulation is employed, i.e., the eroded and blueprint design descriptions are used. A min-max optimization problem is formulated using the output displacements of the eroded and blueprint designs. A volume constraint is imposed on the blueprint design, while the eroded design is used to apply a conceptualized strain energy constraint. The latter constraint aids in attaining optimized designs that can endure the applied load without compromising their performance. Sensitivities required for optimization are computed using the adjoint-variable method. The code is explained in detail, and various extensions are also presented. It is structured into pre-optimization, MMA optimization, and post-optimization operations, each of which is comprehensively detailed. The paper also illustrates the impact of load sensitivities on the optimized designs. SoRoTop is provided in Appendix A and is available with extensions in the supplementary material and publicly at \\url{https://github.com/PrabhatIn/SoRoTop}. ",

    "abstract": "In software development, the predominant emphasis on functionality often supersedes security concerns, a trend gaining momentum with AI-driven automation tools like GitHub Copilot. These tools significantly improve developers' efficiency in functional code development. Nevertheless, it remains a notable concern that such tools are also responsible for creating insecure code, predominantly because of pre-training on publicly available repositories with vulnerable code. Moreover, developers are called the \"weakest link in the chain\" since they have very minimal knowledge of code security. Although existing solutions provide a reasonable solution to vulnerable code, they must adequately describe and educate the developers on code security to ensure that the security issues are not repeated. Therefore we introduce a multipurpose code vulnerability analysis system \\texttt{SecRepair}, powered by a large language model, CodeGen2 assisting the developer in identifying and generating fixed code along with a complete description of the vulnerability with a code comment. Our innovative methodology uses a reinforcement learning paradigm to generate code comments augmented by a semantic reward mechanism. Inspired by how humans fix code issues, we propose an instruction-based dataset suitable for vulnerability analysis with LLMs. We further identify zero-day and N-day vulnerabilities in 6 Open Source IoT Operating Systems on GitHub. Our findings underscore that incorporating reinforcement learning coupled with semantic reward augments our model's performance, thereby fortifying its capacity to address code vulnerabilities with improved efficacy.

    "abstract": "CG-Kit is a new code generation toolkit that we propose as a solution for portability and maintainability for scientific computing applications. The development of CG-Kit is rooted in the urgent need created by the shifting landscape of high-performance computing platforms and the algorithmic complexities of a particular large-scale multiphysics application: Flash-X. This combination leads to unique challenges including handling an existing large code base in Fortran and/or C/C++, subdivision of code into a great variety of units supporting a wide range of physics and numerical methods, different parallelization techniques for distributed- and shared-memory systems and accelerator devices, and heterogeneity of computing platforms requiring coexisting variants of parallel algorithms. The challenges demand that developers determine custom abstractions and granularity for code generation. CG-Kit tackles this with standalone tools that can be combined into highly specific and, we argue, highly effective portability and maintainability tool chains. Here we present the design of our new tools: parametrized source trees, control flow graphs, and recipes. The tools are implemented in Python. Although the tools are agnostic to the programming language of the source code, we focus on C/C++ and Fortran. Code generation experiments demonstrate the generation of variants of parallel algorithms: first, multithreaded variants of the basic AXPY operation (scalar-vector addition and vector-vector multiplication) to introduce the application of CG-Kit tool chains; and second, variants of parallel algorithms within a hydrodynamics solver, called Spark, from Flash-X that operates on block-structured adaptive meshes. In summary, code generated by CG-Kit achieves a reduction by over 60% of the original C/C++/Fortran source code. ",

    "abstract": "Modern ConvNets continue to achieve state-of-the-art results over a vast array of vision and image classification tasks, but at the cost of increasing parameters. One strategy for compactifying a network without sacrificing much expressive power is to reshape it into a tensorial neural network (TNN), which is a higher-order tensorization of its layers, followed by a factorization, such as a CP-decomposition, which strips a weight down to its critical basis components. Passes through TNNs can be represented as sequences of multilinear operations (MLOs), where the evaluation path can greatly affect the number of floating point operations (FLOPs) incurred. While functions such as the popular einsum can evaluate simple MLOs such as contractions, existing implementations cannot process multi-way convolutions, resulting in scant assessments of how optimal evaluation paths through tensorized convolutional layers can improve training speed. In this paper, we develop a unifying framework for representing tensorial convolution layers as einsum-like strings and a meta-algorithm conv_einsum which is able to evaluate these strings in a FLOPs-minimizing manner. Comprehensive experiments, using our open-source implementation, over a wide range of models, tensor decompositions, and diverse tasks, demonstrate that conv_einsum significantly increases both computational and memory-efficiency of convolutional TNNs.

Specifically, ECDFormer predicts the peak properties, including number, position, and symbol, then renders the ECD spectra from these peak properties, which significantly outperforms other models in ECD prediction, Our ECDFormer reduces the time of acquiring ECD spectra from 1-100 hours per molecule to 1.5s.

Recently, implicit neural signed distance fields (SDFs) have shown promising advances in this task. However, most existing approaches employ projective distances from range data as SDF supervision, introducing approximation errors and thus degrading the mapping quality. To address this problem, we introduce N3-Mapping, an implicit neural mapping system featuring normal-guided neural non-projective signed distance fields. Specifically, we directly sample points along the surface normal, instead of the ray, to obtain more accurate non-projective distance values from range data. Then these distance values are used as supervision to train the implicit map. For large-scale mapping, we apply a voxel-oriented sliding window mechanism to alleviate the forgetting issue with a bounded memory footprint. Besides, considering the uneven distribution of measured point clouds, a hierarchical sampling strategy is designed to improve training efficiency. Experiments demonstrate that our method effectively mitigates SDF approximation errors and achieves state-of-the-art mapping quality compared to existing approaches. ",

    "abstract": "Network dynamic (e.g., traffic burst in data center networks and channel fading in cellular WiFi networks) has a great impact on the performance of communication networks (e.g., throughput, capacity, delay, and jitter). This article proposes a unified prediction-based method to handle the dynamic of various network systems. From the view of graph deep learning, I generally formulate the dynamic prediction of networks as a temporal link prediction task and analyze the possible challenges of the prediction of weighted networks, where link weights have the wide-value-range and sparsity issues. Inspired by the high-resolution video frame prediction with generative adversarial network (GAN), I try to adopt adversarial learning to generate high-quality predicted snapshots for network dynamic, which is expected to support the precise and fine-grained network control. A novel high-quality temporal link prediction (HQ-TLP) model with GAN is then developed to illustrate the potential of my basic idea. Extensive experiments for various application scenarios further demonstrate the powerful capability of HQ-TLP. ",

    "abstract": "The importance of uncertainty quantification is increasingly recognized in the diverse field of machine learning. Accurately assessing model prediction uncertainty can help provide deeper understanding and confidence for researchers and practitioners. This is especially critical in medical diagnosis and drug discovery areas, where reliable predictions directly impact research quality and patient health. In this paper, we proposed incorporating uncertainty quantification into clinical trial outcome predictions. Our main goal is to enhance the model's ability to discern nuanced differences, thereby significantly improving its overall performance. We have adopted a selective classification approach to fulfill our objective, integrating it seamlessly with the Hierarchical Interaction Network (HINT), which is at the forefront of clinical trial prediction modeling. Selective classification, encompassing a spectrum of methods for uncertainty quantification, empowers the model to withhold decision-making in the face of samples marked by ambiguity or low confidence, thereby amplifying the accuracy of predictions for the instances it chooses to classify. A series of comprehensive experiments demonstrate that incorporating selective classification into clinical trial predictions markedly enhances the model's performance, as evidenced by significant upticks in pivotal metrics such as PR-AUC, F1, ROC-AUC, and overall accuracy. Specifically, the proposed method achieved 32.37\\%, 21.43\\%, and 13.27\\% relative improvement on PR-AUC over the base model (HINT) in phase I, II, and III trial outcome prediction, respectively. When predicting phase III, our method reaches 0.9022 PR-AUC scores. These findings illustrate the robustness and prospective utility of this strategy within the area of clinical trial predictions, potentially setting a new benchmark in the field. ",

Recently, data-driven subsampling techniques have been utilized to overcome the challenges associated with computational complexity and training time for AMC. Beyond these direct advantages of data-driven subsampling, these methods also have regularizing properties that may improve the adversarial robustness of the modulation classifier. In this paper, we investigate the effects of an adversarial attack on an AMC system that employs deep learning models both for AMC and for subsampling. Our analysis shows that subsampling itself is an effective deterrent to adversarial attacks. We also uncover the most efficient subsampling strategy when an adversarial attack on both the classifier and the subsampler is anticipated. ",

PIML models are increasingly built via deep neural networks (NNs) whose architecture and training process are designed such that the network satisfies the PDE system. While such PIML models have substantially advanced over the past few years, their performance is still very sensitive to the NN's architecture and loss function. Motivated by this limitation, we introduce kernel-weighted Corrective Residuals (CoRes) to integrate the strengths of kernel methods and deep NNs for solving nonlinear PDE systems. To achieve this integration, we design a modular and robust framework which consistently outperforms competing methods in solving a broad range of benchmark problems. This performance improvement has a theoretical justification and is particularly attractive since we simplify the training process while negligibly increasing the inference costs. Additionally, our studies on solving multiple PDEs indicate that kernel-weighted CoRes considerably decrease the sensitivity of NNs to factors such as random initialization, architecture type, and choice of optimizer. We believe our findings have the potential to spark a renewed interest in leveraging kernel methods for solving PDEs. ",

Elevated temperature can lead to temporary closure failure and, in severe cases, the rupture of PIR. To accurately predict the temperature of PIR, this study combines finite element simulation techniques with Support Vector Regression (SVR) optimized by an Improved Whale Optimization Algorithm (IWOA) approach. The IWOA includes Tent mapping, a convergence factor based on the sigmoid function, and the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck variation strategy. The IWOA-SVR model is compared with the SSA-SVR and WOA-SVR. The results reveal that the prediction accuracies of the IWOA-SVR model were 90.2% and 81.5% (above 100$^\\circ$C) in the 3$^\\circ$C temperature deviation range and 96.3% and 93.4% (above 100$^\\circ$C) in the 4$^\\circ$C temperature deviation range, surpassing the performance of the comparative models. This research demonstrates the method proposed can realize the online monitoring of the temperature of the PIR, which can effectively prevent thermal faults PIR and provide a basis for the opening and closing of the circuit breaker within a short period.

Existing works alleviate this problem by equipping language models with defense patches. However, these defense strategies often rely on impractical assumptions or entail substantial sacrifices in model performance. Consequently, enhancing the resilience of the target model using such defense mechanisms is a formidable challenge. This paper introduces an innovative model for robust text inference and classification, built upon diffusion models (ROIC-DM). Benefiting from its training involving denoising stages, ROIC-DM inherently exhibits greater robustness compared to conventional language models. Moreover, ROIC-DM can attain comparable, and in some cases, superior performance to language models, by effectively incorporating them as advisory components. Extensive experiments conducted with several strong textual adversarial attacks on three datasets demonstrate that (1) ROIC-DM outperforms traditional language models in robustness, even when the latter are fortified with advanced defense mechanisms; (2) ROIC-DM can achieve comparable and even better performance than traditional language models by using them as advisors.

    "abstract": "Traffic anomaly detection (TAD) in driving videos is critical for ensuring the safety of autonomous driving and advanced driver assistance systems. Previous single-stage TAD methods primarily rely on frame prediction, making them vulnerable to interference from dynamic backgrounds induced by the rapid movement of the dashboard camera. While two-stage TAD methods appear to be a natural solution to mitigate such interference by pre-extracting background-independent features (such as bounding boxes and optical flow) using perceptual algorithms, they are susceptible to the performance of first-stage perceptual algorithms and may result in error propagation. In this paper, we introduce TTHF, a novel single-stage method aligning video clips with text prompts, offering a new perspective on traffic anomaly detection. Unlike previous approaches, the supervised signal of our method is derived from languages rather than orthogonal one-hot vectors, providing a more comprehensive representation. Further, concerning visual representation, we propose to model the high frequency of driving videos in the temporal domain. This modeling captures the dynamic changes of driving scenes, enhances the perception of driving behavior, and significantly improves the detection of traffic anomalies. In addition, to better perceive various types of traffic anomalies, we carefully design an attentive anomaly focusing mechanism that visually and linguistically guides the model to adaptively focus on the visual context of interest, thereby facilitating the detection of traffic anomalies. It is shown that our proposed TTHF achieves promising performance, outperforming state-of-the-art competitors by +5.4% AUC on the DoTA dataset and achieving high generalization on the DADA dataset.

    "abstract": "The rapid advancement of energy-efficient parallel ultra-low-power (ULP) ucontrollers units (MCUs) is enabling the development of autonomous nano-sized unmanned aerial vehicles (nano-UAVs). These sub-10cm drones represent the next generation of unobtrusive robotic helpers and ubiquitous smart sensors. However, nano-UAVs face significant power and payload constraints while requiring advanced computing capabilities akin to standard drones, including real-time Machine Learning (ML) performance and the safe co-existence of general-purpose and real-time OSs. Although some advanced parallel ULP MCUs offer the necessary ML computing capabilities within the prescribed power limits, they rely on small main memories (<1MB) and ucontroller-class CPUs with no virtualization or security features, and hence only support simple bare-metal runtimes. In this work, we present Shaheen, a 9mm2 200mW SoC implemented in 22nm FDX technology. Differently from state-of-the-art MCUs, Shaheen integrates a Linux-capable RV64 core, compliant with the v1.0 ratified Hypervisor extension and equipped with timing channel protection, along with a low-cost and low-power memory controller exposing up to 512MB of off-chip low-cost low-power HyperRAM directly to the CPU. At the same time, it integrates a fully programmable energy- and area-efficient multi-core cluster of RV32 cores optimized for general-purpose DSP as well as reduced- and mixed-precision ML. To the best of the authors' knowledge, it is the first silicon prototype of a ULP SoC coupling the RV64 and RV32 cores in a heterogeneous host+accelerator architecture fully based on the RISC-V ISA. We demonstrate the capabilities of the proposed SoC on a wide range of benchmarks relevant to nano-UAV applications. The cluster can deliver up to 90GOp/s and up to 1.8TOp/s/W on 2-bit integer kernels and up to 7.9GFLOp/s and up to 150GFLOp/s/W on 16-bit FP kernels. ",

In this paper, we study an evolved form of political amplification by first identifying and then characterizing political campaigns with lexical mutations. By lexical mutation, we mean content that is reframed, paraphrased, or altered while preserving the same underlying message. Using multilingual embeddings and network analysis, we detect over 3.8K political campaigns with text mutations spanning multiple languages and social media platforms in India. By further assessing the political leanings of accounts repeatedly involved in such amplification campaigns, we contribute a broader understanding of how political amplification is used across various political parties in India. Moreover, our temporal analysis of the largest amplification campaigns suggests that political campaigning can evolve as temporally ordered arguments and counter-arguments between groups with competing political interests. Overall, our work contributes insights into how lexical mutations can be leveraged to bypass the platform manipulation policies and how such competing campaigning can provide an exaggerated sense of political divide on Indian social media.

The first system is a simple nonlinear pendulum, and the second is 2D heat diffusion across the surface of a metal block. We show that for the pendulum system the PINNs outperformed equivalent uninformed neural networks (NNs) in the ideal data case, with accuracy improvements of 18x and 6x for 10 linearly-spaced and 10 uniformly-distributed random training points respectively. In similar test cases with real data collected from an experiment, PINNs outperformed NNs with 9.3x and 9.1x accuracy improvements for 67 linearly-spaced and uniformly-distributed random points respectively. For the 2D heat diffusion, we show that both PINNs and NNs do not fare very well in reconstructing the heating regime due to difficulties in optimizing the network parameters over a large domain in both time and space. We highlight that data denoising and smoothing, reducing the size of the optimization problem, and using LBFGS as the optimizer are all ways to improve the accuracy of the predicted solution for both PINNs and NNs. Additionally, we address the viability of deploying physics-informed models within physical systems, and we choose FPGAs as the compute substrate for deployment. In light of this, we perform our experiments using a PYNQ-Z1 FPGA and identify issues related to time-coherent sensing and spatial data alignment. We discuss the insights gained from this work and list future work items based on the proposed architecture for the system that our methods work to develop. ",

The local attention mechanism adjusts the weight of each concept, reducing the influence of irrelevant or noisy concepts during classification. We improve the calculation formula for attention scores in the local self-attention mechanism, ensuring that words with different frequencies of occurrence in the text receive higher attention scores.

    "abstract": "Heterogeneous graph few-shot learning (HGFL) has been developed to address the label sparsity issue in heterogeneous graphs (HGs), which consist of various types of nodes and edges. The core concept of HGFL is to extract knowledge from rich-labeled classes in a source HG, transfer this knowledge to a target HG to facilitate learning new classes with few-labeled training data, and finally make predictions on unlabeled testing data. Existing methods typically assume that the source HG, training data, and testing data all share the same distribution. However, in practice, distribution shifts among these three types of data are inevitable due to two reasons: (1) the limited availability of the source HG that matches the target HG distribution, and (2) the unpredictable data generation mechanism of the target HG. Such distribution shifts result in ineffective knowledge transfer and poor learning performance in existing methods, thereby leading to a novel problem of out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization in HGFL. To address this challenging problem, we propose a novel Causal OOD Heterogeneous graph Few-shot learning model, namely COHF. In COHF, we first characterize distribution shifts in HGs with a structural causal model, establishing an invariance principle for OOD generalization in HGFL. Then, following this invariance principle, we propose a new variational autoencoder-based heterogeneous graph neural network to mitigate the impact of distribution shifts. Finally, by integrating this network with a novel meta-learning framework, COHF effectively transfers knowledge to the target HG to predict new classes with few-labeled data. Extensive experiments on seven real-world datasets have demonstrated the superior performance of COHF over the state-of-the-art methods. ",

Although existing methods have improved prediction accuracy, few research efforts have been devoted to enhancing prediction model interpretability and out-of-distribution (OOD) generalizability. This work addresses these two challenging aspects by designing a variational auto-encoder framework that integrates graph-based representations and time-sequence models to efficiently capture spatio-temporal relations between interactive agents and predict their dynamics. Our model infers dynamic interaction graphs in a latent space augmented with interpretable edge features that characterize the interactions. Moreover, we aim to enhance model interpretability and performance in OOD scenarios by disentangling the latent space of edge features, thereby strengthening model versatility and robustness. We validate our approach through extensive experiments on both simulated and real-world datasets. The results show superior performance compared to existing methods in modeling spatio-temporal relations, motion prediction, and identifying time-invariant latent features. ",

We model the contact network in this hypothetical township of N = 10000 people as a scale-free network, and simulate the spread of COVID-19 and vaccination program using disease and vaccination uptake parameters typically observed in such a NSW town. We simulate the spread of the ancestral variant of COVID-19 in this town, and study the disease dynamics while the town maintains limited but non-negligible contact with the rest of the country which is assumed to be undergoing a severe COVID-19 epidemic. We also simulate a maximum three doses of Pfizer Comirnaty vaccine being administered in this town, with limited vaccine supply at first which gradually increases, and analyse how the vaccination uptake affects the disease dynamics in this town, which is captured using an extended compartmental model with epidemic parameters typical for a COVID-19 epidemic in Australia. Our results show that, in such a township, three vaccination doses are sufficient to contain but not eradicate COVID-19, and the disease essentially becomes endemic. We also show that the average degree of infected nodes (the average number of contacts for infected people) predicts the proportion of infected people. Therefore, if the hubs (people with a relatively high number of contacts) are disproportionately infected, this indicates an oncoming peak of the infection, though the lag time thereof depends on the maximum number of vaccines administered to the populace. Overall, our analysis provides interesting insights in understanding the interplay between network topology, vaccination levels, and COVID-19 disease dynamics in a typical remote NSW country town. ",

However, SGD suffers from inevitable drawbacks, including vanishing gradients, lack of theoretical guarantees, and substantial sensitivity to input. The Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) has been proposed to address these shortcomings as an effective alternative to the gradient-based methods. It has been successfully employed for training deep neural networks. However, ADMM-based optimizers have a slow convergence rate. This paper proposes an Anderson Acceleration for Deep Learning ADMM (AA-DLADMM) algorithm to tackle this drawback. The main intention of the AA-DLADMM algorithm is to employ Anderson acceleration to ADMM by considering it as a fixed-point iteration and attaining a nearly quadratic convergence rate. We verify the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed AA-DLADMM algorithm by conducting extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets contrary to other state-of-the-art optimizers. ",

As we know that GDA is an important issue for graph contrastive learning. Various GDAs have been developed recently which mainly involve dropping or perturbing edges, nodes, node attributes and edge attributes. However, to our knowledge, it still lacks a universal and effective augmentor that is suitable for different types of graph data. To address this issue, in this paper, we first introduce the graph message representation of graph data. Based on it, we then propose a novel Graph Message Augmentation (GMA), a universal scheme for reformulating many existing GDAs. The proposed unified GMA not only gives a new perspective to understand many existing GDAs but also provides a universal and more effective graph data augmentation for graph self-supervised learning tasks. Moreover, GMA introduces an easy way to implement the mixup augmentor which is natural for images but usually challengeable for graphs. Based on the proposed GMA, we then propose a unified graph contrastive learning, termed Graph Message Contrastive Learning (GMCL), that employs attribution-guided universal GMA for graph contrastive learning. Experiments on many graph learning tasks demonstrate the effectiveness and benefits of the proposed GMA and GMCL approaches. ",

In the SINNs, the spectral integration method is applied to perform temporal discretization, and then a fully connected neural network is adopted to solve resulting partial differential equations (PDEs) in the spatial domain. Specifically, spatial coordinates are employed as inputs in the network architecture, and the output layer is configured with multiple outputs, each dedicated to approximating solutions at different time instances characterized by Gaussian points used in the spectral method. By leveraging the automatic differentiation technique and spectral integration scheme, the SINNs minimize the loss function, constructed based on the governing PDEs and boundary conditions, to obtain solutions for dynamic problems. Additionally, we utilize polynomial basis functions to expand the unknown function, aiming to enhance the performance of SINNs in addressing inverse problems. The conceived framework is tested on six forward and inverse dynamic problems, involving nonlinear PDEs. Numerical results demonstrate the superior performance of SINNs over the popularly used physics-informed neural networks in terms of convergence speed, computational accuracy and efficiency. It is also noteworthy that the SINNs exhibit the capability to deliver accurate and stable solutions for long-time dynamic problems. ",

    "abstract": "We propose GrainGNN, a surrogate model for polycrystalline grain formation under rapid solidification conditions in metal additive manufacturing. Such grain formation problems are modeled by a multicomponent partial differential equation PDE with moving interfaces. The inherent randomness of the PDE initial conditions (grain seeds) necessitates ensemble simulations to predict microstructure statistics, e.g., grain size, aspect ratio, and crystallographic orientation. Currently such ensemble simulations are prohibitively expensive and surrogates are necessary. In GrainGNN, we use a dynamic graph to represent interface motion and topological changes due to grain coarsening. We use a reduced representation of the microstructure using hand-crafted features; we combine pattern finding and altering graph algorithms with two neural networks, a classifier (for topological changes) and a regressor (for interface motion). Both networks have an encoder-decoder architecture; the encoder has a multi-layer transformer long-short-term-memory architecture; the decoder is a single layer perceptron. We evaluate GrainGNN by comparing it to high-fidelity phase field simulations for in-distribution and out-of-distribution grain configurations for solidification under laser power bed fusion conditions. GrainGNN results in 80\\%--90\\% pointwise accuracy; and nearly identical distributions of scalar quantities of interest (QoI) between phase field and GrainGNN simulations compared using Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. GrainGNN's inference speedup (PyTorch on single x86 node) over a high-fidelity phase-field simulation (CUDA on a single NVIDIA A100 GPU) is 300$\\times$--2000$\\times$ for 100-initial grain problem.

By optimizing local models with knowledge distillation, FD circumvents the necessity of uploading large-scale model parameters to the central server, simultaneously preserving the raw data on local clients. Despite the growing popularity of FD, there is a noticeable gap in previous works concerning the exploration of poisoning attacks within this framework. This can lead to a scant understanding of the vulnerabilities to potential adversarial actions. To this end, we introduce FDLA, a poisoning attack method tailored for FD. FDLA manipulates logit communications in FD, aiming to significantly degrade model performance on clients through misleading the discrimination of private samples. Through extensive simulation experiments across a variety of datasets, attack scenarios, and FD configurations, we demonstrate that LPA effectively compromises client model accuracy, outperforming established baseline algorithms in this regard. Our findings underscore the critical need for robust defense mechanisms in FD settings to mitigate such adversarial threats. ",

Most of the existing methods rely either on explicit meshes, using surface rendering of meshes for reconstruction, or on implicit field functions, using volume rendering of the fields for reconstruction. The two types of representations in fact have their respective merits. In this work, we propose a new hybrid representation, termed Sur2f, aiming to better benefit from both representations in a complementary manner. Technically, we learn two parallel streams of an implicit signed distance field and an explicit surrogate surface Sur2f mesh, and unify volume rendering of the implicit signed distance function (SDF) and surface rendering of the surrogate mesh with a shared, neural shader; the unified shading promotes their convergence to the same, underlying surface. We synchronize learning of the surrogate mesh by driving its deformation with functions induced from the implicit SDF. In addition, the synchronized surrogate mesh enables surface-guided volume sampling, which greatly improves the sampling efficiency per ray in volume rendering. We conduct thorough experiments showing that Sur$^2$f outperforms existing reconstruction methods and surface representations, including hybrid ones, in terms of both recovery quality and recovery efficiency.

Our investigation specifically focuses on recognizing similar crises through the application of ontology-based knowledge mining. Through our experiments, we demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of our approach to recognizing similar crises. These findings highlight the potential of ontology-based knowledge mining for enhancing crisis recognition processes and improving overall crisis management strategies. ",

    "abstract": "The capabilities of monocular depth estimation (MDE) models are limited by the availability of sufficient and diverse datasets. In the case of MDE models for autonomous driving, this issue is exacerbated by the linearity of the captured data trajectories. We propose a NeRF-based data augmentation pipeline to introduce synthetic data with more diverse viewing directions into training datasets and demonstrate the benefits of our approach to model performance and robustness. Our data augmentation pipeline, which we call \"NeRFmentation\", trains NeRFs on each scene in the dataset, filters out subpar NeRFs based on relevant metrics, and uses them to generate synthetic RGB-D images captured from new viewing directions. In this work, we apply our technique in conjunction with three state-of-the-art MDE architectures on the popular autonomous driving dataset KITTI, augmenting its training set of the Eigen split. We evaluate the resulting performance gain on the original test set, a separate popular driving set, and our own synthetic test set. ",

    "abstract": "We propose GNNInfer, the first automatic property inference technique for GNNs. To tackle the challenge of varying input structures in GNNs, GNNInfer first identifies a set of representative influential structures that contribute significantly towards the prediction of a GNN. Using these structures, GNNInfer converts each pair of an influential structure and the GNN to their equivalent FNN and then leverages existing property inference techniques to effectively capture properties of the GNN that are specific to the influential structures. GNNINfer then generalizes the captured properties to any input graphs that contain the influential structures. Finally, GNNInfer improves the correctness of the inferred properties by building a model (either a decision tree or linear regression) that estimates the deviation of GNN output from the inferred properties given full input graphs. The learned model helps GNNInfer extend the inferred properties with constraints to the input and output of the GNN, obtaining stronger properties that hold on full input graphs. Our experiments show that GNNInfer is effective in inferring likely properties of popular real-world GNNs, and more importantly, these inferred properties help effectively defend against GNNs' backdoor attacks. In particular, out of the 13 ground truth properties, GNNInfer re-discovered 8 correct properties and discovered likely correct properties that approximate the remaining 5 ground truth properties. Using properties inferred by GNNInfer to defend against the state-of-the-art backdoor attack technique on GNNs, namely UGBA, experiments show that GNNInfer's defense success rate is up to 30 times better than existing baselines.

However, poor contact between the zinc electrolysis cathode and the anode is a common problem that leads to reduced production efficiency and damage to the electrolysis cell. Therefore, online monitoring of the contact status of the plates is crucial for ensuring production quality and efficiency. To address this issue, we propose an end-to-end network, the Frequency-masked Multimodal Autoencoder (FM-AE). This method takes the cell voltage signal and infrared image information as input, and through automatic encoding, fuses the two features together and predicts the poor contact status of the plates through a cascaded detector. Experimental results show that the proposed method maintains high accuracy (86.2%) while having good robustness and generalization ability, effectively detecting poor contact status of the zinc electrolysis cell, providing strong support for production practice.

In this vein, we propose ORANUS, an O-RAN-compliant mathematical framework to allocate radio resources to multiple ultra Reliable Low Latency Communication (uRLLC) services. In the near-RT control loop, ORANUS relies on a novel Stochastic Network Calculus (SNC)-based model to compute the amount of guaranteed radio resources for each uRLLC service. Unlike traditional approaches as queueing theory, the SNC-based model allows ORANUS to ensure the probability the packet transmission delay exceeds a budget, i.e., the violation probability, is below a target tolerance. ORANUS also utilizes a RT control loop to monitor service transmission queues, dynamically adjusting the guaranteed radio resources based on detected traffic anomalies. To the best of our knowledge, ORANUS is the first O-RAN-compliant solution which benefits from SNC to carry out near-RT and RT control loops. Simulation results show that ORANUS significantly improves over reference solutions, with an average violation probability 10x lower. ",

We present a model based on Mathematical Morphology (MM), which can binarize ConvNets without losing performance under certain conditions, but these conditions may not be easy to satisfy in real-world scenarios. To solve this, we propose two new approximation methods and develop a robust theoretical framework for ConvNets binarization using MM.

The methodology includes practical techniques to enhance the performance of our goal. The benchmark is composed of the KITTI Misc benchmark and our additional synthetic benchmark for modeling a more diverse range of UFOs. The proposed framework consistently enhances performance by a large margin across all four baseline detectors: SECOND, PointPillars, PV-RCNN, and PartA2, giving insight for future work on UFO detection in the wild.

In this work, we study how DP impacts recommendation accuracy and popularity bias, when applied to the training data of state-of-the-art recommendation models. Our findings are three-fold: First, we find that nearly all users' recommendations change when DP is applied. Second, recommendation accuracy drops substantially while recommended item popularity experiences a sharp increase, suggesting that popularity bias worsens. Third, we find that DP exacerbates popularity bias more severely for users who prefer unpopular items than for users that prefer popular items. ",

When extending these ideas to a multi-agent setting, distribution models suffer from the curse of dimensionality: the exponential relation between the number of possible trajectories and the number of agents. The key advantage of using TNs in this setting is that there exists a large number of established optimisation and decomposition techniques that are specific to TNs, that one can apply to ensure the most efficient representation is found. In this report, these methods are used to form a TN that represents the expected return of a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) task. This model is then applied to a 2 agent random walker example, where it was shown that the policy is correctly optimised using a DMRG technique. Finally, I demonstrate the use of an exact decomposition technique, reducing the number of elements in the tensors by 97.5%, without experiencing any loss of information. ",

However, while achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on clean benchmark datasets, they tend to overlook the complexity and harsh conditions of real-world environments. Meanwhile, with the emergence of visual foundation models (VFMs), opportunities and challenges are presented for improving the robustness and generalization of multi-modal 3D object detection in autonomous driving. Therefore, we propose RoboFusion, a robust framework that leverages VFMs like SAM to tackle out-of-distribution (OOD) noise scenarios. We first adapt the original SAM for autonomous driving scenarios named SAM-AD. To align SAM or SAM-AD with multi-modal methods, we then introduce AD-FPN for upsampling the image features extracted by SAM. We employ wavelet decomposition to denoise the depth-guided images for further noise reduction and weather interference. Lastly, we employ self-attention mechanisms to adaptively reweight the fused features, enhancing informative features while suppressing excess noise. In summary, our RoboFusion gradually reduces noise by leveraging the generalization and robustness of VFMs, thereby enhancing the resilience of multi-modal 3D object detection. Consequently, our RoboFusion achieves state-of-the-art performance in noisy scenarios, as demonstrated by the KITTI-C and nuScenes-C benchmarks. ",

The number of eigenvectors can be chosen to control the condition number. For general sparse matrices, the coarse space is constructed by approximating the image of a local operator that can be defined from information in the coefficient matrix. The connection between the coarse spaces for SPD and general matrices is also discussed. Numerical experiments show the great effectiveness of the proposed preconditioners on matrices arising from a wide range of applications. The set of matrices includes SPD, symmetric indefinite, nonsymmetric, and saddle-point matrices.

However, traditional fault detection methods often struggle with issues such as nonlinearity and multivariate characteristics of the time series variables. This article proposes a generative adversarial wavelet neural operator (GAWNO) as a novel unsupervised deep learning approach for fault detection and isolation of multivariate time series processes.The GAWNO combines the strengths of wavelet neural operators and generative adversarial networks (GANs) to effectively capture both the temporal distributions and the spatial dependencies among different variables of an underlying system. The approach of fault detection and isolation using GAWNO consists of two main stages. In the first stage, the GAWNO is trained on a dataset of normal operating conditions to learn the underlying data distribution. In the second stage, a reconstruction error-based threshold approach using the trained GAWNO is employed to detect and isolate faults based on the discrepancy values. We validate the proposed approach using the Tennessee Eastman Process (TEP) dataset and Avedore wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) and N2O emissions named as WWTPN2O datasets. Overall, we showcase that the idea of harnessing the power of wavelet analysis, neural operators, and generative models in a single framework to detect and isolate faults has shown promising results compared to various well-established baselines in the literature.

The model suggested in this paper detects networks that have a statistically significant overlap with other approaches that principally rely on textual analysis for the detection of fraudulent papers. Researchers connected to networks identified using the methodology outlined in this paper are shown to be connected with 37% of papers identified through the tortured-phrase and clay-feet methods deployed in the Problematic Paper Screener website. Finally, methods to limit the expansion and propagation of these networks is discussed both in technological and social terms. ",

    "title": "FFSplit: Split Feed-Forward Network For Optimizing Accuracy-Efficiency  Trade-off in Language Model Inference",
    "abstract": "The large number of parameters in Pretrained Language Models enhance their performance, but also make them resource-intensive, making it challenging to deploy them on commodity hardware like a single GPU. Due to the memory and power limitations of these devices, model compression techniques are often used to decrease both the model's size and its inference latency. This usually results in a trade-off between model accuracy and efficiency. Therefore, optimizing this balance is essential for effectively deploying LLMs on commodity hardware. A significant portion of the efficiency challenge is the Feed-forward network (FFN) component, which accounts for roughly $\\frac{2}{3}$ total parameters and inference latency. In this paper, we first observe that only a few neurons of FFN module have large output norm for any input tokens, a.k.a. heavy hitters, while the others are sparsely triggered by different tokens. Based on this observation, we explicitly split the FFN into two parts according to the heavy hitters. We improve the efficiency-accuracy trade-off of existing compression methods by allocating more resource to FFN parts with heavy hitters. In practice, our method can reduce model size by 43.1\\% and bring $1.25\\sim1.56\\times$ wall clock time speedup on different hardware with negligible accuracy drop. ",

    "abstract": "Principal component analysis (PCA), along with its extensions to manifolds and outlier contaminated data, have been indispensable in computer vision and machine learning. In this work, we present a unifying formalism for PCA and its variants, and introduce a framework based on the flags of linear subspaces, \\ie a hierarchy of nested linear subspaces of increasing dimension, which not only allows for a common implementation but also yields novel variants, not explored previously. We begin by generalizing traditional PCA methods that either maximize variance or minimize reconstruction error. We expand these interpretations to develop a wide array of new dimensionality reduction algorithms by accounting for outliers and the data manifold. To devise a common computational approach, we recast robust and dual forms of PCA as optimization problems on flag manifolds. We then integrate tangent space approximations of principal geodesic analysis (tangent-PCA) into this flag-based framework, creating novel robust and dual geodesic PCA variations. The remarkable flexibility offered by the 'flagification' introduced here enables even more algorithmic variants identified by specific flag types. Last but not least, we propose an effective convergent solver for these flag-formulations employing the Stiefel manifold. Our empirical results on both real-world and synthetic scenarios, demonstrate the superiority of our novel algorithms, especially in terms of robustness to outliers on manifolds. ",

The cloud computing inherits the traditional potential security and privacy threats besides its own issues due to its unique structures. Some threats related to cloud computing are the insider malicious attacks from the employees that even sometime the provider unconscious about, the lack of transparency of agreement between consumer and provider, data loss, traffic hijacking, shared technology and insecure application interface. Such threats need remedies to make the consumer use its features in secure way. In this review, we spot the light on the most security and privacy issues which can be attributed as gaps that sometimes the consumers or even the enterprises are not aware of.

These models are typically used in downstream tasks by end-to-end finetuning, which is highly memory-intensive for tasks with high-resolution data, e.g., video understanding, small object detection, and point cloud analysis. In this paper, we propose Dynamic Reversible Dual-Residual Networks, or Dr$^2$Net, a novel family of network architectures that acts as a surrogate network to finetune a pretrained model with substantially reduced memory consumption. Dr$^2$Net contains two types of residual connections, one maintaining the residual structure in the pretrained models, and the other making the network reversible. Due to its reversibility, intermediate activations, which can be reconstructed from output, are cleared from memory during training. We use two coefficients on either type of residual connections respectively, and introduce a dynamic training strategy that seamlessly transitions the pretrained model to a reversible network with much higher numerical precision. We evaluate Dr$^2$Net on various pretrained models and various tasks, and show that it can reach comparable performance to conventional finetuning but with significantly less memory usage. ",

    "abstract": "Magmas form at depth, move upwards and evolve chemically through a combination of processes. Magmatic processes are investigated by means of fieldwork combined with geophysics, geochemistry, analog and numerical models, and many other approaches. However, scientists in the field still struggle to understand how the variety of magmatic products arises, and there is no consensus yet on models of volcanic plumbing systems. This is because eruptions result from the integration of multiple processes, rooted in the magma source either in the mantle or lower crust that feeds a complex network of magma bodies linking magma source and volcano. In this work, we investigate the potential of the network approach through a prototype of magma pool interaction and magma transfer across the crust. In network terms, it describes a diffusion process on a dynamic spatial network, in which diffusion and network evolution are intertwined: the diffusion affects the network structure, and reciprocally. The diffusion process and network evolution mechanisms come from rules of behaviour derived from rock mechanics and melting processes. Nodes represent magma pools and edges physical connections between them, e.g., dykes or veinlets. ",

Due to the flexibility of a DNN structure, both linear and nonlinear conditional mean functions can be easily modeled, and a multivariate regression model can be realized by simply adding extra nodes at the output layer. The proposed method is more efficient in capturing the dependency structure among responses than the least squares loss, and robust to outliers. In addition, we consider $L_1$-type penalization for variable selection, crucial in analyzing high-dimensional data. Namely, we propose what we call (A)GDNN-LD estimator that enjoys variable selection and model estimation simultaneously, by applying the (adaptive) group Lasso penalty to weight parameters in the DNN structure. For the computation, we propose a quadratic smoothing approximation method to facilitate optimizing the non-smooth objective function based on the least distance loss.

In order to tackle the problem of insufficient training data in reality, more and more researchers pay attention to data augmentation technology. However, few researchers pay attention to the problem of construction rules and domain information of data, which will directly impact the quality of augmented data and the augmentation performance. While in graph-based molecular research, the molecular connectivity index, as a critical topological index, can directly or indirectly reflect the topology-based physicochemical properties and biological activities. In this paper, we propose a novel data augmentation technique that modifies the topology of the molecular graph to generate augmented data with the same molecular connectivity index as the original data. The molecular connectivity index combined with data augmentation technology helps to retain more topology-based molecular properties information and generate more reliable data. Furthermore, we adopt five benchmark datasets to test our proposed models, and the results indicate that the augmented data generated based on important molecular topology features can effectively improve the prediction accuracy of molecular properties, which also provides a new perspective on data augmentation in cheminformatics studies.

This model co-optimizes unit commitments, power dispatch, upward/downward primary frequency response reserves, virtual inertia provisions from renewable energy sources (RESs), deloading ratios of RESs, and battery operations, while ensuring the system frequency security during unscheduled islanding. We establish an affine relationship between the actual power exchange and RES uncertainty in grid-connected mode, describe RES uncertainty with a Wasserstein-metric ambiguity set, and formulate frequency constraints under uncertain post-islanding power imbalance as distributionally robust quadratic chance constraints, which are further transformed by a tight conic relaxation.

    "abstract": "During the COVID-19 pandemic, a major driver of new surges has been the emergence of new variants. When a new variant emerges in one or more countries, other nations monitor its spread in preparation for its potential arrival. The impact of the variant and the timing of epidemic peaks in a country highly depend on when the variant arrives. The current methods for predicting the spread of new variants rely on statistical modeling, however, these methods work only when the new variant has already arrived in the region of interest and has a significant prevalence. The question arises: Can we predict when (and if) a variant that exists elsewhere will arrive in a given country and reach a certain prevalence? We propose a variant-dynamics-informed Graph Neural Network (GNN) approach. First, We derive the dynamics of variant prevalence across pairs of regions (countries) that applies to a large class of epidemic models. The dynamics suggest that ratios of variant proportions lead to simpler patterns. Therefore, we use ratios of variant proportions along with some parameters estimated from the dynamics as features in a GNN. We develop a benchmarking tool to evaluate variant emergence prediction over 87 countries and 36 variants. We leverage this tool to compare our GNN-based approach against our dynamics-only model and a number of machine learning models. Results show that the proposed dynamics-informed GNN method retrospectively outperforms all the baselines, including the currently pervasive framework of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) that incorporates the dynamics in the loss function.

Finally, we use a Chinese multichannel multi-modal dataset in real scenarios to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method on audio-visual speech recognition (AVSR), automatic speech recognition (ASR), visual speech recognition (VSR) and audio-visual speaker diarization (AVSD) tasks.

In task 1, classification of myopic maculopathy, we employed the contrastive learning framework, specifically SimCLR, to enhance classification accuracy by effectively capturing enriched features from unlabeled data. This approach not only improved the intrinsic understanding of the data but also elevated the performance of our classification model.

The results we obtained are promising and have allowed us to position ourselves in the Top 6 of the classification task, the Top 2 of the segmentation task, and the Top 1 of the prediction task.

    "title": "Boosting Column Generation with Graph Neural Networks for Joint Rider  Trip Planning and Crew Shift Scheduling",
    "abstract": "Optimizing service schedules is pivotal to the reliable, efficient, and inclusive on-demand mobility. This pressing challenge is further exacerbated by the increasing needs of an aging population, the over-subscription of existing services, and the lack of effective solution methods. This study addresses the intricacies of service scheduling, by jointly optimizing rider trip planning and crew scheduling for a complex dynamic mobility service. The resulting optimization problems are extremely challenging computationally for state-of-the-art methods. To address this fundamental gap, this paper introduces the Joint Rider Trip Planning and Crew Shift Scheduling Problem (JRTPCSSP) and a novel solution method, called AGGNNI-CG (Attention and Gated GNN- Informed Column Generation), that hybridizes column generation and machine learning to obtain near-optimal solutions to the JRTPCSSP with the real-time constraints of the application. The key idea of the machine-learning component is to dramatically reduce the number of paths to explore in the pricing component, accelerating the most time-consuming component of the column generation. The machine learning component is a graph neural network with an attention mechanism and a gated architecture, that is particularly suited to cater for the different input sizes coming from daily operations. AGGNNI-CG has been applied to a challenging, real-world dataset from the Paratransit system of Chatham County in Georgia. It produces dramatic improvements compared to the baseline column generation approach, which typically cannot produce feasible solutions in reasonable time on both medium-sized and large-scale complex instances. AGGNNI-CG also produces significant improvements in service compared to the existing system. ",

    "abstract": "The measurement of deep water gravity wave elevations using in-situ devices, such as wave gauges, typically yields spatially sparse data. This sparsity arises from the deployment of a limited number of gauges due to their installation effort and high operational costs. The reconstruction of the spatio-temporal extent of surface elevation poses an ill-posed data assimilation problem, challenging to solve with conventional numerical techniques. To address this issue, we propose the application of a physics-informed neural network (PINN), aiming to reconstruct physically consistent wave fields between two designated measurement locations several meters apart. Our method ensures this physical consistency by integrating residuals of the hydrodynamic nonlinear Schr\\\"{o}dinger equation (NLSE) into the PINN's loss function. Using synthetic wave elevation time series from distinct locations within a wave tank, we initially achieve successful reconstruction quality by employing constant, predetermined NLSE coefficients. However, the reconstruction quality is further improved by introducing NLSE coefficients as additional identifiable variables during PINN training. The results not only showcase a technically relevant application of the PINN method but also represent a pioneering step towards improving the initialization of deterministic wave prediction methods.

Within neural network architectures, the integration of the intrinsic structure of ODEs offers advantages such as enhanced predictive capabilities and reduced data utilization. Among these structural ODE forms, the Lagrangian representation stands out due to its significant physical underpinnings. Building upon this framework, Bhattoo introduced the concept of Lagrangian Neural Networks (LNNs). Then in this article, we introduce a groundbreaking extension (Genralized Lagrangian Neural Networks) to Lagrangian Neural Networks (LNNs), innovatively tailoring them for non-conservative systems. By leveraging the foundational importance of the Lagrangian within Lagrange's equations, we formulate the model based on the generalized Lagrange's equation. This modification not only enhances prediction accuracy but also guarantees Lagrangian representation in non-conservative systems. Furthermore, we perform various experiments, encompassing 1-dimensional and 2-dimensional examples, along with an examination of the impact of network parameters, which proved the superiority of Generalized Lagrangian Neural Networks(GLNNs).

To settle these issues, we propose XtalNet, the first end-to-end deep learning-based framework capable of ab initio generation of crystal structures that accurately match given PXRD patterns. The model employs contrastive learning and Diffusion-based conditional generation to enable the simultaneous execution of two tasks: crystal structure retrieval based on PXRD patterns and conditional structure generations. To validate the effectiveness of XtalNet, we curate a much more challenging and practical dataset hMOF-100, XtalNet performs well on this dataset, reaching 96.3\\% top-10 hit ratio on the database retrieval task and 95.0\\% top-10 match rate on the ranked structure generation task.

    "abstract": "The assessment of breast density is crucial in the context of breast cancer screening, especially in populations with a higher percentage of dense breast tissues. This study introduces a novel data augmentation technique termed Attention-Guided Erasing (AGE), devised to enhance the downstream classification of four distinct breast density categories in mammography following the BI-RADS recommendation in the Vietnamese cohort. The proposed method integrates supplementary information during transfer learning, utilizing visual attention maps derived from a vision transformer backbone trained using the self-supervised DINO method. These maps are utilized to erase background regions in the mammogram images, unveiling only the potential areas of dense breast tissues to the network. Through the incorporation of AGE during transfer learning with varying random probabilities, we consistently surpass classification performance compared to scenarios without AGE and the traditional random erasing transformation. We validate our methodology using the publicly available VinDr-Mammo dataset. Specifically, we attain a mean F1-score of 0.5910, outperforming values of 0.5594 and 0.5691 corresponding to scenarios without AGE and with random erasing (RE), respectively. This superiority is further substantiated by t-tests, revealing a p-value of p<0.0001, underscoring the statistical significance of our approach. ",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD), the predominant form of dementia, poses a growing global challenge and underscores the urgency of accurate and early diagnosis. The clinical technique radiologists adopt for distinguishing between mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD using Machine Resonance Imaging (MRI) encounter hurdles because they are not consistent and reliable. Machine learning has been shown to offer promise for early AD diagnosis. However, existing models focused on focal fine-grain features without considerations to focal structural features that give off information on neurodegeneration of the brain cerebral cortex. Therefore, this paper proposes a machine learning (ML) framework that integrates Gamma correction, an image enhancement technique, and includes a structure-focused neurodegeneration convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture called SNeurodCNN for discriminating between AD and MCI. The ML framework leverages the mid-sagittal and para-sagittal brain image viewpoints of the structure-focused Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset. Through experiments, our proposed machine learning framework shows exceptional performance. The parasagittal viewpoint set achieves 97.8% accuracy, with 97.0% specificity and 98.5% sensitivity. The midsagittal viewpoint is shown to present deeper insights into the structural brain changes given the increase in accuracy, specificity, and sensitivity, which are 98.1% 97.2%, and 99.0%, respectively. Using GradCAM technique, we show that our proposed model is capable of capturing the structural dynamics of MCI and AD which exist about the frontal lobe, occipital lobe, cerebellum, and parietal lobe. Therefore, our model itself as a potential brain structural change Digi-Biomarker for early diagnosis of AD. ",

This paper makes progress towards this by developing non-asymptotic distributional characterizations for approximate message passing (AMP) -- a family of iterative algorithms that prove effective as both fast estimators and powerful theoretical machinery -- for both sparse and robust regression. Prior AMP theory, which focused on high-dimensional asymptotics for the most part, failed to describe the behavior of AMP when the number of iterations exceeds $o\\big({\\log n}/{\\log \\log n}\\big)$ (with $n$ the sample size). We establish the first finite-sample non-asymptotic distributional theory of AMP for both sparse and robust regression that accommodates a polynomial number of iterations. Our results derive approximate accuracy of Gaussian approximation of the AMP iterates, which improves upon all prior results and implies enhanced distributional characterizations for both optimally tuned Lasso and robust M-estimator.

    "title": "The Robust Bilevel Selection Problem",
    "abstract": "In bilevel optimization problems, a leader and a follower make their decisions in a hierarchy, and both decisions influence each other. Usually one assumes that both players have full knowledge also of the other player's data. In a more realistic model, uncertainty can be quantified, e.g., using the robust optimization approach: We assume that the leader does not know the follower's objective precisely, but only up to some uncertainty set, and her aim is to optimize the worst case of the corresponding scenarios. Now the question arises how the complexity of bilevel optimization changes under the additional complications of this uncertainty. We make a further step towards answering this question by examining an easy bilevel problem. In the Bilevel Selection Problem (BSP), the leader and the follower each select some items, while a common number of items to select in total is given, and each player minimizes the total costs of the selected items, according to different sets of item costs. We show that the BSP can be solved in polynomial time and then investigate its robust version. If the item sets controlled by the players are disjoint, it can still be solved in polynomial time for several types of uncertainty sets. Otherwise, we show that the Robust BSP is NP-hard and present a 2-approximation algorithm and exact exponential-time approaches. Furthermore, we investigate variants of the BSP where one or both of the two players take a continuous decision. One variant leads to an example of a bilevel optimization problem whose optimum value may not be attained. For the Robust Continuous BSP, where all variables are continuous, we also develop a new approach for the setting of discrete uncorrelated uncertainty, which gives a polynomial-time algorithm for the Robust Continuous BSP and a pseudopolynomial-time algorithm for the Robust Bilevel Continuous Knapsack Problem.
