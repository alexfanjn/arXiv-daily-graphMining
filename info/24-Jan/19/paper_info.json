    "abstract": "Visual defect detection plays an important role in intelligent industry. Patch based methods consider visual images as a collection of image patches according to positions, which have stronger discriminative ability for small defects in products, e.g. scratches on pills. However, the nearest neighbor search for the query image and the stored patches will occupy $O(n)$ complexity in terms of time and space requirements, posing strict challenges for deployment in edge environments. In this paper, we propose an alternative approach to the distance calculation of image patches via collaborative representation models. Starting from the nearest neighbor distance with $L_0$ constraint, we relax the constraint to $L_2$ constraint and solve the distance quickly in close-formed without actually accessing the original stored collection of image patches. Furthermore, we point out that the main computational burden of this close-formed solution can be pre-computed by high-performance server before deployment. Consequently, the distance calculation on edge devices only requires a simple matrix multiplication, which is extremely lightweight and GPU-friendly. Performance on real industrial scenarios demonstrates that compared to the existing state-of-the-art methods, this distance achieves several hundred times improvement in computational efficiency with slight performance drop, while greatly reducing memory overhead.

This novel KRM called Tumbug was designed to be pictorial in nature because there exists increasing evidence that the human brain uses some pictorial type of KRM, and no well-known prior research in AGI has researched this KRM possibility. Tumbug is somewhat similar to Roger Schank's Conceptual Dependency (CD) theory, but Tumbug is pictorial and uses about 30 components based on fundamental concepts from the sciences and human life, in contrast to CD theory, which is textual and uses about 17 components (= 6 Primitive Conceptual Categories + 11 Primitive Acts) based mainly on human-oriented activities. All the Building Blocks of Tumbug were found to generalize to only five Basic Building Blocks that exactly correspond to the three components {O, A, V} of traditional Object-Attribute-Value representation plus two new components {C, S}, which are Change and System. Collectively this set of five components, called \"SCOVA,\" seems to be a universal foundation for all knowledge representation. ",

    "abstract": "The integration of machine learning in medicine has significantly improved diagnostic precision, particularly in the interpretation of complex structures like the human brain. Diagnosing challenging conditions such as Alzheimer's disease has prompted the development of brain age estimation techniques. These methods often leverage three-dimensional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans, with recent studies emphasizing the efficacy of 3D convolutional neural networks (CNNs) like 3D ResNet. However, the untapped potential of Vision Transformers (ViTs), known for their accuracy and interpretability, persists in this domain due to limitations in their 3D versions. This paper introduces Triamese-ViT, an innovative adaptation of the ViT model for brain age estimation. Our model uniquely combines ViTs from three different orientations to capture 3D information, significantly enhancing accuracy and interpretability. Tested on a dataset of 1351 MRI scans, Triamese-ViT achieves a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 3.84, a 0.9 Spearman correlation coefficient with chronological age, and a -0.29 Spearman correlation coefficient between the brain age gap (BAG) and chronological age, significantly better than previous methods for brian age estimation. A key innovation of Triamese-ViT is its capacity to generate a comprehensive 3D-like attention map, synthesized from 2D attention maps of each orientation-specific ViT. This feature is particularly beneficial for in-depth brain age analysis and disease diagnosis, offering deeper insights into brain health and the mechanisms of age-related neural changes. ",

To counter this, various machine learning solutions have been developed for the detection of hardware Trojans. While most of the focus has been on either a statistical or deep learning approach, the limited number of Trojan-infected benchmarks affects the detection accuracy and restricts the possibility of detecting zero-day Trojans. To close the gap, we first employ generative adversarial networks to amplify our data in two alternative representation modalities, a graph and a tabular, ensuring that the dataset is distributed in a representative manner. Further, we propose a multimodal deep learning approach to detect hardware Trojans and evaluate the results from both early fusion and late fusion strategies. We also estimate the uncertainty quantification metrics of each prediction for risk-aware decision-making. The outcomes not only confirms the efficacy of our proposed hardware Trojan detection method but also opens a new door for future studies employing multimodality and uncertainty quantification to address other hardware security challenges.

This paper proposes a comprehensive intellectual property (IP) protection framework for the NeRF model in both black-box and white-box settings, namely IPR-NeRF. In the black-box setting, a diffusion-based solution is introduced to embed and extract the watermark via a two-stage optimization process. In the white-box setting, a designated digital signature is embedded into the weights of the NeRF model by adopting the sign loss objective. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that not only does our approach maintain the fidelity (\\ie, the rendering quality) of IPR-NeRF models, but it is also robust against both ambiguity and removal attacks compared to prior arts.

Existing methods for data smoothing and dimensional reduction mainly focus on learning the linear mappings from the data space to the representation space, however, learning only the linear representations may not be sufficient. In this study, we propose to learn the nonlinear representations of functional data using neural network autoencoders designed to process data in the form it is usually collected without the need of preprocessing. We design the encoder to employ a projection layer computing the weighted inner product of the functional data and functional weights over the observed timestamp, and the decoder to apply a recovery layer that maps the finite-dimensional vector extracted from the functional data back to functional space using a set of predetermined basis functions. The developed architecture can accommodate both regularly and irregularly spaced data. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms functional principal component analysis in terms of prediction and classification, and maintains superior smoothing ability and better computational efficiency in comparison to the conventional autoencoders under both linear and nonlinear settings.

We first put forth a random graph model, called the multi-view stochastic block model (MVSBM), designed to generate correlated graphs on the same set of nodes (with cardinality $n$). The $n$ nodes are partitioned into two disjoint communities of equal size. The presence or absence of edges in the graphs for each pair of nodes depends on whether the two nodes belong to the same community or not. The objective for the learner is to recover the hidden communities with observed graphs. Our technical contributions are two-fold: (i) We establish an information-theoretic upper bound (Theorem~1) showing that exact recovery of community is achievable when the model parameters of MVSBM exceed a certain threshold. (ii) Conversely, we derive an information-theoretic lower bound (Theorem~2) showing that when the model parameters of MVSBM fall below the aforementioned threshold, then for any estimator, the expected number of misclassified nodes will always be greater than one. Our results for the MVSBM recover several prior results for community detection in the standard SBM as well as in multiple independent SBMs as special cases. ",

In critical applications like surveillance systems and self-driving cars, an inadequate FOV can give rise to severe safety and security concerns, including car accidents and thefts due to the failure to detect individuals and objects. The conventional methods for establishing the correct FOV heavily rely on human judgment and lack automated mechanisms to assess video and image quality based on FOV. In this paper, we introduce an innovative approach that harnesses semantic line detection and classification alongside deep Hough transform to identify semantic lines, thus ensuring a suitable FOV by understanding 3D view through parallel lines. Our approach yields an effective F1 score of 0.729 on the public EgoCart dataset, coupled with a notably high median score in the line placement metric. We illustrate that our method offers a straightforward means of assessing the quality of the camera's field of view, achieving a classification accuracy of 83.8\\%. This metric can serve as a proxy for evaluating the potential performance of video and image quality applications. ",

    "abstract": "Learning neural operators for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) has attracted great attention due to its high inference efficiency. However, training such operators requires generating a substantial amount of labeled data, i.e., PDE problems together with their solutions. The data generation process is exceptionally time-consuming, as it involves solving numerous systems of linear equations to obtain numerical solutions to the PDEs. Many existing methods solve these systems independently without considering their inherent similarities, resulting in extremely redundant computations. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel method, namely Sorting Krylov Recycling (SKR), to boost the efficiency of solving these systems, thus significantly accelerating data generation for neural operators training. To the best of our knowledge, SKR is the first attempt to address the time-consuming nature of data generation for learning neural operators. The working horse of SKR is Krylov subspace recycling, a powerful technique for solving a series of interrelated systems by leveraging their inherent similarities. Specifically, SKR employs a sorting algorithm to arrange these systems in a sequence, where adjacent systems exhibit high similarities. Then it equips a solver with Krylov subspace recycling to solve the systems sequentially instead of independently, thus effectively enhancing the solving efficiency. Both theoretical analysis and extensive experiments demonstrate that SKR can significantly accelerate neural operator data generation, achieving a remarkable speedup of up to 13.9 times. ",

On-off pattern of a neuron is decided as `on' or `off' depending on whether the neuron's activation after ReLU is non-zero or zero. PathCount is the number of paths that transmit non-zero energy from the input to a neuron. We investigate how neurons in the network encodes information by replacing each layer's activation with On-Off pattern or PathCount and evaluating its effect on classification performance. We also examine correlation between representation and PathCount. Finally, we show a possible way to improve an existing DNN interpretation method, Class Activation Map (CAM), by directly utilizing On-Off or PathCount. ",

While most research focuses primarily on user privacy, device data privacy, especially identity privacy, is almost neglected, which can significantly impact overall user privacy within the SH system. To this end, our study incorporates privacy engineering (PE) principles in the SH system that consider user and device data privacy. We start with a comprehensive reference model for a typical SH system. Based on the initial stage of LINDDUN PRO for the PE framework, we present a data flow diagram (DFD) based on a typical SH reference model to better understand SH system operations. To identify potential areas of privacy threat and perform a privacy threat analysis (PTA), we employ the LINDDUN PRO threat model. Then, a privacy impact assessment (PIA) was carried out to implement privacy risk management by prioritizing privacy threats based on their likelihood of occurrence and potential consequences. Finally, we suggest possible privacy enhancement techniques (PETs) that can mitigate some of these threats. The study aims to elucidate the main threats to privacy, associated risks, and effective prioritization of privacy control in SH systems. The outcomes of this study are expected to benefit SH stakeholders, including vendors, cloud providers, users, researchers, and regulatory bodies in the SH systems domain. ",

Hand-designed models, however, may be insufficiently accurate, even after careful parameter tuning. This motivates the use of machine learning techniques to approximate the robot dynamics over a training set of state-control trajectories. The dynamics of many robots are described in terms of their generalized coordinates on a matrix Lie group, e.g. on SE(3) for ground, aerial, and underwater vehicles, and generalized velocity, and satisfy conservation of energy principles. This paper proposes a (port-)Hamiltonian formulation over a Lie group of the structure of a neural ordinary differential equation (ODE) network to approximate the robot dynamics. In contrast to a black-box ODE network, our formulation guarantees energy conservation principle and Lie group's constraints by construction and explicitly accounts for energy-dissipation effect such as friction and drag forces in the dynamics model. We develop energy shaping and damping injection control for the learned, potentially under-actuated Hamiltonian dynamics to enable a unified approach for stabilization and trajectory tracking with various robot platforms.

We require that each intermediate arrangement of tokens again specifies an independent set of size $k$. Given $G$, $I_s$, and $I_t$, we ask whether there exists a sequence of token jumps that transforms $I_s$ to $I_t$. When $k$ is part of the input, this problem is known to be PSPACE-complete. However, it was shown by Ito, Kami\\'nski, and Ono to be fixed-parameter tractable. That is, when $k$ is fixed, the problem can be solved in time polynomial in the order of $G$. Here we strengthen the upper bound on the running time in terms of $k$ by showing that the problem has a kernel of size linear in $k$. More precisely, we transform an arbitrary input problem on a planar graph into an equivalent problem on a (planar) graph with order $O(k)$. ",

    "abstract": "As the deployment of deep learning models continues to expand across industries, the threat of malicious incursions aimed at gaining access to these deployed models is on the rise. Should an attacker gain access to a deployed model, whether through server breaches, insider attacks, or model inversion techniques, they can then construct white-box adversarial attacks to manipulate the model's classification outcomes, thereby posing significant risks to organizations that rely on these models for critical tasks. Model owners need mechanisms to protect themselves against such losses without the necessity of acquiring fresh training data - a process that typically demands substantial investments in time and capital. In this paper, we explore the feasibility of generating multiple versions of a model that possess different attack properties, without acquiring new training data or changing model architecture. The model owner can deploy one version at a time and replace a leaked version immediately with a new version. The newly deployed model version can resist adversarial attacks generated leveraging white-box access to one or all previously leaked versions. We show theoretically that this can be accomplished by incorporating parameterized hidden distributions into the model training data, forcing the model to learn task-irrelevant features uniquely defined by the chosen data. Additionally, optimal choices of hidden distributions can produce a sequence of model versions capable of resisting compound transferability attacks over time. Leveraging our analytical insights, we design and implement a practical model versioning method for DNN classifiers, which leads to significant robustness improvements over existing methods. We believe our work presents a promising direction for safeguarding DNN services beyond their initial deployment. ",

In this report, we present a series of six lessons combining presentations and hands-on activities covering topics within social computing and detail our experience teaching these lessons to approximately 1,405 students across 13 middle and high schools in our local school district. We developed lessons covering how social computing relates to the topics of Data Management, Encrypted Messaging, Human-Computer Interaction Careers, Machine Learning and Bias, Misinformation, and Online Behavior. We found that 81.13% of students expressed greater interest in the content of our lessons compared to their interest in STEM overall. We also found from pre- and post-lesson comprehension questions that 63.65% learned new concepts from the main activity. We release all lesson materials on a website for public use.

We employ Ladaformer in both the generator and discriminator, which reduces the computational complexity and overcomes the training instabilities often associated with Transformer GANs. LadaGAN consistently outperforms existing convolutional and Transformer GANs on benchmark datasets at different resolutions while being significantly more efficient. Moreover, LadaGAN shows competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art multi-step generative models (e.g. DMs) using orders of magnitude less computational resources. ",

Traditional aircraft navigation systems, while effective, face limitations in precision and reliability in certain environments and against attacks. Airborne MagNav leverages the Earth's magnetic field to provide accurate positional information. However, external magnetic fields induced by aircraft electronics and Earth's large-scale magnetic fields disrupt the weaker signal of interest. We introduce a physics-informed approach using Tolles-Lawson coefficients for compensation and Liquid Time-Constant Networks (LTCs) to remove complex, noisy signals derived from the aircraft's magnetic sources. Using real flight data with magnetometer measurements and aircraft measurements, we observe up to a 64% reduction in aeromagnetic compensation error (RMSE nT), outperforming conventional models. This significant improvement underscores the potential of a physics-informed, machine learning approach for extracting clean, reliable, and accurate magnetic signals for MagNav positional estimation.

However, LiNGAM can only deal with the finite-dimensional case. To expand this concept, we extend the notion of variables to encompass vectors and even functions, leading to the Functional Linear Non-Gaussian Acyclic Model (Func-LiNGAM). Our motivation stems from the desire to identify causal relationships in brain-effective connectivity tasks involving, for example, fMRI and EEG datasets. We demonstrate why the original LiNGAM fails to handle these inherently infinite-dimensional datasets and explain the availability of functional data analysis from both empirical and theoretical perspectives. {We establish theoretical guarantees of the identifiability of the causal relationship among non-Gaussian random vectors and even random functions in infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces.} To address the issue of sparsity in discrete time points within intrinsic infinite-dimensional functional data, we propose optimizing the coordinates of the vectors using functional principal component analysis. Experimental results on synthetic data verify the ability of the proposed framework to identify causal relationships among multivariate functions using the observed samples. For real data, we focus on analyzing the brain connectivity patterns derived from fMRI data. ",

While mobility is usually considered as a challenge from the perspective of communication, we prove that it increases the convergence speed of HFL with edge-level heterogeneous data, since more diverse data can be incorporated. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a higher speed leads to faster convergence, since it accelerates the fusion of data.

Aligning SVD-based models with fast-paced updates becomes increasingly important. Existing methods for updating truncated SVDs employ Rayleigh-Ritz projection procedures, where projection matrices are augmented based on original singular vectors. However, these methods suffer from inefficiency due to the densification of the update matrix and the application of the projection to all singular vectors. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel method for dynamically approximating the truncated SVD of a sparse and temporally evolving matrix. Our approach leverages sparsity in the orthogonalization process of augmented matrices and utilizes an extended decomposition to independently store projections in the column space of singular vectors. Numerical experiments demonstrate a remarkable efficiency improvement of an order of magnitude compared to previous methods. Remarkably, this improvement is achieved while maintaining a comparable precision to existing approaches. ",

To fully unleash the potential of LEO satellite communication, resource management plays a key role.

In this paper, we study the joint optimization of beam direction and the allocation of spectrum, time, and power resource in a dynamic multi-beam LEO satellite network. The objective is to improve long-term user sum data rate while taking user fairness into account. Since the concerned resource management problem is mixed-integer non-convex programming, the problem is decomposed into three subproblems, namely beam direction control and time slot allocation, user subchannel assignment, and beam power allocation. Then, these subproblems are solved iteratively by leveraging matching with externalities and successive convex approximation, and the proposed algorithms are analyzed in terms of stability, convergence, and complexity. Extensive simulations are conducted, and the results demonstrate that our proposal can improve the number of served users by up to two times and the sum user data rate by up to 68%, compared to baseline schemes.

    "abstract": "Backdoors and adversarial examples are the two primary threats currently faced by deep neural networks (DNNs). Both attacks attempt to hijack the model behaviors with unintended outputs by introducing (small) perturbations to the inputs. Backdoor attacks, despite the high success rates, often require a strong assumption, which is not always easy to achieve in reality. Adversarial example attacks, which put relatively weaker assumptions on attackers, often demand high computational resources, yet do not always yield satisfactory success rates when attacking mainstream black-box models in the real world. These limitations motivate the following research question: can model hijacking be achieved more simply, with a higher attack success rate and more reasonable assumptions? In this paper, we propose CleanSheet, a new model hijacking attack that obtains the high performance of backdoor attacks without requiring the adversary to tamper with the model training process. CleanSheet exploits vulnerabilities in DNNs stemming from the training data. Specifically, our key idea is to treat part of the clean training data of the target model as \"poisoned data,\" and capture the characteristics of these data that are more sensitive to the model (typically called robust features) to construct \"triggers.\" These triggers can be added to any input example to mislead the target model, similar to backdoor attacks. We validate the effectiveness of CleanSheet through extensive experiments on 5 datasets, 79 normally trained models, 68 pruned models, and 39 defensive models. Results show that CleanSheet exhibits performance comparable to state-of-the-art backdoor attacks, achieving an average attack success rate (ASR) of 97.5% on CIFAR-100 and 92.4% on GTSRB, respectively. Furthermore, CleanSheet consistently maintains a high ASR, when confronted with various mainstream backdoor defenses. ",

This paper highlights the ``bonus inconsistency'' issue within RND, pinpointing its primary limitation. To address this issue, we introduce the Distributional RND (DRND), a derivative of the RND. DRND enhances the exploration process by distilling a distribution of random networks and implicitly incorporating pseudo counts to improve the precision of bonus allocation. This refinement encourages agents to engage in more extensive exploration. Our method effectively mitigates the inconsistency issue without introducing significant computational overhead. Both theoretical analysis and experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our approach over the original RND algorithm.

Motivated by this, a surge of robust models is crafted to enhance the adversarial robustness of graph neural networks on homophilic graphs. However, the vulnerability based on heterophilic graphs remains a mystery to us. To bridge this gap, in this paper, we start to explore the vulnerability of graph neural networks on heterophilic graphs and theoretically prove that the update of the negative classification loss is negatively correlated with the pairwise similarities based on the powered aggregated neighbor features. This theoretical proof explains the empirical observations that the graph attacker tends to connect dissimilar node pairs based on the similarities of neighbor features instead of ego features both on homophilic and heterophilic graphs. In this way, we novelly introduce a novel robust model termed NSPGNN which incorporates a dual-kNN graphs pipeline to supervise the neighbor similarity-guided propagation. This propagation utilizes the low-pass filter to smooth the features of node pairs along the positive kNN graphs and the high-pass filter to discriminate the features of node pairs along the negative kNN graphs. Extensive experiments on both homophilic and heterophilic graphs validate the universal robustness of NSPGNN compared to the state-of-the-art methods. ",

However, the already deployed terrestrial base stations (TBSs) result in weak ground-to-air (G2A) coverage due to the down-tilted antennas. Furthermore, achieving optimal coverage across the entire airspace through antenna adjustment is challenging due to the complex signal coverage requirements in three-dimensional space, especially in the vertical direction. In this paper, we propose a cooperative tri-point (CoTP) model-based method that utilizes cooperative beams to enhance the G2A coverage extension. To utilize existing TBSs for establishing effective cooperation, we prove that the cooperation among three TBSs can ensure G2A coverage with a minimum coverage overlap, and design the CoTP model to analyze the G2A coverage extension. Using the model, a cooperative coverage structure based on Delaunay triangulation is designed to divide triangular prism-shaped subspaces and corresponding TBS cooperation sets. To enable TBSs in the cooperation set to cover different height subspaces while maintaining ground coverage, we design a cooperative beam generation algorithm to maximize the coverage in the triangular prism-shaped airspace. The simulation results and field trials demonstrate that the proposed method can efficiently enhance the G2A coverage extension while guaranteeing ground coverage. ",

For this purpose, we create the first Inter-Procedural Vulnerability Dataset (InterPVD) based on C/C++ open-source software, and we propose a tool dubbed VulTrigger for identifying vulnerability-triggering statements across functions. Experimental results show that VulTrigger can effectively identify vulnerability-triggering statements and inter-procedural vulnerabilities. Our findings include: (i) inter-procedural vulnerabilities are prevalent with an average of 2.8 inter-procedural layers; and (ii) function-level vulnerability detectors are much less effective in detecting to-be-patched functions of inter-procedural vulnerabilities than detecting their counterparts of intra-procedural vulnerabilities.

(1) Similar visual presentation of intranuclear and extranuclear regions of chromophobe nuclei often causes under-segmentation, and (2) current methods lack the exploration of nuclei structure, resulting in fragmented instance predictions. To address these problems, this paper proposes a structure encoding and interaction network, termed SEINE, which develops the structure modeling scheme of nuclei and exploits the structure similarity between nuclei to improve the integrality of each segmented instance. Concretely, SEINE introduces a contour-based structure encoding (SE) that considers the correlation between nuclei structure and semantics, realizing a reasonable representation of the nuclei structure. Based on the encoding, we propose a structure-guided attention (SGA) that takes the clear nuclei as prototypes to enhance the structure learning for the fuzzy nuclei. To strengthen the structural learning ability, a semantic feature fusion (SFF) is presented to boost the semantic consistency of semantic and structure branches. Furthermore, a position enhancement (PE) method is applied to suppress incorrect nuclei boundary predictions. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our approaches, and SEINE achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on four datasets.

To this end, we introduce a Self-Training framework for SGG (ST-SGG) that assigns pseudo-labels for unannotated triplets based on which the SGG models are trained. While there has been significant progress in self-training for image recognition, designing a self-training framework for the SGG task is more challenging due to its inherent nature such as the semantic ambiguity and the long-tailed distribution of predicate classes. Hence, we propose a novel pseudo-labeling technique for SGG, called Class-specific Adaptive Thresholding with Momentum (CATM), which is a model-agnostic framework that can be applied to any existing SGG models. Furthermore, we devise a graph structure learner (GSL) that is beneficial when adopting our proposed self-training framework to the state-of-the-art message-passing neural network (MPNN)-based SGG models. Our extensive experiments verify the effectiveness of ST-SGG on various SGG models, particularly in enhancing the performance on fine-grained predicate classes. ",

    "abstract": "Anomaly detection stands as a crucial aspect of time series analysis, aiming to identify abnormal events in time series samples. The central challenge of this task lies in effectively learning the representations of normal and abnormal patterns in a label-lacking scenario. Previous research mostly relied on reconstruction-based approaches, restricting the representational abilities of the models. In addition, most of the current deep learning-based methods are not lightweight enough, which prompts us to design a more efficient framework for anomaly detection. In this study, we introduce PatchAD, a novel multi-scale patch-based MLP-Mixer architecture that leverages contrastive learning for representational extraction and anomaly detection. Specifically, PatchAD is composed of four distinct MLP Mixers, exclusively utilizing the MLP architecture for high efficiency and lightweight architecture. Additionally, we also innovatively crafted a dual project constraint module to mitigate potential model degradation. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that PatchAD achieves state-of-the-art results across multiple real-world multivariate time series datasets.

We further propose a two-level cascade neural network named Path Planning Network (PPNet) to solve the path planning problem by solving the abovementioned subproblems. Moreover, we propose a novel efficient data generation method for path planning named EDaGe-PP. The results show the total computation time is less than 1/33 and the success rate of PPNet trained by the dataset that is generated by EDaGe-PP is about $2 \\times$ compared to other methods.

Contrary to conventional Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Fast&Focused-Net employs a series of our newly proposed layer, the Volume-wise Dot Product (VDP) layer, designed to address several inherent limitations of CNNs. Specifically, CNNs often exhibit a smaller effective receptive field than their theoretical counterparts, limiting their vision span. Additionally, the initial layers in CNNs produce low-dimensional feature vectors, presenting a bottleneck for subsequent learning. Lastly, the computational overhead of CNNs, particularly in capturing diverse image regions by parameter sharing, is significantly high. The VDP layer, at the heart of Fast&Focused-Net, aims to remedy these issues by efficiently covering the entire image patch information with reduced computational demand. Experimental results demonstrate the prowess of Fast&Focused-Net in a variety of applications. For small object classification tasks, our network outperformed state-of-the-art methods on datasets such as CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, STL-10, SVHN-Cropped, and Fashion-MNIST. In the context of larger image classification, when combined with a transformer encoder (ViT), Fast&Focused-Net produced competitive results for OpenImages V6, ImageNet-1K, and Places365 datasets. Moreover, the same combination showcased unparalleled performance in text recognition tasks across SVT, IC15, SVTP, and HOST datasets. This paper presents the architecture, the underlying motivation, and extensive empirical evidence suggesting that Fast&Focused-Net is a promising direction for efficient and focused deep learning. ",

Conventional approaches that rely on estimating an over-fit projection matrix struggle to effectively address these challenges and often result in noisy outputs. Recent advancements in diffusion models have shown promise in incorporating structural priors to address reprojection ambiguities. However, there is still ample room for improvement as these methods often overlook the exploration of correlation between the 2D and 3D joint-level features. In this study, we propose a novel cross-channel embedding framework that aims to fully explore the correlation between joint-level features of 3D coordinates and their 2D projections. In addition, we introduce a context guidance mechanism to facilitate the propagation of joint graph attention across latent channels during the iterative diffusion process. To evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed method, we conduct experiments on two benchmark datasets, namely Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP.

Most recent models have adopted a prototype-based paradigm for few-shot inference. These approaches may have limited generalization capacity beyond the standard 1- or 5-shot settings. In this paper, we closely examine and reevaluate the fine-tuning based learning scheme that fine-tunes the classification layer of a deep segmentation network pre-trained on diverse base classes. To improve the generalizability of the classification layer optimized with sparsely annotated samples, we introduce an instance-aware data augmentation (IDA) strategy that augments the support images based on the relative sizes of the target objects. The proposed IDA effectively increases the support set's diversity and promotes the distribution consistency between support and query images. On the other hand, the large visual difference between query and support images may hinder knowledge transfer and cripple the segmentation performance. To cope with this challenge, we introduce the local consensus guided cross attention (LCCA) to align the query feature with support features based on their dense correlation, further improving the model's generalizability to the query image. The significant performance improvements on the standard few-shot segmentation benchmarks PASCAL-$5^i$ and COCO-$20^i$ verify the efficacy of our proposed method. ",

On the other hand, other efforts have tried to use spatial abstraction to mitigate the previous issues. Their limitations include scalability to high dimensional environments and dependency on prior knowledge.

It is crucial for SBSs to predict accurate popular contents through learning while protecting users' personal information. Traditional federated learning (FL) can protect users' privacy but the data discrepancies among UEs can lead to a degradation in model quality. Therefore, it is necessary to train personalized local models for each UE to predict popular contents accurately. In addition, the cached contents can be shared among adjacent SBSs in next-generation networks, thus caching predicted popular contents in different SBSs may affect the cost to fetch contents. Hence, it is critical to determine where the popular contents are cached cooperatively. To address these issues, we propose a cooperative edge caching scheme based on elastic federated and multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (CEFMR) to optimize the cost in the network. We first propose an elastic FL algorithm to train the personalized model for each UE, where adversarial autoencoder (AAE) model is adopted for training to improve the prediction accuracy, then {a popular} content prediction algorithm is proposed to predict the popular contents for each SBS based on the trained AAE model.

This challenge is primarily rooted in two key issues: first, the memory available on embedded devices is typically insufficient to accommodate the memory-intensive back-propagation algorithm, which often relies on floating-point precision. Second, the development of learning algorithms on models with extreme quantization levels, such as Binary Neural Networks (BNNs), is critical due to the drastic reduction in bit representation. In this study, we propose a solution that combines recent advancements in the field of Continual Learning (CL) and Binary Neural Networks to enable on-device training while maintaining competitive performance. Specifically, our approach leverages binary latent replay (LR) activations and a novel quantization scheme that significantly reduces the number of bits required for gradient computation. The experimental validation demonstrates a significant accuracy improvement in combination with a noticeable reduction in memory requirement, confirming the suitability of our approach in expanding the practical applications of deep learning in real-world scenarios.

    "abstract": "Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) aims to transfer a model learned using labeled data from the source domain to unlabeled data in the target domain. To address the large domain gap issue between the source and target domains, we propose a novel regularization method for domain adaptive object detection, BlenDA, by generating the pseudo samples of the intermediate domains and their corresponding soft domain labels for adaptation training. The intermediate samples are generated by dynamically blending the source images with their corresponding translated images using an off-the-shelf pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model which takes the text label of the target domain as input and has demonstrated superior image-to-image translation quality. Based on experimental results from two adaptation benchmarks, our proposed approach can significantly enhance the performance of the state-of-the-art domain adaptive object detector, Adversarial Query Transformer (AQT). Particularly, in the Cityscapes to Foggy Cityscapes adaptation, we achieve an impressive 53.4% mAP on the Foggy Cityscapes dataset, surpassing the previous state-of-the-art by 1.5%. It is worth noting that our proposed method is also applicable to various paradigms of domain adaptive object detection. The code is available at:https://github.com/aiiu-lab/BlenDA ",

    "abstract": "State-of-the-art video object detection methods maintain a memory structure, either a sliding window or a memory queue, to enhance the current frame using attention mechanisms. However, we argue that these memory structures are not efficient or sufficient because of two implied operations: (1) concatenating all features in memory for enhancement, leading to a heavy computational cost; (2) frame-wise memory updating, preventing the memory from capturing more temporal information. In this paper, we propose a multi-level aggregation architecture via memory bank called MAMBA. Specifically, our memory bank employs two novel operations to eliminate the disadvantages of existing methods: (1) light-weight key-set construction which can significantly reduce the computational cost; (2) fine-grained feature-wise updating strategy which enables our method to utilize knowledge from the whole video. To better enhance features from complementary levels, i.e., feature maps and proposals, we further propose a generalized enhancement operation (GEO) to aggregate multi-level features in a unified manner. We conduct extensive evaluations on the challenging ImageNetVID dataset. Compared with existing state-of-the-art methods, our method achieves superior performance in terms of both speed and accuracy. More remarkably, MAMBA achieves mAP of 83.7/84.6% at 12.6/9.1 FPS with ResNet-101. Code is available at https://github.com/guanxiongsun/video_feature_enhancement. ",

However, existing adversarial attack methods, which are primarily designed for homogeneous graphs, fall short when applied to HGNNs due to their limited ability to address the structural and semantic complexity of HGNNs. This paper introduces HGAttack, the first dedicated gray box evasion attack method for heterogeneous graphs. We design a novel surrogate model to closely resemble the behaviors of the target HGNN and utilize gradient-based methods for perturbation generation. Specifically, the proposed surrogate model effectively leverages heterogeneous information by extracting meta-path induced subgraphs and applying GNNs to learn node embeddings with distinct semantics from each subgraph. This approach improves the transferability of generated attacks on the target HGNN and significantly reduces memory costs. For perturbation generation, we introduce a semantics-aware mechanism that leverages subgraph gradient information to autonomously identify vulnerable edges across a wide range of relations within a constrained perturbation budget. We validate HGAttack's efficacy with comprehensive experiments on three datasets, providing empirical analyses of its generated perturbations. Outperforming baseline methods, HGAttack demonstrated significant efficacy in diminishing the performance of target HGNN models, affirming the effectiveness of our approach in evaluating the robustness of HGNNs against adversarial attacks.

Through a spectral lens, we investigate the interplay between graph properties, their augmentation, and their spectral behavior, and found that keeping the low-frequency eigenvalues unchanged can preserve the critical properties at a large scale when generating augmented graphs. These observations inform our introduction of the Dual-Prism (DP) augmentation method, comprising DP-Noise and DP-Mask, which adeptly retains essential graph properties while diversifying augmented graphs.

    "abstract": "This paper considers the problem of co-synthesis in $k$-player games over a finite graph where each player has an individual $\\omega$-regular specification $\\phi_i$. In this context, a secure equilibrium (SE) is a Nash equilibrium w.r.t. the lexicographically ordered objectives of each player to first satisfy their own specification, and second, to falsify other players' specifications. A winning secure equilibrium (WSE) is an SE strategy profile $(\\pi_i)_{i\\in[1;k]}$ that ensures the specification $\\phi:=\\bigwedge_{i\\in[1;k]}\\phi_i$ if no player deviates from their strategy $\\pi_i$. Distributed implementations generated from a WSE make components act rationally by ensuring that a deviation from the WSE strategy profile is immediately punished by a retaliating strategy that makes the involved players lose. In this paper, we move from deviation punishment in WSE-based implementations to a distributed, assume-guarantee based realization of WSE. This shift is obtained by generalizing WSE from strategy profiles to specification profiles $(\\varphi_i)_{i\\in[1;k]}$ with $\\bigwedge_{i\\in[1;k]}\\varphi_i = \\phi$, which we call most general winning secure equilibria (GWSE). Such GWSE have the property that each player can individually pick a strategy $\\pi_i$ winning for $\\varphi_i$ (against all other players) and all resulting strategy profiles $(\\pi_i)_{i\\in[1;k]}$ are guaranteed to be a WSE. The obtained flexibility in players' strategy choices can be utilized for robustness and adaptability of local implementations. Concretely, our contribution is three-fold: (1) we formalize GWSE for $k$-player games over finite graphs, where each player has an $\\omega$-regular specification $\\phi_i$; (2) we devise an iterative semi-algorithm for GWSE synthesis in such games, and (3) obtain an exponential-time algorithm for GWSE synthesis with parity specifications $\\phi_i$.

    "abstract": "Leveraging recent advancements in large language models, modern neural code completion models have demonstrated the capability to generate highly accurate code suggestions. However, their massive size poses challenges in terms of computational costs and environmental impact, hindering their widespread adoption in practical scenarios. Dynamic inference emerges as a promising solution, as it allocates minimal computation during inference while maintaining the model's performance. In this research, we explore dynamic inference within the context of code completion. Initially, we conducted an empirical investigation on GPT-2, focusing on the inference capabilities of intermediate layers for code completion. We found that 54.4% of tokens can be accurately generated using just the first layer, signifying significant computational savings potential. Moreover, despite using all layers, the model still fails to predict 14.5% of tokens correctly, and the subsequent completions continued from them are rarely considered helpful, with only a 4.2% Acceptance Rate. These findings motivate our exploration of dynamic inference in code completion and inspire us to enhance it with a decision-making mechanism that stops the generation of incorrect code. We thus propose a novel dynamic inference method specifically tailored for code completion models. This method aims not only to produce correct predictions with largely reduced computation but also to prevent incorrect predictions proactively. Our extensive evaluation shows that it can averagely skip 1.7 layers out of 16 layers in the models, leading to an 11.2% speedup with only a marginal 1.1% reduction in ROUGE-L. ",

However, it can be computationally expensive. Hence, data-driven machine learning models have been applied to predict the mean-field response of a polycrystal representative volume element to reduce computation time. In this work, we proposed a novel Deep Operator Network (DeepONet) architecture for predicting microstructure stress-strain response. It employs a convolutional neural network in the trunk to encode the microstructure. To account for different material properties, boundary conditions, and loading, we proposed using single crystal stress-strain curves as inputs to the branch network, furnishing a material-response-informed DeepONet. Using four numerical examples, we demonstrate that the current DeepONet can be trained on a single material and loading and then generalized to new conditions via transfer learning. Results show that using single crystal responses as input outperforms a similar model using material properties as inputs and overcomes limitations with changing boundary conditions and temporal resolution. In all cases, the new model achieved a $R^2$ value of above 0.99, and over 95\\% of predicted stresses have a relative error of $\\le$ 5\\%, indicating superior accuracy. With as few as 20 new data points and under 1min training time, the trained DeepONet can be fine-tuned to generate accurate predictions on different materials and loading.

Meanwhile, EA can not only provide an optimization framework for LLM's further enhancement under black-box settings but also empower LLM with flexible global search and iterative mechanism in applications.

To tackle this issue, we propose a novel cross-modal fusion network (CMFN) for irregular scene text recognition, which incorporates visual cues into the semantic mining process. Specifically, CMFN consists of a position self-enhanced encoder, a visual recognition branch and an iterative semantic recognition branch. The position self-enhanced encoder provides character sequence position encoding for both the visual recognition branch and the iterative semantic recognition branch. The visual recognition branch carries out visual recognition based on the visual features extracted by CNN and the position encoding information provided by the position self-enhanced encoder. The iterative semantic recognition branch, which consists of a language recognition module and a cross-modal fusion gate, simulates the way that human recognizes scene text and integrates cross-modal visual cues for text recognition.

    "abstract": "Antonyms vs synonyms distinction is a core challenge in lexico-semantic analysis and automated lexical resource construction. These pairs share a similar distributional context which makes it harder to distinguish them. Leading research in this regard attempts to capture the properties of the relation pairs, i.e., symmetry, transitivity, and trans-transitivity. However, the inability of existing research to appropriately model the relation-specific properties limits their end performance. In this paper, we propose InterlaCed Encoder NETworks (i.e., ICE-NET) for antonym vs synonym distinction, that aim to capture and model the relation-specific properties of the antonyms and synonyms pairs in order to perform the classification task in a performance-enhanced manner. Experimental evaluation using the benchmark datasets shows that ICE-NET outperforms the existing research by a relative score of upto 1.8% in F1-measure. We release the codes for ICE-NET at https://github.com/asif6827/ICENET. ",

    "abstract": "While deep neural networks have achieved remarkable performance, data augmentation has emerged as a crucial strategy to mitigate overfitting and enhance network performance. These techniques hold particular significance in industrial manufacturing contexts. Recently, image mixing-based methods have been introduced, exhibiting improved performance on public benchmark datasets. However, their application to industrial tasks remains challenging. The manufacturing environment generates massive amounts of unlabeled data on a daily basis, with only a few instances of abnormal data occurrences. This leads to severe data imbalance. Thus, creating well-balanced datasets is not straightforward due to the high costs associated with labeling. Nonetheless, this is a crucial step for enhancing productivity. For this reason, we introduce ContextMix, a method tailored for industrial applications and benchmark datasets. ContextMix generates novel data by resizing entire images and integrating them into other images within the batch. This approach enables our method to learn discriminative features based on varying sizes from resized images and train informative secondary features for object recognition using occluded images. With the minimal additional computation cost of image resizing, ContextMix enhances performance compared to existing augmentation techniques. We evaluate its effectiveness across classification, detection, and segmentation tasks using various network architectures on public benchmark datasets. Our proposed method demonstrates improved results across a range of robustness tasks. Its efficacy in real industrial environments is particularly noteworthy, as demonstrated using the passive component dataset. ",

Among the multiple types of reasoning, conditional reasoning, the ability to draw different conclusions depending on some condition, has been understudied in large language models (LLMs). Recent prompting methods, such as chain of thought, have significantly improved LLMs on reasoning tasks. Nevertheless, there is still little understanding of what triggers reasoning abilities in LLMs. We hypothesize that code prompts can trigger conditional reasoning in LLMs trained on text and code. We propose a chain of prompts that transforms a natural language problem into code and prompts the LLM with the generated code. Our experiments find that code prompts exhibit a performance boost between 2.6 and 7.7 points on GPT 3.5 across multiple datasets requiring conditional reasoning. We then conduct experiments to discover how code prompts elicit conditional reasoning abilities and through which features. We observe that prompts need to contain natural language text accompanied by high-quality code that closely represents the semantics of the instance text. Furthermore, we show that code prompts are more efficient, requiring fewer demonstrations, and that they trigger superior state tracking of variables or key entities. ",

    "abstract": "In recent years, there has been significant research focusing on addressing security concerns in single-modal person re-identification (ReID) systems that are based on RGB images. However, the safety of cross-modality scenarios, which are more commonly encountered in practical applications involving images captured by infrared cameras, has not received adequate attention. The main challenge in cross-modality ReID lies in effectively dealing with visual differences between different modalities. For instance, infrared images are typically grayscale, unlike visible images that contain color information. Existing attack methods have primarily focused on the characteristics of the visible image modality, overlooking the features of other modalities and the variations in data distribution among different modalities. This oversight can potentially undermine the effectiveness of these methods in image retrieval across diverse modalities. This study represents the first exploration into the security of cross-modality ReID models and proposes a universal perturbation attack specifically designed for cross-modality ReID. This attack optimizes perturbations by leveraging gradients from diverse modality data, thereby disrupting the discriminator and reinforcing the differences between modalities. We conducted experiments on two widely used cross-modality datasets, namely RegDB and SYSU, which not only demonstrated the effectiveness of our method but also provided insights for future enhancements in the robustness of cross-modality ReID systems.

Yet, teaching machines to comprehend text has not been solved in the general case. By appending one adversarial sentence to the context paragraph, past research has shown that the F1 scores from reading comprehension models drop almost in half. In this paper, I replicate past adversarial research with a new model, ELECTRA-Small, and demonstrate that the new model's F1 score drops from 83.9% to 29.2%. To improve ELECTRA-Small's resistance to this attack, I finetune the model on SQuAD v1.1 training examples with one to five adversarial sentences appended to the context paragraph. Like past research, I find that the finetuned model on one adversarial sentence does not generalize well across evaluation datasets. However, when finetuned on four or five adversarial sentences the model attains an F1 score of more than 70% on most evaluation datasets with multiple appended and prepended adversarial sentences. The results suggest that with enough examples we can make models robust to adversarial attacks. ",

    "abstract": "Existing works show that augmenting training data of neural networks using both clean and adversarial examples can enhance their generalizability under adversarial attacks. However, this training approach often leads to performance degradation on clean inputs. Additionally, it requires frequent re-training of the entire model to account for new attack types, resulting in significant and costly computations. Such limitations make adversarial training mechanisms less practical, particularly for complex Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) with millions or even billions of parameters. To overcome these challenges while still harnessing the theoretical benefits of adversarial training, this study combines two concepts: (1) adapters, which enable parameter-efficient fine-tuning, and (2) Mixup, which train NNs via convex combinations of pairs data pairs. Intuitively, we propose to fine-tune PLMs through convex combinations of non-data pairs of fine-tuned adapters, one trained with clean and another trained with adversarial examples. Our experiments show that the proposed method achieves the best trade-off between training efficiency and predictive performance, both with and without attacks compared to other baselines on a variety of downstream tasks.

To address this, we show that the recently proposed Edge Transformer, a global attention model operating on node pairs instead of nodes, has at least 3-WL expressive power. Empirically, we demonstrate that the Edge Transformer surpasses other theoretically aligned architectures regarding predictive performance while not relying on positional or structural encodings. ",

Although existing traffic prediction models often emphasize developing complex neural network structures, their accuracy has not seen improvements accordingly. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown outstanding capabilities in time series analysis. Differing from existing models, LLMs progress mainly through parameter expansion and extensive pre-training while maintaining their fundamental structures. In this paper, we propose a Spatial-Temporal Large Language Model (ST-LLM) for traffic prediction. Specifically, ST-LLM redefines the timesteps at each location as tokens and incorporates a spatial-temporal embedding module to learn the spatial location and global temporal representations of tokens. Then these representations are fused to provide each token with unified spatial and temporal information. Furthermore, we propose a novel partially frozen attention strategy of the LLM, which is designed to capture spatial-temporal dependencies for traffic prediction. Comprehensive experiments on real traffic datasets offer evidence that ST-LLM outperforms state-of-the-art models. Notably, the ST-LLM also exhibits robust performance in both few-shot and zero-shot prediction scenarios. ",

    "abstract": "Beyond 5G and 6G networks are expected to support new and challenging use cases and applications that depend on a certain level of Quality of Service (QoS) to operate smoothly. Predicting the QoS in a timely manner is of high importance, especially for safety-critical applications as in the case of vehicular communications. Although until recent years the QoS prediction has been carried out by centralized Artificial Intelligence (AI) solutions, a number of privacy, computational, and operational concerns have emerged. Alternative solutions have been surfaced (e.g. Split Learning, Federated Learning), distributing AI tasks of reduced complexity across nodes, while preserving the privacy of the data. However, new challenges rise when it comes to scalable distributed learning approaches, taking into account the heterogeneous nature of future wireless networks. The current work proposes DISTINQT, a privacy-aware distributed learning framework for QoS prediction. Our framework supports multiple heterogeneous nodes, in terms of data types and model architectures, by sharing computations across them. This, enables the incorporation of diverse knowledge into a sole learning process that will enhance the robustness and generalization capabilities of the final QoS prediction model. DISTINQT also contributes to data privacy preservation by encoding any raw input data into a non-linear latent representation before any transmission. Evaluation results showcase that our framework achieves a statistically identical performance compared to its centralized version and an average performance improvement of up to 65% against six state-of-the-art centralized baseline solutions in the Tele-Operated Driving use case.

While Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) aims to enhance transparency, black box surrogate explainers, such as Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanation (LIME) and SHapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP), are difficult to trust. The black box nature of these surrogate explainers makes the process behind explanation generation opaque and difficult to understand. To avoid this problem, one can use transparent white box algorithms such as Rule Extraction (RE). There are three types of RE algorithms: pedagogical, decompositional, and eclectic. Pedagogical methods offer fast but untrustworthy white-box explanations, while decompositional RE provides trustworthy explanations with poor scalability. This work explores eclectic rule extraction, which strikes a balance between scalability and trustworthiness. By combining techniques from pedagogical and decompositional approaches, eclectic rule extraction leverages the advantages of both, while mitigating some of their drawbacks. The proposed Hybrid X-IDS architecture features eclectic RE as a white box surrogate explainer for black box Deep Neural Networks (DNN). The presented eclectic RE algorithm extracts human-readable rules from hidden layers, facilitating explainable and trustworthy rulesets. Evaluations on UNSW-NB15 and CIC-IDS-2017 datasets demonstrate the algorithm's ability to generate rulesets with 99.9% accuracy, mimicking DNN outputs. The contributions of this work include the hybrid X-IDS architecture, the eclectic rule extraction algorithm applicable to intrusion detection datasets, and a thorough analysis of performance and explainability, demonstrating the trade-offs involved in rule extraction speed and accuracy.

Specifically, we learn a representation based on Node2Vec that encodes symmetries over mastery or skill level since, to solve a problem, it is natural that a student's strategy is likely to involve concepts in which they have gained mastery. Using this representation, we use DP-Means to group symmetric instances through a coarse-to-fine refinement of the clusters. We apply our model to learn strategies for Math learning from large-scale datasets from MATHia, a leading AIS for middle-school math learning. Our results illustrate that our approach can consistently achieve high accuracy using a small sample that is representative of the full dataset.

These systems prioritize the significance of content over sheer data volume. However, existing SemCom designs face challenges when applied to diverse computational capabilities and network conditions, particularly in time-sensitive applications. A key challenge is the assumption that diverse devices can uniformly benefit from a standard, large DL model in SemCom systems. This assumption becomes increasingly impractical, especially in high-speed, high-reliability applications such as industrial automation or critical healthcare. Therefore, this paper introduces a novel SemCom framework tailored for heterogeneous, resource-constrained edge devices and computation-intensive servers. Our approach employs dynamic knowledge distillation (KD) to customize semantic models for each device, balancing computational and communication constraints while ensuring Quality of Service (QoS). We formulate an optimization problem and develop an adaptive algorithm that iteratively refines semantic knowledge on edge devices, resulting in better models tailored to their resource profiles. This algorithm strategically adjusts the granularity of distilled knowledge, enabling devices to maintain high semantic accuracy for precise inference tasks, even under unstable network conditions. Extensive simulations demonstrate that our approach significantly reduces model complexity for edge devices, leading to better semantic extraction and achieving the desired QoS. ",

    "abstract": "The many variations of Implicit Neural Representations (INRs), where a neural network is trained as a continuous representation of a signal, have tremendous practical utility for downstream tasks including novel view synthesis, video compression, and image superresolution. Unfortunately, the inner workings of these networks are seriously under-studied. Our work, eXplaining the Implicit Neural Canvas (XINC), is a unified framework for explaining properties of INRs by examining the strength of each neuron's contribution to each output pixel. We call the aggregate of these contribution maps the Implicit Neural Canvas and we use this concept to demonstrate that the INRs which we study learn to ''see'' the frames they represent in surprising ways. For example, INRs tend to have highly distributed representations. While lacking high-level object semantics, they have a significant bias for color and edges, and are almost entirely space-agnostic. We arrive at our conclusions by examining how objects are represented across time in video INRs, using clustering to visualize similar neurons across layers and architectures, and show that this is dominated by motion. These insights demonstrate the general usefulness of our analysis framework. Our project page is available at https://namithap10.github.io/xinc. ",

    "abstract": "Foundation models encode rich representations that can be adapted to a desired task by fine-tuning on task-specific data. However, fine-tuning a model on one particular data distribution often compromises the model's original performance on other distributions. Current methods for robust fine-tuning utilize hand-crafted regularization techniques to constrain the fine-tuning process towards the base foundation model. Yet, it is hard to precisely specify what characteristics of the foundation model to retain during fine-tuning, as this depends on how the pre-training, fine-tuning, and evaluation data distributions relate to each other. We propose AutoFT, a data-driven approach for guiding foundation model fine-tuning. AutoFT optimizes fine-tuning hyperparameters to maximize performance on a small out-of-distribution (OOD) validation set. To guide fine-tuning in a granular way, AutoFT searches a highly expressive hyperparameter space that includes weight coefficients for many different losses, in addition to learning rate and weight decay values. We evaluate AutoFT on nine natural distribution shifts which include domain shifts and subpopulation shifts. Our experiments show that AutoFT significantly improves generalization to new OOD data, outperforming existing robust fine-tuning methods. Notably, AutoFT achieves new state-of-the-art performance on the WILDS-iWildCam and WILDS-FMoW benchmarks, outperforming the previous best methods by $6.0\\%$ and $1.5\\%$, respectively. ",

    "abstract": "Precipitation prediction plays a crucial role in modern agriculture and industry. However, it poses significant challenges due to the diverse patterns and dynamics in time and space, as well as the scarcity of high precipitation events. To address this challenge, we propose an ensemble learning framework that leverages multiple learners to capture the diverse patterns of precipitation distribution. Specifically, the framework consists of a precipitation predictor with multiple lightweight heads (learners) and a controller that combines the outputs from these heads. The learners and the controller are separately optimized with a proposed 3-stage training scheme. By utilizing provided satellite images, the proposed approach can effectively model the intricate rainfall patterns, especially for high precipitation events. It achieved 1st place on the core test as well as the nowcasting leaderboards of the Weather4Cast 2023 competition.

    "abstract": "The task of inferring three-dimensional molecular configurations from their two-dimensional graph representations is of critical significance in the domains of computational chemistry and the development of pharmaceuticals. It contributes fundamentally to our grasp of molecular mechanisms and interactions. The rapid evolution of machine learning, especially in the realm of deep generative networks, has catalyzed breakthroughs in the precision of such predictive modeling. Traditional methodologies typically employ a bifurcated strategy: initially estimating interatomic distances followed by sculpting the spatial molecular structure via solving a distance geometry problem. This sequential approach, however, occasionally fails to capture the intricacies of local atomic arrangements accurately, thus compromising the integrity of the resultant structural models. Addressing these deficiencies, this work introduces an avant-garde generative framework: \\method{}, which is predicated on the diffusion principles found in classical non-equilibrium thermodynamics. \\method{} envisages atoms as discrete entities and is adept at guiding the reversal of diffusion morphing a distribution of stochastic noise back into coherent molecular forms through a process akin to a Markov chain. This transformation begins with the initial representation of a molecular graph in an abstract latent space, progressing to the realization of the three-dimensional forms via an elaborate bilevel optimization scheme, tailored to respect the task's specific requirements.

This study introduces MITS-GAN, a novel approach to prevent tampering in medical images, with a specific focus on CT scans. The approach disrupts the output of the attacker's CT-GAN architecture by introducing imperceptible but yet precise perturbations. Specifically, the proposed approach involves the introduction of appropriate Gaussian noise to the input as a protective measure against various attacks. Our method aims to enhance tamper resistance, comparing favorably to existing techniques. Experimental results on a CT scan dataset demonstrate MITS-GAN's superior performance, emphasizing its ability to generate tamper-resistant images with negligible artifacts. As image tampering in medical domains poses life-threatening risks, our proactive approach contributes to the responsible and ethical use of generative models.

Comprising an encoder utilizing models like vision transformers for feature extraction and a slicer employing a learnable bilateral grid, the Slicer Network strategically refines and upsamples feature maps via a splatting-blurring-slicing process. This introduces an edge-preserving low-frequency approximation for the network outcome, effectively enlarging the effective receptive field. The enhancement not only reduces computational complexity but also boosts overall performance. Experiments across different medical imaging applications, including unsupervised and keypoints-based image registration and lesion segmentation, have verified the Slicer Network's improved accuracy and efficiency.

In this work, we examine the interplay between their width $p$ and number of layer transitions $L$ (effectively the depth $L+1$). Specifically, we assess the model expressivity in terms of its capacity to interpolate either a finite dataset $D$ comprising $N$ pairs of points or two probability measures in $\\mathbb{R}^d$ within a Wasserstein error margin $\\varepsilon>0$. Our findings reveal a balancing trade-off between $p$ and $L$, with $L$ scaling as $O(1+N/p)$ for dataset interpolation, and $L=O\\left(1+(p\\varepsilon^d)^{-1}\\right)$ for measure interpolation. In the autonomous case, where $L=0$, a separate study is required, which we undertake focusing on dataset interpolation. We address the relaxed problem of $\\varepsilon$-approximate controllability and establish an error decay of $\\varepsilon\\sim O(\\log(p)p^{-1/d})$. This decay rate is a consequence of applying a universal approximation theorem to a custom-built Lipschitz vector field that interpolates $D$. In the high-dimensional setting, we further demonstrate that $p=O(N)$ neurons are likely sufficient to achieve exact control. ",

SPRING combines ideas from the recently introduced minimum-step stochastic reconfiguration optimizer (MinSR) and the classical randomized Kaczmarz method for solving linear least-squares problems. We demonstrate that SPRING outperforms both MinSR and the popular Kronecker-Factored Approximate Curvature method (KFAC) across a number of small atoms and molecules, given that the learning rates of all methods are optimally tuned. For example, on the oxygen atom, SPRING attains chemical accuracy after forty thousand training iterations, whereas both MinSR and KFAC fail to do so even after one hundred thousand iterations. ",

However, existing methods ignore the structure information and merely utilize protein sequences.

In this paper, we propose a PTM site prediction method by Coupling of Multi-Granularity structure and Multi-Scale sequence representation, PTM-CMGMS for brevity. Specifically, multigranularity structure-aware representation learning is designed to learn neighborhood structure representations at the amino acid, atom, and whole protein granularity from AlphaFold predicted structures, followed by utilizing contrastive learning to optimize the structure representations.Additionally, multi-scale sequence representation learning is used to extract context sequence information, and motif generated by aligning all context sequences of PTM sites assists the prediction. Extensive experiments on three datasets show that PTM-CMGMS outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. ",
