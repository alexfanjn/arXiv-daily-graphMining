    "abstract": "Object detection applied to LiDAR point clouds is a relevant task in robotics, and particularly in autonomous driving. Single frame methods, predominant in the field, exploit information from individual sensor scans. Recent approaches achieve good performance, at relatively low inference time. Nevertheless, given the inherent high sparsity of LiDAR data, these methods struggle in long-range detection (e.g. 200m) which we deem to be critical in achieving safe automation. Aggregating multiple scans not only leads to a denser point cloud representation, but it also brings time-awareness to the system, and provides information about how the environment is changing. Solutions of this kind, however, are often highly problem-specific, demand careful data processing, and tend not to fulfil runtime requirements. In this context we propose TimePillars, a temporally-recurrent object detection pipeline which leverages the pillar representation of LiDAR data across time, respecting hardware integration efficiency constraints, and exploiting the diversity and long-range information of the novel Zenseact Open Dataset (ZOD). Through experimentation, we prove the benefits of having recurrency, and show how basic building blocks are enough to achieve robust and efficient results. ",

    "abstract": "Recently, prompt-tuning with pre-trained language models (PLMs) has demonstrated the significantly enhancing ability of relation extraction (RE) tasks. However, in low-resource scenarios, where the available training data is scarce, previous prompt-based methods may still perform poorly for prompt-based representation learning due to a superficial understanding of the relation. To this end, we highlight the importance of learning high-quality relation representation in low-resource scenarios for RE, and propose a novel prompt-based relation representation method, named MVRE (\\underline{M}ulti-\\underline{V}iew \\underline{R}elation \\underline{E}xtraction), to better leverage the capacity of PLMs to improve the performance of RE within the low-resource prompt-tuning paradigm. Specifically, MVRE decouples each relation into different perspectives to encompass multi-view relation representations for maximizing the likelihood during relation inference. Furthermore, we also design a Global-Local loss and a Dynamic-Initialization method for better alignment of the multi-view relation-representing virtual words, containing the semantics of relation labels during the optimization learning process and initialization. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets show that our method can achieve state-of-the-art in low-resource settings. ",

State-of-the-art methods of ConvQA often struggle with inexplicit question-answer pairs. These inputs are easy for human beings to understand given a conversation history, but hard for a machine to interpret, which can degrade ConvQA performance. To address this problem, we propose a reinforcement learning (RL) based model, CornNet, which utilizes question reformulations generated by large language models (LLMs) to improve ConvQA performance. CornNet adopts a teacher-student architecture where a teacher model learns question representations using human writing reformulations, and a student model to mimic the teacher model's output via reformulations generated by LLMs. The learned question representation is then used by an RL model to locate the correct answer in a KG. Extensive experimental results show that CornNet outperforms state-of-the-art convQA models. ",

    "abstract": "The upcoming Sixth Generation (6G) network is projected to grapple with a range of security concerns, encompassing access control, authentication, secure connections among 6G Core (6GC) entities, and trustworthiness. Classical Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), extensively deployed in Evolved Packet Core (EPC) network infrastructure, are notoriously susceptible to a variety of attacks, including man-in-the-middle incursions, Domain Name System (DNS) hijacking, Denial of Service (DoS) attacks, port scanning, and persistent unauthorized access attempts. This paper introduces the concept of Software Defined Perimeter (SDP) as an innovative solution, providing an alternative to VPNs with the goal of fostering a secure zero-trust milieu within the 6G Core networks. We capitalize on the SDP controller-based authentication and authorization mechanisms to secure the EPC network's control and data plane functions, conceiving an architecture that is expansible to the 6G network. Further, we augment the SDP zero-trust capabilities via the incorporation of a dynamic component, the Moving Target Defense (MTD). This enhances the network's resilience against attacks targeting traditionally static network environments established via VPNs. Following rigorous testbed analysis, our proposed framework manifests superior resilience against DoS and port scanning attacks when juxtaposed with traditional VPN methodologies. ",

Existing approaches to reveal learned concepts often rely on human supervision, such as pre-defined concept sets or segmentation processes. In this paper, we propose a novel unsupervised method for discovering distributed representations of concepts by selecting a principal subset of neurons. Our empirical findings demonstrate that instances with similar neuron activation states tend to share coherent concepts. Based on the observations, the proposed method selects principal neurons that construct an interpretable region, namely a Relaxed Decision Region (RDR), encompassing instances with coherent concepts in the feature space. It can be utilized to identify unlabeled subclasses within data and to detect the causes of misclassifications. Furthermore, the applicability of our method across various layers discloses distinct distributed representations over the layers, which provides deeper insights into the internal mechanisms of the deep learning model.

We validate our approach using a synthetic dataset generated with ChatGPT and DeepL, further applying it to a real-world dataset on Venezuelan actors from Twitter Transparency. Our method successfully identifies all three types of inauthentic duplicates in the synthetic dataset, and is able to uncover inauthentic duplicates across political, commercial, and entertainment contexts in the Twitter dataset. The distinct focus on clustered alterations to messages, rather than individual messages, makes our approach efficient and effective at detecting large-scale instances of textual manipulation, including AI-generated ones. Moreover, our method offers a robust tool for identifying translated content, overlooked in previous research. This research also represents the first comprehensive analysis of copy-pasta detection, providing a reliable technique for tracking duplicate textual content across social networks. ",

    "abstract": "In this article, we consider a multi-agent path planning problem in a stochastic environment. The environment, which can be an urban road network, is represented by a graph where the travel time for selected road segments (impeded edges) is a random variable because of traffic congestion. An unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) wishes to travel from a starting location to a destination while minimizing the arrival time at the destination. UGV can traverse through an impeded edge but the true travel time is only realized at the end of that edge. This implies that the UGV can potentially get stuck in an impeded edge with high travel time. A support vehicle, such as an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is simultaneously deployed from its starting position to assist the UGV by inspecting and realizing the true cost of impeded edges. With the updated information from UAV, UGV can efficiently reroute its path to the destination. The UGV does not wait at any time until it reaches the destination. The UAV is permitted to terminate its path at any vertex. The goal is then to develop an online algorithm to determine efficient paths for the UGV and the UAV based on the current information so that the UGV reaches the destination in minimum time. We refer to this problem as Stochastic Assisted Path Planning (SAPP). We present Dynamic $k$-Shortest Path Planning (D*KSPP) algorithm for the UGV planning and Rural Postman Problem (RPP) formulation for the UAV planning. Due to the scalability challenges of RPP, we also present a heuristic based Priority Assignment Algorithm (PAA) for the UAV planning. Computational results are presented to corroborate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm to solve SAPP. ",

In essence, STanHop sequentially learn temporal representation and cross-series representation using two tandem sparse Hopfield layers. In addition, StanHop incorporates two additional external memory modules: a Plug-and-Play module and a Tune-and-Play module for train-less and task-aware memory-enhancements, respectively. They allow StanHop-Net to swiftly respond to certain sudden events. Methodologically, we construct the StanHop-Net by stacking STanHop blocks in a hierarchical fashion, enabling multi-resolution feature extraction with resolution-specific sparsity. Theoretically, we introduce a sparse extension of the modern Hopfield model (Generalized Sparse Modern Hopfield Model) and show that it endows a tighter memory retrieval error compared to the dense counterpart without sacrificing memory capacity.

    "abstract": "Network epidemic simulation holds the promise of enabling fine-grained understanding of epidemic behavior, beyond that which is possible with coarse-grained compartmental models. Key inputs to these epidemic simulations are the networks themselves. However, empirical measurements and samples of realistic interaction networks typically display properties that are challenging to capture with popular synthetic models of networks. Our empirical results show that epidemic spread behavior is very sensitive to a subtle but ubiquitous form of multi-scale local structure that is not present in common baseline models, including (but not limited to) uniform random graph models (Erdos-Renyi), random configuration models (Chung-Lu), etc. Such structure is not necessary to reproduce very simple network statistics, such as degree distributions or triangle closing probabilities. However, we show that this multi-scale local structure impacts, critically, the behavior of more complex network properties, in particular the effect of interventions such as quarantining; and it enables epidemic spread to be halted in realistic interaction networks, even when it cannot be halted in simple synthetic models. Key insights from our analysis include how epidemics on networks with widespread multi-scale local structure are easier to mitigate, as well as characterizing which nodes are ultimately not likely to be infected. We demonstrate that this structure results from more than just local triangle structure in the network, and we illustrate processes based on homophily or social influence and random walks that suggest how this multi-scale local structure arises.

We demonstrate the versatility of Seqnature by using it to implement five different fingerprinting techniques, as special cases of the framework, which broadly fall into two categories: (i) fingerprinting techniques that consider features of each individual packet in a packet sequence, e.g., size and direction; and (ii) fingerprinting techniques that only consider stream-wide features, specifically what Internet endpoints are contacted. We illustrate how Seqnature facilitates comparisons of the relative performance of different fingerprinting techniques by applying the five fingerprinting techniques to datasets from the literature. The results confirm findings in prior work, for example that endpoint information alone is insufficient to differentiate between individual events on Internet of Things devices, but also show that smart TV app fingerprints based exclusively on endpoint information are not as distinct as previously reported.

Regret is the difference in cost obtained by a causal controller and a clairvoyant controller with access to future disturbances. We focus on the infinite-horizon framework, which results in stability guarantees. In this DR setting, the probability distribution of the disturbances resides within a Wasserstein-2 ambiguity set centered at a specified nominal distribution. Our objective is to identify a control policy that minimizes the worst-case expected regret over an infinite horizon, considering all potential disturbance distributions within the ambiguity set. In contrast to prior works, which assume time-independent disturbances, we relax this constraint to allow for time-correlated disturbances, thus actual distributional robustness. While we show that the resulting optimal controller is non-rational and lacks a finite-dimensional state-space realization, we demonstrate that it can still be uniquely characterized by a finite dimensional parameter. Exploiting this fact, we introduce an efficient numerical method to compute the controller in the frequency domain using fixed-point iterations. This method circumvents the computational bottleneck associated with the finite-horizon problem, where the semi-definite programming (SDP) solution dimension scales with the time horizon. Numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and performance of our framework. ",

What triggers an accident can be dependent on several subjective parameters and varies within each region, city, or country. In the same way, it is important to understand those parameters in order to provide a knowledge basis to support decisions regarding future cases prevention. The literature presents several works where machine learning algorithms are used for prediction of accidents or severity of accidents, in which city-level datasets were used as evaluation studies. This work attempts to add to the diversity of research, by focusing mainly on concentration of accidents and how machine learning can be used to predict hotspots. This approach demonstrated to be a useful technique for authorities to understand nuances of accident concentration behavior. For the first time, data from the Federal District of Brazil collected from forensic traffic accident analysts were used and combined with data from local weather conditions to predict hotspots of collisions. Out of the five algorithms we considered, two had good performance: Multi-layer Perceptron and Random Forest, with the latter being the best one at 98% accuracy. As a result, we identify that weather parameters are not as important as the accident location, demonstrating that local intervention is important to reduce the number of accidents. ",

DiGress is a recent diffusion model for molecular graphs whose distinctive feature is allowing property targeting through classifier-based (CB) guidance. While CB guidance may work to generate molecular-like graphs, we hint at the fact that its assumptions apply poorly to the chemical domain. Based on this insight we propose a classifier-free DiGress (FreeGress), which works by directly injecting the conditioning information into the training process. CF guidance is convenient given its less stringent assumptions and since it does not require to train an auxiliary property regressor, thus halving the number of trainable parameters in the model. We empirically show that our model yields up to 79% improvement in Mean Absolute Error with respect to DiGress on property targeting tasks on QM9 and ZINC-250k benchmarks. As an additional contribution, we propose a simple yet powerful approach to improve chemical validity of generated samples, based on the observation that certain chemical properties such as molecular weight correlate with the number of atoms in molecules.

We propose a new method, Generative Posterior Networks (GPNs), that uses unlabeled data to estimate epistemic uncertainty in high-dimensional problems. A GPN is a generative model that, given a prior distribution over functions, approximates the posterior distribution directly by regularizing the network towards samples from the prior. We prove theoretically that our method indeed approximates the Bayesian posterior and show empirically that it improves epistemic uncertainty estimation and scalability over competing methods. ",

Furthermore, they typically involve a two-stage process with significant computational costs, starting with pre-training a model for data transfer, followed by training from scratch using transferred labels. Thus, we introduce a plug-and-play method named CITrans, which iteratively trains SGG models with progressively enhanced data. First, we introduce Context-Restricted Transfer (CRT), which imposes subject-object constraints within predicates' semantic space to achieve fine-grained data transfer. Subsequently, Efficient Iterative Learning (EIL) iteratively trains models and progressively generates enhanced labels which are consistent with model's learning state, thereby accelerating the training process. Finally, extensive experiments show that CITrans achieves state-of-the-art and results with high efficiency. ",

However, due to the huge cost of multi-temporal images acquisition and labeling, existing change detection datasets are small in quantity, short in temporal, and low in practicability. Therefore, a large-scale practical-oriented dataset covering wide temporal phases is urgently needed to facilitate the community. To this end, the ChangeNet dataset is presented especially for multi-temporal change detection, along with the new task of ``Asymmetric Change Detection\". Specifically, ChangeNet consists of 31,000 multi-temporal images pairs, a wide range of complex scenes from 100 cities, and 6 pixel-level annotated categories, which is far superior to all the existing change detection datasets including LEVIR-CD, WHU Building CD, etc.. In addition, ChangeNet contains amounts of real-world perspective distortions in different temporal phases on the same areas, which is able to promote the practical application of change detection algorithms. The ChangeNet dataset is suitable for both binary change detection (BCD) and semantic change detection (SCD) tasks. Accordingly, we benchmark the ChangeNet dataset on six BCD methods and two SCD methods, and extensive experiments demonstrate its challenges and great significance.

However, the conspicuous patterns on these patches may draw more attention and raise suspicions among humans. Moreover, existing works have primarily focused on the attack performance of individual models and have neglected the generation of adversarial patches for ensemble attacks on multiple object detection models. To tackle these concerns, we propose a novel approach referred to as the More Vivid Patch (MVPatch), which aims to improve the transferability and stealthiness of adversarial patches while considering the limitations observed in prior paradigms, such as easy identification and poor transferability. Our approach incorporates an attack algorithm that decreases object confidence scores of multiple object detectors by using the ensemble attack loss function, thereby enhancing the transferability of adversarial patches. Additionally, we propose a lightweight visual similarity measurement algorithm realized by the Compared Specified Image Similarity (CSS) loss function, which allows for the generation of natural and stealthy adversarial patches without the reliance on additional generative models. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed MVPatch algorithm achieves superior attack transferability compared to similar algorithms in both digital and physical domains, while also exhibiting a more natural appearance. These findings emphasize the remarkable stealthiness and transferability of the proposed MVPatch attack algorithm. ",

However, insufficient training signal data in complicated channel environments and large-scale DL models are critical factors that make DL methods difficult to deploy in practice. Aiming to these problems, we propose a novel neural network named convolution-linked signal transformer (ClST) and a novel knowledge distillation method named signal knowledge distillation (SKD). The ClST is accomplished through three primary modifications: a hierarchy of transformer containing convolution, a novel attention mechanism named parallel spatial-channel attention (PSCA) mechanism and a novel convolutional transformer block named convolution-transformer projection (CTP) to leverage a convolutional projection. The SKD is a knowledge distillation method to effectively reduce the parameters and complexity of neural networks. We train two lightweight neural networks using the SKD algorithm, KD-CNN and KD-MobileNet, to meet the demand that neural networks can be used on miniaturized devices. The simulation results demonstrate that the ClST outperforms advanced neural networks on all datasets. Moreover, both KD-CNN and KD-MobileNet obtain higher recognition accuracy with less network complexity, which is very beneficial for the deployment of AMR on miniaturized communication devices. ",

    "abstract": "Accurately predicting molecular properties is a challenging but essential task in drug discovery. Recently, many mono-modal deep learning methods have been successfully applied to molecular property prediction. However, the inherent limitation of mono-modal learning arises from relying solely on one modality of molecular representation, which restricts a comprehensive understanding of drug molecules and hampers their resilience against data noise. To overcome the limitations, we construct multimodal deep learning models to cover different molecular representations. We convert drug molecules into three molecular representations, SMILES-encoded vectors, ECFP fingerprints, and molecular graphs. To process the modal information, Transformer-Encoder, bi-directional gated recurrent units (BiGRU), and graph convolutional network (GCN) are utilized for feature learning respectively, which can enhance the model capability to acquire complementary and naturally occurring bioinformatics information. We evaluated our triple-modal model on six molecule datasets. Different from bi-modal learning models, we adopt five fusion methods to capture the specific features and leverage the contribution of each modal information better. Compared with mono-modal models, our multimodal fused deep learning (MMFDL) models outperform single models in accuracy, reliability, and resistance capability against noise. Moreover, we demonstrate its generalization ability in the prediction of binding constants for protein-ligand complex molecules in the refined set of PDBbind. The advantage of the multimodal model lies in its ability to process diverse sources of data using proper models and suitable fusion methods, which would enhance the noise resistance of the model while obtaining data diversity.

In multi-hop MANETs, some nodes lack direct links to base anchors, depending on neighbor nodes as dynamic anchors for chain localization. However, the dynamic nature of MANETs challenges TOA's robustness due to the availability and accuracy of base anchors, coupled with ranging errors. To address the issue of cascading positioning error divergence, we first derive the CRLB for any primary node in MANETs as a metric to tackle localization error in cascading scenarios. Second, we propose an advanced two-step TOA method based on CRLB which is able to approximate target node's CRLB with only local neighbor information. Finally, simulation results confirm the robustness of our algorithm, achieving CRLB-level accuracy for small ranging errors and maintaining precision for larger errors compared to existing TOA methods.

The set of non-dominated forecast models identified by the algorithm is then utilized to construct a meta-model through stacking-based ensemble learning. Furthermore, our proposed method provides an avenue for attribute importance determination, as the frequency of selection for each attribute in the set of non-dominated forecasting models reflects their significance. This attribute importance insight adds an interpretable dimension to the forecasting process. Experimental evaluations on air quality time series data from Italy and southeast Spain demonstrate that our method substantially improves the generalization ability of conventional LSTMs, effectively reducing overfitting.

    "abstract": "Small-signal synchronization instability (SSI) may be triggered when a grid-connected converter is operated in weak grids. This problem is highly related to the active and reactive power (referred to as complex power) generation or consumption of the converter. Such an instability phenomenon manifests as power oscillations within the bandwidth frequency of phase-locked loop (PLL). However, in a multi-converter power system (MCPS), it is challenging to characterize the role of each converter's complex power in SSI issues due to the high dimension of system dynamics. In this paper, we focus on the impact regularity of complex power on the small-signal synchronization stability of the MCPS. Firstly, we formulate the modeling of the MCPS and develop a systematical stability indicator to explicitly quantify the stability margin under various operating complex power. Then, based on the proposed stability indicator, the \"resultant force\" of complex power on the stability margin of the MCPS can be analytically characterized into a weighted summation form. Furthermore, we elaborate on the impact of each converter's active power and reactive power, respectively. Notably, we demonstrate the cancellation effect between the active power generation and consumption on the stability margin, which ultimately helps prevent SSI issues in the MCPS. The correctness of theoretical findings is well verified by simulations results. ",

In this paper, we propose a distance guided GAN (DisGAN) which controls the variation degrees of generated samples in the hyperplane space. Specifically, we instantiate the idea of DisGAN by combining two ways. The first way is vertical distance GAN (VerDisGAN) where the inter-domain generation is conditioned on the vertical distances. The second way is horizontal distance GAN (HorDisGAN) where the intra-domain generation is conditioned on the horizontal distances. Furthermore, VerDisGAN can produce the class-specific regions by mapping the source images to the hyperplane. Experimental results show that DisGAN consistently outperforms the GAN-based augmentation methods with explainable binary classification. The proposed method can apply to different classification architectures and has potential to extend to multi-class classification. ",

But the most effective and efficient existing solutions feature two reduction operations, which constitutes an important factor of termination delay. In this paper, we present new, non-intrusive, protocols to compute a residual error under asynchronous iterations, requiring only one reduction operation.

Different machine learning algorithms such as Linear Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Tree, and Gradient Boosting were compared using the evaluation metrics Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and the Coefficient of Determination ($R^2$). The study revealed that Gradient Boosting Regressor exhibited superior performance, closely followed by the Random Forest Regressor. These models effectively captured the non-linear patterns in solar radiation, as evidenced by their low MSE and high $R^2$ values. With the aim of assess the performance of our ML models, we developed a web-based tool for the Solar Radiation Forecasting in the UTEQ available at this http URL The results obtained demonstrate the effectiveness of our ML models in solar radiation prediction and contribute a practical utility in real-time solar radiation forecasting, aiding in efficient solar energy management.

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are attracting significant research attention due to their instruction-following abilities, allowing users and developers to leverage LLMs for a variety of tasks. However, LLMs are vulnerable to prompt-injection attacks: a class of attacks that hijack the model's instruction-following abilities, changing responses to prompts to undesired, possibly malicious ones. In this work, we introduce Jatmo, a method for generating task-specific models resilient to prompt-injection attacks. Jatmo leverages the fact that LLMs can only follow instructions once they have undergone instruction tuning. It harnesses a teacher instruction-tuned model to generate a task-specific dataset, which is then used to fine-tune a base model (i.e., a non-instruction-tuned model). Jatmo only needs a task prompt and a dataset of inputs for the task: it uses the teacher model to generate outputs. For situations with no pre-existing datasets, Jatmo can use a single example, or in some cases none at all, to produce a fully synthetic dataset. Our experiments on six tasks show that Jatmo models provide the same quality of outputs on their specific task as standard LLMs, while being resilient to prompt injections. The best attacks succeeded in less than 0.5% of cases against our models, versus over 90% success rate against GPT-3.5-Turbo. We release Jatmo at https://github.com/wagner-group/prompt-injection-defense. ",

    "abstract": "Task scheduling as an effective strategy can improve application performance on computing resource-limited devices over distributed networks. However, existing evaluation mechanisms fail to depict the complexity of diverse applications, which involve dependencies among tasks, computing resource requirements, and multi-dimensional quality of service (QoS) constraints. Furthermore, traditional QoS-oriented task scheduling strategies struggle to meet the performance requirements without considering differences in satisfaction and acceptance of application, leading application failures and resource wastage. To tackle these issues, a quality of experience (QoE) cost model is designed to evaluate application completion, depicting the relationship among application satisfaction, communications, and computing resources in the distributed networks. Specifically, considering the sensitivity and preference of QoS, we model the different dimensional QoS degradation cost functions for dependent tasks, which are then integrated into the QoE cost model. Based on the QoE model, the dependent task scheduling problem is formulated as the minimization of overall QoE cost, aiming to improve the application performance in the distributed networks, which is proven Np-hard. Moreover, a heuristic Hierarchical Multi-queue Task Scheduling Algorithm (HMTSA) is proposed to address the QoE-oriented task scheduling problem among multiple dependent tasks, which utilizes hierarchical multiple queues to determine the optimal task execution order and location according to different dimensional QoS priorities. Finally, extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can significantly improve the satisfaction of applications. ",

    "abstract": "Graph outlier detection is a prominent task of research and application in the realm of graph neural networks. It identifies the outlier nodes that exhibit deviation from the majority in the graph. One of the fundamental challenges confronting supervised graph outlier detection algorithms is the prevalent issue of class imbalance, where the scarcity of outlier instances compared to normal instances often results in suboptimal performance. Conventional methods mitigate the imbalance by reweighting instances in the estimation of the loss function, assigning higher weights to outliers and lower weights to inliers. Nonetheless, these strategies are prone to overfitting and underfitting, respectively. Recently, generative models, especially diffusion models, have demonstrated their efficacy in synthesizing high-fidelity images. Despite their extraordinary generation quality, their potential in data augmentation for supervised graph outlier detection remains largely underexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce GODM, a novel data augmentation for mitigating class imbalance in supervised Graph Outlier detection with latent Diffusion Models. Specifically, our proposed method consists of three key components: (1) Variantioanl Encoder maps the heterogeneous information inherent within the graph data into a unified latent space. (2) Graph Generator synthesizes graph data that are statistically similar to real outliers from latent space, and (3) Latent Diffusion Model learns the latent space distribution of real organic data by iterative denoising. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple datasets substantiate the effectiveness and efficiency of GODM. The case study further demonstrated the generation quality of our synthetic data. To foster accessibility and reproducibility, we encapsulate GODM into a plug-and-play package and release it at the Python Package Index (PyPI). ",

The physics-based knowledge is constructed from the branch current formulation, making the approach adaptable to both transmission and distribution systems.

    "abstract": "Sparse-view CT is a promising strategy for reducing the radiation dose of traditional CT scans, but reconstructing high-quality images from incomplete and noisy data is challenging. Recently, 3D Gaussian has been applied to model complex natural scenes, demonstrating fast convergence and better rendering of novel views compared to implicit neural representations (INRs). Taking inspiration from the successful application of 3D Gaussians in natural scene modeling and novel view synthesis, we investigate their potential for sparse-view CT reconstruction. We leverage prior information from the filtered-backprojection reconstructed image to initialize the Gaussians; and update their parameters via comparing difference in the projection space. Performance is further enhanced by adaptive density control. Compared to INRs, 3D Gaussians benefit more from prior information to explicitly bypass learning in void spaces and allocate the capacity efficiently, accelerating convergence. 3D Gaussians also efficiently learn high-frequency details. Trained in a self-supervised manner, 3D Gaussians avoid the need for large-scale paired data. Our experiments on the AAPM-Mayo dataset demonstrate that 3D Gaussians can provide superior performance compared to INR-based methods. This work is in progress, and the code will be publicly available. ",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease is a neurological condition that occurs in nearly 1% of the world's population. The disease is manifested by a drop in dopamine production, symptoms are cognitive and behavioural and include a wide range of personality changes, depressive disorders, memory problems, and emotional dysregulation, which can occur as the disease progresses. Early diagnosis and accurate staging of the disease are essential to apply the appropriate therapeutic approaches to slow cognitive and motor decline. Currently, there is not a single blood test or biomarker available to diagnose Parkinson's disease. Magnetic resonance imaging has been used for the past three decades to diagnose and distinguish between PD and other neurological conditions. However, in recent years new possibilities have arisen: several AI algorithms have been developed to increase the precision and accuracy of differential diagnosis of PD at an early stage. To our knowledge, no AI tools have been designed to identify the stage of progression. This paper aims to fill this gap. Using the \"Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative\" dataset, which reports the patient's MRI and an indication of the disease stage, we developed a model to identify the level of progression. The images and the associated scores were used for training and assessing different deep-learning models. Our analysis distinguished four distinct disease progression levels based on a standard scale (Hoehn and Yah scale). The final architecture consists of the cascading of a 3DCNN network, adopted to reduce and extract the spatial characteristics of the RMI for efficient training of the successive LSTM layers, aiming at modelling the temporal dependencies among the data. Our results show that the proposed 3DCNN + LSTM model achieves state-of-the-art results by classifying the elements with 91.90\\% as macro averaged OVR AUC on four classes ",

In systems biology, they became useful tools to study the dynamical characteristics of large-scale biomolecular networks and there have been a number of studies to develop efficient ways of finding steady states or cycles of Boolean network models. On the other hand, there has been little attention to analyzing the dynamic properties of the network structure itself. Here, we present a systematic way to study such properties by introducing a recursive self-composite of the logic update rules. Of note, we found that all Boolean update rules actually have repeated logic structures underneath. This repeated nature of Boolean networks reveals interesting algebraic properties embedded in the networks. We found that each converged logic leads to the same states, called kernel states. As a result, the longest-length period of states cycle turns out to be equal to the number of converged logics in the logic cycle. Based on this, we propose a leaping and filling algorithm to avoid any possible large string explosions during the self-composition procedures. Finally, we demonstrate how the proposed approach can be used to reveal interesting hidden properties using Boolean network examples of a simple network with a long feedback structure, a T-cell receptor network and a cancer network.

The formation process of these sub-Earths remains elusive, and acquiring additional samples is essential for investigating this unique population. In our study, we employ a novel GPU Phase Folding algorithm combined with a Convolutional Neural Network, termed the GPFC method, on Kepler photometry data. This method enhances the transit search speed significantly over the traditional Box-fitting Least Squares method, allowing a complete search of the known KOI photometry data within hours using a commercial GPU card. To date, we have identified five promising sub-Earth short-period candidates: K00446.c, K01821.b, K01522.c, K03404.b, and K04978.b. A closer analysis reveals the following characteristics: K00446.c orbits a K dwarf on a 0.645091-day period. With a radius of $0.461R_\\oplus$, it ranks as the second smallest USP discovered to date. K01821.b is a sub-Earth with a radius of $0.648R_\\oplus$, orbiting a G dwarf over a 0.91978-day period. It is the second smallest USP among all confirmed USPs orbiting G dwarfs in the NASA Archive. K01522.c has a radius of $0.704 R_\\oplus$ and completes an orbit around a Sun-like G dwarf in 0.64672 days; K03404.b, with a radius of $0.738 R_\\oplus$, orbits a G dwarf on a 0.68074-day period; and K04978.b, with its planetary radius of $0.912 R_\\oplus$, orbits a G dwarf, completing an orbit every 0.94197 days. Three of our finds, K01821.b, K01522.c and K03404.b, rank as the smallest planets among all confirmed USPs orbiting G dwarfs in the Kepler dataset.

In several scenarios, including classical, we find multiplicative converse bounds. However, this is not always the case. Even for simple noise such as qubit dephasing or depolarizing, mutual information may fall by an unbounded factor under arbitrarily weak noise.

    "abstract": "Predicting the outcome of antiretroviral therapies for HIV-1 is a pressing clinical challenge, especially when the treatment regimen includes drugs for which limited effectiveness data is available. This scarcity of data can arise either due to the introduction of a new drug to the market or due to limited use in clinical settings. To tackle this issue, we introduce a novel joint fusion model, which combines features from a Fully Connected (FC) Neural Network and a Graph Neural Network (GNN). The FC network employs tabular data with a feature vector made up of viral mutations identified in the most recent genotypic resistance test, along with the drugs used in therapy. Conversely, the GNN leverages knowledge derived from Stanford drug-resistance mutation tables, which serve as benchmark references for deducing in-vivo treatment efficacy based on the viral genetic sequence, to build informative graphs. We evaluated these models' robustness against Out-of-Distribution drugs in the test set, with a specific focus on the GNN's role in handling such scenarios. Our comprehensive analysis demonstrates that the proposed model consistently outperforms the FC model, especially when considering Out-of-Distribution drugs. These results underscore the advantage of integrating Stanford scores in the model, thereby enhancing its generalizability and robustness, but also extending its utility in real-world applications with limited data availability. This research highlights the potential of our approach to inform antiretroviral therapy outcome prediction and contribute to more informed clinical decisions. ",

    "abstract": "The early detection of breast abnormalities is a matter of critical significance. Notably, infrared thermography has emerged as a valuable tool in breast cancer screening and clinical breast examination (CBE). Measuring heterogeneous thermal patterns is the key to incorporating computational dynamic thermography, which can be achieved by matrix factorization techniques. These approaches focus on extracting the predominant thermal patterns from the entire thermal sequence. Yet, the task of singling out the dominant image that effectively represents the prevailing temporal changes remains a challenging pursuit within the field of computational thermography. In this context, we propose applying James-Stein for eigenvector (JSE) and Weibull embedding approaches, as two novel strategies in response to this challenge. The primary objective is to create a low-dimensional (LD) representation of the thermal data stream. This LD approximation serves as the foundation for extracting thermomics and training a classification model with optimized hyperparameters, for early breast cancer detection. Furthermore, we conduct a comparative analysis of various embedding adjuncts to matrix factorization methods. The results of the proposed method indicate an enhancement in the projection of the predominant basis vector, yielding classification accuracy of 81.7% (+/-5.2%) using Weibull embedding, which outperformed other embedding approaches we proposed previously. In comparison analysis, Sparse PCT and Deep SemiNMF showed the highest accuracies having 80.9% and 78.6%, respectively. These findings suggest that JSE and Weibull embedding techniques substantially help preserve crucial thermal patterns as a biomarker leading to improved CBE and enabling the very early detection of breast cancer.
