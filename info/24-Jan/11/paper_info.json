    "title": "Exploring Attack Resilience in Distributed Platoon Controllers with  Model Predictive Control",
    "abstract": "The extensive use of distributed vehicle platoon controllers has resulted in several benefits for transportation systems, such as increased traffic flow, fuel efficiency, and decreased pollution. The rising reliance on interconnected systems and communication networks, on the other hand, exposes these controllers to potential cyber-attacks, which may compromise their safety and functionality. This thesis aims to improve the security of distributed vehicle platoon controllers by investigating attack scenarios and assessing their influence on system performance. Various attack techniques, including man-in-the-middle (MITM) and false data injection (FDI), are simulated using Model Predictive Control (MPC) controller to identify vulnerabilities and weaknesses of the platoon controller. Countermeasures are offered and tested, that includes attack analysis and reinforced communication protocols using Machine Learning techniques for detection. The findings emphasize the significance of integrating security issues into their design and implementation, which helps to construct safe and resilient distributed platoon controllers. ",

    "abstract": "Graph clustering algorithms with autoencoder structures have recently gained popularity due to their efficient performance and low training cost. However, for existing graph autoencoder clustering algorithms based on GCN or GAT, not only do they lack good generalization ability, but also the number of clusters clustered by such autoencoder models is difficult to determine automatically. To solve this problem, we propose a new framework called Graph Clustering with Masked Autoencoders (GCMA). It employs our designed fusion autoencoder based on the graph masking method for the fusion coding of graph. It introduces our improved density-based clustering algorithm as a second decoder while decoding with multi-target reconstruction. By decoding the mask embedding, our model can capture more generalized and comprehensive knowledge. The number of clusters and clustering results can be output end-to-end while improving the generalization ability. As a nonparametric class method, extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of \\textit{GCMA} over state-of-the-art baselines. ",

Dropout-based BayNNs are increasingly implemented in spintronics-based computation-in-memory architectures for resource-constrained yet high-performance safety-critical applications. Although uncertainty estimation is important, the reliability of Dropout generation and BayNN computation is equally important for target applications but is overlooked in existing works. However, testing BayNNs is significantly more challenging compared to conventional NNs, due to their stochastic nature. In this paper, we present for the first time the model of the non-idealities of the spintronics-based Dropout module and analyze their impact on uncertainty estimates and accuracy. Furthermore, we propose a testing framework based on repeatability ranking for Dropout-based BayNN with up to $100\\%$ fault coverage while using only $0.2\\%$ of training data as test vectors. ",

    "abstract": "Fruit ripeness estimation models have for decades depended on spectral index features or colour-based features, such as mean, standard deviation, skewness, colour moments, and/or histograms for learning traits of fruit ripeness. Recently, few studies have explored the use of deep learning techniques to extract features from images of fruits with visible ripeness cues. However, the blackberry (Rubus fruticosus) fruit does not show obvious and reliable visible traits of ripeness when mature and therefore poses great difficulty to fruit pickers. The mature blackberry, to the human eye, is black before, during, and post-ripening. To address this engineering application challenge, this paper proposes a novel multi-input convolutional neural network (CNN) ensemble classifier for detecting subtle traits of ripeness in blackberry fruits. The multi-input CNN was created from a pre-trained visual geometry group 16-layer deep convolutional network (VGG16) model trained on the ImageNet dataset. The fully connected layers were optimized for learning traits of ripeness of mature blackberry fruits. The resulting model served as the base for building homogeneous ensemble learners that were ensemble using the stack generalization ensemble (SGE) framework. The input to the network is images acquired with a stereo sensor using visible and near-infrared (VIS-NIR) spectral filters at wavelengths of 700 nm and 770 nm. Through experiments, the proposed model achieved 95.1% accuracy on unseen sets and 90.2% accuracy with in-field conditions. Further experiments reveal that machine sensory is highly and positively correlated to human sensory over blackberry fruit skin texture. ",

    "abstract": "Log anomaly detection is a key component in the field of artificial intelligence for IT operations (AIOps). Considering log data of variant domains, retraining the whole network for unknown domains is inefficient in real industrial scenarios. However, previous deep models merely focused on extracting the semantics of log sequences in the same domain, leading to poor generalization on multi-domain logs. To alleviate this issue, we propose a unified Transformer-based framework for Log anomaly detection (LogFormer) to improve the generalization ability across different domains, where we establish a two-stage process including the pre-training and adapter-based tuning stage. Specifically, our model is first pre-trained on the source domain to obtain shared semantic knowledge of log data. Then, we transfer such knowledge to the target domain via shared parameters. Besides, the Log-Attention module is proposed to supplement the information ignored by the log-paring. The proposed method is evaluated on three public and one real-world datasets. Experimental results on multiple benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our LogFormer with fewer trainable parameters and lower training costs. ",

We propose an end-to-end trainable learning network (DedustNet) to solve the real-world agricultural dust removal task. To our knowledge, DedustNet is the first time Swin Transformer-based units have been used in wavelet networks for agricultural image dusting. Specifically, we present the frequency-dominated block (DWTFormer block and IDWTFormer block) by adding a spatial features aggregation scheme (SFAS) to the Swin Transformer and combining it with the wavelet transform, the DWTFormer block and IDWTFormer block, alleviating the limitation of the global receptive field of Swin Transformer when dealing with complex dusty backgrounds. Furthermore, We propose a cross-level information fusion module to fuse different levels of features and effectively capture global and long-range feature relationships. In addition, we present a dilated convolution module to capture contextual information guided by wavelet transform at multiple scales, which combines the advantages of wavelet transform and dilated convolution. Our algorithm leverages deep learning techniques to effectively remove dust from images while preserving the original structural and textural features. Compared to existing state-of-the-art methods, DedustNet achieves superior performance and more reliable results in agricultural image dedusting, providing strong support for the application of agricultural machinery in dusty environments. Additionally, the impressive performance on real-world hazy datasets and application tests highlights DedustNet superior generalization ability and computer vision-related application performance. ",

Visualization of networks facilitates conceptualizing research questions and forming scientific hypotheses. Networks, as mathematical high-dimensional objects, require dimensionality reduction for (planar) visualization. Visualizing empirical networks present additional challenges. They often contain false positive (spurious) and false negative (missing) edges. Traditional visualization methods don't account for errors in observation, potentially biasing interpretations. Moreover, contemporary network data includes rich nodal attributes. However, traditional methods neglect these attributes when computing node locations. Our visualization approach aims to leverage nodal attribute richness to compensate for network data limitations. We employ a statistical model estimating the probability of edge connections between nodes based on their covariates. We enhance the Fruchterman-Reingold algorithm to incorporate estimated dyad connection probabilities, allowing practitioners to balance reliance on observed versus estimated edges. We explore optimal smoothing levels, offering a natural way to include relevant nodal information in layouts. Results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in achieving robust network visualization, providing insights for improved analysis. ",

Deep Learning (DL) has become one of the most used techniques to perform spectrum sensing as they are capable of delivering high accuracy and reliability. However, current techniques suffer from ad-hoc implementations and high complexity, which makes them unsuited for practical deployment on wireless systems where flexibility and fast inference time are necessary to support real-time spectrum sensing. In this paper, we introduce DeepSweep, a novel DL-based transceiver design that allows scalable, accurate, and fast spectrum sensing while maintaining a high level of customizability to adapt its design to a broad range of application scenarios and use cases. DeepSweep is designed to be seamlessly integrated with well-established transceiver designs and leverages shallow convolutional neural network (CNN) to \"sweep\" the spectrum and process captured IQ samples fast and reliably without interrupting ongoing demodulation and decoding operations. DeepSweep reduces training and inference times by more than 2 times and 10 times respectively, achieves up to 98 percent accuracy in locating spectrum activity, and produces outputs in less than 1 ms, thus showing that DeepSweep can be used for a broad range of spectrum sensing applications and scenarios.

One common and serious threat is phishing, where cybercriminals employ deceptive methods to steal sensitive information.This study addresses the pressing issue of phishing by introducing an advanced detection model that meticulously focuses on HTML content. Our proposed approach integrates a specialized Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) model for structured tabular data and two pretrained Natural Language Processing (NLP) models for analyzing textual features such as page titles and content. The embeddings from these models are harmoniously combined through a novel fusion process. The resulting fused embeddings are then input into a linear classifier. Recognizing the scarcity of recent datasets for comprehensive phishing research, our contribution extends to the creation of an up-to-date dataset, which we openly share with the community. The dataset is meticulously curated to reflect real-life phishing conditions, ensuring relevance and applicability. The research findings highlight the effectiveness of the proposed approach, with the CANINE demonstrating superior performance in analyzing page titles and the RoBERTa excelling in evaluating page content. The fusion of two NLP and one MLP model,termed MultiText-LP, achieves impressive results, yielding a 96.80 F1 score and a 97.18 accuracy score on our research dataset.

Some studies have proposed Shapley value-based GNN explanations, yet they have several limitations: they consider limited samples to approximate Shapley values; some mainly focus on small and large coalition sizes, and they are an order of magnitude slower than other explanation methods, making them inapplicable to even moderate-size graphs. In this work, we propose GNNShap, which provides explanations for edges since they provide more natural explanations for graphs and more fine-grained explanations. We overcome the limitations by sampling from all coalition sizes, parallelizing the sampling on GPUs, and speeding up model predictions by batching. GNNShap gives better fidelity scores and faster explanations than baselines on real-world datasets. ",

Tensor networks arise commonly in many domains of scientific computing and data science. After a transformation into a tree of binary contractions, the network is implemented as a sequence of individual contractions. Several critical aspects must be considered in the generation of efficient code for a contraction tree, including sparse tensor layout mode order, loop fusion to reduce intermediate tensors, and the interdependence of loop order, mode order, and contraction order. We propose CoNST, a novel approach that considers these factors in an integrated manner using a single formulation. Our approach creates a constraint system that encodes these decisions and their interdependence, while aiming to produce reduced-order intermediate tensors via fusion. The constraint system is solved by the Z3 SMT solver and the result is used to create the desired fused loop structure and tensor mode layouts for the entire contraction tree. This structure is lowered to the IR of the TACO compiler, which is then used to generate executable code. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates very significant (sometimes orders of magnitude) performance improvements over current state-of-the-art sparse tensor compiler/library alternatives. ",

This fleet scheduling problem is formulated to consider time-varying demand, constraints related to vertiport capacity, aircraft capacity and airspace safety guidelines, uncertainties related to take-off delay, weather-induced route closures, and unanticipated aircraft downtime. Collectively, such a formulation presents greater complexity, and potentially increased realism, than in existing UAM fleet planning implementations. To address these complexities, a new policy architecture is constructed, primary components of which include: graph capsule conv-nets for encoding vertiport and aircraft-fleet states both abstracted as graphs; transformer layers encoding time series information on demand and passenger fare; and a Multi-head Attention-based decoder that uses the encoded information to compute the probability of selecting each available destination for an aircraft. Trained with Proximal Policy Optimization, this policy architecture shows significantly better performance in terms of daily averaged profits on unseen test scenarios involving 8 vertiports and 40 aircraft, when compared to a random baseline and genetic algorithm-derived optimal solutions, while being nearly 1000 times faster in execution than the latter.

To tackle these challenges, we propose CE_FS, a novel cross-encoder (CE) re-ranker based on the fine-grained structured inputs. CE_FS uses additional structured information in the CQA data to improve the effectiveness of cross-encoder re-rankers. Furthermore, we propose LegalQA: a real-world benchmark dataset for evaluating answer retrieval in the legal domain. Experiments conducted on LegalQA show that our proposed method significantly outperforms strong cross-encoder re-rankers fine-tuned on MS MARCO. Our novel finding is that adding the question tags of each question besides the question description and title into the input of cross-encoder re-rankers structurally boosts the rankers' effectiveness.

However, are the GHP URIs referenced by scholarly publications contained within the Software Heritage and Web archive collections? We analyzed a dataset of GHP URIs extracted from scholarly publications to determine (1) is the URI still publicly available on the live Web?, (2) has the URI been archived by Software Heritage?, and (3) has the URI been archived by Web archives? Of all GHP URIs, we found that 93.98% were still publicly available on the live Web, 68.39% had been archived by Software Heritage, and 81.43% had been archived by Web archives. ",

    "abstract": "We propose a pipeline for identifying important entities from intelligence reports that constructs a knowledge graph, where nodes correspond to entities of fine-grained types (e.g. traffickers) extracted from the text and edges correspond to extracted relations between entities (e.g. cartel membership). The important entities in intelligence reports then map to central nodes in the knowledge graph. We introduce a novel method that extracts fine-grained entities in a few-shot setting (few labeled examples), given limited resources available to label the frequently changing entity types that intelligence analysts are interested in. It outperforms other state-of-the-art methods. Next, we identify challenges facing previous evaluations of zero-shot (no labeled examples) methods for extracting relations, affecting the step of populating edges. Finally, we explore the utility of the pipeline: given the goal of identifying important entities, we evaluate the impact of relation extraction errors on the identification of central nodes in several real and synthetic networks. The impact of these errors varies significantly by graph topology, suggesting that confidence in measurements based on automatically extracted relations should depend on observed network features. ",

    "abstract": "Machine learning models, in particular deep neural networks, are currently an integral part of various applications, from healthcare to finance. However, using sensitive data to train these models raises concerns about privacy and security. One method that has emerged to verify if the trained models are privacy-preserving is Membership Inference Attacks (MIA), which allows adversaries to determine whether a specific data point was part of a model's training dataset. While a series of MIAs have been proposed in the literature, only a few can achieve high True Positive Rates (TPR) in the low False Positive Rate (FPR) region (0.01%~1%). This is a crucial factor to consider for an MIA to be practically useful in real-world settings. In this paper, we present a novel approach to MIA that is aimed at significantly improving TPR at low FPRs. Our method, named learning-based difficulty calibration for MIA(LDC-MIA), characterizes data records by their hardness levels using a neural network classifier to determine membership. The experiment results show that LDC-MIA can improve TPR at low FPR by up to 4x compared to the other difficulty calibration based MIAs. It also has the highest Area Under ROC curve (AUC) across all datasets. Our method's cost is comparable with most of the existing MIAs, but is orders of magnitude more efficient than one of the state-of-the-art methods, LiRA, while achieving similar performance. ",

    "abstract": "While likelihood is attractive in theory, its estimates by deep generative models (DGMs) are often broken in practice, and perform poorly for out of distribution (OOD) Detection. Various recent works started to consider alternative scores and achieved better performances. However, such recipes do not come with provable guarantees, nor is it clear that their choices extract sufficient information. We attempt to change this by conducting a case study on variational autoencoders (VAEs). First, we introduce the likelihood path (LPath) principle, generalizing the likelihood principle. This narrows the search for informative summary statistics down to the minimal sufficient statistics of VAEs' conditional likelihoods. Second, introducing new theoretic tools such as nearly essential support, essential distance and co-Lipschitzness, we obtain non-asymptotic provable OOD detection guarantees for certain distillation of the minimal sufficient statistics. The corresponding LPath algorithm demonstrates SOTA performances, even using simple and small VAEs with poor likelihood estimates. To our best knowledge, this is the first provable unsupervised OOD method that delivers excellent empirical results, better than any other VAEs based techniques.

    "abstract": "Fake base stations (FBSes) pose a significant security threat by impersonating legitimate base stations. Though efforts have been made to defeat this threat, up to this day, the presence of FBSes and the multi-step attacks (MSAs) stemming from them can lead to unauthorized surveillance, interception of sensitive information, and disruption of network services for legitimate users. Therefore, detecting these malicious entities is crucial to ensure the security and reliability of cellular networks. Traditional detection methods often rely on additional hardware, predefined rules, signal scanning, changing protocol specifications, or cryptographic mechanisms that have limitations and incur huge infrastructure costs in accurately identifying FBSes. In this paper, we develop FBSDetector-an effective and efficient detection solution that can reliably detect FBSes and MSAs from layer-3 network traces using machine learning (ML) at the user equipment (UE) side. To develop FBSDetector, we created FBSAD and MSAD, the first-ever high-quality and large-scale datasets for training machine learning models capable of detecting FBSes and MSAs. These datasets capture the network traces in different real-world cellular network scenarios (including mobility and different attacker capabilities) incorporating legitimate base stations and FBSes. The combined network trace has a volume of 6.6 GB containing 751963 packets. Our novel ML models, specially designed to detect FBSes and MSAs, can effectively detect FBSes with an accuracy of 92% and a false positive rate of 5.96% and recognize MSAs with an accuracy of 86% and a false positive rate of 7.82%. We deploy FBSDetector as a real-world solution to protect end-users through an Android app and validate in a controlled lab environment. Compared to the existing solutions that fail to detect FBSes, FBSDetector can detect FBSes in the wild in real time. ",

Although remarkable progress has been achieved in recent years, the complex colon environment and concealed polyps with unclear boundaries still pose severe challenges in this area. Existing methods either involve computationally expensive context aggregation or lack prior modeling of polyps, resulting in poor performance in challenging cases. In this paper, we propose the Enhanced CenterNet with Contrastive Learning (ECC-PolypDet), a two-stage training \\& end-to-end inference framework that leverages images and bounding box annotations to train a general model and fine-tune it based on the inference score to obtain a final robust model. Specifically, we conduct Box-assisted Contrastive Learning (BCL) during training to minimize the intra-class difference and maximize the inter-class difference between foreground polyps and backgrounds, enabling our model to capture concealed polyps. Moreover, to enhance the recognition of small polyps, we design the Semantic Flow-guided Feature Pyramid Network (SFFPN) to aggregate multi-scale features and the Heatmap Propagation (HP) module to boost the model's attention on polyp targets. In the fine-tuning stage, we introduce the IoU-guided Sample Re-weighting (ISR) mechanism to prioritize hard samples by adaptively adjusting the loss weight for each sample during fine-tuning. Extensive experiments on six large-scale colonoscopy datasets demonstrate the superiority of our model compared with previous state-of-the-art detectors. ",

But they ignore the complementary relationship between different types of graphs, which can effectively capture potential relationships among sparse correspondences. To address this problem, we propose MGNet to effectively combine multiple complementary graphs. To obtain information integrating implicit and explicit local graphs, we construct local graphs from implicit and explicit aspects and combine them effectively, which is used to build a global graph. Moreover, we propose Graph~Soft~Degree~Attention (GSDA) to make full use of all sparse correspondence information at once in the global graph, which can capture and amplify discriminative features.

However, the preservation of structure, such as energy and stability, in a suitable manner has yet to be established. This limitation could be a potential reason why the learning process for PINNs is not always efficient and the numerical results may suggest nonphysical behavior. Besides, there is little research on their applications on downstream tasks. To address these issues, we propose structure-preserving PINNs to improve their performance and broaden their applications for downstream tasks. Firstly, by leveraging prior knowledge about the physical system, a structure-preserving loss function is designed to assist the PINN in learning the underlying structure. Secondly, a framework that utilizes structure-preserving PINN for robust image recognition is proposed. Here, preserving the Lyapunov structure of the underlying system ensures the stability of the system. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method improves the numerical accuracy of PINNs for partial differential equations. Furthermore, the robustness of the model against adversarial perturbations in image data is enhanced. ",

This setting poses significant challenges as classic decentralization approaches often operate on (strictly) concave objectives under differentiable constraints. In contrast, the problem we study here has a non-convex, continuous DR-submodular objective, while multicast transmissions naturally result in non-differentiable constraints. From a technical standpoint, we propose a distributed Frank-Wolfe and a distributed projected gradient ascent algorithm that, coupled with a relaxation of non-differentiable constraints, yield allocations within a $1-1/e$ factor from the optimal.

A few prior works, such as SESS and 3DIoUMatch, attempt to solve this task by utilizing a teacher model to generate pseudo-labels for unlabeled samples. However, the availability of unlabeled samples in the 3D domain is relatively limited compared to its 2D counterpart due to the greater effort required to collect 3D data. Moreover, the loose consistency regularization in SESS and restricted pseudo-label selection strategy in 3DIoUMatch lead to either low-quality supervision or a limited amount of pseudo labels. To address these issues, we present a novel Dual-Perspective Knowledge Enrichment approach named DPKE for semi-supervised 3D object detection. Our DPKE enriches the knowledge of limited training data, particularly unlabeled data, from two perspectives: data-perspective and feature-perspective. Specifically, from the data-perspective, we propose a class-probabilistic data augmentation method that augments the input data with additional instances based on the varying distribution of class probabilities. Our DPKE achieves feature-perspective knowledge enrichment by designing a geometry-aware feature matching method that regularizes feature-level similarity between object proposals from the student and teacher models. Extensive experiments on the two benchmark datasets demonstrate that our DPKE achieves superior performance over existing state-of-the-art approaches under various label ratio conditions.

We incorporated adapters into the SSL model, which we fine-tuned with the TTS model using noisy reference speech. In addition, to further improve performance, we adopted a speech enhancement (SE) front-end. With these improvements, our proposed SSL-based zero-shot TTS achieved high-quality speech synthesis with noisy reference speech. Through the objective and subjective evaluations, we confirmed that the proposed method is highly robust to noise in reference speech, and effectively works in combination with SE. ",

    "abstract": "The automation of code review has been tackled by several researchers with the goal of reducing its cost. The adoption of deep learning in software engineering pushed the automation to new boundaries, with techniques imitating developers in generative tasks, such as commenting on a code change as a reviewer would do or addressing a reviewer's comment by modifying code. The performance of these techniques is usually assessed through quantitative metrics, e.g., the percentage of instances in the test set for which correct predictions are generated, leaving many open questions on the techniques' capabilities. For example, knowing that an approach is able to correctly address a reviewer's comment in 10% of cases is of little value without knowing what was asked by the reviewer: What if in all successful cases the code change required to address the comment was just the removal of an empty line? In this paper we aim at characterizing the cases in which three code review automation techniques tend to succeed or fail in the two above-described tasks. The study has a strong qualitative focus, with ~105 man-hours of manual inspection invested in manually analyzing correct and wrong predictions generated by the three techniques, for a total of 2,291 inspected predictions. The output of this analysis are two taxonomies reporting, for each of the two tasks, the types of code changes on which the experimented techniques tend to succeed or to fail, pointing to areas for future work. A result of our manual analysis was also the identification of several issues in the datasets used to train and test the experimented techniques. Finally, we assess the importance of researching in techniques specialized for code review automation by comparing their performance with ChatGPT, a general purpose large language model, finding that ChatGPT struggles in commenting code as a human reviewer would do.

    "abstract": "Fusion of a panchromatic (PAN) image and corresponding multispectral (MS) image is also known as pansharpening, which aims to combine abundant spatial details of PAN and spectral information of MS. Due to the absence of high-resolution MS images, available deep-learning-based methods usually follow the paradigm of training at reduced resolution and testing at both reduced and full resolution. When taking original MS and PAN images as inputs, they always obtain sub-optimal results due to the scale variation. In this paper, we propose to explore the self-supervised representation of pansharpening by designing a cross-predictive diffusion model, named CrossDiff. It has two-stage training. In the first stage, we introduce a cross-predictive pretext task to pre-train the UNet structure based on conditional DDPM, while in the second stage, the encoders of the UNets are frozen to directly extract spatial and spectral features from PAN and MS, and only the fusion head is trained to adapt for pansharpening task. Extensive experiments show the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed model compared with state-of-the-art supervised and unsupervised methods. Besides, the cross-sensor experiments also verify the generalization ability of proposed self-supervised representation learners for other satellite's datasets. We will release our code for reproducibility. ",

In this paper, we propose a reusable self-supervised framework for bitemporal geometric distortion in CD tasks. The whole framework is composed of Pretext Representation Pre-training, Bitemporal Image Alignment, and Down-stream Decoder Fine-Tuning.

To address this issue, we further integrate Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) to guide the generation of pseudo-labels, termed CLIP-guided Aggregation. By leveraging CLIP's zero-shot classification capability, we use it to aggregate scores with the original predicted bounding boxes, enabling us to obtain refined scores for the pseudo-labels.

Our findings show that automated metrics yield similar results for ChatGPT under different prompts and NMT systems, while human annotators tend to assign noticeably higher scores to ChatGPT when it is provided an example or contextual information about the translation task. Pairwise correlation between automated metrics and dimensions of human evaluation produces weak and non-significant results, suggesting the divergence between the two methods of translation quality assessment.

The trajectories of the keypoints were then used to compute six locomotion traits: back posture measurement, head bobbing, tracking distance, stride length, stance duration, and swing duration. The three most important traits were back posture measurement, head bobbing, and tracking distance. For the ground truth, we showed that a thoughtful merging of the scores of the observers could improve intra-observer reliability and agreement. We showed that including multiple locomotion traits improves the classification accuracy from 76.6% with only one trait to 79.9% with the three most important traits and to 80.1% with all six locomotion traits.

Under certain assumptions different environments can be regarded as interventions on the observed system. We assume a linear relationship between target and covariates, which can be different in each environment with the only restriction that the causal structure is invariant across environments. This is an extension of the ICP ($\\textbf{I}$nvariant $\\textbf{C}$ausal $\\textbf{P}$rediction) principle by Peters et al. [2016], who assumed a fixed linear relationship across all environments.

SfD begins by identifying multiple instances of an object within an image, and then jointly estimates the 6DoF pose for all instances.An inverse graphics pipeline is subsequently employed to jointly reason about the shape, material of the object, and the environment light, while adhering to the shared geometry and material constraint across instances. Our primary contributions involve utilizing object duplicates as a robust prior for single-image inverse graphics and proposing an in-plane rotation-robust Structure from Motion (SfM) formulation for joint 6-DoF object pose estimation. By leveraging multi-view cues from a single image, SfD generates more realistic and detailed 3D reconstructions, significantly outperforming existing single image reconstruction models and multi-view reconstruction approaches with a similar or greater number of observations.

This diversity not only enhances the training accuracy of FL models but also hastens their convergence. Yet, applying FL in these expansive networks presents notable challenges, particularly the significant non-IIDness in client data distributions. Such data heterogeneity often results in slower convergence rates and reduced effectiveness in model training performance. Our study introduces a client selection strategy tailored to address this issue, leveraging user network traffic behaviour. This strategy involves the prediction and classification of clients based on their network usage patterns while prioritizing user privacy. By strategically selecting clients whose data exhibit similar patterns for participation in FL training, our approach fosters a more uniform and representative data distribution across the network. Our simulations demonstrate that this targeted client selection methodology significantly reduces the training loss of FL models in HAPS networks, thereby effectively tackling a crucial challenge in implementing large-scale FL systems.

Yet, for them to be accepted by customers, trust in their punctuality is vital. Many pilot initiatives operate without a fixed schedule, thus enhancing the importance of reliable arrival time (AT) predictions. This study presents an AT prediction system for autonomous shuttles, utilizing separate models for dwell and running time predictions, validated on real-world data from five cities. Alongside established methods such as XGBoost, we explore the benefits of integrating spatial data using graph neural networks (GNN). To accurately handle the case of a shuttle bypassing a stop, we propose a hierarchical model combining a random forest classifier and a GNN. The results for the final AT prediction are promising, showing low errors even when predicting several stops ahead. Yet, no single model emerges as universally superior, and we provide insights into the characteristics of pilot sites that influence the model selection process. Finally, we identify dwell time prediction as the key determinant in overall AT prediction accuracy when autonomous shuttles are deployed in low-traffic areas or under regulatory speed limits. This research provides insights into the current state of autonomous public transport prediction models and paves the way for more data-informed decision-making as the field advances. ",

Based on a user-provided textual description and a 2D bounding box in a reference viewpoint, InseRF generates new objects in 3D scenes. Recently, methods for 3D scene editing have been profoundly transformed, owing to the use of strong priors of text-to-image diffusion models in 3D generative modeling. Existing methods are mostly effective in editing 3D scenes via style and appearance changes or removing existing objects. Generating new objects, however, remains a challenge for such methods, which we address in this study. Specifically, we propose grounding the 3D object insertion to a 2D object insertion in a reference view of the scene. The 2D edit is then lifted to 3D using a single-view object reconstruction method. The reconstructed object is then inserted into the scene, guided by the priors of monocular depth estimation methods. We evaluate our method on various 3D scenes and provide an in-depth analysis of the proposed components. Our experiments with generative insertion of objects in several 3D scenes indicate the effectiveness of our method compared to the existing methods.

Such network structures have previously been studied implicitly in image processing and computational biology. We thus describe feature networks as graph structures imposed on feature vectors, and provide applications in machine learning. One application involves graph-based generalizations of convolutional neural networks, involving structured deep learning with hierarchical representations of features that have varying depth or complexity. This extends also to learning algorithms that are able to generate useful new multilevel features. Additionally, we discuss the use of feature networks to engineer new features, which can enhance the expressiveness of the model. We give a specific example of a deep tree-structured feature network, where hierarchical connections are formed through feature clustering and feed-forward learning. This results in low learning complexity and computational efficiency. Unlike \"standard\" neural features which are limited to modulated (thresholded) linear combinations of adjacent ones, feature networks offer more general feedforward dependencies among features.

    "abstract": "To investigate the processing of speech in the brain, simple linear models are commonly used to establish a relationship between brain signals and speech features. However, these linear models are ill-equipped to model a highly dynamic and complex non-linear system like the brain. Although non-linear methods with neural networks have been developed recently, reconstructing unseen stimuli from unseen subjects' EEG is still a highly challenging task. This work presents a novel method, ConvConcatNet, to reconstruct mel-specgrams from EEG, in which the deep convolution neural network and extensive concatenation operation were combined. With our ConvConcatNet model, the Pearson correlation between the reconstructed and the target mel-spectrogram can achieve 0.0420, which was ranked as No.1 in the Task 2 of the Auditory EEG Challenge. The codes and models to implement our work will be available on Github: https://github.com/xuxiran/ConvConcatNet ",

    "abstract": "Recently, 2D convolution has been found unqualified in sound event detection (SED). It enforces translation equivariance on sound events along frequency axis, which is not a shift-invariant dimension. To address this issue, dynamic convolution is used to model the frequency dependency of sound events. In this paper, we proposed the first full-dynamic method named \\emph{full-frequency dynamic convolution} (FFDConv). FFDConv generates frequency kernels for every frequency band, which is designed directly in the structure for frequency-dependent modeling. It physically furnished 2D convolution with the capability of frequency-dependent modeling. FFDConv outperforms not only the baseline by 6.6\\% in DESED real validation dataset in terms of PSDS1, but outperforms the other full-dynamic methods. In addition, by visualizing features of sound events, we observed that FFDConv could effectively extract coherent features in specific frequency bands, consistent with the vocal continuity of sound events. This proves that FFDConv has great frequency-dependent perception ability. ",

    "abstract": "The ability to accurately approximate trajectories of dynamical systems enables their analysis, prediction, and control. Neural network (NN)-based approximations have attracted significant interest due to fast evaluation with good accuracy over long integration time steps. In contrast to established numerical approximation schemes such as Runge-Kutta methods, the estimation of the error of the NN-based approximations proves to be difficult. In this work, we propose to use the NN's predictions in a high-order implicit Runge-Kutta (IRK) method. The residuals in the implicit system of equations can be related to the NN's prediction error, hence, we can provide an error estimate at several points along a trajectory. We find that this error estimate highly correlates with the NN's prediction error and that increasing the order of the IRK method improves this estimate. We demonstrate this estimation methodology for Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINNs) on the logistic equation as an illustrative example and then apply it to a four-state electric generator model that is regularly used in power system modelling.

    "abstract": "We present a new Subset Simulation approach using Hamiltonian neural network-based Monte Carlo sampling for reliability analysis. The proposed strategy combines the superior sampling of the Hamiltonian Monte Carlo method with computationally efficient gradient evaluations using Hamiltonian neural networks. This combination is especially advantageous because the neural network architecture conserves the Hamiltonian, which defines the acceptance criteria of the Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampler. Hence, this strategy achieves high acceptance rates at low computational cost. Our approach estimates small failure probabilities using Subset Simulations. However, in low-probability sample regions, the gradient evaluation is particularly challenging. The remarkable accuracy of the proposed strategy is demonstrated on different reliability problems, and its efficiency is compared to the traditional Hamiltonian Monte Carlo method. We note that this approach can reach its limitations for gradient estimations in low-probability regions of complex and high-dimensional distributions. Thus, we propose techniques to improve gradient prediction in these particular situations and enable accurate estimations of the probability of failure. The highlight of this study is the reliability analysis of a system whose parameter distributions must be inferred with Bayesian inference problems. In such a case, the Hamiltonian Monte Carlo method requires a full model evaluation for each gradient evaluation and, therefore, comes at a very high cost. However, using Hamiltonian neural networks in this framework replaces the expensive model evaluation, resulting in tremendous improvements in computational efficiency. ",
