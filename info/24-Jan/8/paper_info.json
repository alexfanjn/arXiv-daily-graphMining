    "abstract": "Maintaining freshness of data collection in Internet-of-Things (IoT) networks has attracted increasing attention. By taking into account age-of-information (AoI), we investigate the trajectory planning problem of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) that is used to aid a cluster-based IoT network. An optimization problem is formulated to minimize the total AoI of the collected data by the UAV from the ground IoT network. Since the total AoI of the IoT network depends on the flight time of the UAV and the data collection time at hovering points, we jointly optimize the selection of hovering points and the visiting order to these points. We exploit the state-of-the-art transformer and the weighted A*, which is a path search algorithm, to design a machine learning algorithm to solve the formulated problem. The whole UAV-IoT system is fed into the encoder network of the proposed algorithm, and the algorithm's decoder network outputs the visiting order to ground clusters. Then, the weighted A* is used to find the hovering point for each cluster in the ground IoT network. Simulation results show that the trained model by the proposed algorithm has a good generalization ability to generate solutions for IoT networks with different numbers of ground clusters, without the need to retrain the model. Furthermore, results show that our proposed algorithm can find better UAV trajectories with the minimum total AoI when compared to other algorithms. ",

    "title": "Brain-Inspired Spiking Neural Networks for Industrial Fault Diagnosis: A  Survey, Challenges, and Opportunities",
    "abstract": "In recent decades, Industrial Fault Diagnosis (IFD) has emerged as a crucial discipline concerned with detecting and gathering vital information about industrial equipment's health condition, thereby facilitating the identification of failure types and severities. The pursuit of precise and effective fault recognition has garnered substantial attention, culminating in a focus on automating equipment monitoring to preclude safety accidents and reduce reliance on human labor. The advent of artificial neural networks (ANNs) has been instrumental in augmenting intelligent IFD algorithms, particularly in the context of big data. Despite these advancements, ANNs, being a simplified biomimetic neural network model, exhibit inherent limitations such as resource and data dependencies and restricted cognitive capabilities. To address these limitations, the third-generation Spiking Neural Network (SNN), founded on principles of Brain-inspired computing, has surfaced as a promising alternative. The SNN, characterized by its biological neuron dynamics and spiking information encoding, demonstrates exceptional potential in representing spatiotemporal features. Consequently, developing SNN-based IFD models has gained momentum, displaying encouraging performance. Nevertheless, this field lacks systematic surveys to illustrate the current situation, challenges, and future directions. Therefore, this paper systematically reviews the theoretical progress of SNN-based models to answer the question of what SNN is. Subsequently, it reviews and analyzes existing SNN-based IFD models to explain why SNN needs to be used and how to use it. More importantly, this paper systematically answers the challenges, solutions, and opportunities of SNN in IFD. ",

    "abstract": "This study presents the first comprehensive analysis of the social and economic effects of solar mini-grids in rural African settings, specifically in Kenya and Nigeria. A group of 2,658 household heads and business owners connected to mini-grids over the last five years were interviewed both before and one year after their connection. These interviews focused on changes in gender equality, productivity, health, safety, and economic activity. The results show notable improvements in all areas. Economic activities and productivity increased significantly among the connected households and businesses. The median income of rural Kenyan community members quadrupled. Gender equality also improved, with women gaining more opportunities in decision making and business. Health and safety enhancements were linked to reduced use of hazardous energy sources like kerosene lamps. The introduction of solar mini-grids not only transformed the energy landscape but also led to broad socioeconomic benefits in these rural areas. The research highlights the substantial impact of decentralized renewable energy on the social and economic development of rural African communities. Its findings are crucial for policymakers, development agencies, and stakeholders focused on promoting sustainable energy and development in Africa. ",

    "abstract": "Global financial crime activity is driving demand for machine learning solutions in fraud prevention. However, prevention systems are commonly serviced to financial institutions in isolation, and few provisions exist for data sharing due to fears of unintentional leaks and adversarial attacks. Collaborative learning advances in finance are rare, and it is hard to find real-world insights derived from privacy-preserving data processing systems. In this paper, we present a collaborative deep learning framework for fraud prevention, designed from a privacy standpoint, and awarded at the recent PETs Prize Challenges. We leverage latent embedded representations of varied-length transaction sequences, along with local differential privacy, in order to construct a data release mechanism which can securely inform externally hosted fraud and anomaly detection models. We assess our contribution on two distributed data sets donated by large payment networks, and demonstrate robustness to popular inference-time attacks, along with utility-privacy trade-offs analogous to published work in alternative application domains.

    "abstract": "Federated learning (FL) as one of the novel branches of distributed machine learning (ML), develops global models through a private procedure without direct access to local datasets. However, access to model updates (e.g. gradient updates in deep neural networks) transferred between clients and servers can reveal sensitive information to adversaries. Differential privacy (DP) offers a framework that gives a privacy guarantee by adding certain amounts of noise to parameters. This approach, although being effective in terms of privacy, adversely affects model performance due to noise involvement. Hence, it is always needed to find a balance between noise injection and the sacrificed accuracy. To address this challenge, we propose adaptive noise addition in FL which decides the value of injected noise based on features' relative importance. Here, we first propose two effective methods for prioritizing features in deep neural network models and then perturb models' weights based on this information. Specifically, we try to figure out whether the idea of adding more noise to less important parameters and less noise to more important parameters can effectively save the model accuracy while preserving privacy. Our experiments confirm this statement under some conditions. The amount of noise injected, the proportion of parameters involved, and the number of global iterations can significantly change the output. While a careful choice of parameters by considering the properties of datasets can improve privacy without intense loss of accuracy, a bad choice can make the model performance worse. ",

    "abstract": "New categories may be introduced over time, or existing categories may need to be reclassified. Class incremental learning (CIL) is employed for the gradual acquisition of knowledge about new categories while preserving information about previously learned ones in such dynamic environments. It might also be necessary to also eliminate the influence of related categories on the model to adapt to reclassification. We thus introduce class-level machine unlearning (MU) within CIL. Typically, MU methods tend to be time-consuming and can potentially harm the model's performance. A continuous stream of unlearning requests could lead to catastrophic forgetting. To address these issues, we propose a non-destructive eCIL-MU framework based on embedding techniques to map data into vectors and then be stored in vector databases. Our approach exploits the overlap between CIL and MU tasks for acceleration. Experiments demonstrate the capability of achieving unlearning effectiveness and orders of magnitude (upto $\\sim 278\\times$) of acceleration. ",

With the phenomenal growth in semi-structured and unstructured data, sizes of the underlying graphs have witnessed a rapid growth over the years. Analyzing such large structures necessitates parallel processing, which is challenged by the intrinsic irregularity of sparse computation, memory access, and communication. It would be ideal if programmers and domain-experts get to focus only on the sequential computation and a compiler takes care of auto-generating the parallel code. On the other side, there is a variety in the number of target hardware devices, and achieving optimal performance often demands coding in specific languages or frameworks. Our goal in this work is to focus on a graph DSL which allows the domain-experts to write almost-sequential code, and generate parallel code for different accelerators from the same algorithmic specification. In particular, we illustrate code generation from the StarPlat graph DSL for NVIDIA, AMD, and Intel GPUs using CUDA, OpenCL, SYCL, and OpenACC programming languages. Using a suite of ten large graphs and four popular algorithms, we present the efficacy of StarPlat's versatile code generator. ",

    "abstract": "To stabilize PDE models, control laws require space-dependent functional gains mapped by nonlinear operators from the PDE functional coefficients. When a PDE is nonlinear and its \"pseudo-coefficient\" functions are state-dependent, a gain-scheduling (GS) nonlinear design is the simplest approach to the design of nonlinear feedback. The GS version of PDE backstepping employs gains obtained by solving a PDE at each value of the state. Performing such PDE computations in real time may be prohibitive. The recently introduced neural operators (NO) can be trained to produce the gain functions, rapidly in real time, for each state value, without requiring a PDE solution. In this paper we introduce NOs for GS-PDE backstepping. GS controllers act on the premise that the state change is slow and, as a result, guarantee only local stability, even for ODEs. We establish local stabilization of hyperbolic PDEs with nonlinear recirculation using both a \"full-kernel\" approach and the \"gain-only\" approach to gain operator approximation. Numerical simulations illustrate stabilization and demonstrate speedup by three orders of magnitude over traditional PDE gain-scheduling. Code (Github) for the numerical implementation is published to enable exploration. ",

Assuming the attacker has total access to the training dataset, and cannot intervene in model construction or training process. Specifically, a portion of benign training samples is randomly selected to be poisoned. Afterwards, considering that the captions are usually unfolded around objects in an image, we design an object-oriented method to craft poisons, which aims to modify pixel values by a slight range with the modification number proportional to the scale of the current detected object region. After training with the poisoned data, the attacked model behaves normally on benign images, but for poisoned images, the model will generate some sentences irrelevant to the given image. The attack controls the model behavior on specific test images without sacrificing the generation performance on benign test images. Our method proves the weakness of image captioning models to backdoor attack and we hope this work can raise the awareness of defending against backdoor attack in the image captioning field. ",

These two topics have been studied in tandem in the literature under the rubric of causal abstractions theory. In practice, it remains an open problem how to best leverage abstraction theory in real-world causal inference tasks, where the true mechanisms are unknown and only limited data is available. In this paper, we develop a new family of causal abstractions by clustering variables and their domains. This approach refines and generalizes previous notions of abstractions to better accommodate individual causal distributions that are spawned by Pearl's causal hierarchy. We show that such abstractions are learnable in practical settings through Neural Causal Models (Xia et al., 2021), enabling the use of the deep learning toolkit to solve various challenging causal inference tasks -- identification, estimation, sampling -- at different levels of granularity. Finally, we integrate these results with representation learning to create more flexible abstractions, moving these results closer to practical applications. Our experiments support the theory and illustrate how to scale causal inferences to high-dimensional settings involving image data. ",

The large variations in lighting/weather conditions and vehicle densities of the scenes pose significant challenges to existing car detection algorithms to meet the highly accurate perception demand for safety, due to the unstable/limited color information, which impedes the extraction of meaningful/discriminative features of cars. In this work, we present a novel learning-based car detection method that leverages trichromatic linear polarization as an additional cue to disambiguate such challenging cases. A key observation is that polarization, characteristic of the light wave, can robustly describe intrinsic physical properties of the scene objects in various imaging conditions and is strongly linked to the nature of materials for cars (e.g., metal and glass) and their surrounding environment (e.g., soil and trees), thereby providing reliable and discriminative features for robust car detection in challenging scenes. To exploit polarization cues, we first construct a pixel-aligned RGB-Polarization car detection dataset, which we subsequently employ to train a novel multimodal fusion network. Our car detection network dynamically integrates RGB and polarization features in a request-and-complement manner and can explore the intrinsic material properties of cars across all learning samples. We extensively validate our method and demonstrate that it outperforms state-of-the-art detection methods. Experimental results show that polarization is a powerful cue for car detection. ",

Motivated by the intuition that the contextual information between point parts lies in the pairwise adjacent relationship, which can be depicted by the hop distance of the graph quantitatively, we devise a novel self-supervised part-level hop distance reconstruction task and design a novel loss function accordingly to facilitate training. In addition, we propose the Hop Graph Attention (HGA), which takes the learned hop distance as input for producing attention weights to allow edge features to contribute distinctively in aggregation. Eventually, the proposed DHGCN is a plug-and-play module that is compatible with point-based backbone networks.

    "abstract": "The crux of effective out-of-distribution (OOD) detection lies in acquiring a robust in-distribution (ID) representation, distinct from OOD samples. While previous methods predominantly leaned on recognition-based techniques for this purpose, they often resulted in shortcut learning, lacking comprehensive representations. In our study, we conducted a comprehensive analysis, exploring distinct pretraining tasks and employing various OOD score functions. The results highlight that the feature representations pre-trained through reconstruction yield a notable enhancement and narrow the performance gap among various score functions. This suggests that even simple score functions can rival complex ones when leveraging reconstruction-based pretext tasks. Reconstruction-based pretext tasks adapt well to various score functions. As such, it holds promising potential for further expansion. Our OOD detection framework, MOODv2, employs the masked image modeling pretext task. Without bells and whistles, MOODv2 impressively enhances 14.30% AUROC to 95.68% on ImageNet and achieves 99.98% on CIFAR-10. ",

    "abstract": "As the first defensive layer that attacks would hit, the web application firewall (WAF) plays an indispensable role in defending against malicious web attacks like SQL injection (SQLi). With the development of cloud computing, WAF-as-a-service, as one kind of Security-as-a-service, has been proposed to facilitate the deployment, configuration, and update of WAFs in the cloud. Despite its tremendous popularity, the security vulnerabilities of WAF-as-a-service are still largely unknown, which is highly concerning given its massive usage. In this paper, we propose a general and extendable attack framework, namely AdvSQLi, in which a minimal series of transformations are performed on the hierarchical tree representation of the original SQLi payload, such that the generated SQLi payloads can not only bypass WAF-as-a-service under black-box settings but also keep the same functionality and maliciousness as the original payload. With AdvSQLi, we make it feasible to inspect and understand the security vulnerabilities of WAFs automatically, helping vendors make products more secure. To evaluate the attack effectiveness and efficiency of AdvSQLi, we first employ two public datasets to generate adversarial SQLi payloads, leading to a maximum attack success rate of 100% against state-of-the-art ML-based SQLi detectors. Furthermore, to demonstrate the immediate security threats caused by AdvSQLi, we evaluate the attack effectiveness against 7 WAF-as-a-service solutions from mainstream vendors and find all of them are vulnerable to AdvSQLi. For instance, AdvSQLi achieves an attack success rate of over 79% against the F5 WAF. Through in-depth analysis of the evaluation results, we further condense out several general yet severe flaws of these vendors that cannot be easily patched. ",

In this paper, we present a systematic analysis of Twitter(X) accounts using human faces generated by Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for their profile pictures. We present a dataset of 1,353 such accounts and show that they are used to spread scams, spam, and amplify coordinated messages, among other inauthentic activities. Leveraging a feature of GAN-generated faces -- consistent eye placement -- and supplementing it with human annotation, we devise an effective method for identifying GAN-generated profiles in the wild. Applying this method to a random sample of active Twitter users, we estimate a lower bound for the prevalence of profiles using GAN-generated faces between 0.021% and 0.044% -- around 10K daily active accounts. These findings underscore the emerging threats posed by multimodal generative AI. We release the source code of our detection method and the data we collect to facilitate further investigation. Additionally, we provide practical heuristics to assist social media users in recognizing such accounts. ",

    "abstract": "Among the most insidious attacks on Reinforcement Learning (RL) solutions are training-time attacks (TTAs) that create loopholes and backdoors in the learned behaviour. Not limited to a simple disruption, constructive TTAs (C-TTAs) are now available, where the attacker forces a specific, target behaviour upon a training RL agent (victim). However, even state-of-the-art C-TTAs focus on target behaviours that could be naturally adopted by the victim if not for a particular feature of the environment dynamics, which C-TTAs exploit. In this work, we show that a C-TTA is possible even when the target behaviour is un-adoptable due to both environment dynamics as well as non-optimality with respect to the victim objective(s). To find efficient attacks in this context, we develop a specialised flavour of the DDPG algorithm, which we term gammaDDPG, that learns this stronger version of C-TTA. gammaDDPG dynamically alters the attack policy planning horizon based on the victim's current behaviour. This improves effort distribution throughout the attack timeline and reduces the effect of uncertainty the attacker has about the victim. To demonstrate the features of our method and better relate the results to prior research, we borrow a 3D grid domain from a state-of-the-art C-TTA for our experiments.

    "abstract": "Mobile malware has become one of the most critical security threats in the era of ubiquitous mobile computing. Despite the intensive efforts from security experts to counteract it, recent years have still witnessed a rapid growth of identified malware samples. This could be partly attributed to the newly-emerged technologies that may constantly open up under-studied attack surfaces for the adversaries. One typical example is the recently-developed mobile machine learning (ML) framework that enables storing and running deep learning (DL) models on mobile devices. Despite obvious advantages, this new feature also inadvertently introduces potential vulnerabilities (e.g., on-device models may be modified for malicious purposes). In this work, we propose a method to generate or transform mobile malware by hiding the malicious payloads inside the parameters of deep learning models, based on a strategy that considers four factors (layer type, layer number, layer coverage and the number of bytes to replace). Utilizing the proposed method, we can run malware in DL mobile applications covertly with little impact on the model performance (i.e., as little as 0.4% drop in accuracy and at most 39ms latency overhead).

Meanwhile, the 6G networks will also evolve from the Internet-of-everything to the Internet-of-intelligence with hybrid heterogeneous network architectures. In the future, the interplay between GAI and the 6G will lead to new opportunities, where GAI can learn the knowledge of personalized data from the massive connected 6G end devices, while GAI's powerful generation ability can provide advanced network solutions for 6G network and provide 6G end devices with various AIGC services. However, they seem to be an odd couple, due to the contradiction of data and resources. To achieve a better-coordinated interplay between GAI and 6G, the GAI-native networks (GainNet), a GAI-oriented collaborative cloud-edge-end intelligence framework, is proposed in this paper. By deeply integrating GAI with 6G network design, GainNet realizes the positive closed-loop knowledge flow and sustainable-evolution GAI model optimization. On this basis, the GAI-oriented generic resource orchestration mechanism with integrated sensing, communication, and computing (GaiRom-ISCC) is proposed to guarantee the efficient operation of GainNet. Two simple case studies demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed schemes. Finally, we envision the key challenges and future directions concerning the interplay between GAI models and 6G networks. ",

    "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are a class of deep learning models capable of processing graph-structured data, and they have demonstrated significant performance in a variety of real-world applications. Recent studies have found that GNN models are vulnerable to backdoor attacks. When specific patterns (called backdoor triggers, e.g., subgraphs, nodes, etc.) appear in the input data, the backdoor embedded in the GNN models is activated, which misclassifies the input data into the target class label specified by the attacker, whereas when there are no backdoor triggers in the input, the backdoor embedded in the GNN models is not activated, and the models work normally. Backdoor attacks are highly stealthy and expose GNN models to serious security risks. Currently, research on backdoor attacks against GNNs mainly focus on tasks such as graph classification and node classification, and backdoor attacks against link prediction tasks are rarely studied. In this paper, we propose a backdoor attack against the link prediction tasks based on GNNs and reveal the existence of such security vulnerability in GNN models, which make the backdoored GNN models to incorrectly predict unlinked two nodes as having a link relationship when a trigger appear. The method uses a single node as the trigger and poison selected node pairs in the training graph, and then the backdoor will be embedded in the GNN models through the training process. In the inference stage, the backdoor in the GNN models can be activated by simply linking the trigger node to the two end nodes of the unlinked node pairs in the input data, causing the GNN models to produce incorrect link prediction results for the target node pairs.

This hierarchical approach expands the representability across various scales of music. This representation serves as the foundation for an energy-based model, uniquely tailored to learn musical concepts through a flexible algorithm framework relying on the minimax entropy principle. Utilizing an adapted Metropolis-Hastings sampling technique, the model enables fine-grained control over music generation. A comprehensive empirical evaluation, contrasting this novel approach with existing methodologies, manifests considerable advancements in interpretability and controllability.

    "abstract": "Recently there is a growing focus on graph data, and multi-view graph clustering has become a popular area of research interest. Most of the existing methods are only applicable to homophilous graphs, yet the extensive real-world graph data can hardly fulfill the homophily assumption, where the connected nodes tend to belong to the same class. Several studies have pointed out that the poor performance on heterophilous graphs is actually due to the fact that conventional graph neural networks (GNNs), which are essentially low-pass filters, discard information other than the low-frequency information on the graph. Nevertheless, on certain graphs, particularly heterophilous ones, neglecting high-frequency information and focusing solely on low-frequency information impedes the learning of node representations. To break this limitation, our motivation is to perform graph filtering that is closely related to the homophily degree of the given graph, with the aim of fully leveraging both low-frequency and high-frequency signals to learn distinguishable node embedding. In this work, we propose Adaptive Hybrid Graph Filter for Multi-View Graph Clustering (AHGFC). Specifically, a graph joint process and graph joint aggregation matrix are first designed by using the intrinsic node features and adjacency relationship, which makes the low and high-frequency signals on the graph more distinguishable. Then we design an adaptive hybrid graph filter that is related to the homophily degree, which learns the node embedding based on the graph joint aggregation matrix. After that, the node embedding of each view is weighted and fused into a consensus embedding for the downstream task. Experimental results show that our proposed model performs well on six datasets containing homophilous and heterophilous graphs. ",

We first conducted a pilot study to develop and validate the robot's affective narratives. Then, in the full study, the robot used one of three different affective narrative strategies (funny, sad, neutral) while becoming less functional at its shopping task over the course of the interaction. As the functionality of the robot degraded, participants were repeatedly asked if they were willing to help the robot. The results showed that conveying a sad narrative significantly influenced the participants' willingness to help the robot throughout the interaction and determined whether participants felt empathetic toward the robot throughout the interaction. Furthermore, a higher amount of past experience with robots also increased the participants' willingness to help the robot. This work suggests that affective narratives can be useful in short-term interactions that benefit from emotional connections between humans and robots. ",

However, the shroud of opacity surrounding the decision-making process of these detectors makes it difficult for security analysts to comprehend. To address this, various explanation approaches have been proposed to explain the predictions by highlighting important features, which have been demonstrated effective in other domains such as computer vision and natural language processing. Unfortunately, an in-depth evaluation of vulnerability-critical features, such as fine-grained vulnerability-related code lines, learned and understood by these explanation approaches remains lacking. In this study, we first evaluate the performance of ten explanation approaches for vulnerability detectors based on graph and sequence representations, measured by two quantitative metrics including fidelity and vulnerability line coverage rate. Our results show that fidelity alone is not sufficient for evaluating these approaches, as fidelity incurs significant fluctuations across different datasets and detectors. We subsequently check the precision of the vulnerability-related code lines reported by the explanation approaches, and find poor accuracy in this task among all of them. This can be attributed to the inefficiency of explainers in selecting important features and the presence of irrelevant artifacts learned by DL-based detectors. ",

This detailed information includes the SAR image features that contributed to the classification, the classification confidence, and the probability of the identified object being classified as a different object type or class.

Existing voxel-based methods face significant challenges when fusing sparse voxel features with dense image features in a one-to-one manner, resulting in the loss of the advantages of images, including semantic and continuity information, leading to sub-optimal detection performance, especially at long distances. In this paper, we present VoxelNextFusion, a multi-modal 3D object detection framework specifically designed for voxel-based methods, which effectively bridges the gap between sparse point clouds and dense images. In particular, we propose a voxel-based image pipeline that involves projecting point clouds onto images to obtain both pixel- and patch-level features. These features are then fused using a self-attention to obtain a combined representation. Moreover, to address the issue of background features present in patches, we propose a feature importance module that effectively distinguishes between foreground and background features, thus minimizing the impact of the background features. Extensive experiments were conducted on the widely used KITTI and nuScenes 3D object detection benchmarks. Notably, our VoxelNextFusion achieved around +3.20% in AP@0.7 improvement for car detection in hard level compared to the Voxel R-CNN baseline on the KITTI test dataset ",

Learning graph-level representation plays an important role in a variety of real-world issues such as molecule property prediction, protein structure feature extraction, and social network analysis. The mainstream method is utilizing contrastive learning to facilitate graph feature extraction, known as Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL). GCL, although effective, suffers from some complications in contrastive learning, such as the effect of false negative pairs. Moreover, augmentation strategies in GCL are weakly adaptive to diverse graph datasets. Motivated by these problems, we propose a novel framework called Structure Knowledge Refinement (SKR) which uses data structure to determine the probability of whether a pair is positive or negative. Meanwhile, we propose an augmentation strategy that naturally preserves the semantic meaning of the original data and is compatible with our SKR framework. Furthermore, we illustrate the effectiveness of our SKR framework through intuition and experiments. The experimental results on the tasks of graph-level classification demonstrate that our SKR framework is superior to most state-of-the-art baselines. ",

    "abstract": "We introduce a new framework of adversarial attacks, named calibration attacks, in which the attacks are generated and organized to trap victim models to be miscalibrated without altering their original accuracy, hence seriously endangering the trustworthiness of the models and any decision-making based on their confidence scores. Specifically, we identify four novel forms of calibration attacks: underconfidence attacks, overconfidence attacks, maximum miscalibration attacks, and random confidence attacks, in both the black-box and white-box setups. We then test these new attacks on typical victim models with comprehensive datasets, demonstrating that even with a relatively low number of queries, the attacks can create significant calibration mistakes. We further provide detailed analyses to understand different aspects of calibration attacks. Building on that, we investigate the effectiveness of widely used adversarial defences and calibration methods against these types of attacks, which then inspires us to devise two novel defences against such calibration attacks.

    "title": "A Cost-Efficient FPGA Implementation of Tiny Transformer Model using  Neural ODE",
    "abstract": "Transformer is an emerging neural network model with attention mechanism. It has been adopted to various tasks and achieved a favorable accuracy compared to CNNs and RNNs. While the attention mechanism is recognized as a general-purpose component, many of the Transformer models require a significant number of parameters compared to the CNN-based ones. To mitigate the computational complexity, recently, a hybrid approach has been proposed, which uses ResNet as a backbone architecture and replaces a part of its convolution layers with an MHSA (Multi-Head Self-Attention) mechanism. In this paper, we significantly reduce the parameter size of such models by using Neural ODE (Ordinary Differential Equation) as a backbone architecture instead of ResNet. The proposed hybrid model reduces the parameter size by 94.6% compared to the CNN-based ones without degrading the accuracy. We then deploy the proposed model on a modest-sized FPGA device for edge computing. To further reduce FPGA resource utilization, we quantize the model following QAT (Quantization Aware Training) scheme instead of PTQ (Post Training Quantization) to suppress the accuracy loss. As a result, an extremely lightweight Transformer-based model can be implemented on resource-limited FPGAs. The weights of the feature extraction network are stored on-chip to minimize the memory transfer overhead, allowing faster inference. By eliminating the overhead of memory transfers, inference can be executed seamlessly, leading to accelerated inference. The proposed FPGA implementation achieves 12.8x speedup and 9.21x energy efficiency compared to ARM Cortex-A53 CPU. ",

The task of achieving a balance between prediction precision and computational efficiency presents a significant challenge. In this article, we present a novel deep-learning method called Federated Learning and Asynchronous Graph Convolutional Network (FLAGCN). Our framework incorporates the principles of asynchronous graph convolutional networks with federated learning to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of real-time traffic flow prediction. The FLAGCN model employs a spatial-temporal graph convolution technique to asynchronously address spatio-temporal dependencies within traffic data effectively. To efficiently handle the computational requirements associated with this deep learning model, this study used a graph federated learning technique known as GraphFL. This approach is designed to facilitate the training process. The experimental results obtained from conducting tests on two distinct traffic datasets demonstrate that the utilization of FLAGCN leads to the optimization of both training and inference durations while maintaining a high level of prediction accuracy. FLAGCN outperforms existing models with significant improvements by achieving up to approximately 6.85% reduction in RMSE, 20.45% reduction in MAPE, compared to the best-performing existing models.

Existing vulnerability detectors, especially those based on deep learning (DL) models, have achieved high effectiveness. Despite their capability of detecting vulnerable code snippets from given code fragments, the detectors are typically unable to further locate the fine-grained information pertaining to the vulnerability, such as the precise vulnerability triggering locations.In this paper, we propose VULEXPLAINER, a tool for automatically locating vulnerability-critical code lines from coarse-level vulnerable code snippets reported by DL-based detectors.Our approach takes advantage of the code structure and the semantics of the vulnerabilities. Specifically, we leverage program slicing to get a set of critical program paths containing vulnerability-triggering and vulnerability-dependent statements and rank them to pinpoint the most important one (i.e., sub-graph) as the data flow associated with the vulnerability. We demonstrate that VULEXPLAINER performs consistently well on four state-of-the-art graph-representation(GP)-based vulnerability detectors, i.e., it can flag the vulnerability-triggering code statements with an accuracy of around 90% against eight common C/C++ vulnerabilities, outperforming five widely used GNN-based explanation approaches. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of VULEXPLAINER, which provides insights into a promising research line: integrating program slicing and deep learning for the interpretation of vulnerable code fragments.

There is a growing need for parallel data structures and algorithms due to the increasing number of cores in modern computers. The assembly task is an indispensable step in sequencing genomes of new organisms and studying structural genomic changes. In recent years, the dynamic development of next-generation sequencing (NGS) methods raises hopes for making whole-genome sequencing a fast and reliable tool used, for example, in medical diagnostics. However, this is hampered by the slowness and computational requirements of the current processing algorithms, which raises the need to develop more efficient algorithms. One possible approach, still little explored, is the use of quantum computing. We created the lock-free version of the de Bruijn graph, as well as a lock-free algorithm to build such graph from reads. Our algorithm and data structures are developed to use parallel threads of execution and do not use mutexes or other locking mechanisms, instead, we used only compare-and-swap instruction and other atomic operations. It makes our algorithm very fast and efficiently scaling. The presented article depicts the new lock-free de Bruijn graph data structure with a graph build algorithm. We developed a C++ library and tested its performance to depict its high speed and scalability compared to other available tools. ",

Current approaches are mostly based on supervised methods that require large, fully instance-level labels (i.e., bounding boxes). However, large image datasets with instance-level labels are often limited because of the burden of annotation. Thus, surgical tool detection is important when providing image-level labels instead of instance-level labels since image-level annotations are considerably more time-efficient than instance-level annotations. In this work, we propose to strike a balance between the extremely costly annotation burden and detection performance. We further propose a co-occurrence loss, which considers a characteristic that some tool pairs often co-occur together in an image to leverage image-level labels. Encapsulating the knowledge of co-occurrence using the co-occurrence loss helps to overcome the difficulty in classification that originates from the fact that some tools have similar shapes and textures. Extensive experiments conducted on the Endovis2018 dataset in various data settings show the effectiveness of our method. ",

Through two case studies, we discovered that transfer learning can effectively train PINN to approximate solutions from low-frequency problems to high-frequency problems without increasing network parameters.

However, many deep CNN-based denoising models equally utilize the hierarchical features of noisy images without paying attention to the more important and useful features, leading to relatively low performance. To address the issue, we design a new Two-stage Progressive Residual Dense Attention Network (TSP-RDANet) for image denoising, which divides the whole process of denoising into two sub-tasks to remove noise progressively. Two different attention mechanism-based denoising networks are designed for the two sequential sub-tasks: the residual dense attention module (RDAM) is designed for the first stage, and the hybrid dilated residual dense attention module (HDRDAM) is proposed for the second stage. The proposed attention modules are able to learn appropriate local features through dense connection between different convolutional layers, and the irrelevant features can also be suppressed. The two sub-networks are then connected by a long skip connection to retain the shallow feature to enhance the denoising performance. The experiments on seven benchmark datasets have verified that compared with many state-of-the-art methods, the proposed TSP-RDANet can obtain favorable results both on synthetic and real noisy image denoising.

To address this issue, this paper proposes the use of state-of-the-art deep neural models for automatic image classification/tagging, specifically by adapting transformer-based architectures for crisis image classification (CrisisViT). We leverage the new Incidents1M crisis image dataset to develop a range of new transformer-based image classification models. Through experimentation over the standard Crisis image benchmark dataset, we demonstrate that the CrisisViT models significantly outperform previous approaches in emergency type, image relevance, humanitarian category, and damage severity classification. Additionally, we show that the new Incidents1M dataset can further augment the CrisisViT models resulting in an additional 1.25% absolute accuracy gain. ",

In practice, however, servers are not always trusted, and an adversarial server can strategically select compromised clients to create a dishonest majority, thereby undermining the system's security guarantees. In this paper, we present Lotto, an FL system that addresses this fundamental, yet underexplored issue by providing secure participant selection against an adversarial server. Lotto supports two selection algorithms: random and informed. To ensure random selection without a trusted server, Lotto enables each client to autonomously determine their participation using verifiable randomness. For informed selection, which is more vulnerable to manipulation, Lotto approximates the algorithm by employing random selection within a refined client pool. Our theoretical analysis shows that Lotto effectively restricts the number of server-selected compromised clients, thus ensuring an honest majority among participants. Large-scale experiments further reveal that Lotto achieves time-to-accuracy performance comparable to that of insecure selection methods, indicating a low computational overhead for secure selection.

Physiological responses of the human body are influenced by human cognition and commonly used to analyze cognitive states. From a network science perspective, the interactions of these heterogeneous physiological modalities in a graph structure may provide insightful information to support prediction of cognitive states. However, there is no clue to derive exact connectivity between heterogeneous modalities and there exists a hierarchical structure of sub-modalities. Existing graph neural networks are designed to learn on non-hierarchical homogeneous graphs with pre-defined graph structures; they failed to learn from hierarchical, multi-modal physiological data without a pre-defined graph structure. To this end, we propose a hierarchical heterogeneous graph generative network (H2G2-Net) that automatically learns a graph structure without domain knowledge, as well as a powerful representation on the hierarchical heterogeneous graph in an end-to-end fashion. We validate the proposed method on the CogPilot dataset that consists of multi-modal physiological signals.

    "abstract": "In an instance of the weighted Nash Social Welfare problem, we are given a set of $m$ indivisible items, $\\mathscr{G}$, and $n$ agents, $\\mathscr{A}$, where each agent $i \\in \\mathscr{A}$ has a valuation $v_{ij}\\geq 0$ for each item $j\\in \\mathscr{G}$. In addition, every agent $i$ has a non-negative weight $w_i$ such that the weights collectively sum up to $1$. The goal is to find an assignment $\\sigma:\\mathscr{G}\\rightarrow \\mathscr{A}$ that maximizes $\\prod_{i\\in \\mathscr{A}} \\left(\\sum_{j\\in \\sigma^{-1}(i)} v_{ij}\\right)^{w_i}$, the product of the weighted valuations of the players. When all the weights equal $\\frac1n$, the problem reduces to the classical Nash Social Welfare problem, which has recently received much attention. In this work, we present a $5\\cdot\\exp\\left(2\\cdot D_{\\text{KL}}(\\mathbf{w}\\, ||\\, \\frac{\\vec{\\mathbf{1}}}{n})\\right) = 5\\cdot\\exp\\left(2\\log{n} + 2\\sum_{i=1}^n w_i \\log{w_i}\\right)$-approximation algorithm for the weighted Nash Social Welfare problem, where $D_{\\text{KL}}(\\mathbf{w}\\, ||\\, \\frac{\\vec{\\mathbf{1}}}{n})$ denotes the KL-divergence between the distribution induced by $\\mathbf{w}$ and the uniform distribution on $[n]$. We show a novel connection between the convex programming relaxations for the unweighted variant of Nash Social Welfare presented in \\cite{cole2017convex, anari2017nash}, and generalize the programs to two different mathematical programs for the weighted case. The first program is convex and is necessary for computational efficiency, while the second program is a non-convex relaxation that can be rounded efficiently. The approximation factor derives from the difference in the objective values of the convex and non-convex relaxation. ",

    "abstract": "In the realm of spoken language understanding (SLU), numerous natural language understanding (NLU) methodologies have been adapted by supplying large language models (LLMs) with transcribed speech instead of conventional written text. In real-world scenarios, prior to input into an LLM, an automated speech recognition (ASR) system generates an output transcript hypothesis, where inherent errors can degrade subsequent SLU tasks. Here we introduce a method that utilizes the ASR system's lattice output instead of relying solely on the top hypothesis, aiming to encapsulate speech ambiguities and enhance SLU outcomes. Our in-context learning experiments, covering spoken question answering and intent classification, underline the LLM's resilience to noisy speech transcripts with the help of word confusion networks from lattices, bridging the SLU performance gap between using the top ASR hypothesis and an oracle upper bound. Additionally, we delve into the LLM's robustness to varying ASR performance conditions and scrutinize the aspects of in-context learning which prove the most influential. ",

Addressing the limitations of traditional Vision Transformers' fixed-size, non-adaptive patch partitioning, SPFormer employs superpixels that adapt to the image's content. This approach divides the image into irregular, semantically coherent regions, effectively capturing intricate details and applicable at both initial and intermediate feature levels. SPFormer, trainable end-to-end, exhibits superior performance across various benchmarks. Notably, it exhibits significant improvements on the challenging ImageNet benchmark, achieving a 1.4% increase over DeiT-T and 1.1% over DeiT-S respectively. A standout feature of SPFormer is its inherent explainability. The superpixel structure offers a window into the model's internal processes, providing valuable insights that enhance the model's interpretability. This level of clarity significantly improves SPFormer's robustness, particularly in challenging scenarios such as image rotations and occlusions, demonstrating its adaptability and resilience. ",

We train our architecture following a simple self-supervised training scheme in which input displacements over a set of sparse control vertices are used to overwrite the encoded geometry in order to transform one training sample into another. During inference, our model produces a dense output that adheres locally to the specified sparse geometry while maintaining the overall appearance of the encoded object. This approach results in state-of-the-art performance in both disentangling manipulated geometry and 3D mesh reconstruction. To the best of our knowledge LAMM is the first end-to-end framework that enables direct local control of 3D vertex geometry in a single forward pass. A very efficient computational graph allows our network to train with only a fraction of the memory required by previous methods and run faster during inference, generating 12k vertex meshes at $>$60fps on a single CPU thread. We further leverage local geometry control as a primitive for higher level editing operations and present a set of derivative capabilities such as swapping and sampling object parts.

    "abstract": "Large infrastructure networks (e.g. for transportation and power distribution) require constant monitoring for failures, congestion, and other adversarial events. However, assigning a sensor to every link in the network is often infeasible due to placement and maintenance costs. Instead, sensors can be placed only on a few key links, and machine learning algorithms can be leveraged for the inference of missing measurements (e.g. traffic counts, power flows) across the network. This paper investigates the sensor placement problem for networks. We first formalize the problem under a flow conservation assumption and show that it is NP-hard to place a fixed set of sensors optimally. Next, we propose an efficient and adaptive greedy heuristic for sensor placement that scales to large networks. Our experiments, using datasets from real-world application domains, show that the proposed approach enables more accurate inference than existing alternatives from the literature. We demonstrate that considering even imperfect or incomplete ground-truth estimates can vastly improve the prediction error, especially when a small number of sensors is available. ",

In this paper, the problem takes on the form of a multi-player non-convex potential game in which canonical duality theory is used to define a complementary dual potential function. After showing the Nash equilibrium (NE) correspondent to the SNL solution, we provide a necessary and sufficient condition for a stationary point to coincide with the NE.

Such framework is then jointly trained to optimize the final objective of interest. Specifically, factored complex linear projection (fCLP) has been adopted to form the neural beamforming. Several pooling strategies to combine look directions are then compared in order to find the optimal approach. Moreover, information of the source direction is also integrated in the beamforming to explore the usefulness of source direction as a prior, which is usually available especially in multi-modality scenario. Experiments on different microphone array geometry are conducted to evaluate the robustness against spacing variance of microphone array. Large in-house databases are used to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed framework and the proposed method achieve 19.26\\% improvement when compared with a strong baseline. ",

The paper reviews existing literature on DR detection, spanning classical computer vision methods to deep learning approaches, particularly focusing on CNNs. It identifies gaps in the research, emphasizing the lack of exploration in integrating pretrained large language models with segmented image inputs for generating recommendations and understanding dynamic interactions within a web application context.Objectives include developing a comprehensive DR detection methodology, exploring model integration, evaluating performance through competition ranking, contributing significantly to DR detection methodologies, and identifying research gaps.The methodology involves data preprocessing, data augmentation, and the use of a U-Net neural network architecture for segmentation. The U-Net model efficiently segments retinal structures, including blood vessels, hard and soft exudates, haemorrhages, microaneurysms, and the optical disc. High evaluation scores in Jaccard, F1, recall, precision, and accuracy underscore the model's potential for enhancing diagnostic capabilities in retinal pathology assessment.The outcomes of this research hold promise for improving patient outcomes through timely diagnosis and intervention in the fight against diabetic retinopathy, marking a significant contribution to the field of medical image analysis.

    "abstract": "The review summarizes the main methodological concepts used in studying natural language from the perspective of complexity science and documents their applicability in identifying both universal and system-specific features of language in its written representation. Three main complexity-related research trends in quantitative linguistics are covered. The first part addresses the issue of word frequencies in texts and demonstrates that taking punctuation into consideration restores scaling whose violation in the Zipf's law is often observed for the most frequent words. The second part introduces methods inspired by time series analysis, used in studying various kinds of correlations in written texts. The related time series are generated on the basis of text partition into sentences or into phrases between consecutive punctuation marks. It turns out that these series develop features often found in signals generated by complex systems, like long-range correlations or (multi)fractal structures. Moreover, it appears that the distances between punctuation marks comply with the discrete variant of the Weibull distribution. In the third part, the application of the network formalism to natural language is reviewed, particularly in the context of the so-called word-adjacency networks. Parameters characterizing topology of such networks can be used for classification of texts, for example, from a stylometric perspective. Network approach can also be applied to represent the organization of word associations. Structure of word-association networks turns out to be significantly different from that observed in random networks, revealing genuine properties of language. Finally, punctuation seems to have a significant impact not only on the language's information-carrying ability but also on its key statistical properties, hence it is recommended to consider punctuation marks on a par with words.

However, due to the infinite dimensional input, we need a powerful dimension reduction method for functional learning tasks, especially for the nonlinear functional regression. In this paper, based on the idea of smooth kernel integral transformation, we propose a functional deep neural network with an efficient and fully data-dependent dimension reduction method. The architecture of our functional net consists of a kernel embedding step: an integral transformation with a data-dependent smooth kernel; a projection step: a dimension reduction by projection with eigenfunction basis based on the embedding kernel; and finally an expressive deep ReLU neural network for the prediction. The utilization of smooth kernel embedding enables our functional net to be discretization invariant, efficient, and robust to noisy observations, capable of utilizing information in both input functions and responses data, and have a low requirement on the number of discrete points for an unimpaired generalization performance. We conduct theoretical analysis including approximation error and generalization error analysis, and numerical simulations to verify these advantages of our functional net. ",
