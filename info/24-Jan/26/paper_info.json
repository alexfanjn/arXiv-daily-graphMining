    "abstract": "Existing multimodal sentiment analysis tasks are highly rely on the assumption that the training and test sets are complete multimodal data, while this assumption can be difficult to hold: the multimodal data are often incomplete in real-world scenarios. Therefore, a robust multimodal model in scenarios with randomly missing modalities is highly preferred. Recently, CLIP-based multimodal foundational models have demonstrated impressive performance on numerous multimodal tasks by learning the aligned cross-modal semantics of image and text pairs, but the multimodal foundational models are also unable to directly address scenarios involving modality absence. To alleviate this issue, we propose a simple and effective framework, namely TRML, Toward Robust Multimodal Learning using Multimodal Foundational Models. TRML employs generated virtual modalities to replace missing modalities, and aligns the semantic spaces between the generated and missing modalities. Concretely, we design a missing modality inference module to generate virtual modaliites and replace missing modalities. We also design a semantic matching learning module to align semantic spaces generated and missing modalities. Under the prompt of complete modality, our model captures the semantics of missing modalities by leveraging the aligned cross-modal semantic space. Experiments demonstrate the superiority of our approach on three multimodal sentiment analysis benchmark datasets, CMU-MOSI, CMU-MOSEI, and MELD. ",

    "abstract": "Topological data analysis (TDA) is gaining prominence across a wide spectrum of machine learning tasks that spans from manifold learning to graph classification. A pivotal technique within TDA is persistent homology (PH), which furnishes an exclusive topological imprint of data by tracing the evolution of latent structures as a scale parameter changes. Present PH tools are confined to analyzing data through a single filter parameter. However, many scenarios necessitate the consideration of multiple relevant parameters to attain finer insights into the data. We address this issue by introducing the Effective Multidimensional Persistence (EMP) framework. This framework empowers the exploration of data by simultaneously varying multiple scale parameters. The framework integrates descriptor functions into the analysis process, yielding a highly expressive data summary. It seamlessly integrates established single PH summaries into multidimensional counterparts like EMP Landscapes, Silhouettes, Images, and Surfaces. These summaries represent data's multidimensional aspects as matrices and arrays, aligning effectively with diverse ML models. We provide theoretical guarantees and stability proofs for EMP summaries. We demonstrate EMP's utility in graph classification tasks, showing its effectiveness. Results reveal that EMP enhances various single PH descriptors, outperforming cutting-edge methods on multiple benchmark datasets. ",

    "abstract": "Face recognition (FR) has been applied to nearly every aspect of daily life, but it is always accompanied by the underlying risk of leaking private information. At present, almost all attack models against FR rely heavily on the presence of a classification layer. However, in practice, the FR model can obtain complex features of the input via the model backbone, and then compare it with the target for inference, which does not explicitly involve the outputs of the classification layer adopting logit or other losses. In this work, we advocate a novel inference attack composed of two stages for practical FR models without a classification layer. The first stage is the membership inference attack. Specifically, We analyze the distances between the intermediate features and batch normalization (BN) parameters. The results indicate that this distance is a critical metric for membership inference. We thus design a simple but effective attack model that can determine whether a face image is from the training dataset or not. The second stage is the model inversion attack, where sensitive private data is reconstructed using a pre-trained generative adversarial network (GAN) guided by the attack model in the first stage. To the best of our knowledge, the proposed attack model is the very first in the literature developed for FR models without a classification layer. We illustrate the application of the proposed attack model in the establishment of privacy-preserving FR techniques. ",

Machine learning models that output calibrated prediction sets through conformal prediction mimic this human behaviour; larger sets signal greater uncertainty while providing alternatives. In this work, we study the usefulness of conformal prediction sets as an aid for human decision making by conducting a pre-registered randomized controlled trial with conformal prediction sets provided to human subjects. With statistical significance, we find that when humans are given conformal prediction sets their accuracy on tasks improves compared to fixed-size prediction sets with the same coverage guarantee. The results show that quantifying model uncertainty with conformal prediction is helpful for human-in-the-loop decision making and human-AI teams. ",

    "abstract": "Convolutional neural networks have shown to be widely applicable to a large number of fields when large amounts of labelled data are available. The recent trend has been to use models with increasingly larger sets of tunable parameters to increase model accuracy, reduce model loss, or create more adversarially robust models -- goals that are often at odds with one another. In particular, recent theoretical work raises questions about the ability for even larger models to generalize to data outside of the controlled train and test sets. As such, we examine the role of the number of hidden layers in the ResNet model, demonstrated on the MNIST, CIFAR10, CIFAR100 datasets. We test a variety of parameters including the size of the model, the floating point precision, and the noise level of both the training data and the model output. To encapsulate the model's predictive power and computational cost, we provide a method that uses induced failures to model the probability of failure as a function of time and relate that to a novel metric that allows us to quickly determine whether or not the cost of training a model outweighs the cost of attacking it. Using this approach, we are able to approximate the expected failure rate using a small number of specially crafted samples rather than increasingly larger benchmark datasets. We demonstrate the efficacy of this technique on both the MNIST and CIFAR10 datasets using 8-, 16-, 32-, and 64-bit floating-point numbers, various data pre-processing techniques, and several attacks on five configurations of the ResNet model. Then, using empirical measurements, we examine the various trade-offs between cost, robustness, latency, and reliability to find that larger models do not significantly aid in adversarial robustness despite costing significantly more to train.

    "abstract": "Consensus-based decentralized stochastic gradient descent (D-SGD) is a widely adopted algorithm for decentralized training of machine learning models across networked agents. A crucial part of D-SGD is the consensus-based model averaging, which heavily relies on information exchange and fusion among the nodes. Specifically, for consensus averaging over wireless networks, communication coordination is necessary to determine when and how a node can access the channel and transmit (or receive) information to (or from) its neighbors. In this work, we propose $\\texttt{BASS}$, a broadcast-based subgraph sampling method designed to accelerate the convergence of D-SGD while considering the actual communication cost per iteration. $\\texttt{BASS}$ creates a set of mixing matrix candidates that represent sparser subgraphs of the base topology. In each consensus iteration, one mixing matrix is sampled, leading to a specific scheduling decision that activates multiple collision-free subsets of nodes. The sampling occurs in a probabilistic manner, and the elements of the mixing matrices, along with their sampling probabilities, are jointly optimized. Simulation results demonstrate that $\\texttt{BASS}$ enables faster convergence with fewer transmission slots compared to existing link-based scheduling methods. In conclusion, the inherent broadcasting nature of wireless channels offers intrinsic advantages in accelerating the convergence of decentralized optimization and learning. ",

    "abstract": "Holistic understanding and reasoning in 3D scenes play a vital role in the success of autonomous driving systems. The evolution of 3D semantic occupancy prediction as a pretraining task for autonomous driving and robotic downstream tasks captures finer 3D details compared to methods like 3D detection. Existing approaches predominantly focus on spatial cues, often overlooking temporal cues. Query-based methods tend to converge on computationally intensive Voxel representation for encoding 3D scene information. This study introduces S2TPVFormer, an extension of TPVFormer, utilizing a spatiotemporal transformer architecture for coherent 3D semantic occupancy prediction. Emphasizing the importance of spatiotemporal cues in 3D scene perception, particularly in 3D semantic occupancy prediction, our work explores the less-explored realm of temporal cues. Leveraging Tri-Perspective View (TPV) representation, our spatiotemporal encoder generates temporally rich embeddings, improving prediction coherence while maintaining computational efficiency. To achieve this, we propose a novel Temporal Cross-View Hybrid Attention (TCVHA) mechanism, facilitating effective spatiotemporal information exchange across TPV views. Experimental evaluations on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate a substantial 3.1% improvement in mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) for 3D Semantic Occupancy compared to TPVFormer, confirming the effectiveness of the proposed S2TPVFormer in enhancing 3D scene perception.

Our method consists in augmenting SimpleToD, an end-to-end TOD system, by extending belief state tracking to include ED, relying on a single language model.

    "abstract": "The ever-increasing demand for data services and the proliferation of user equipment (UE) have resulted in a significant rise in the volume of mobile traffic. Moreover, in multi-band networks, non-uniform traffic distribution among different operational bands can lead to congestion, which can adversely impact the user's quality of experience. Load balancing is a critical aspect of network optimization, where it ensures that the traffic is evenly distributed among different bands, avoiding congestion and ensuring better user experience. Traditional load balancing approaches rely only on the band channel quality as a load indicator and to move UEs between bands, which disregards the UE's demands and the band resource, and hence, leading to a suboptimal balancing and utilization of resources. To address this challenge, we propose an event-based algorithm, in which we model the load balancing problem as a multi-objective stochastic optimization, and assign UEs to bands in a probabilistic manner. The goal is to evenly distribute traffic across available bands according to their resources, while maintaining minimal number of inter-frequency handovers to avoid the signaling overhead and the interruption time. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm enhances the network's performance and outperforms traditional load balancing approaches in terms of throughput and interruption time. ",

Hence, it is essential to build resilience in modern cyber physical battery systems (CPBS) under cyber attacks. The first step of building such resilience is to analyze potential adversarial behavior, that is, how the adversaries can inject attacks into the battery systems. However, it has been found that in this under-explored area of battery cyber physical security, such an adversarial threat model has not been studied in a systematic manner.

To this end, we considered four different fairness operationalizations, including both consumer and provider perspectives.

    "abstract": "This paper introduces a novel approach for high-quality deepfake detection called Localized Artifact Attention Network (LAA-Net). Existing methods for high-quality deepfake detection are mainly based on a supervised binary classifier coupled with an implicit attention mechanism. As a result, they do not generalize well to unseen manipulations. To handle this issue, two main contributions are made. First, an explicit attention mechanism within a multi-task learning framework is proposed. By combining heatmap-based and self-consistency attention strategies, LAA-Net is forced to focus on a few small artifact-prone vulnerable regions. Second, an Enhanced Feature Pyramid Network (E-FPN) is proposed as a simple and effective mechanism for spreading discriminative low-level features into the final feature output, with the advantage of limiting redundancy. Experiments performed on several benchmarks show the superiority of our approach in terms of Area Under the Curve (AUC) and Average Precision (AP). The code will be released soon. ",

    "abstract": "Recently, appearance-based gaze estimation has been attracting attention in computer vision, and remarkable improvements have been achieved using various deep learning techniques. Despite such progress, most methods aim to infer gaze vectors from images directly, which causes overfitting to person-specific appearance factors. In this paper, we address these challenges and propose a novel framework: Stochastic subject-wise Adversarial gaZE learning (SAZE), which trains a network to generalize the appearance of subjects. We design a Face generalization Network (Fgen-Net) using a face-to-gaze encoder and face identity classifier and a proposed adversarial loss. The proposed loss generalizes face appearance factors so that the identity classifier inferences a uniform probability distribution. In addition, the Fgen-Net is trained by a learning mechanism that optimizes the network by reselecting a subset of subjects at every training step to avoid overfitting. Our experimental results verify the robustness of the method in that it yields state-of-the-art performance, achieving 3.89 and 4.42 on the MPIIGaze and EyeDiap datasets, respectively. Furthermore, we demonstrate the positive generalization effect by conducting further experiments using face images involving different styles generated from the generative model. ",

    "abstract": "Conventional recommendation methods have achieved notable advancements by harnessing collaborative or sequential information from user behavior. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have gained prominence for their capabilities in understanding and reasoning over textual semantics, and have found utility in various domains, including recommendation. Conventional recommendation methods and LLMs each have their strengths and weaknesses. While conventional methods excel at mining collaborative information and modeling sequential behavior, they struggle with data sparsity and the long-tail problem. LLMs, on the other hand, are proficient at utilizing rich textual contexts but face challenges in mining collaborative or sequential information. Despite their individual successes, there is a significant gap in leveraging their combined potential to enhance recommendation performance. In this paper, we introduce a general and model-agnostic framework known as \\textbf{L}arge \\textbf{la}nguage model with \\textbf{m}utual augmentation and \\textbf{a}daptive aggregation for \\textbf{Rec}ommendation (\\textbf{Llama4Rec}). Llama4Rec synergistically combines conventional and LLM-based recommendation models. Llama4Rec proposes data augmentation and prompt augmentation strategies tailored to enhance the conventional model and LLM respectively. An adaptive aggregation module is adopted to combine the predictions of both kinds of models to refine the final recommendation results. Empirical studies on three real-world datasets validate the superiority of Llama4Rec, demonstrating its consistent outperformance of baseline methods and significant improvements in recommendation performance.

Consequently, graph-based time-series anomaly detection methods have gained attention due to their ability to explicitly represent relationships between sensors. However, these methods often apply a uniform source node representation across all connected target nodes, even when updating different target node representations. Moreover, the graph attention mechanism, commonly used to infer unknown graph structures, could constrain the diversity of source node representations. In this paper, we introduce the Edge Conditional Node-update Graph Neural Network (ECNU-GNN). Our model, equipped with an edge conditional node update module, dynamically transforms source node representations based on connected edges to represent target nodes aptly. We validate performance on three real-world datasets: SWaT, WADI, and PSM. Our model demonstrates 5.4%, 12.4%, and 6.0% higher performance, respectively, compared to best F1 baseline models. ",

    "abstract": "Obtaining high-resolution, accurate channel topography and deposit conditions is the prior challenge for the study of channelized debris flow. Currently, wide-used mapping technologies including satellite imaging and drone photogrammetry struggle to precisely observe channel interior conditions of mountainous long-deep gullies, particularly those in the Wenchuan Earthquake region. SLAM is an emerging tech for 3D mapping; however, extremely rugged environment in long-deep gullies poses two major challenges even for the state-of-art SLAM: (1) Atypical features; (2) Violent swaying and oscillation of sensors. These issues result in large deviation and lots of noise for SLAM results. To improve SLAM mapping in such environments, we propose an advanced SLAM-based channel detection and mapping system, namely AscDAMs. It features three main enhancements to post-process SLAM results: (1) The digital orthophoto map aided deviation correction algorithm greatly eliminates the systematic error; (2) The point cloud smoothing algorithm substantially diminishes noises; (3) The cross section extraction algorithm enables the quantitative assessment of channel deposits and their changes. Two field experiments were conducted in Chutou Gully, Wenchuan County in China in February and November 2023, representing observations before and after the rainy season. We demonstrate the capability of AscDAMs to greatly improve SLAM results, promoting SLAM for mapping the specially challenging environment. The proposed method compensates for the insufficiencies of existing technologies in detecting debris flow channel interiors including detailed channel morphology, erosion patterns, deposit distinction, volume estimation and change detection. It serves to enhance the study of full-scale debris flow mechanisms, long-term post-seismic evolution, and hazard assessment. ",

The degrees-of-freedom (DoF) of ISAC is limited due to multiple performance metrics used for communication and sensing. Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS) composed of metamaterials can enhance the DoF in the spatial domain of ISAC systems. However, the availability of perfect Channel State Information (CSI) is a prerequisite for the gain brought by RIS, which is not realistic in practical environments. Therefore, under the imperfect CSI condition, we propose a decomposition-based large deviation inequality approach to eliminate the impact of CSI error on communication rate and sensing Cram\\'er-Rao bound (CRB). Then, an alternating optimization (AO) algorithm based on semi-definite relaxation (SDR) and gradient extrapolated majorization-maximization (GEMM) is proposed to solve the transmit beamforming and discrete RIS beamforming problems. We also analyze the complexity and convergence of the proposed algorithm. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithms can effectively eliminate the influence of CSI error and have good convergence performance. Notably, when CSI error exists, the gain brought by RIS will decrease with the increase of the number of RIS elements. Finally, we summarize and outline future research directions. ",

In this paper, a new multimodal knowledge supported basketball benchmark for video captioning is proposed. Specifically, we construct a Multimodal Basketball Game Knowledge Graph (MbgKG) to provide knowledge beyond videos. Then, a Multimodal Basketball Game Video Captioning (MbgVC) dataset that contains 9 types of fine-grained shooting events and 286 players' knowledge (i.e., images and names) is constructed based on MbgKG. We develop a novel framework in the encoder-decoder form named Entity-Aware Captioner (EAC) for basketball live text broadcast. The temporal information in video is encoded by introducing the bi-directional GRU (Bi-GRU) module. And the multi-head self-attention module is utilized to model the relationships among the players and select the key players. Besides, we propose a new performance evaluation metric named Game Description Score (GDS), which measures not only the linguistic performance but also the accuracy of the names prediction. Extensive experiments on MbgVC dataset demonstrate that EAC effectively leverages external knowledge and outperforms advanced video captioning models.

    "abstract": "Video object segmentation is a fundamental research problem in computer vision. Recent techniques have often applied attention mechanism to object representation learning from video sequences. However, due to temporal changes in the video data, attention maps may not well align with the objects of interest across video frames, causing accumulated errors in long-term video processing. In addition, existing techniques have utilised complex architectures, requiring highly computational complexity and hence limiting the ability to integrate video object segmentation into low-powered devices. To address these issues, we propose a new method for self-supervised video object segmentation based on distillation learning of deformable attention. Specifically, we devise a lightweight architecture for video object segmentation that is effectively adapted to temporal changes. This is enabled by deformable attention mechanism, where the keys and values capturing the memory of a video sequence in the attention module have flexible locations updated across frames. The learnt object representations are thus adaptive to both the spatial and temporal dimensions. We train the proposed architecture in a self-supervised fashion through a new knowledge distillation paradigm where deformable attention maps are integrated into the distillation loss. We qualitatively and quantitatively evaluate our method and compare it with existing methods on benchmark datasets including DAVIS 2016/2017 and YouTube-VOS 2018/2019. Experimental results verify the superiority of our method via its achieved state-of-the-art performance and optimal memory usage. ",

In response to this challenge, the rapid development of artificial intelligence has spurred the exploration of computational methodologies aimed at automatically generating solutions.

Here, we report an automatic social operating system (ASOS) designed for general social solution generation, which is built upon agent-based models, enabling both global and local analyses and regulations of social problems across spatial and temporal dimensions. ASOS adopts a hypergraph with extensible social semantics for a comprehensive and structured representation of social dynamics. It also incorporates a generalized protocol for standardized hypergraph operations and a symbolic hybrid framework that delivers interpretable solutions, yielding a balance between regulatory efficacy and function viability. To demonstrate the effectiveness of ASOS, we apply it to the domain of averting extreme events within international oil futures markets. By generating a new trading role supplemented by new mechanisms, ASOS can adeptly discern precarious market conditions and make front-running interventions for non-profit purposes. This study demonstrates that ASOS provides an efficient and systematic approach for generating solutions for enhancing our society. ",

However, most current works consider a homogeneous scenario where all agents use identity sensors and perception models. In reality, heterogeneous agent types may continually emerge and inevitably face a domain gap when collaborating with existing agents. In this paper, we introduce a new open heterogeneous problem: how to accommodate continually emerging new heterogeneous agent types into collaborative perception, while ensuring high perception performance and low integration cost? To address this problem, we propose HEterogeneous ALliance (HEAL), a novel extensible collaborative perception framework. HEAL first establishes a unified feature space with initial agents via a novel multi-scale foreground-aware Pyramid Fusion network. When heterogeneous new agents emerge with previously unseen modalities or models, we align them to the established unified space with an innovative backward alignment. This step only involves individual training on the new agent type, thus presenting extremely low training costs and high extensibility. It also protects new agents' model details from disclosure since the training can be conducted by the agent owner locally. To enrich agents' data heterogeneity, we bring OPV2V-H, a new large-scale dataset with more diverse sensor types. Extensive experiments on OPV2V-H and DAIR-V2X datasets show that HEAL surpasses SOTA methods in performance while reducing the training parameters by 91.5% when integrating 3 new agent types.

Empirical investigations reveal that the DG methods tend to underperform in SSDG settings, likely because they are unable to exploit the unlabelled data. Semi-supervised learning (SSL) shows improved but still inferior results compared to fully-supervised learning.

Currently, this problem is typically addressed using deep learning approaches, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transformers. However, deep networks are data-driven and are prone to overfitting, especially when the available labeled crowd dataset is limited. To overcome this limitation, we have designed a pipeline that utilizes a diffusion model to generate extensive training data. We are the first to generate images conditioned on a location dot map (a binary dot map that specifies the location of human heads) with a diffusion model. We are also the first to use these diverse synthetic data to augment the crowd counting models. Our proposed smoothed density map input for ControlNet significantly improves ControlNet's performance in generating crowds in the correct locations. Also, Our proposed counting loss for the diffusion model effectively minimizes the discrepancies between the location dot map and the crowd images generated. Additionally, our innovative guidance sampling further directs the diffusion process toward regions where the generated crowd images align most accurately with the location dot map. Collectively, we have enhanced ControlNet's ability to generate specified objects from a location dot map, which can be used for data augmentation in various counting problems. Moreover, our framework is versatile and can be easily adapted to all kinds of counting problems.

    "abstract": "Social media feeds are deeply personal spaces that reflect individual values and preferences. However, top-down, platform-wide content algorithms can reduce users' sense of agency and fail to account for nuanced experiences and values. Drawing on the paradigm of interactive machine teaching (IMT), an interaction framework for non-expert algorithmic adaptation, we map out a design space for teachable social media feed experiences to empower agential, personalized feed curation. To do so, we conducted a think-aloud study (N=24) featuring four social media platforms -- Instagram, Mastodon, TikTok, and Twitter -- to understand key signals users leveraged to determine the value of a post in their feed. We synthesized users' signals into taxonomies that, when combined with user interviews, inform five design principles that extend IMT into the social media setting. We finally embodied our principles into three feed designs that we present as sensitizing concepts for teachable feed experiences moving forward. ",

    "abstract": "The rapid evolution of Vehicular Ad-hoc NETworks (VANETs) has ushered in a transformative era for intelligent transportation systems (ITS), significantly enhancing road safety and vehicular communication. However, the intricate and dynamic nature of VANETs presents formidable challenges, particularly in vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communications. Roadside Units (RSUs), integral components of VANETs, are increasingly susceptible to cyberattacks, such as jamming and distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. These vulnerabilities pose grave risks to road safety, potentially leading to traffic congestion and vehicle malfunctions. Current approaches often struggle to effectively merge digital twin technology with Artificial Intelligence (AI) models to boost security and sustainability. Our study introduces an innovative cyber-twin framework tailored to enhance the security of RSUs in VANETs. This framework uniquely combines digital twin technology with cutting-edge AI to offer a real-time, dynamic representation of RSUs. This allows for detailed monitoring and efficient detection of threats, significantly strengthening RSU security in VANETs. Moreover, our framework makes a notable contribution to eco-friendly communication by improving the computational efficiency of RSUs, leading to increased energy efficiency and extended hardware durability. Our results show a considerable enhancement in resource management and attack detection, surpassing the performance of existing solutions. In particular, the cyber-twin framework showed a substantial reduction in RSU load and an optimal balance between resource consumption and high attack detection efficiency, with a defined twinning rate range of seventy-six to ninety per cent. These advancements underscore our commitment to developing sustainable, secure, and resilient vehicular communication systems for the future of smart cities. ",

    "abstract": "Dynamic graph modeling is crucial for understanding complex structures in web graphs, spanning applications in social networks, recommender systems, and more. Most existing methods primarily emphasize structural dependencies and their temporal changes. However, these approaches often overlook detailed temporal aspects or struggle with long-term dependencies. Furthermore, many solutions overly complicate the process by emphasizing intricate module designs to capture dynamic evolutions. In this work, we harness the strength of the Transformer's self-attention mechanism, known for adeptly handling long-range dependencies in sequence modeling. Our approach offers a simple Transformer model tailored for dynamic graph modeling without complex modifications. We re-conceptualize dynamic graphs as a sequence modeling challenge and introduce an innovative temporal alignment technique. This technique not only captures the inherent temporal evolution patterns within dynamic graphs but also streamlines the modeling process of their evolution. As a result, our method becomes versatile, catering to an array of applications. Our model's effectiveness is underscored through rigorous experiments on four real-world datasets from various sectors, solidifying its potential in dynamic graph modeling. ",

    "abstract": "In High-definition (HD) maps, lane elements constitute the majority of components and demand stringent localization requirements to ensure safe vehicle navigation. Vision lane detection with LiDAR position assignment is a prevalent method to acquire initial lanes for HD maps. However, due to incorrect vision detection and coarse camera-LiDAR calibration, initial lanes may deviate from their true positions within an uncertain range. To mitigate the need for manual lane correction, we propose a patch-wise lane correction network (PLCNet) to automatically correct the positions of initial lane points in local LiDAR images that are transformed from point clouds. PLCNet first extracts multi-scale image features and crops patch (ROI) features centered at each initial lane point. By applying ROIAlign, the fix-sized ROI features are flattened into 1D features. Then, a 1D lane attention module is devised to compute instance-level lane features with adaptive weights. Finally, lane correction offsets are inferred by a multi-layer perceptron and used to correct the initial lane positions. Considering practical applications, our automatic method supports merging local corrected lanes into global corrected lanes. Through extensive experiments on a self-built dataset, we demonstrate that PLCNet achieves fast and effective initial lane correction. ",

Specifically, the key strategy for enhancing model robustness entails the transfer of robustness from the pre-trained model to the fine-tuned model, coupled with adding a small amount of Gaussian noise to augment the representative capacity of the model. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that our approach markedly enhances the robustness across diverse scenarios, encompassing various parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods and confronting different levels of data heterogeneity.

Our approach is based on truncated power iteration providing sparsity to $(p,q)$-singular vectors of the hidden layers of Jacobian matrices. Using the ImageNet benchmark validation subset, we analyze the proposed method in various settings, achieving results comparable to dense baselines with more than a 50% fooling rate while damaging only 5% of pixels and utilizing 256 samples for perturbation fitting. We also show that our algorithm admits higher attack magnitude without affecting the human ability to solve the task. Furthermore, we investigate that the constructed perturbations are highly transferable among different models without significantly decreasing the fooling rate. Our findings demonstrate the vulnerability of state-of-the-art models to sparse attacks and highlight the importance of developing robust machine learning systems. ",

    "abstract": "Unsupervised skeleton based action recognition has achieved remarkable progress recently. Existing unsupervised learning methods suffer from severe overfitting problem, and thus small networks are used, significantly reducing the representation capability. To address this problem, the overfitting mechanism behind the unsupervised learning for skeleton based action recognition is first investigated. It is observed that the skeleton is already a relatively high-level and low-dimension feature, but not in the same manifold as the features for action recognition. Simply applying the existing unsupervised learning method may tend to produce features that discriminate the different samples instead of action classes, resulting in the overfitting problem. To solve this problem, this paper presents an Unsupervised spatial-temporal Feature Enrichment and Fidelity Preservation framework (U-FEFP) to generate rich distributed features that contain all the information of the skeleton sequence. A spatial-temporal feature transformation subnetwork is developed using spatial-temporal graph convolutional network and graph convolutional gate recurrent unit network as the basic feature extraction network. The unsupervised Bootstrap Your Own Latent based learning is used to generate rich distributed features and the unsupervised pretext task based learning is used to preserve the information of the skeleton sequence. The two unsupervised learning ways are collaborated as U-FEFP to produce robust and discriminative representations. Experimental results on three widely used benchmarks, namely NTU-RGB+D-60, NTU-RGB+D-120 and PKU-MMD dataset, demonstrate that the proposed U-FEFP achieves the best performance compared with the state-of-the-art unsupervised learning methods. t-SNE illustrations further validate that U-FEFP can learn more discriminative features for unsupervised skeleton based action recognition.

Hence energy business and control of wind power generation requires prediction of wind speed (WS) from few seconds to different time steps in advance.

Predictive data mining offers variety of methods for WS predictions where artificial neural network (ANN) is one of the reliable and accurate methods. It is observed from the result of this study that ANN gives better accuracy in comparison conventional model. The accuracy of WS prediction models is found to be dependent on input parameters and architecture type algorithms utilized. So the selection of most relevant input parameters is important research area in WS predicton field.

Discussion and analysis of feature selection using Relief Algorithm (RA) in WS prediction are considered for different Indian sites. RA identify atmospheric pressure, solar radiation and relative humidity are relevant input variables. Based on relevant input variables Cascade ANN model is developed and prediction accuracy is evaluated. It is found that root mean square error (RMSE) for comparison between predicted and measured WS for training and testing wind speed are found to be 1.44 m/s and 1.49 m/s respectively.

We utilize the velocity field matching training scheme in NSGF, which only requires samples from the source and target distribution to compute an empirical velocity field approximation. Our theoretical analyses show that as the sample size increases to infinity, the mean-field limit of the empirical approximation converges to the true underlying velocity field. To further enhance model efficiency on high-dimensional tasks, a two-phase NSGF++ model is devised, which first follows the Sinkhorn flow to approach the image manifold quickly ($\\le 5$ NFEs) and then refines the samples along a simple straight flow. Numerical experiments with synthetic and real-world benchmark datasets support our theoretical results and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods. ",

The question of what constitutes the best counterfactual explanation must consider multiple aspects, where \"distance from the sample\" is the most common. We argue that this requirement frequently leads to explanations that are unlikely and, therefore, of limited value. Here, we present a system that provides high-likelihood explanations. We show that the search for the most likely explanations satisfying many common desiderata for counterfactual explanations can be modeled using mixed-integer optimization (MIO). In the process, we propose an MIO formulation of a Sum-Product Network (SPN) and use the SPN to estimate the likelihood of a counterfactual, which can be of independent interest.

    "abstract": "Post-quantum cryptographic (PQC) algorithms, especially those based on the learning with errors (LWE) problem, have been subjected to several physical attacks in the recent past. Although the attacks broadly belong to two classes - passive side-channel attacks and active fault attacks, the attack strategies vary significantly due to the inherent complexities of such algorithms. Exploring further attack surfaces is, therefore, an important step for eventually securing the deployment of these algorithms. Also, it is important to test the robustness of the already proposed countermeasures in this regard. In this work, we propose a new fault attack on side-channel secure masked implementation of LWE-based key-encapsulation mechanisms (KEMs) exploiting fault propagation. The attack typically originates due to an algorithmic modification widely used to enable masking, namely the Arithmetic-to-Boolean (A2B) conversion. We exploit the data dependency of the adder carry chain in A2B and extract sensitive information, albeit masking (of arbitrary order) being present. As a practical demonstration of the exploitability of this information leakage, we show key recovery attacks of Kyber, although the leakage also exists for other schemes like Saber. The attack on Kyber targets the decapsulation module and utilizes Belief Propagation (BP) for key recovery. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first attack exploiting an algorithmic component introduced to ease masking rather than only exploiting the randomness introduced by masking to obtain desired faults (as done by Delvaux). Finally, we performed both simulated and electromagnetic (EM) fault-based practical validation of the attack for an open-source first-order secure Kyber implementation running on an STM32 platform.

Traditional compression methods such as pruning, distillation, and low-rank approximation focus on reducing the effective number of neurons in the network, while quantization focuses on reducing the numerical precision of individual weights to reduce the model size while keeping the number of neurons fixed. While these compression methods have been relatively successful in practice, there's no compelling reason to believe that truncating the number of neurons is an optimal strategy. In this context, this paper introduces CompactifAI, an innovative LLM compression approach using quantum-inspired Tensor Networks that focuses on the model's correlation space instead, allowing for a more controlled, refined and interpretable model compression. Our method is versatile and can be implemented with - or on top of - other compression techniques. As a benchmark, we demonstrate that CompactifAI alone enables compression of the LlaMA-2 7B model to only $30\\%$ of its original size while recovering over $90\\%$ of the original accuracy after a brief distributed retraining.

Scene graph to image generation is one such task of generating images which are consistent with the given scene graph. However, the complexity of visual scenes poses a challenge in accurately aligning objects based on specified relations within the scene graph. Existing methods approach this task by first predicting a scene layout and generating images from these layouts using adversarial training. In this work, we introduce a novel approach to generate images from scene graphs which eliminates the need of predicting intermediate layouts. We leverage pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models and CLIP guidance to translate graph knowledge into images. Towards this, we first pre-train our graph encoder to align graph features with CLIP features of corresponding images using a GAN based training. Further, we fuse the graph features with CLIP embedding of object labels present in the given scene graph to create a graph consistent CLIP guided conditioning signal. In the conditioning input, object embeddings provide coarse structure of the image and graph features provide structural alignment based on relationships among objects. Finally, we fine tune a pre-trained diffusion model with the graph consistent conditioning signal with reconstruction and CLIP alignment loss. Elaborate experiments reveal that our method outperforms existing methods on standard benchmarks of COCO-stuff and Visual Genome dataset. ",

    "title": "Incorporating Exemplar Optimization into Training with Dual Networks for  Human Mesh Recovery",
    "abstract": "We propose a novel optimization-based human mesh recovery method from a single image. Given a test exemplar, previous approaches optimize the pre-trained regression network to minimize the 2D re-projection loss, which however suffer from over-/under-fitting problems. This is because the ``exemplar optimization'' at testing time has too weak relation to the pre-training process, and the exemplar optimization loss function is different from the training loss function. (1) We incorporate exemplar optimization into the training stage. During training, our method first executes exemplar optimization and subsequently proceeds with training-time optimization. The exemplar optimization may run into a wrong direction, while the subsequent training optimization serves to correct the deviation. Involved in training, the exemplar optimization learns to adapt its behavior to training data, thereby acquires generalibility to test exemplars. (2) We devise a dual-network architecture to convey the novel training paradigm, which is composed of a main regression network and an auxiliary network, in which we can formulate the exemplar optimization loss function in the same form as the training loss function. This further enhances the compatibility between the exemplar and training optimizations. Experiments demonstrate that our exemplar optimization after the novel training scheme significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches. ",

First, we consider the action of a Lie group $G$ on a smooth manifold $M$ and establish the equivalence between equivariance of vector fields, symmetries of the corresponding Cauchy problems, and equivariance of the associated NODEs. We also propose a novel formulation of the equivariant NODEs in terms of the differential invariants of the action of $G$ on $M$, based on Lie theory for symmetries of differential equations, which provides an efficient parameterisation of the space of equivariant vector fields in a way that is agnostic to both the manifold $M$ and the symmetry group $G$. Second, we construct augmented manifold NODEs, through embeddings into equivariant flows, and show that they are universal approximators of equivariant diffeomorphisms on any path-connected $M$. Furthermore, we show that the augmented NODEs can be incorporated in the geometric framework and parameterised using higher order differential invariants. Finally, we consider the induced action of $G$ on different fields on $M$ and show how it can be used to generalise previous work, on, e.g., continuous normalizing flows, to equivariant models in any geometry.

    "abstract": "Graph anomaly detection (GAD) is a challenging binary classification problem due to its different structural distribution between anomalies and normal nodes -- abnormal nodes are a minority, therefore holding high heterophily and low homophily compared to normal nodes. Furthermore, due to various time factors and the annotation preferences of human experts, the heterophily and homophily can change across training and testing data, which is called structural distribution shift (SDS) in this paper. The mainstream methods are built on graph neural networks (GNNs), benefiting the classification of normals from aggregating homophilous neighbors, yet ignoring the SDS issue for anomalies and suffering from poor generalization. This work solves the problem from a feature view. We observe that the degree of SDS varies between anomalies and normal nodes. Hence to address the issue, the key lies in resisting high heterophily for anomalies meanwhile benefiting the learning of normals from homophily. We tease out the anomaly features on which we constrain to mitigate the effect of heterophilous neighbors and make them invariant. We term our proposed framework as Graph Decomposition Network (GDN). Extensive experiments are conducted on two benchmark datasets, and the proposed framework achieves a remarkable performance boost in GAD, especially in an SDS environment where anomalies have largely different structural distribution across training and testing environments.

We show that all three problems can be solved in polynomial time on primitive task networks of constant partial order width (and a generalization thereof), whereas for the latter two problems this holds only under a provably necessary restriction to the state space. Next, we obtain an algorithmic meta-theorem along with corresponding lower bounds to identify tight conditions under which general polynomial-time solvability results can be lifted from primitive to general task networks. Finally, we enrich our investigation by analyzing the parameterized complexity of the three considered problems, and show that (1) fixed-parameter tractability for all three problems can be achieved by replacing the partial order width with the vertex cover number of the network as the parameter, and (2) other classical graph-theoretic parameters of the network (including treewidth, treedepth, and the aforementioned partial order width) do not yield fixed-parameter tractability for any of the three problems.

GitHub Copilot is one such tool that has gained widespread usage. Copilot Chat, released on September 2023, functions as an interactive tool aims at facilitating natural language-powered coding. However, limited attention has been given to understanding code smells in Copilot-generated Python code and Copilot's ability to fix the code smells it generates. To this end, we built a dataset comprising 102 code smells in Copilot-generated Python code. Our aim is to first explore the occurrence of code smells in Copilot-generated Python code and then evaluate the effectiveness of Copilot in fixing these code smells employing different prompts. The results show that 8 out of 10 types of Python smells can be detected in Copilot-generated Python code, among which Multiply-Nested Container is the most common one. For these code smells, Copilot Chat achieves a highest fixing rate of 87.1%, showing promise in fixing Python code smells generated by Copilot itself. Besides, the effectiveness of Copilot Chat in fixing these smells can be improved with the provision of more detailed prompts. However, using Copilot Chat to fix these smells might introduce new code smells. ",

Inspired by the concept of adversarial attacks, our method leverages the idea of introducing slight perturbations to the neural network input, resulting in a substantial impact on the network's performance. By introducing small perturbations to fixed-point modulated codewords before transmission, we effectively improve the decoder's performance without violating the input power constraint. The perturbation design is accomplished by a modified iterative fast gradient method. This study investigates various decoder architectures suitable for computing gradients to obtain the desired perturbations. Specifically, we consider belief propagation (BP) for LDPC codes; the error correcting code transformer, BP and neural BP (NBP) for polar codes, and neural BCJR for convolutional codes. We demonstrate that the proposed friendly attack method can improve the reliability across different channels, modulations, codes, and decoders. This method allows us to increase the reliability of communication with a legacy receiver by simply modifying the transmitted codeword appropriately. ",

Addressing this, we introduce a novel framework, Multi-modal Temporal Relation Graph Learning (MTRGL). MTRGL combines time series data and discrete features into a temporal graph and employs a memory-based temporal graph neural network. This approach reframes temporal correlation identification as a temporal graph link prediction task, which has shown empirical success. Our experiments on real-world datasets confirm the superior performance of MTRGL, emphasizing its promise in refining automated pair trading strategies. ",

This task of layout prediction is valuable in text-to-image synthesis as it allows localized and controlled in-painting of the image. In this comparative study it is shown that we can predict layouts from language representations that implicitly or explicitly encode sentence syntax, if the sentences mention similar entity-relationships to the ones seen during training. To test compositional understanding, we collect a test set of grammatically correct sentences and layouts describing compositions of entities and relations that unlikely have been seen during training. Performance on this test set substantially drops, showing that current models rely on correlations in the training data and have difficulties in understanding the structure of the input sentences. We propose a novel structural loss function that better enforces the syntactic structure of the input sentence and show large performance gains in the task of 2D spatial layout prediction conditioned on text. The loss has the potential to be used in other generation tasks where a tree-like structure underlies the conditioning modality.

    "abstract": "This study developed a generative adversarial network (GAN)-based defense method for traffic sign classification in an autonomous vehicle (AV), referred to as the attack-resilient GAN (AR-GAN). The novelty of the AR-GAN lies in (i) assuming zero knowledge of adversarial attack models and samples and (ii) providing consistently high traffic sign classification performance under various adversarial attack types. The AR-GAN classification system consists of a generator that denoises an image by reconstruction, and a classifier that classifies the reconstructed image. The authors have tested the AR-GAN under no-attack and under various adversarial attacks, such as Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM), DeepFool, Carlini and Wagner (C&W), and Projected Gradient Descent (PGD). The authors considered two forms of these attacks, i.e., (i) black-box attacks (assuming the attackers possess no prior knowledge of the classifier), and (ii) white-box attacks (assuming the attackers possess full knowledge of the classifier). The classification performance of the AR-GAN was compared with several benchmark adversarial defense methods. The results showed that both the AR-GAN and the benchmark defense methods are resilient against black-box attacks and could achieve similar classification performance to that of the unperturbed images. However, for all the white-box attacks considered in this study, the AR-GAN method outperformed the benchmark defense methods. In addition, the AR-GAN was able to maintain its high classification performance under varied white-box adversarial perturbation magnitudes, whereas the performance of the other defense methods dropped abruptly at increased perturbation magnitudes.

This is a task that is often hampered by severely imbalanced datasets, where positive cases can be quite rare. Their use is further compromised by their limited interpretability, which is becoming increasingly important. While post-hoc interpretability techniques such as SHAP and LIME have been used with some success on so-called black box models, the use of inherently understandable models makes such endeavors more fruitful. This paper addresses these issues by demonstrating how a relatively new synthetic data generation technique, STEM, can be used to produce data to train models produced by Grammatical Evolution (GE) that are inherently understandable. STEM is a recently introduced combination of the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE), Edited Nearest Neighbour (ENN), and Mixup; it has previously been successfully used to tackle both between class and within class imbalance issues. We test our technique on the Digital Database for Screening Mammography (DDSM) and the Wisconsin Breast Cancer (WBC) datasets and compare Area Under the Curve (AUC) results with an ensemble of the top three performing classifiers from a set of eight standard ML classifiers with varying degrees of interpretability. We demonstrate that the GE-derived models present the best AUC while still maintaining interpretable solutions. ",

    "abstract": "Modern plankton high-throughput monitoring relies on deep learning classifiers for species recognition in water ecosystems. Despite satisfactory nominal performances, a significant challenge arises from Dataset Shift, which causes performances to drop during deployment. In our study, we integrate the ZooLake dataset with manually-annotated images from 10 independent days of deployment, serving as test cells to benchmark Out-Of-Dataset (OOD) performances. Our analysis reveals instances where classifiers, initially performing well in In-Dataset conditions, encounter notable failures in practical scenarios. For example, a MobileNet with a 92% nominal test accuracy shows a 77% OOD accuracy. We systematically investigate conditions leading to OOD performance drops and propose a preemptive assessment method to identify potential pitfalls when classifying new data, and pinpoint features in OOD images that adversely impact classification. We present a three-step pipeline: (i) identifying OOD degradation compared to nominal test performance, (ii) conducting a diagnostic analysis of degradation causes, and (iii) providing solutions. We find that ensembles of BEiT vision transformers, with targeted augmentations addressing OOD robustness, geometric ensembling, and rotation-based test-time augmentation, constitute the most robust model, which we call BEsT model. It achieves an 83% OOD accuracy, with errors concentrated on container classes. Moreover, it exhibits lower sensitivity to dataset shift, and reproduces well the plankton abundances. Our proposed pipeline is applicable to generic plankton classifiers, contingent on the availability of suitable test cells. By identifying critical shortcomings and offering practical procedures to fortify models against dataset shift, our study contributes to the development of more reliable plankton classification technologies.

    "abstract": "We present an approach for the data-driven modeling of nonlinear viscoelastic materials at small strains which is based on physics-augmented neural networks (NNs) and requires only stress and strain paths for training. The model is built on the concept of generalized standard materials and is therefore thermodynamically consistent by construction. It consists of a free energy and a dissipation potential, which can be either expressed by the components of their tensor arguments or by a suitable set of invariants. The two potentials are described by fully/partially input convex neural networks. For training of the NN model by paths of stress and strain, an efficient and flexible training method based on a recurrent cell, particularly a long short-term memory cell, is developed to automatically generate the internal variable(s) during the training process. The proposed method is benchmarked and thoroughly compared with existing approaches. These include a method that obtains the internal variable by integrating the evolution equation over the entire sequence, while the other method uses an an auxiliary feedforward neural network for the internal variable(s). Databases for training are generated by using a conventional nonlinear viscoelastic reference model, where 3D and 2D plane strain data with either ideal or noisy stresses are generated. The coordinate-based and the invariant-based formulation are compared and the advantages of the latter are demonstrated. Afterwards, the invariant-based model is calibrated by applying the three training methods using ideal or noisy stress data. All methods yield good results, but differ in computation time and usability for large data sets. The presented training method based on a recurrent cell turns out to be particularly robust and widely applicable and thus represents a promising approach for the calibration of other types of models as well.

However, code snippets on Q&A sites are usually uncompilable and semantically incomplete for compilation due to unresolved types and missing dependent libraries, which raises the obstacle for users to reuse or analyze Q&A code snippets. Prior approaches either are not designed for synthesizing compilable code or suffer from a low compilation success rate. To address this problem, we propose ZS4C, a lightweight approach to perform zero-shot synthesis of compilable code from incomplete code snippets using Large Language Model (LLM). ZS4C operates in two stages. In the first stage, ZS4C utilizes an LLM, i.e., ChatGPT, to identify missing import statements for a given code snippet, leveraging our designed task-specific prompt template. In the second stage, ZS4C fixes compilation errors caused by incorrect import statements and syntax errors through collaborative work between ChatGPT and a compiler. We thoroughly evaluated ZS4C on a widely used benchmark called StatType-SO against the SOTA approach SnR. Compared with SnR, ZS4C improves the compilation rate from 63% to 87.6%, with a 39.3% improvement. On average, ZS4C can infer more accurate import statements than SnR, with an improvement of 6.6% in the F1. ",

    "abstract": "Low-dose PET offers a valuable means of minimizing radiation exposure in PET imaging. However, the prevalent practice of employing additional CT scans for generating attenuation maps (u-map) for PET attenuation correction significantly elevates radiation doses. To address this concern and further mitigate radiation exposure in low-dose PET exams, we propose POUR-Net - an innovative population-prior-aided over-under-representation network that aims for high-quality attenuation map generation from low-dose PET. First, POUR-Net incorporates an over-under-representation network (OUR-Net) to facilitate efficient feature extraction, encompassing both low-resolution abstracted and fine-detail features, for assisting deep generation on the full-resolution level. Second, complementing OUR-Net, a population prior generation machine (PPGM) utilizing a comprehensive CT-derived u-map dataset, provides additional prior information to aid OUR-Net generation. The integration of OUR-Net and PPGM within a cascade framework enables iterative refinement of $\\mu$-map generation, resulting in the production of high-quality $\\mu$-maps. Experimental results underscore the effectiveness of POUR-Net, showing it as a promising solution for accurate CT-free low-count PET attenuation correction, which also surpasses the performance of previous baseline methods.

    "abstract": "The field of natural language processing (NLP) has witnessed significant progress in recent years, with a notable focus on improving large language models' (LLM) performance through innovative prompting techniques. Among these, prompt engineering coupled with structures has emerged as a promising paradigm, with designs such as Chain-of-Thought, Tree of Thoughts, or Graph of Thoughts, in which the overall LLM reasoning is guided by a structure such as a graph. As illustrated with numerous examples, this paradigm significantly enhances the LLM's capability to solve numerous tasks, ranging from logical or mathematical reasoning to planning or creative writing. To facilitate the understanding of this growing field and pave the way for future developments, we devise a general blueprint for effective and efficient LLM reasoning schemes. For this, we conduct an in-depth analysis of the prompt execution pipeline, clarifying and clearly defining different concepts. We then build the first taxonomy of structure-enhanced LLM reasoning schemes. We focus on identifying fundamental classes of harnessed structures, and we analyze the representations of these structures, algorithms executed with these structures, and many others. We refer to these structures as reasoning topologies, because their representation becomes to a degree spatial, as they are contained within the LLM context. Our study compares existing prompting schemes using the proposed taxonomy, discussing how certain design choices lead to different patterns in performance and cost. We also outline theoretical underpinnings, relationships between prompting and others parts of the LLM ecosystem such as knowledge bases, and the associated research challenges. Our work will help to advance future prompt engineering techniques. ",

    "abstract": "In the age of digital music streaming, playlists on platforms like Spotify have become an integral part of individuals' musical experiences. People create and publicly share their own playlists to express their musical tastes, promote the discovery of their favorite artists, and foster social connections. These publicly accessible playlists transcend the boundaries of mere musical preferences: they serve as sources of rich insights into users' attributes and identities. For example, the musical preferences of elderly individuals may lean more towards Frank Sinatra, while Billie Eilish remains a favored choice among teenagers. These playlists thus become windows into the diverse and evolving facets of one's musical identity. In this work, we investigate the relationship between Spotify users' attributes and their public playlists. In particular, we focus on identifying recurring musical characteristics associated with users' individual attributes, such as demographics, habits, or personality traits. To this end, we conducted an online survey involving 739 Spotify users, yielding a dataset of 10,286 publicly shared playlists encompassing over 200,000 unique songs and 55,000 artists. Through extensive statistical analyses, we first assess a deep connection between a user's Spotify playlists and their real-life attributes. For instance, we found individuals high in openness often create playlists featuring a diverse array of artists, while female users prefer Pop and K-pop music genres. Building upon these observed associations, we create accurate predictive models for users' attributes, presenting a novel DeepSet application that outperforms baselines in most of these users' attributes.

We introduce a diverse people image ranking method which more flexibly aligns with human notions of people diversity in a less prescriptive, label-free manner. The Perception-Aligned Text-derived Human representation Space (PATHS) aims to capture all or many relevant features of people-related diversity, and, when used as the representation space in the standard Maximal Marginal Relevance (MMR) ranking algorithm, is better able to surface a range of types of people-related diversity (e.g. disability, cultural attire). PATHS is created in two stages. First, a text-guided approach is used to extract a person-diversity representation from a pre-trained image-text model. Then this representation is fine-tuned on perception judgments from human annotators so that it captures the aspects of people-related similarity that humans find most salient. Empirical results show that the PATHS method achieves diversity better than baseline methods, according to side-by-side ratings from human annotators. ",

    "abstract": "Accurate and comprehensive semantic segmentation of Bird's Eye View (BEV) is essential for ensuring safe and proactive navigation in autonomous driving. Although cooperative perception has exceeded the detection capabilities of single-agent systems, prevalent camera-based algorithms in cooperative perception neglect valuable information derived from historical observations. This limitation becomes critical during sensor failures or communication issues as cooperative perception reverts to single-agent perception, leading to degraded performance and incomplete BEV segmentation maps. This paper introduces TempCoBEV, a temporal module designed to incorporate historical cues into current observations, thereby improving the quality and reliability of BEV map segmentations. We propose an importance-guided attention architecture to effectively integrate temporal information that prioritizes relevant properties for BEV map segmentation. TempCoBEV is an independent temporal module that seamlessly integrates into state-of-the-art camera-based cooperative perception models. We demonstrate through extensive experiments on the OPV2V dataset that TempCoBEV performs better than non-temporal models in predicting current and future BEV map segmentations, particularly in scenarios involving communication failures. We show the efficacy of TempCoBEV and its capability to integrate historical cues into the current BEV map, improving predictions under optimal communication conditions by up to 2% and under communication failures by up to 19%. The code will be published on GitHub. ",

    "abstract": "There has recently been an explosion of interest in how \"higher-order\" structures emerge in complex systems. This \"emergent\" organization has been found in a variety of natural and artificial systems, although at present the field lacks a unified understanding of what the consequences of higher-order synergies and redundancies are for systems. Typical research treat the presence (or absence) of synergistic information as a dependent variable and report changes in the level of synergy in response to some change in the system. Here, we attempt to flip the script: rather than treating higher-order information as a dependent variable, we use evolutionary optimization to evolve boolean networks with significant higher-order redundancies, synergies, or statistical complexity. We then analyse these evolved populations of networks using established tools for characterizing discrete dynamics: the number of attractors, average transient length, and Derrida coefficient. We also assess the capacity of the systems to integrate information. We find that high-synergy systems are unstable and chaotic, but with a high capacity to integrate information. In contrast, evolved redundant systems are extremely stable, but have negligible capacity to integrate information. Finally, the complex systems that balance integration and segregation (known as Tononi-Sporns-Edelman complexity) show features of both chaosticity and stability, with a greater capacity to integrate information than the redundant systems while being more stable than the random and synergistic systems. We conclude that there may be a fundamental trade-off between the robustness of a systems dynamics and its capacity to integrate information (which inherently requires flexibility and sensitivity), and that certain kinds of complexity naturally balance this trade-off.

For instance, consider a bibliographic network, with nodes representing authors and conferences with properties such as gender and location respectively, and edges representing collaboration between authors and publications in conferences. A key challenge in studying temporal graphs lies in detecting interesting events in their evolution, defined as time intervals of significant stability, growth, or shrinkage. To address this challenge, we build aggregated graphs, where nodes are grouped based on the values of their properties, and seek events at the aggregated level, for example, time intervals of significant growth in the collaborations between authors of the same gender. To locate such events, we propose a novel approach based on unified evolution skylines. A unified evolution skyline assesses the significance of an event in conjunction with the duration of the interval in which the event occurs. Significance is measured by a set of counts, where each count refers to the number of graph elements that remain stable, are created, or deleted, for a specific property value. For example, for property gender, we measure the number of female-female, female-male, and male-male collaborations. Lastly, we share experimental findings that highlight the efficiency and effectiveness of our approach. ",

    "abstract": "This paper introduces a novel paradigm for the generalizable neural radiance field (NeRF). Previous generic NeRF methods combine multiview stereo techniques with image-based neural rendering for generalization, yielding impressive results, while suffering from three issues. First, occlusions often result in inconsistent feature matching. Then, they deliver distortions and artifacts in geometric discontinuities and locally sharp shapes due to their individual process of sampled points and rough feature aggregation. Third, their image-based representations experience severe degradations when source views are not near enough to the target view. To address challenges, we propose the first paradigm that constructs the generalizable neural field based on point-based rather than image-based rendering, which we call the Generalizable neural Point Field (GPF). Our approach explicitly models visibilities by geometric priors and augments them with neural features. We propose a novel nonuniform log sampling strategy to improve both rendering speed and reconstruction quality. Moreover, we present a learnable kernel spatially augmented with features for feature aggregations, mitigating distortions at places with drastically varying geometries. Besides, our representation can be easily manipulated. Experiments show that our model can deliver better geometries, view consistencies, and rendering quality than all counterparts and benchmarks on three datasets in both generalization and finetuning settings, preliminarily proving the potential of the new paradigm for generalizable NeRF.

    "abstract": "Inverse problems in granular flows, such as landslides and debris flows, involve estimating material parameters or boundary conditions based on target runout profile. Traditional high-fidelity simulators for these inverse problems are computationally demanding, restricting the number of simulations possible. Additionally, their non-differentiable nature makes gradient-based optimization methods, known for their efficiency in high-dimensional problems, inapplicable. While machine learning-based surrogate models offer computational efficiency and differentiability, they often struggle to generalize beyond their training data due to their reliance on low-dimensional input-output mappings that fail to capture the complete physics of granular flows. We propose a novel differentiable graph neural network simulator (GNS) by combining reverse mode automatic differentiation of graph neural networks with gradient-based optimization for solving inverse problems. GNS learns the dynamics of granular flow by representing the system as a graph and predicts the evolution of the graph at the next time step, given the current state. The differentiable GNS shows optimization capabilities beyond the training data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method for inverse estimation across single and multi-parameter optimization problems, including evaluating material properties and boundary conditions for a target runout distance and designing baffle locations to limit a landslide runout. Our proposed differentiable GNS framework offers an orders of magnitude faster solution to these inverse problems than the conventional finite difference approach to gradient-based optimization. ",

    "abstract": "Graph topology inference, i.e., learning graphs from a given set of nodal observations, is a significant task in many application domains. Existing approaches are mostly limited to learning a single graph assuming that the observed data is homogeneous. This is problematic because many modern datasets are heterogeneous or mixed and involve multiple related graphs, i.e., multiview graphs. Recent work proposing to learn multiview graphs ensures the similarity of learned view graphs through pairwise regularization, where each pair of views is encouraged to have similar structures. However, this approach cannot infer the shared structure across views. In this work, we propose an alternative method based on consensus regularization, where views are ensured to be similar through a learned consensus graph representing the common structure of the views. In particular, we propose an optimization problem, where graph data is assumed to be smooth over the multiview graph and the topology of the individual views and that of the consensus graph are learned, simultaneously. Our optimization problem is designed to be general in the sense that different regularization functions can be used depending on what the shared structure across views is. Moreover, we propose two regularization functions that extend fused and group graphical lasso to consensus based regularization. Proposed multiview graph learning is evaluated on simulated data and shown to have better performance than existing methods. It is also employed to infer the functional brain connectivity networks of multiple subjects from their electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings. The proposed method reveals the structure shared by subjects as well as the characteristics unique to each subject. ",

Recent research suggests that utilizing plaque segmentation as an auxiliary task for classification can enhance performance by leveraging the correlation between segmentation and classification tasks. However, this approach relies on obtaining a substantial amount of challenging-to-acquire segmentation annotations. This paper proposes a novel weakly supervised auxiliary task learning network model (WAL-Net) to explore the interdependence between carotid plaque classification and segmentation tasks. The plaque classification task is primary task, while the plaque segmentation task serves as an auxiliary task, providing valuable information to enhance the performance of the primary task. Weakly supervised learning is adopted in the auxiliary task to completely break away from the dependence on segmentation annotations. Experiments and evaluations are conducted on a dataset comprising 1270 carotid plaque ultrasound images from Wuhan University Zhongnan Hospital. Results indicate that the proposed method achieved an approximately 1.3% improvement in carotid plaque classification accuracy compared to the baseline network. Specifically, the accuracy of mixed-echoic plaques classification increased by approximately 3.3%, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach. ",

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in neural compression have surpassed traditional codecs in PSNR and MS-SSIM measurements. However, at low bit-rates, these methods can introduce visually displeasing artifacts, such as blurring, color shifting, and texture loss, thereby compromising perceptual quality of images. To address these issues, this study presents an enhanced neural compression method designed for optimal visual fidelity. We have trained our model with a sophisticated semantic ensemble loss, integrating Charbonnier loss, perceptual loss, style loss, and a non-binary adversarial loss, to enhance the perceptual quality of image reconstructions. Additionally, we have implemented a latent refinement process to generate content-aware latent codes. These codes adhere to bit-rate constraints, balance the trade-off between distortion and fidelity, and prioritize bit allocation to regions of greater importance. Our empirical findings demonstrate that this approach significantly improves the statistical fidelity of neural image compression. On CLIC2024 validation set, our approach achieves a 62% bitrate saving compared to MS-ILLM under FID metric. ",

    "title": "GQHAN: A Grover-inspired Quantum Hard Attention Network",
    "abstract": "Numerous current Quantum Machine Learning (QML) models exhibit an inadequacy in discerning the significance of quantum data, resulting in diminished efficacy when handling extensive quantum datasets. Hard Attention Mechanism (HAM), anticipated to efficiently tackle the above QML bottlenecks, encounters the substantial challenge of non-differentiability, consequently constraining its extensive applicability. In response to the dilemma of HAM and QML, a Grover-inspired Quantum Hard Attention Mechanism (GQHAM) consisting of a Flexible Oracle (FO) and an Adaptive Diffusion Operator (ADO) is proposed. Notably, the FO is designed to surmount the non-differentiable issue by executing the activation or masking of Discrete Primitives (DPs) with Flexible Control (FC) to weave various discrete destinies. Based on this, such discrete choice can be visualized with a specially defined Quantum Hard Attention Score (QHAS). Furthermore, a trainable ADO is devised to boost the generality and flexibility of GQHAM. At last, a Grover-inspired Quantum Hard Attention Network (GQHAN) based on QGHAM is constructed on PennyLane platform for Fashion MNIST binary classification. Experimental findings demonstrate that GQHAN adeptly surmounts the non-differentiability hurdle, surpassing the efficacy of extant quantum soft self-attention mechanisms in accuracies and learning ability. In noise experiments, GQHAN is robuster to bit-flip noise in accuracy and amplitude damping noise in learning performance. Predictably, the proposal of GQHAN enriches the Quantum Attention Mechanism (QAM), lays the foundation for future quantum computers to process large-scale data, and promotes the development of quantum computer vision.

    "abstract": "This paper studies the statistical characterization of ground-to-UAV (G2A) and reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted UAV-to-ground (A2G) communications in terrestrial and non-terrestrial networks under the impact of channel aging. We first model the G2A and A2G signal-to-noise ratios as non-central complex Gaussian quadratic random variables (RVs) and derive their exact probability density functions, offering a unique characterization for the A2G SNR as the product of two scaled non-central chi-square RVs. Moreover, we also find that, for a large number of RIS elements, the RIS-assisted A2G channel can be characterized as a single Rician fading channel. Our results reveal the presence of channel hardening in A2G communication under low UAV speeds, where we derive the maximum target spectral efficiency (SE) for a system to maintain a consistent required outage level. Meanwhile, high UAV speeds, exceeding 50 m/s, lead to a significant performance degradation, which cannot be mitigated by increasing the number of RIS elements. ",

    "abstract": "In today's data-driven world, the proliferation of publicly available information intensifies the challenge of information leakage (IL), raising security concerns. IL involves unintentionally exposing secret (sensitive) information to unauthorized parties via systems' observable information. Conventional statistical approaches, which estimate mutual information (MI) between observable and secret information for detecting IL, face challenges such as the curse of dimensionality, convergence, computational complexity, and MI misestimation. Furthermore, emerging supervised machine learning (ML) methods, though effective, are limited to binary system-sensitive information and lack a comprehensive theoretical framework. To address these limitations, we establish a theoretical framework using statistical learning theory and information theory to accurately quantify and detect IL. We demonstrate that MI can be accurately estimated by approximating the log-loss and accuracy of the Bayes predictor. As the Bayes predictor is typically unknown in practice, we propose to approximate it with the help of automated machine learning (AutoML). First, we compare our MI estimation approaches against current baselines, using synthetic data sets generated using the multivariate normal (MVN) distribution with known MI. Second, we introduce a cut-off technique using one-sided statistical tests to detect IL, employing the Holm-Bonferroni correction to increase confidence in detection decisions. Our study evaluates IL detection performance on real-world data sets, highlighting the effectiveness of the Bayes predictor's log-loss estimation, and finds our proposed method to effectively estimate MI on synthetic data sets and thus detect ILs accurately.

    "abstract": "Recent TTS models with decoder-only Transformer architecture, such as SPEAR-TTS and VALL-E, achieve impressive naturalness and demonstrate the ability for zero-shot adaptation given a speech prompt. However, such decoder-only TTS models lack monotonic alignment constraints, sometimes leading to hallucination issues such as mispronunciation, word skipping and difficulty in stopping. To address this limitation, we propose VALL-T, a generative Transducer model that introduces shifting relative position embeddings for input phoneme sequence, explicitly indicating the monotonic generation process while maintaining the architecture of decoder-only Transformer. Consequently, VALL-T retains the capability of prompt-based zero-shot adaptation and demonstrates better robustness against hallucinations with a relative reduction of 28.3\\% in the word error rate. Furthermore, the controllability of alignment in VALL-T during decoding facilitates the use of untranscribed speech prompts, even in unknown languages. It also enables the synthesis of lengthy speech by utilizing an aligned context window. ",
