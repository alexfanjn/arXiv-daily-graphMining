    "abstract": "Knowledge graph embedding transforms knowledge graphs into a continuous, low-dimensional space, facilitating inference and completion tasks. This field is mainly divided into translational distance models and semantic matching models. A key challenge in translational distance models is their inability to effectively differentiate between 'head' and 'tail' entities in graphs. To address this, the novel location-sensitive embedding (LSE) method has been developed. LSE innovatively modifies the head entity using relation-specific mappings, conceptualizing relations as linear transformations rather than mere translations. The theoretical foundations of LSE, including its representational capabilities and its connections to existing models, have been thoroughly examined. A more streamlined variant, LSEd, employs a diagonal matrix for transformations to enhance practical efficiency. In tests conducted on four large-scale datasets for link prediction, LSEd either outperforms or is competitive with leading contemporary models. ",

The run-time visual presentation of barren plateau situations is helpful for real-time quantum-based advanced IoT software testing because the software engineers can easily be aware of the training performances of QNN. Moreover, this tool is obviously useful for software engineers because it can intuitively guide them in designing and implementing high-accurate QNN-based advanced IoT software even if they are not familiar with quantum mechanics and quantum computing.

Unlike any previous activations, HOSC has been specifically designed to better capture sudden changes in the input signal, and hence sharp or acute features of the underlying data, as well as smooth low-frequency transitions. Due to its simplicity and modularity, HOSC offers a plug-and-play functionality that can be easily incorporated into any existing method employing a neural network as a way of implicitly representing a signal. We benchmark HOSC against other popular activations in an array of general tasks, empirically showing an improvement in the quality of obtained representations, provide the mathematical motivation behind the efficacy of HOSC, and discuss its limitations.

    "abstract": "Vehicles today comprise intelligent systems like connected autonomous driving and advanced driving assistance systems (ADAS) to enhance the driving experience, which is enabled through increased connectivity to infrastructure and fusion of information from different sensing modes. However, the rising connectivity coupled with the legacy network architecture within vehicles can be exploited for launching active and passive attacks on critical vehicle systems and directly affecting the safety of passengers. Machine learning-based intrusion detection models have been shown to successfully detect multiple targeted attack vectors in recent literature, whose deployments are enabled through quantised neural networks targeting low-power platforms. Multiple models are often required to simultaneously detect multiple attack vectors, increasing the area, (resource) cost, and energy consumption. In this paper, we present a case for utilising custom-quantised MLP's (CQMLP) as a multi-class classification model, capable of detecting multiple attacks from the benign flow of controller area network (CAN) messages. The specific quantisation and neural architecture are determined through a joint design space exploration, resulting in our choice of the 2-bit precision and the n-layer MLP. Our 2-bit version is trained using Brevitas and optimised as a dataflow hardware model through the FINN toolflow from AMD/Xilinx, targeting an XCZU7EV device. We show that the 2-bit CQMLP model, when integrated as the IDS, can detect malicious attack messages (DoS, fuzzing, and spoofing attack) with a very high accuracy of 99.9%, on par with the state-of-the-art methods in the literature. Furthermore, the dataflow model can perform line rate detection at a latency of 0.11 ms from message reception while consuming 0.23 mJ/inference, making it ideally suited for integration with an ECU in critical CAN networks.

Unfortunately, journalists also regularly endure significant online harassment on social media platforms, ranging from personal attacks to doxxing to threats of physical harm. In this paper, we seek to understand how we can make social media usable for journalists who face constant digital harassment. To begin, we conduct a set of need-finding interviews to understand where existing platform tools and newsroom resources fall short in adequately protecting journalists. We map journalists' unmet needs to concrete design goals, which we use to build PressProtect, an interface that provides journalists greater agency over engaging with readers on Twitter/X. Through user testing with eight journalists, we evaluate PressProtect and find that participants felt it effectively protected them against harassment and could also generalize to serve other visible and vulnerable groups. We conclude with a discussion of our findings and recommendations for social platforms hoping to build defensive defaults for journalists facing online harassment. ",

Machine learning methods have achieved good success by learning graph neural networks to model spatial interactions. However, these approaches do not faithfully capture temporal correlations since they only model next-step predictions. In this work, we propose Equivariant Graph Neural Operator (EGNO), a novel and principled method that directly models dynamics as trajectories instead of just next-step prediction. Different from existing methods, EGNO explicitly learns the temporal evolution of 3D dynamics where we formulate the dynamics as a function over time and learn neural operators to approximate it. To capture the temporal correlations while keeping the intrinsic SE(3)-equivariance, we develop equivariant temporal convolutions parameterized in the Fourier space and build EGNO by stacking the Fourier layers over equivariant networks. EGNO is the first operator learning framework that is capable of modeling solution dynamics functions over time while retaining 3D equivariance. Comprehensive experiments in multiple domains, including particle simulations, human motion capture, and molecular dynamics, demonstrate the significantly superior performance of EGNO against existing methods, thanks to the equivariant temporal modeling.

We introduce a novel methodology for the comparative analysis of intricate material expressions, emphasising the standardisation of chemical formulas to tackle the complexities inherent in materials science information assessment. To this end, we primarily focus on two critical tasks of information extraction: (i) a named entity recognition (NER) of studied materials and physical properties and (ii) a relation extraction (RE) between these entities. The performance of LLMs in executing these tasks is benchmarked against traditional models based on the BERT architecture and rule-based approaches. For NER, LLMs fail to outperform the baseline with zero-shot prompting and exhibit only limited improvement with few-shot prompting. However, for RE, a GPT-3.5-Turbo fine-tuned with the appropriate strategy outperforms all models, including the baseline. Without any fine-tuning, GPT-4 and GPT-4-Turbo display remarkable reasoning and relationship extraction capabilities after being provided with merely a couple of examples, surpassing the baseline. Overall, the results suggest that although LLMs demonstrate relevant reasoning skills in connecting concepts, for tasks requiring extracting complex domain-specific entities like materials, specialised models are currently a better choice.

In the proposed algorithm, signals are detected based on layers processed by multiple SIC-MMSE linear filters for each sub-channel, with interference on the targeted signal layer being successively canceled either by hard or soft information. To reduce the complexity of computing individual layer filter coefficients, we also propose a novel filter coefficients recycling approach in place of generating the exact form of MMSE filter weights. Moreover, we design a joint detection and decoding algorithm for ZP-OTFS to enhance error performance. Compared to the conventional SIC-MMSE detection, our proposed algorithms outperform other linear detectors, e.g., maximal ratio combining (MRC), for ZP-OTFS with up to 3 dB gain while maintaining comparable computation complexity.

Recent data indicates that the number of such attacks has increased by over 100 percent, highlighting the urgent need for robust cybersecurity measures to mitigate these threats. In addition, a cyber-attack will begin to spread malware across the network once it has successfully compromised an IoT network. However, to mitigate this attack, a new patch must be applied immediately. In reality, the time required to prepare and apply the new patch can vary significantly depending on the nature of the cyber-attack. In this paper, we address the issue of how to mitigate cyber-attacks before the new patch is applied by formulating an optimal control strategy that reduces the impact of malware propagation and minimise the number of infected devices across IoT networks in the smart home. A novel node-based epidemiological model susceptible, infected high, infected low, recover first, and recover complete(SI_HI_LR_FR_C) is established with immediate response state for the restricted environment. After that, the impact of malware on IoT devices using both high and low infected rates will be analyzed. Finally, to illustrate the main results, several numerical analyses are carried out in addition to simulate the real-world scenario of IoT networks in the smart home, we built a dataset to be used in the experiments.

    "abstract": "Domain shift poses a significant challenge in Cross-Domain Facial Expression Recognition (CD-FER) due to the distribution variation across different domains. Current works mainly focus on learning domain-invariant features through global feature adaptation, while neglecting the transferability of local features. Additionally, these methods lack discriminative supervision during training on target datasets, resulting in deteriorated feature representation in target domain. To address these limitations, we propose an Adaptive Global-Local Representation Learning and Selection (AGLRLS) framework. The framework incorporates global-local adversarial adaptation and semantic-aware pseudo label generation to enhance the learning of domain-invariant and discriminative feature during training. Meanwhile, a global-local prediction consistency learning is introduced to improve classification results during inference. Specifically, the framework consists of separate global-local adversarial learning modules that learn domain-invariant global and local features independently. We also design a semantic-aware pseudo label generation module, which computes semantic labels based on global and local features. Moreover, a novel dynamic threshold strategy is employed to learn the optimal thresholds by leveraging independent prediction of global and local features, ensuring filtering out the unreliable pseudo labels while retaining reliable ones. These labels are utilized for model optimization through the adversarial learning process in an end-to-end manner. During inference, a global-local prediction consistency module is developed to automatically learn an optimal result from multiple predictions. We conduct comprehensive experiments and analysis based on a fair evaluation benchmark.

Recently, Graph Neural Networks (GNN) have gained popularity in recommendation tasks due to their ability to capture high-order interactions between users and items.

To address this limitation, some methods create pseudo-interacted items or users in the graph to compensate for missing information for each client. Unfortunately, these methods introduce random noise and raise privacy concerns. In this paper, we propose FedRKG, a novel federated recommendation system, where a global knowledge graph (KG) is constructed and maintained on the server using publicly available item information, enabling higher-order user-item interactions. On the client side, a relation-aware GNN model leverages diverse KG relationships. To protect local interaction items and obscure gradients, we employ pseudo-labeling and Local Differential Privacy (LDP). Extensive experiments conducted on three real-world datasets demonstrate the competitive performance of our approach compared to centralized algorithms while ensuring privacy preservation. Moreover, FedRKG achieves an average accuracy improvement of 4% compared to existing federated learning baselines. ",

Most of the current SV datasets rely on SV-fixing commits to extract vulnerable functions and lines. However, none of these datasets have considered latent SVs existing between the introduction and fix of the collected SVs. There is also little known about the usefulness of these latent SVs for SV prediction. To bridge these gaps, we conduct a large-scale study on the latent vulnerable functions in two commonly used SV datasets and their utilization for function-level and line-level SV predictions. Leveraging the state-of-the-art SZZ algorithm, we identify more than 100k latent vulnerable functions in the studied datasets. We find that these latent functions can increase the number of SVs by 4x on average and correct up to 5k mislabeled functions, yet they have a noise level of around 6%. Despite the noise, we show that the state-of-the-art SV prediction model can significantly benefit from such latent SVs. The improvements are up to 24.5% in the performance (F1-Score) of function-level SV predictions and up to 67% in the effectiveness of localizing vulnerable lines.

Our architecture overcomes the limitations of large-scale graphs containing connections irrelevant to sleep behavior by devising an attention mechanism. The extensive experimental evaluation highlights the improvement provided by incorporating social networks in the model. Additionally, we conduct robustness analysis to demonstrate the system's performance in real-life conditions. The outcomes affirm the stability of SPAND against perturbations in input data. Further analyses emphasize the significance of network topology in prediction performance revealing that users with higher eigenvalue centrality are more vulnerable to data perturbations. ",

    "title": "DengueNet: Dengue Prediction using Spatiotemporal Satellite Imagery for  Resource-Limited Countries",
    "abstract": "Dengue fever presents a substantial challenge in developing countries where sanitation infrastructure is inadequate. The absence of comprehensive healthcare systems exacerbates the severity of dengue infections, potentially leading to life-threatening circumstances. Rapid response to dengue outbreaks is also challenging due to limited information exchange and integration. While timely dengue outbreak forecasts have the potential to prevent such outbreaks, the majority of dengue prediction studies have predominantly relied on data that impose significant burdens on individual countries for collection. In this study, our aim is to improve health equity in resource-constrained countries by exploring the effectiveness of high-resolution satellite imagery as a nontraditional and readily accessible data source. By leveraging the wealth of publicly available and easily obtainable satellite imagery, we present a scalable satellite extraction framework based on Sentinel Hub, a cloud-based computing platform. Furthermore, we introduce DengueNet, an innovative architecture that combines Vision Transformer, Radiomics, and Long Short-term Memory to extract and integrate spatiotemporal features from satellite images. This enables dengue predictions on an epi-week basis. To evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed method, we conducted experiments on five municipalities in Colombia. We utilized a dataset comprising 780 high-resolution Sentinel-2 satellite images for training and evaluation. The performance of DengueNet was assessed using the mean absolute error (MAE) metric. Across the five municipalities, DengueNet achieved an average MAE of 43.92. Our findings strongly support the efficacy of satellite imagery as a valuable resource for dengue prediction, particularly in informing public health policies within countries where manually collected data is scarce and dengue virus prevalence is severe.

Meanwhile, the privacy protection issue caused by ultra-high definition (HD) RGB cameras aroused more and more people's attention. Inspired by the success of event cameras which perform better on high dynamic range, no motion blur, and low energy consumption, we propose to recognize human actions based on the event stream. We propose a lightweight uncertainty-aware information propagation based Mobile-Former network for efficient pattern recognition, which aggregates the MobileNet and Transformer network effectively. Specifically, we first embed the event images using a stem network into feature representations, then, feed them into uncertainty-aware Mobile-Former blocks for local and global feature learning and fusion. Finally, the features from MobileNet and Transformer branches are concatenated for pattern recognition. Extensive experiments on multiple event-based recognition datasets fully validated the effectiveness of our model.

    "abstract": "Few-shot object detection(FSOD) aims to design methods to adapt object detectors efficiently with only few annotated samples. Fine-tuning has been shown to be an effective and practical approach. However, previous works often take the classical base-novel two stage fine-tuning procedure but ignore the implicit stability-plasticity contradiction among different modules. Specifically, the random re-initialized classifiers need more plasticity to adapt to novel samples. The other modules inheriting pre-trained weights demand more stability to reserve their class-agnostic knowledge. Regular fine-tuning which couples the optimization of these two parts hurts the model generalization in FSOD scenarios. In this paper, we find that this problem is prominent in the end-to-end object detector Sparse R-CNN for its multi-classifier cascaded architecture. We propose to mitigate this contradiction by a new three-stage fine-tuning procedure by introducing an addtional plasticity classifier fine-tuning(PCF) stage. We further design the multi-source ensemble(ME) technique to enhance the generalization of the model in the final fine-tuning stage. Extensive experiments verify that our method is effective in regularizing Sparse R-CNN, outperforming previous methods in the FSOD benchmark. ",

GAAM integrates learnable mean and variance into its attention mechanism, implemented in a Multi-Headed framework enabling it to collectively model any Probability Distribution for dynamic recalibration of feature significance. This method demonstrates significant improvements, especially with highly non-stationary data, surpassing the state-of-the-art attention techniques in model performance (up to approximately +20% in accuracy) by identifying key elements within the feature space. GAAM's compatibility with dot-product-based attention models and relatively low number of parameters showcases its adaptability and potential to boost existing attention frameworks. Empirically, GAAM exhibits superior adaptability and efficacy across a diverse range of tasks, including emotion recognition in speech, image classification, and text classification, thereby establishing its robustness and versatility in handling multi-modal data. Furthermore, we introduce the Importance Factor (IF), a new learning-based metric that enhances the explainability of models trained with GAAM-based methods. Overall, GAAM represents an advancement towards development of better performing and more explainable attention models across multiple modalities. ",

    "abstract": "It is now well-known that automatic speaker verification (ASV) systems can be spoofed using various types of adversaries. The usual approach to counteract ASV systems against such attacks is to develop a separate spoofing countermeasure (CM) module to classify speech input either as a bonafide, or a spoofed utterance. Nevertheless, such a design requires additional computation and utilization efforts at the authentication stage. An alternative strategy involves a single monolithic ASV system designed to handle both zero-effort imposter (non-targets) and spoofing attacks. Such spoof-aware ASV systems have the potential to provide stronger protections and more economic computations. To this end, we propose to generalize the standalone ASV (G-SASV) against spoofing attacks, where we leverage limited training data from CM to enhance a simple backend in the embedding space, without the involvement of a separate CM module during the test (authentication) phase. We propose a novel yet simple backend classifier based on deep neural networks and conduct the study via domain adaptation and multi-task integration of spoof embeddings at the training stage. Experiments are conducted on the ASVspoof 2019 logical access dataset, where we improve the performance of statistical ASV backends on the joint (bonafide and spoofed) and spoofed conditions by a maximum of 36.2% and 49.8% in terms of equal error rates, respectively.

    "abstract": "While third-party libraries are extensively reused to enhance productivity during software development, they can also introduce potential security risks such as vulnerability propagation. Software composition analysis, proposed to identify reused TPLs for reducing such risks, has become an essential procedure within modern DevSecOps. As one of the mainstream SCA techniques, binary-to-source SCA identifies the third-party source projects contained in binary files via binary source code matching, which is a major challenge in reverse engineering since binary and source code exhibit substantial disparities after compilation. The existing binary-to-source SCA techniques leverage basic syntactic features that suffer from redundancy and lack robustness in the large-scale TPL dataset, leading to inevitable false positives and compromised recall. To mitigate these limitations, we introduce BinaryAI, a novel binary-to-source SCA technique with two-phase binary source code matching to capture both syntactic and semantic code features. First, BinaryAI trains a transformer-based model to produce function-level embeddings and obtain similar source functions for each binary function accordingly. Then by applying the link-time locality to facilitate function matching, BinaryAI detects the reused TPLs based on the ratio of matched source functions. Our experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of BinaryAI in terms of binary source code matching and the downstream SCA task. Specifically, our embedding model outperforms the state-of-the-art model CodeCMR, i.e., achieving 22.54% recall@1 and 0.34 MRR compared with 10.75% and 0.17 respectively. Additionally, BinaryAI outperforms all existing binary-to-source SCA tools in TPL detection, increasing the precision from 73.36% to 85.84% and recall from 59.81% to 64.98% compared with the well-recognized commercial SCA product Black Duck.

To understand how these models impact adversarial question writing process, we enrich the writing guidance with LLMs and retrieval models for the authors to reason why their questions are not adversarial. While authors could create interesting, challenging adversarial questions, they sometimes resort to tricks that result in poor questions that are ambiguous, subjective, or confusing not just to a computer but also to humans.

In that realm, a DN's input-mapping is expressed as per-region affine mapping where those regions are implicitly determined by the model's architecture and form a partition of their input space. That partition -- which is involved in all the results spanned from this line of research -- has so far only been computed on $2/3$-dimensional slices of the DN's input space or estimated by random sampling. In this paper, we provide the first parallel algorithm that does exact enumeration of the DN's partition regions. The proposed algorithm enables one to finally assess the closeness of the commonly employed approximations methods, e.g. based on random sampling of the DN input space. One of our key finding is that if one is only interested in regions with ``large'' volume, then uniform sampling of the space is highly efficient, but that if one is also interested in discovering the ``small'' regions of the partition, then uniform sampling is exponentially costly with the DN's input space dimension. On the other hand, our proposed method has complexity scaling linearly with input dimension and the number of regions. ",

    "abstract": "The projected belief network (PBN) is a generative stochastic network with tractable likelihood function based on a feed-forward neural network (FFNN). The generative function operates by \"backing up\" through the FFNN. The PBN is two networks in one, a FFNN that operates in the forward direction, and a generative network that operates in the backward direction. Both networks co-exist based on the same parameter set, have their own cost functions, and can be separately or jointly trained. The PBN therefore has the potential to possess the best qualities of both discriminative and generative classifiers. To realize this potential, a separate PBN is trained on each class, maximizing the generative likelihood function for the given class, while minimizing the discriminative cost for the FFNN against \"all other classes\". This technique, called discriminative alignment (PBN-DA), aligns the contours of the likelihood function to the decision boundaries and attains vastly improved classification performance, rivaling that of state of the art discriminative networks. The method may be further improved using a hidden Markov model (HMM) as a component of the PBN, called PBN-DA-HMM. This paper provides a comprehensive treatment of PBN, PBN-DA, and PBN-DA-HMM. In addition, the results of two new classification experiments are provided. The first experiment uses air-acoustic events, and the second uses underwater acoustic data consisting of marine mammal calls. In both experiments, PBN-DA-HMM attains comparable or better performance as a state of the art CNN, and attain a factor of two error reduction when combined with the CNN. ",

Towards that, a common practice is to embed components of structured data into a high-dimensional vector space. We study the embedding of the tuples of a relational database, where existing techniques are often based on optimization tasks over a collection of random walks from the database. The focus of this paper is on the recent FoRWaRD algorithm that is designed for dynamic databases, where walks are sampled by following foreign keys between tuples. Importantly, different walks have different schemas, or \"walk schemes\", that are derived by listing the relations and attributes along the walk. Also importantly, different walk schemes describe relationships of different natures in the database. We show that by focusing on a few informative walk schemes, we can obtain tuple embedding significantly faster, while retaining the quality. We define the problem of scheme selection for tuple embedding, devise several approaches and strategies for scheme selection, and conduct a thorough empirical study of the performance over a collection of downstream tasks. Our results confirm that with effective strategies for scheme selection, we can obtain high-quality embeddings considerably (e.g., three times) faster, preserve the extensibility to newly inserted tuples, and even achieve an increase in the precision of some tasks.

However, the extensive use of LBSs raises concerns about the privacy of users' trajectories, as adversaries can exploit temporal correlations between different locations to extract personal information. Additionally, users have varying privacy requirements depending on the time and location. To address these issues, this paper proposes a personalized trajectory privacy protection mechanism (PTPPM). This mechanism first uses the temporal correlation between trajectory locations to determine the possible location set for each time instant. We identify a protection location set (PLS) for each location by employing the Hilbert curve-based minimum distance search algorithm. This approach incorporates the complementary features of geo-indistinguishability and distortion privacy. We put forth a novel Permute-and-Flip mechanism for location perturbation, which maps its initial application in data publishing privacy protection to a location perturbation mechanism. This mechanism generates fake locations with smaller perturbation distances while improving the balance between privacy and quality of service (QoS). Simulation results show that our mechanism outperforms the benchmark by providing enhanced privacy protection while meeting user's QoS requirements. ",

Considering labels are crucial for detection but difficult to obtain, we turn to TSAD with inexact supervision: only series-level labels are provided during the training phase, while point-level anomalies are predicted during the testing phase. Previous works follow a traditional multi-instance learning (MIL) approach, which focuses on encouraging high anomaly scores at individual time steps. However, time series anomalies are not only limited to individual point anomalies, they can also be collective anomalies, typically exhibiting abnormal patterns over subsequences. To address the challenge of collective anomalies, in this paper, we propose a tree-based MIL framework (TreeMIL). We first adopt an N-ary tree structure to divide the entire series into multiple nodes, where nodes at different levels represent subsequences with different lengths. Then, the subsequence features are extracted to determine the presence of collective anomalies. Finally, we calculate point-level anomaly scores by aggregating features from nodes at different levels. Experiments conducted on seven public datasets and eight baselines demonstrate that TreeMIL achieves an average 32.3% improvement in F1- score compared to previous state-of-the-art methods.

It generally utilizes additional Transformer decoder blocks to provide sustainable supervision signals and compress contextual information into dense representations. However, the underlying reasons for the effectiveness of such a pre-training technique remain unclear. The usage of additional Transformer-based decoders also incurs significant computational costs. In this study, we aim to shed light on this issue by revealing that masked auto-encoder (MAE) pre-training with enhanced decoding significantly improves the term coverage of input tokens in dense representations, compared to vanilla BERT checkpoints. Building upon this observation, we propose a modification to the traditional MAE by replacing the decoder of a masked auto-encoder with a completely simplified Bag-of-Word prediction task. This modification enables the efficient compression of lexical signals into dense representations through unsupervised pre-training. Remarkably, our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art retrieval performance on several large-scale retrieval benchmarks without requiring any additional parameters, which provides a 67% training speed-up compared to standard masked auto-encoder pre-training with enhanced decoding.

    "abstract": "Trust and privacy have emerged as significant concerns in online transactions. Sharing information on health is especially sensitive but it is necessary for purchasing and utilizing health insurance. Evidence shows that consumers are increasingly comfortable with technology in place of humans, but the expanding use of AI potentially changes this. This research explores whether trust and privacy concern are barriers to the adoption of AI in health insurance. Two scenarios are compared: The first scenario has limited AI that is not in the interface and its presence is not explicitly revealed to the consumer. In the second scenario there is an AI interface and AI evaluation, and this is explicitly revealed to the consumer. The two scenarios were modeled and compared using SEM PLS-MGA. The findings show that trust is significantly lower in the second scenario where AI is visible. Privacy concerns are higher with AI but the difference is not statistically significant within the model. ",

    "abstract": "Anomaly detection in time-series data is crucial for identifying faults, failures, threats, and outliers across a range of applications. Recently, deep learning techniques have been applied to this topic, but they often struggle in real-world scenarios that are complex and highly dynamic, e.g., the normal data may consist of multiple distributions, and various types of anomalies may differ from the normal data to different degrees. In this work, to tackle these challenges, we propose Distribution-Augmented Contrastive Reconstruction (DACR). DACR generates extra data disjoint from the normal data distribution to compress the normal data's representation space, and enhances the feature extractor through contrastive learning to better capture the intrinsic semantics from time-series data. Furthermore, DACR employs an attention mechanism to model the semantic dependencies among multivariate time-series features, thereby achieving more robust reconstruction for anomaly detection. Extensive experiments conducted on nine benchmark datasets in various anomaly detection scenarios demonstrate the effectiveness of DACR in achieving new state-of-the-art time-series anomaly detection.

For the modeling of this complex system, the use of the Matrix-Analytical Method (MAM) is proposed under a layered approach according to its hierarchical structure. Thus, the operational state of the system (top layer) depends on the states of the modules (middle layer), which in turn depend on the states of their components (bottom layer). This allows a detailed description of the system operation to plan maintenance actions appropriately and optimally. We propose a hierarchical decision-based maintenance strategy with periodic inspections as follows: at the time of the inspection, the condition of the system is first evaluated. If intervention is necessary, the modules are then checked to make individual decisions based on their states, and so on. Replacement or repair will be carried out as appropriate. An optimization problem is formulated as a function of the length of the inspection period and the intervention cost incurred over the useful life of the system. Our method shows the advantages, providing compact and implementable expressions. The model is illustrated on a submarine Electrical Control Unit (ECU). ",

Utilizing the reward model obtained from robust regression, we develop a comprehensive suite of policy value estimators, by integrating our reward model into established evaluation frameworks, namely direct methods and doubly robust methods. Through theoretical analysis, we further establish that the proposed policy value estimators offer a finite sample upper bound for the bias, providing a clear advantage over traditional methods, especially when the shift is large. Finally, we designed an extensive range of policy evaluation scenarios, covering diverse magnitudes of shifts and a spectrum of logging and target policies. Our empirical results indicate that our approach significantly outperforms baseline methods, most notably in 90% of the cases under the policy shift-only settings and 72% of the scenarios under the general covariate shift settings.

We demonstrate and evaluate TPRL's effectiveness in discovering natural adversarial attacks and improving model performance through extensive experiments on four diverse NLP classification tasks via Automatic and Human evaluation. TPRL outperforms strong baselines, exhibits generalizability across classifiers and datasets, and combines the strengths of language modeling and reinforcement learning to generate diverse and influential adversarial examples.

Recently, multi-agent reinforcement learning has been introduced to control of multi-AUV. However, designing efficient reward functions for various tasks of multi-AUV control is difficult or even impractical. Multi-agent generative adversarial imitation learning (MAGAIL) allows multi-AUV to learn from expert demonstration instead of pre-defined reward functions, but suffers from the deficiency of requiring optimal demonstrations and not surpassing provided expert demonstrations. This paper builds upon the MAGAIL algorithm by proposing multi-agent generative adversarial interactive self-imitation learning (MAGAISIL), which can facilitate AUVs to learn policies by gradually replacing the provided sub-optimal demonstrations with self-generated good trajectories selected by a human trainer. Our experimental results in a multi-AUV formation control and obstacle avoidance task on the Gazebo platform with AUV simulator of our lab show that AUVs trained via MAGAISIL can surpass the provided sub-optimal expert demonstrations and reach a performance close to or even better than MAGAIL with optimal demonstrations. Further results indicate that AUVs' policies trained via MAGAISIL can adapt to complex and different tasks as well as MAGAIL learning from optimal demonstrations. ",

Specifically, we present a generative counterfactual inference approach to study the influence of visual features (i.e., pixels) as well as causal factors through generative learning. To this end, we first uncover the most influential pixels on a classifier's decision by varying the value of a causal attribute via counterfactual inference and computing both Shapely and contrastive explanations for counterfactual images with these different attribute values. We then establish a Monte-Carlo mechanism using the generator of a causal generative model in order to adapt Shapley explainers to produce feature importances for the human-interpretable attributes of a causal dataset in the case where a classifier has been trained exclusively on the images of the dataset. Finally, we present optimization methods for creating counterfactual explanations of classifiers by means of counterfactual inference, proposing straightforward approaches for both differentiable and arbitrary classifiers. We exploit the Morpho-MNIST causal dataset as a case study for exploring our proposed methods for generating counterfacutl explantions. We employ visual explanation methods from OmnixAI open source toolkit to compare them with our proposed methods. By employing quantitative metrics to measure the interpretability of counterfactual explanations, we find that our proposed methods of counterfactual explanation offer more interpretable explanations compared to those generated from OmnixAI. This finding suggests that our methods are well-suited for generating highly interpretable counterfactual explanations on causal datasets. ",

To address this problem, this paper proposes a simple and effective solution by incorporating calibrated contrastive representative learning into visual AIL framework. Specifically, we present an image encoder in visual AIL, utilizing a combination of unsupervised and supervised contrastive learning to extract valuable features from visual states. Based on the fact that the improved agent often produces demonstrations of varying quality, we propose to calibrate the contrastive loss by treating each agent demonstrations as a mixed sample. The incorporation of contrastive learning can be jointly optimized with the AIL framework, without modifying the architecture or incurring significant computational costs.

    "abstract": "Despite recent advances in video action recognition achieving strong performance on existing benchmarks, these models often lack robustness when faced with natural distribution shifts between training and test data. We propose two novel evaluation methods to assess model resilience to such distribution disparity. One method uses two different datasets collected from different sources and uses one for training and validation, and the other for testing. More precisely, we created dataset splits of HMDB-51 or UCF-101 for training, and Kinetics-400 for testing, using the subset of the classes that are overlapping in both train and test datasets. The other proposed method extracts the feature mean of each class from the target evaluation dataset's training data (i.e. class prototype) and estimates test video prediction as a cosine similarity score between each sample to the class prototypes of each target class. This procedure does not alter model weights using the target dataset and it does not require aligning overlapping classes of two different datasets, thus is a very efficient method to test the model robustness to distribution shifts without prior knowledge of the target distribution. We address the robustness problem by adversarial augmentation training - generating augmented views of videos that are \"hard\" for the classification model by applying gradient ascent on the augmentation parameters - as well as \"curriculum\" scheduling the strength of the video augmentations. We experimentally demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed adversarial augmentation approach over baselines across three state-of-the-art action recognition models - TSM, Video Swin Transformer, and Uniformer. The presented work provides critical insight into model robustness to distribution shifts and presents effective techniques to enhance video action recognition performance in a real-world deployment.

Nevertheless, such cooperations require the knowledge of channel state information (CSI) at base stations (BSs), which is assumed to be perfectly known. However, CSI errors are inevitable in practice which necessitates beamforming techniques that can achieve robust performance in the presence of channel estimation errors. Existing approaches relax the robust beamforming design problems into semidefinite programming (SDP), which can only achieve a solution that is far from being optimal. To this end, this paper views robust beamforming design problems from a bilevel optimization perspective. In particular, we focus on maximizing the worst-case weighted sum-rate (WSR) in the downlink multi-cell multi-user multiple-input single-output (MISO) system considering bounded CSI errors. We first reformulate this problem into a bilevel optimization problem and then develop an efficient algorithm based on the cutting plane method. A distributed optimization algorithm has also been developed to facilitate the parallel processing in practical settings. Numerical results are provided to confirm the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in terms of performance and complexity, particularly in the presence of CSI uncertainties. ",

    "abstract": "Link prediction can help rectify inaccuracies in community detection stemming from unaccounted-for or overlooked links within networks. Many existing works use a baseline approach, which incurs unnecessary computational costs due to its high time complexity. Further, many studies focus on smaller graphs, which can lead to misleading conclusions. The report introduces two parallel approaches, called IHub and LHub, which predict links using neighborhood-based similarity measures on large graphs. LHub is a heuristic approach, which additionally disregards large hubs - based on the idea that low-degree nodes contribute significant similarity among neighbors. On a server equipped with dual 16-core Intel Xeon Gold 6226R processors, LHub is on average 563x faster than IHub, especially on web graphs and social networks, while having similar prediction accuracy. Notably, LHub achieves a link prediction rate of 38.1M edges/s and improves performance at a rate of 1.6x for every doubling of threads. ",

    "abstract": "Multi-access edge computing (MEC)-enabled integrated space-air-ground (SAG) networks have drawn much attention recently, as they can provide communication and computing services to wireless devices in areas that lack terrestrial base stations (TBSs). Leveraging the ample bandwidth in the terahertz (THz) spectrum, in this paper, we propose MEC-enabled integrated SAG networks with collaboration among unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). We then formulate the problem of minimizing the energy consumption of devices and UAVs in the proposed MEC-enabled integrated SAG networks by optimizing tasks offloading decisions, THz sub-bands assignment, transmit power control, and UAVs deployment. The formulated problem is a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MILP) problem with a non-convex structure, which is challenging to solve. We thus propose a block coordinate descent (BCD) approach to decompose the problem into four sub-problems: 1) device task offloading decision problem, 2) THz sub-band assignment and power control problem, 3) UAV deployment problem, and 4) UAV task offloading decision problem. We then propose to use a matching game, concave-convex procedure (CCP) method, successive convex approximation (SCA), and block successive upper-bound minimization (BSUM) approaches for solving the individual subproblems. Finally, extensive simulations are performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm. ",

    "abstract": "Representation learning is all about discovering the hidden modular attributes that generate the data faithfully. We explore the potential of Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DM) in unsupervised learning of the modular attributes. We build a theoretical framework that connects the diffusion time-steps and the hidden attributes, which serves as an effective inductive bias for unsupervised learning. Specifically, the forward diffusion process incrementally adds Gaussian noise to samples at each time-step, which essentially collapses different samples into similar ones by losing attributes, e.g., fine-grained attributes such as texture are lost with less noise added (i.e., early time-steps), while coarse-grained ones such as shape are lost by adding more noise (i.e., late time-steps). To disentangle the modular attributes, at each time-step t, we learn a t-specific feature to compensate for the newly lost attribute, and the set of all 1,...,t-specific features, corresponding to the cumulative set of lost attributes, are trained to make up for the reconstruction error of a pre-trained DM at time-step t. On CelebA, FFHQ, and Bedroom datasets, the learned feature significantly improves attribute classification and enables faithful counterfactual generation, e.g., interpolating only one specified attribute between two images, validating the disentanglement quality.

    "abstract": "Real-world data are long-tailed, the lack of tail samples leads to a significant limitation in the generalization ability of the model. Although numerous approaches of class re-balancing perform well for moderate class imbalance problems, additional knowledge needs to be introduced to help the tail class recover the underlying true distribution when the observed distribution from a few tail samples does not represent its true distribution properly, thus allowing the model to learn valuable information outside the observed domain. In this work, we propose to leverage the geometric information of the feature distribution of the well-represented head class to guide the model to learn the underlying distribution of the tail class. Specifically, we first systematically define the geometry of the feature distribution and the similarity measures between the geometries, and discover four phenomena regarding the relationship between the geometries of different feature distributions. Then, based on four phenomena, feature uncertainty representation is proposed to perturb the tail features by utilizing the geometry of the head class feature distribution. It aims to make the perturbed features cover the underlying distribution of the tail class as much as possible, thus improving the model's generalization performance in the test domain. Finally, we design a three-stage training scheme enabling feature uncertainty modeling to be successfully applied. Experiments on CIFAR-10/100-LT, ImageNet-LT, and iNaturalist2018 show that our proposed approach outperforms other similar methods on most metrics. In addition, the experimental phenomena we discovered are able to provide new perspectives and theoretical foundations for subsequent studies. ",

This event occurs when the minimum ambient temperature falls below a certain value. This phenomenon causes a lot of damage to the country, especially Fars province. Solving this problem requires that, in addition to predicting the minimum temperature, we can provide enough time to implement the necessary measures. Empirical methods have been provided by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), which can predict the minimum temperature, but not in time. In addition to this, we can use machine learning methods to model the minimum temperature. In this study, we have used three methods Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) as deep learning methods, and Gradient Boosting (XGBoost). A customized loss function designed for methods based on deep learning, which can be effective in reducing prediction errors. With methods based on deep learning models, not only do we observe a reduction in RMSE error compared to empirical methods but also have more time to predict minimum temperature. Thus, we can model the minimum temperature for the next 24 hours by having the current 24 hours. With the gradient boosting model (XGBoost) we can keep the prediction time as deep learning and RMSE error reduced. Finally, we experimentally concluded that machine learning methods work better than empirical methods and XGBoost model can have better performance in this problem among other implemented. ",

    "abstract": "Transformer-based models are becoming deeper and larger recently. For better scalability, an underlying training solution in industry is to split billions of parameters (tensors) into many tasks and then run them across homogeneous accelerators (e.g., GPUs). However, such dedicated compute cluster is prohibitively expensive in academia and moderate companies. An economic replacement is to aggregate existing heterogeneous devices and share resources among multi-tenants. Nevertheless, static hardware configurations and dynamic resource contention definitely cause straggling tasks, which heavily slows down the overall training efficiency. Existing works feature contributions mainly tailored for traditional data parallelism. They cannot work well for the new tensor parallelism due to strict communication and correctness constraints. In this paper we first present ZERO-resizing, a novel dynamic workload balancing technique without any data migration. We tune workloads in real-time by temporarily resizing matrices involved in core tensor-related computations. We particularly design data imputation and priority selection policies to respectively satisfy consistency constraint required by normal training and reduce the accuracy loss. We also give a lightweight data migration technique without loss of accuracy, to cope with heavy heterogeneity. Our final SEMI-migration solution is built on top of these two techniques and can adaptively distinguish their respective balancing missions, to achieve an overall success in efficiency and accuracy. Extensive experiments on the representative Colossal-AI platform validate the effectiveness of our proposals. ",

However, training its complex network is very space-consuming, since a lot of intermediate data are preserved across layers, especially when processing high-dimension inputs with a big batch size. That poses great challenges to the limited memory capacity of current accelerators (e.g., GPUs). Existing efforts mitigate such bottleneck by external auxiliary solutions with additional hardware costs, and internal modifications with potential accuracy penalty. Differently, our analysis reveals that computations intra- and inter-layers exhibit the spatial-temporal weak dependency and even complete independency features. That inspires us to break the traditional layer-by-layer (column) dataflow rule. Now operations are novelly re-organized into rows throughout all convolution layers. This lightweight design allows a majority of intermediate data to be removed without any loss of accuracy. We particularly study the weak dependency between two consecutive rows. For the resulting skewed memory consumption, we give two solutions with different favorite scenarios. Evaluations on two representative networks confirm the effectiveness. We also validate that our middle dataflow optimization can be smoothly embraced by existing works for better memory reduction. ",

Different from traditional road-based modeling schemes, a two-lane intersection model is first proposed to model the flow propagation in a more accurate way. A distributed model predictive control (MPC) method is then presented to assign the green times. To enable the real-time feasibility of the proposed approach, the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) is incorporated with the distributed MPC scheme for solving the problem.

In addition, emphasis was placed on expert-based feature engineering and information-rich inputs in order to enable a lean model architecture.

Traditional methods for SCD have predominantly relied on the comparison of image pairs. However, this approach is significantly hindered by substantial imaging differences, which arise due to variations in shooting times, atmospheric conditions, and angles. Such discrepancies lead to two primary issues: the under-detection of minor yet significant changes, and the generation of false alarms due to temporal variances. These factors often result in unchanged objects appearing markedly different in multi-temporal images. In response to these challenges, the MapChange framework has been developed. This framework introduces a novel paradigm that synergizes temporal-invariant historical map data with contemporary high-resolution images. By employing this combination, the temporal variance inherent in conventional image pair comparisons is effectively mitigated. The efficacy of the MapChange framework has been empirically validated through comprehensive testing on two public datasets. These tests have demonstrated the framework's marked superiority over existing state-of-the-art SCD methods. ",

However, accurate absolute pose estimation techniques are computation- and storage-heavy, requiring computation offloading. As such, AR systems rely on visual-inertial odometry (VIO) to track the device's relative pose between requests to the server. However, VIO suffers from drift, requiring frequent absolute repositioning. This paper introduces MobileARLoc, a new framework for on-device large-scale markerless mobile AR that combines an absolute pose regressor (APR) with a local VIO tracking system. Absolute pose regressors (APRs) provide fast on-device pose estimation at the cost of reduced accuracy. To address APR accuracy and reduce VIO drift, MobileARLoc creates a feedback loop where VIO pose estimations refine the APR predictions. The VIO system identifies reliable predictions of APR, which are then used to compensate for the VIO drift. We comprehensively evaluate MobileARLoc through dataset simulations. MobileARLoc halves the error compared to the underlying APR and achieve fast (80\\,ms) on-device inference speed. ",

The dynamics and transition between states are based on neighbors' beliefs, hoax credibility, spreading rate, probability of verifying the news, and probability of forgetting the current state. Our contribution is to push this model to real social networks by considering different classes of agents with their characteristics. We proposed two main strategies for confronting misinformation diffusion. First, we can educate a minor class, like scholars or influencers, to improve their ability to verify the news or remember their state longer.

This paper presents Tempo, the first cloud-based deep learning system that cooperates with TEE and distributed GPUs for efficient DNN training with model confidentiality preserved. To tackle the challenge of preserving privacy while offloading linear algebraic operations from TEE to GPUs for efficient batch computation, we introduce a customized permutation-based obfuscation algorithm to blind both inputs and model parameters. An optimization mechanism that reduces encryption operations is proposed for faster weight updates during backpropagation to speed up training. We implement Tempo and evaluate it with both training and inference for two prevalent DNNs. Empirical results indicate that Tempo outperforms baselines and offers sufficient privacy protection. ",

For this reason, in this paper, a system consisting of two groups of components: degrading and non-degrading components is analyzed. The main novelty of this paper is the evaluation of a maintenance policy at system-level coordinating condition-based maintenance for the degrading components, delay time to the maintenance and an inspection strategy for this heterogeneous system.

In contrast, energy-based models (EBMs), which were designed for efficient implementation in neuromorphic hardware and physical systems, incorporate feedback connections from each layer to the previous layer, yielding a recurrent, deep-attractor architecture which we hypothesize should make them naturally robust. Our work is the first to explore the robustness of EBMs to both natural corruptions and adversarial attacks, which we do using the CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets. We demonstrate that EBMs are more robust than transformers and display comparable robustness to adversarially-trained DNNs on gradient-based (white-box) attacks, query-based (black-box) attacks, and natural perturbations without sacrificing clean accuracy, and without the need for adversarial training or additional training techniques.

Our main results are proving the existence of a threshold in $G(n,p)$ from rational to logarithmic average version age, and showing $G(n,d)$ almost surely has logarithmic version age for constant $d$.

    "abstract": "Given a $k$-uniform hypergraph $H$ on $n$ vertices, an even cover in $H$ is a collection of hyperedges that touch each vertex an even number of times. Even covers are a generalization of cycles in graphs and are equivalent to linearly dependent subsets of a system of linear equations modulo $2$. As a result, they arise naturally in the context of well-studied questions in coding theory and refuting unsatisfiable $k$-SAT formulas. Analogous to the irregular Moore bound of Alon, Hoory, and Linial (2002), in 2008, Feige conjectured an extremal trade-off between the number of hyperedges and the length of the smallest even cover in a $k$-uniform hypergraph. This conjecture was recently settled up to a multiplicative logarithmic factor in the number of hyperedges (Guruswami, Kothari, and 1Manohar 2022 and Hsieh, Kothari, and Mohanty 2023). These works introduce the new technique that relates hypergraph even covers to cycles in the associated \\emph{Kikuchi} graphs. Their analysis of these Kikuchi graphs, especially for odd $k$, is rather involved and relies on matrix concentration inequalities. In this work, we give a simple and purely combinatorial argument that recovers the best-known bound for Feige's conjecture for even $k$. We also introduce a novel variant of a Kikuchi graph which together with this argument improves the logarithmic factor in the best-known bounds for odd $k$. As an application of our ideas, we also give a purely combinatorial proof of the improved lower bounds (Alrabiah, Guruswami, Kothari and Manohar, 2023) on 3-query binary linear locally decodable codes.

Building upon recent proposals for Hierarchical Differential Privacy (HDP), one of the key concepts of DP-HFL is adapting DP noise injection at different layers of an established FL hierarchy -- edge devices, edge servers, and cloud servers -- according to the trust models within particular subnetworks. We conduct a comprehensive analysis of the convergence behavior of DP-HFL, revealing conditions on parameter tuning under which the model training process converges sublinearly to a stationarity gap, with this gap depending on the network hierarchy, trust model, and target privacy level. Subsequent numerical evaluations demonstrate that DP-HFL obtains substantial improvements in convergence speed over baselines for different privacy budgets, and validate the impact of network configuration on training.

    "abstract": "Face recognition systems are widely deployed in high-security applications such as for biometric verification at border controls. Despite their high accuracy on pristine data, it is well-known that digital manipulations, such as face morphing, pose a security threat to face recognition systems. Malicious actors can exploit the facilities offered by the identity document issuance process to obtain identity documents containing morphed images. Thus, subjects who contributed to the creation of the morphed image can with high probability use the identity document to bypass automated face recognition systems. In recent years, no-reference (i.e., single image) and differential morphing attack detectors have been proposed to tackle this risk. These systems are typically evaluated in isolation from the face recognition system that they have to operate jointly with and do not consider the face recognition process. Contrary to most existing works, we present a novel method for adapting deep learning-based face recognition systems to be more robust against face morphing attacks. To this end, we introduce TetraLoss, a novel loss function that learns to separate morphed face images from its contributing subjects in the embedding space while still preserving high biometric verification performance. In a comprehensive evaluation, we show that the proposed method can significantly enhance the original system while also significantly outperforming other tested baseline methods. ",

The disadvantage is the limited mining of the PLL score sets without capturing its distributional information. In this paper, we represent a PLL score set as a Gaussian distribution and use Kullback Leibler (KL) divergence and Jensen Shannon (JS) divergence to construct evaluation measures for the distributions of stereotypical and anti-stereotypical PLL scores.

The server-side calibration mechanism takes advantage of the resource-rich server in an FL environment to assist in global model training.

Our experiments show that LW-FedSSL has a $3.3 \\times$ lower memory requirement and a $3.2 \\times$ cheaper communication cost than its end-to-end counterpart.

The success of FL hinges on the efficiency of participating models and their ability to handle the unique challenges of distributed learning. While several variants of Vision Transformer (ViT) have shown great potential as alternatives to modern convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for centralized training, the unprecedented size and higher computational demands hinder their deployment on resource-constrained edge devices, challenging their widespread application in FL. Since client devices in FL typically have limited computing resources and communication bandwidth, models intended for such devices must strike a balance between model size, computational efficiency, and the ability to adapt to the diverse and non-IID data distributions encountered in FL. To address these challenges, we propose OnDev-LCT: Lightweight Convolutional Transformers for On-Device vision tasks with limited training data and resources. Our models incorporate image-specific inductive biases through the LCT tokenizer by leveraging efficient depthwise separable convolutions in residual linear bottleneck blocks to extract local features, while the multi-head self-attention (MHSA) mechanism in the LCT encoder implicitly facilitates capturing global representations of images. Extensive experiments on benchmark image datasets indicate that our models outperform existing lightweight vision models while having fewer parameters and lower computational demands, making them suitable for FL scenarios with data heterogeneity and communication bottlenecks.

However, a comprehensive theoretical framework for solving multiplayer games with an arbitrary number of strategies on graphs is still missing. Here, we solve this by drawing an analogy with the Ball-and-Box problem, based on which we show that the local configuration of multiplayer games on graphs is equivalent to distributing $k$ identical co-players among $n$ distinct strategies. We use this to derive the replicator equation for any $n$-strategy multiplayer game under weak selection, which can be solved in polynomial time. As an example, we revisit the second-order free-riding problem, where costly punishment cannot truly resolve social dilemmas in a well-mixed population. Yet, in structured populations, we derive an accurate threshold for the punishment strength, beyond which punishment can either lead to the extinction of defection or transform the system into a rock-paper-scissors-like cycle. The analytical solution also qualitatively agrees with the phase diagrams that were previously obtained for non-marginal selection strengths. Our framework thus allows an exploration of any multi-strategy multiplayer game on regular graphs. ",

Different from direct depth supervision, HGG samples volume points from local-to-global geometric regions, mitigating the misalignment caused by inherent bias in the depth prior. Furthermore, we draw inspiration from notable variations in semantic consistency observed across images of different resolutions and propose Hierarchical Semantic Guidance (HSG) to learn the coarse-to-fine semantic content, which corresponds to the coarse-to-fine scene representations.

In particular, we define a binary classification problem UNIFORM, and formulate an explicit fitness function to represent the relationship between neural architecture and classification accuracy. Furthermore, we consider (1+1)-ENAS algorithm with mutation to optimize the neural architecture, and obtain the following runtime bounds: 1) the one-bit mutation finds the optimum in an expected runtime of $O(n)$ and $\\Omega(\\log n)$; 2) the multi-bit mutation finds the optimum in an expected runtime of $\\Theta(n)$. These theoretical results show that one-bit and multi-bit mutations achieve nearly the same performance on UNIFORM. We provide insight into the choices of mutation in the ENAS community: although multi-bit mutation can change the step size to prevent a local trap, this may not always improve runtime. Empirical results also verify the equivalence of these two mutation operators.

    "title": "MsSVT++: Mixed-scale Sparse Voxel Transformer with Center Voting for 3D  Object Detection",
    "abstract": "Accurate 3D object detection in large-scale outdoor scenes, characterized by considerable variations in object scales, necessitates features rich in both long-range and fine-grained information. While recent detectors have utilized window-based transformers to model long-range dependencies, they tend to overlook fine-grained details. To bridge this gap, we propose MsSVT++, an innovative Mixed-scale Sparse Voxel Transformer that simultaneously captures both types of information through a divide-and-conquer approach. This approach involves explicitly dividing attention heads into multiple groups, each responsible for attending to information within a specific range. The outputs of these groups are subsequently merged to obtain final mixed-scale features. To mitigate the computational complexity associated with applying a window-based transformer in 3D voxel space, we introduce a novel Chessboard Sampling strategy and implement voxel sampling and gathering operations sparsely using a hash map. Moreover, an important challenge stems from the observation that non-empty voxels are primarily located on the surface of objects, which impedes the accurate estimation of bounding boxes. To overcome this challenge, we introduce a Center Voting module that integrates newly voted voxels enriched with mixed-scale contextual information towards the centers of the objects, thereby improving precise object localization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our single-stage detector, built upon the foundation of MsSVT++, consistently delivers exceptional performance across diverse datasets. ",

The notable efficacy of GC and its broad prospects have garnered significant attention and spurred extensive research. This survey paper provides an up-to-date and systematic overview of GC, organizing existing research into four categories aligned with critical GC evaluation criteria: effectiveness, generalization, fairness, and efficiency. To facilitate an in-depth and comprehensive understanding of GC, we examine various methods under each category and thoroughly discuss two essential components within GC: optimization strategies and condensed graph generation. Additionally, we introduce the applications of GC in a variety of fields, and highlight the present challenges and novel insights in GC, promoting advancements in future research. ",

These devices facilitate a multitude of smart applications, enhancing the quality of life and efficiency across various domains. Machine Learning (ML) serves as a crucial technology, not only for analyzing IoT-generated data but also for diverse applications within the IoT ecosystem. For instance, ML finds utility in IoT device recognition, anomaly detection, and even in uncovering malicious activities. This paper embarks on a comprehensive exploration of the security threats arising from ML's integration into various facets of IoT, spanning various attack types including membership inference, adversarial evasion, reconstruction, property inference, model extraction, and poisoning attacks. Unlike previous studies, our work offers a holistic perspective, categorizing threats based on criteria such as adversary models, attack targets, and key security attributes (confidentiality, availability, and integrity). We delve into the underlying techniques of ML attacks in IoT environment, providing a critical evaluation of their mechanisms and impacts. Furthermore, our research thoroughly assesses 65 libraries, both author-contributed and third-party, evaluating their role in safeguarding model and data privacy. We emphasize the availability and usability of these libraries, aiming to arm the community with the necessary tools to bolster their defenses against the evolving threat landscape.

    "abstract": "Few-shot hyperspectral image classification aims to identify the classes of each pixel in the images by only marking few of these pixels. And in order to obtain the spatial-spectral joint features of each pixel, the fixed-size patches centering around each pixel are often used for classification. However, observing the classification results of existing methods, we found that boundary patches corresponding to the pixels which are located at the boundary of the objects in the hyperspectral images, are hard to classify. These boundary patchs are mixed with multi-class spectral information. Inspired by this, we propose to augment the prototype network with TransMix for few-shot hyperspectrial image classification(APNT). While taking the prototype network as the backbone, it adopts the transformer as feature extractor to learn the pixel-to-pixel relation and pay different attentions to different pixels. At the same time, instead of directly using the patches which are cut from the hyperspectral images for training, it randomly mixs up two patches to imitate the boundary patches and uses the synthetic patches to train the model, with the aim to enlarge the number of hard training samples and enhance their diversity. And by following the data agumentation technique TransMix, the attention returned by the transformer is also used to mix up the labels of two patches to generate better labels for synthetic patches. Compared with existing methods, the proposed method has demonstrated sate of the art performance and better robustness for few-shot hyperspectral image classification in our experiments. ",

Existing FGL studies fall into two categories: (i) FGL Optimization, which improves multi-client training in existing machine learning models; (ii) FGL Model, which enhances performance with complex local models and multi-client interactions. However, most FGL optimization strategies are designed specifically for the computer vision domain and ignore graph structure, presenting dissatisfied performance and slow convergence. Meanwhile, complex local model architectures in FGL Models studies lack scalability for handling large-scale subgraphs and have deployment limitations. To address these issues, we propose Federated Graph Topology-aware Aggregation (FedGTA), a personalized optimization strategy that optimizes through topology-aware local smoothing confidence and mixed neighbor features. During experiments, we deploy FedGTA in 12 multi-scale real-world datasets with the Louvain and Metis split. This allows us to evaluate the performance and robustness of FedGTA across a range of scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FedGTA achieves state-of-the-art performance while exhibiting high scalability and efficiency. The experiment includes ogbn-papers100M, the most representative large-scale graph database so that we can verify the applicability of our method to large-scale graph learning. To the best of our knowledge, our study is the first to bridge large-scale graph learning with FGL using this optimization strategy, contributing to the development of efficient and scalable FGL methods.

In response to the potential hazards of these media forgeries, many researchers engage in exploring detection methods, increasing the demand for high-quality media forgery datasets. Despite this, existing datasets have certain limitations. Firstly, most of datasets focus on the manipulation of visual modality and usually lack diversity, as only a few forgery approaches are considered. Secondly, the quality of media is often inadequate in clarity and naturalness. Meanwhile, the size of the dataset is also limited. Thirdly, while many real-world forgeries are driven by identity, the identity information of the subject in media is frequently neglected. For detection, identity information could be an essential clue to boost accuracy. Moreover, official media concerning certain identities on the Internet can serve as prior knowledge, aiding both the audience and forgery detectors in determining the true identity. Therefore, we propose an identity-driven multimedia forgery dataset, IDForge, which contains 249,138 video shots. All video shots are sourced from 324 wild videos collected of 54 celebrities from the Internet. The fake video shots involve 9 types of manipulation across visual, audio and textual modalities. Additionally, IDForge provides extra 214,438 real video shots as a reference set for the 54 celebrities. Correspondingly, we design an effective multimedia detection network, Reference-assisted Multimodal Forgery Detection Network (R-MFDN). Through extensive experiments on the proposed dataset, we demonstrate the effectiveness of R-MFDN on the multimedia detection task. ",

The main challenge lies in the time cost of handling bond angles, which leads to a significant increase in inference time. To solve this issue, we first propose a crystal structure modeling based on dual scale neighbor partitioning mechanism, which uses a larger scale cutoff for edge neighbors and a smaller scale cutoff for angle neighbors. Then, we propose a novel Atom-Distance-Angle Graph Neural Network (ADA-GNN) for property prediction tasks, which can process node information and structural information separately. The accuracy of predictions and inference time are improved with the dual scale modeling and the specially designed architecture of ADA-GNN.

    "abstract": "Most existing graph neural networks (GNNs) are limited to undirected graphs, whose restricted scope of the captured relational information hinders their expressive capabilities and deployments in real-world scenarios. Compared with undirected graphs, directed graphs (digraphs) fit the demand for modeling more complex topological systems by capturing more intricate relationships between nodes, such as formulating transportation and financial networks. While some directed GNNs have been introduced, their inspiration mainly comes from deep learning architectures, which lead to redundant complexity and computation, making them inapplicable to large-scale databases. To address these issues, we propose LightDiC, a scalable variant of the digraph convolution based on the magnetic Laplacian. Since topology-related computations are conducted solely during offline pre-processing, LightDiC achieves exceptional scalability, enabling downstream predictions to be trained separately without incurring recursive computational costs. Theoretical analysis shows that LightDiC utilizes directed information to achieve message passing based on the complex field, which corresponds to the proximal gradient descent process of the Dirichlet energy optimization function from the perspective of digraph signal denoising, ensuring its expressiveness. Experimental results demonstrate that LightDiC performs comparably well or even outperforms other SOTA methods in various downstream tasks, with fewer learnable parameters and higher training efficiency. Notably, LightDiC is the first DiGNN to provide satisfactory results in the most representative large-scale database (ogbn-papers100M). ",

Existing methods mainly focus on interactive learning between vision and language to enhance the multi-modal representations for global context reasoning. However, predicting directly in pixel-level space can lead to collapsed positioning and poor segmentation results. Its main challenge lies in how to explicitly model entity localization, especially for non-salient entities. In this paper, we tackle this problem by executing a Collaborative Position Reasoning Network (CPRN) via the proposed novel Row-and-Column interactive (RoCo) and Guided Holistic interactive (Holi) modules. Specifically, RoCo aggregates the visual features into the row- and column-wise features corresponding two directional axes respectively. It offers a fine-grained matching behavior that perceives the associations between the linguistic features and two decoupled visual features to perform position reasoning over a hierarchical space. Holi integrates features of the two modalities by a cross-modal attention mechanism, which suppresses the irrelevant redundancy under the guide of positioning information from RoCo. Thus, with the incorporation of RoCo and Holi modules, CPRN captures the visual details of position reasoning so that the model can achieve more accurate segmentation. To our knowledge, this is the first work that explicitly focuses on position reasoning modeling. We also validate the proposed method on three evaluation datasets. It consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods. ",

However, translating sparse sensor signals into comprehensive human motion remains a challenge since the sparsely distributed sensors in common VR systems fail to capture the motion of full human body. In this paper, we use well-designed Body Pose Graph (BPG) to represent the human body and translate the challenge into a prediction problem of graph missing nodes. Then, we propose a novel full-body motion reconstruction framework based on BPG. To establish BPG, nodes are initially endowed with features extracted from sparse sensor signals. Features from identifiable joint nodes across diverse sensors are amalgamated and processed from both temporal and spatial perspectives. Temporal dynamics are captured using the Temporal Pyramid Structure, while spatial relations in joint movements inform the spatial attributes. The resultant features serve as the foundational elements of the BPG nodes. To further refine the BPG, node features are updated through a graph neural network that incorporates edge reflecting varying joint relations. Our method's effectiveness is evidenced by the attained state-of-the-art performance, particularly in lower body motion, outperforming other baseline methods.

To predict traffic conditions, we employ a spatio-temporal graph neural network (ST-GNN) to model our real-time traffic data as temporal graphs. Despite its capabilities, it often encounters challenges in delivering efficient real-time predictions for real-world traffic data. Recognizing the significance of timely prediction due to the dynamic nature of real-time data, we employ knowledge distillation (KD) as a solution to enhance the execution time of ST-GNNs for traffic prediction. In this paper, We introduce a cost function designed to train a network with fewer parameters (the student) using distilled data from a complex network (the teacher) while maintaining its accuracy close to that of the teacher. We use knowledge distillation, incorporating spatial-temporal correlations from the teacher network to enable the student to learn the complex patterns perceived by the teacher. However, a challenge arises in determining the student network architecture rather than considering it inadvertently. To address this challenge, we propose an algorithm that utilizes the cost function to calculate pruning scores, addressing small network architecture search issues, and jointly fine-tunes the network resulting from each pruning stage using KD. Ultimately, we evaluate our proposed ideas on two real-world datasets, PeMSD7 and PeMSD8. The results indicate that our method can maintain the student's accuracy close to that of the teacher, even with the retention of only $3\\%$ of network parameters. ",

A popular technique to achieve this goal is conformal prediction (CP), which transforms an arbitrary base predictor into a set predictor with coverage guarantees. While CP certifies the predicted set to contain the target quantity with a user-defined tolerance, it does not provide control over the average size of the predicted sets, i.e., over the informativeness of the prediction. In this work, a theoretical connection is established between the generalization properties of the base predictor and the informativeness of the resulting CP prediction sets. To this end, an upper bound is derived on the expected size of the CP set predictor that builds on generalization error bounds for the base predictor.

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in artificial intelligence, particularly with the emergence of large language models (LLMs), have sparked a rethinking of artificial general intelligence possibilities. The increasing human-like capabilities of AI are also attracting attention in social science research, leading to various studies exploring the combination of these two fields. In this survey, we systematically categorize previous explorations in the combination of AI and social science into two directions that share common technical approaches but differ in their research objectives. The first direction is focused on AI for social science, where AI is utilized as a powerful tool to enhance various stages of social science research. While the second direction is the social science of AI, which examines AI agents as social entities with their human-like cognitive and linguistic capabilities. By conducting a thorough review, particularly on the substantial progress facilitated by recent advancements in large language models, this paper introduces a fresh perspective to reassess the relationship between AI and social science, provides a cohesive framework that allows researchers to understand the distinctions and connections between AI for social science and social science of AI, and also summarized state-of-art experiment simulation platforms to facilitate research in these two directions. We believe that as AI technology continues to advance and intelligent agents find increasing applications in our daily lives, the significance of the combination of AI and social science will become even more prominent.

    "abstract": "Various Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been successful in analyzing data in non-Euclidean spaces, however, they have limitations such as oversmoothing, i.e., information becomes excessively averaged as the number of hidden layers increases. The issue stems from the intrinsic formulation of conventional graph convolution where the nodal features are aggregated from a direct neighborhood per layer across the entire nodes in the graph. As setting different number of hidden layers per node is infeasible, recent works leverage a diffusion kernel to redefine the graph structure and incorporate information from farther nodes. Unfortunately, such approaches suffer from heavy diagonalization of a graph Laplacian or learning a large transform matrix. In this regards, we propose a diffusion learning framework, where the range of feature aggregation is controlled by the scale of a diffusion kernel. For efficient computation, we derive closed-form derivatives of approximations of the graph convolution with respect to the scale, so that node-wise range can be adaptively learned. With a downstream classifier, the entire framework is made trainable in an end-to-end manner. Our model is tested on various standard datasets for node-wise classification for the state-of-the-art performance, and it is also validated on a real-world brain network data for graph classifications to demonstrate its practicality for Alzheimer classification.

    "abstract": "Accurate crop yield prediction is of utmost importance for informed decision-making in agriculture, aiding farmers, and industry stakeholders. However, this task is complex and depends on multiple factors, such as environmental conditions, soil properties, and management practices. Combining heterogeneous data views poses a fusion challenge, like identifying the view-specific contribution to the predictive task. We present a novel multi-view learning approach to predict crop yield for different crops (soybean, wheat, rapeseed) and regions (Argentina, Uruguay, and Germany). Our multi-view input data includes multi-spectral optical images from Sentinel-2 satellites and weather data as dynamic features during the crop growing season, complemented by static features like soil properties and topographic information. To effectively fuse the data, we introduce a Multi-view Gated Fusion (MVGF) model, comprising dedicated view-encoders and a Gated Unit (GU) module. The view-encoders handle the heterogeneity of data sources with varying temporal resolutions by learning a view-specific representation. These representations are adaptively fused via a weighted sum. The fusion weights are computed for each sample by the GU using a concatenation of the view-representations. The MVGF model is trained at sub-field level with 10 m resolution pixels. Our evaluations show that the MVGF outperforms conventional models on the same task, achieving the best results by incorporating all the data sources, unlike the usual fusion results in the literature. For Argentina, the MVGF model achieves an R2 value of 0.68 at sub-field yield prediction, while at field level evaluation (comparing field averages), it reaches around 0.80 across different countries. The GU module learned different weights based on the country and crop-type, aligning with the variable significance of each data source to the prediction task. ",

This module achieves adaptive expansion of the 3D convolutional kernel's receptive field, balancing the expansion with acceptable computational loads. This innovation reduces operations, expands the receptive field, and allows the model to dynamically adjust to different object requirements. Simultaneously, we identify redundant information in 3D features. Employing the Feature Selection Module (FSM) quantitatively evaluates and eliminates non-important features, achieving the separation of output box fitting and feature extraction. This innovation enables the detector to focus on critical features, resulting in model compression, reduced computational burden, and minimized candidate frame interference. Extensive experiments confirm that both DFFM and FSM not only enhance current benchmarks, particularly in small target detection, but also accelerate network performance. Importantly, these modules exhibit effective complementarity. ",

    "abstract": "With the rapid development of low-cost consumer electronics and cloud computing, Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices are widely adopted for supporting next-generation distributed systems such as smart cities and industrial control systems. IoT devices are often susceptible to cyber attacks due to their open deployment environment and limited computing capabilities for stringent security controls. Hence, Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) have emerged as one of the effective ways of securing IoT networks by monitoring and detecting abnormal activities. However, existing IDS approaches rely on centralized servers to generate behaviour profiles and detect anomalies, causing high response time and large operational costs due to communication overhead. Besides, sharing of behaviour data in an open and distributed IoT network environment may violate on-device privacy requirements. Additionally, various IoT devices tend to capture heterogeneous data, which complicates the training of behaviour models. In this paper, we introduce Federated Learning (FL) to collaboratively train a decentralized shared model of IDS, without exposing training data to others. Furthermore, we propose an effective method called Federated Learning Ensemble Knowledge Distillation (FLEKD) to mitigate the heterogeneity problems across various clients. FLEKD enables a more flexible aggregation method than conventional model fusion techniques. Experiment results on the public dataset CICIDS2019 demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms local training and traditional FL in terms of both speed and performance and significantly improves the system's ability to detect unknown attacks. Finally, we evaluate our proposed framework's performance in three potential real-world scenarios and show FLEKD has a clear advantage in experimental results. ",

Therefore, XXX focuses on selectively masking these short-term elements, preserving the quality of long-term speech understanding. The core of XXX is an innovative differential mask generator, grounded in interpretable learning, which fine-tunes the masking process. We tested XXX on the STM32H7 microcontroller, assessing its performance in various potential attack scenarios.

Here we introduce a method which substantially reduces the memory required to run graph-based learned simulators. Based on this memory-efficient simulation model, we then present a perceptual interface in the form of editable NeRFs which can convert real-world scenes into a structured representation that can be processed by graph network simulator. We show that our method uses substantially less memory than previous graph-based simulators while retaining their accuracy, and that the simulators learned in synthetic environments can be applied to real world scenes captured from multiple camera angles. This paves the way for expanding the application of learned simulators to settings where only perceptual information is available at inference time. ",

Grounded in the foundational concepts of disparity definition and the disparity plane sweep, the proposed stereo-confidence method is built upon the idea that any shift in a stereo-image pair should be updated in a corresponding amount shift in the disparity map. Based on this idea, the proposed stereo-confidence method can be summarized in three folds. 1) Using the disparity plane sweep, multiple disparity maps can be obtained and treated as a 3-D volume (predicted disparity volume), like the cost volume is constructed. 2) One of these disparity maps serves as an anchor, allowing us to define a desirable (or ideal) disparity profile at every spatial point. 3) By comparing the desirable and predicted disparity profiles, we can quantify the level of matching ambiguity between left and right images for confidence measurement. Extensive experimental results using various stereo-matching networks and datasets demonstrate that the proposed stereo-confidence method not only shows competitive performance on its own but also consistent performance improvements when it is used as an input modality for learning-based stereo-confidence methods.

Graph neural networks (GNNs) have recently gained growing attention in graph learning and have shown significant improvements in many important graph problems. Despite their state-of-the-art performances, existing GNNs only use local information from a very limited neighborhood around each node, suffering from loss of multi-modal information and overheads of excessive computation. To address these issues, we propose a novel Tensor-view Topological Graph Neural Network (TTG-NN), a class of simple yet effective topological deep learning built upon persistent homology, graph convolution, and tensor operations. This new method incorporates tensor learning to simultaneously capture Tensor-view Topological (TT), as well as Tensor-view Graph (TG) structural information on both local and global levels. Computationally, to fully exploit graph topology and structure, we propose two flexible TT and TG representation learning modules that disentangle feature tensor aggregation and transformation and learn to preserve multi-modal structure with less computation. Theoretically, we derive high probability bounds on both the out-of-sample and in-sample mean squared approximation errors for our proposed Tensor Transformation Layer (TTL).

It is important to investigate the robustness of compressed networks in two types of data distribution shifts: domain shifts and adversarial perturbations. In this study, we discover that compressed models are less robust to distribution shifts than their original networks. Interestingly, larger networks are more vulnerable to losing robustness than smaller ones, even when they are compressed to a similar size as the smaller networks. Furthermore, compact networks obtained by knowledge distillation are much more robust to distribution shifts than pruned networks. Finally, post-training quantization is a reliable method for achieving significant robustness to distribution shifts, and it outperforms both pruned and distilled models in terms of robustness. ",

    "title": "SEDAC: A CVAE-Based Data Augmentation Method for Security Bug Report  Identification",
    "abstract": "Bug tracking systems store many bug reports, some of which are related to security. Identifying those security bug reports (SBRs) may help us predict some security-related bugs and solve security issues promptly so that the project can avoid threats and attacks. However, in the real world, the ratio of security bug reports is severely low; thus, directly training a prediction model with raw data may result in inaccurate results. Faced with the massive challenge of data imbalance, many researchers in the past have attempted to use text filtering or clustering methods to minimize the proportion of non-security bug reports (NSBRs) or apply oversampling methods to synthesize SBRs to make the dataset as balanced as possible. Nevertheless, there are still two challenges to those methods: 1) They ignore long-distance contextual information. 2) They fail to generate an utterly balanced dataset. To tackle these two challenges, we propose SEDAC, a new SBR identification method that generates similar bug report vectors to solve data imbalance problems and accurately detect security bug reports. Unlike previous studies, it first converts bug reports into individual bug report vectors with distilBERT, which are based on word2vec. Then, it trains a generative model through conditional variational auto-encoder (CVAE) to generate similar vectors with security labels, which makes the number of SBRs equal to NSBRs'. Finally, balanced data are used to train a security bug report classifier. To evaluate the effectiveness of our framework, we conduct it on 45,940 bug reports from Chromium and four Apache projects. The experimental results show that SEDAC outperforms all the baselines in g-measure with improvements of around 14.24%-50.10%. ",

However, we find that a score based on contrasting two closely related language models is highly accurate at separating human-generated and machine-generated text. Based on this mechanism, we propose a novel LLM detector that only requires simple calculations using a pair of pre-trained LLMs. The method, called Binoculars, achieves state-of-the-art accuracy without any training data. It is capable of spotting machine text from a range of modern LLMs without any model-specific modifications. We comprehensively evaluate Binoculars on a number of text sources and in varied situations. Over a wide range of document types, Binoculars detects over 90% of generated samples from ChatGPT (and other LLMs) at a false positive rate of 0.01%, despite not being trained on any ChatGPT data.

The robotic platforms and control methods also impact people's perception of human-robot interaction. However, limited studies have compared robot imitation across different platforms and control methods. Our research addresses this gap by conducting two experiments comparing people's perception of affective mirroring between the iCub and Pepper robots and movement mirroring between vision-based iCub control and Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU)-based iCub control. We discovered that the iCub robot was perceived as more humanlike than the Pepper robot when mirroring affect. A vision-based controlled iCub outperformed the IMU-based controlled one in the movement mirroring task. Our findings suggest that different robotic platforms impact people's perception of robots' mirroring during HRI. The control method also contributes to the robot's mirroring performance.

    "abstract": "In a modern DBMS, working memory is frequently the limiting factor when processing in-memory analytic query operations such as joins, sorting, and aggregation. Existing resource estimation approaches for a DBMS estimate the resource consumption of a query by computing an estimate of each individual database operator in the query execution plan. Such an approach is slow and error-prone as it relies upon simplifying assumptions, such as uniformity and independence of the underlying data. Additionally, the existing approach focuses on individual queries separately and does not factor in other queries in the workload that may be executed concurrently. In this research, we are interested in query performance optimization under concurrent execution of a batch of queries (a workload). Specifically, we focus on predicting the memory demand for a workload rather than providing separate estimates for each query within it. We introduce the problem of workload memory prediction and formalize it as a distribution regression problem. We propose Learned Workload Memory Prediction (LearnedWMP) to improve and simplify estimating the working memory demands of workloads. Through a comprehensive experimental evaluation, we show that LearnedWMP reduces the memory estimation error of the state-of-the-practice method by up to 47.6%. Compared to an alternative single-query model, during training and inferencing, the LearnedWMP model and its variants were 3x to 10x faster. Moreover, LearnedWMP-based models were at least 50% smaller in most cases. Overall, the results demonstrate the advantages of the LearnedWMP approach and its potential for a broader impact on query performance optimization. ",

Among many others, existing methods use the following two scores to do so without training on any apriori OOD examples: a learned temperature and an energy score. In this paper we introduce Ablated Learned Temperature Energy (or \"AbeT\" for short), a method which combines these prior methods in novel ways with effective modifications. Due to these contributions, AbeT lowers the False Positive Rate at $95\\%$ True Positive Rate (FPR@95) by $35.39\\%$ in classification (averaged across all ID and OOD datasets measured) compared to state of the art without training networks in multiple stages or requiring hyperparameters or test-time backward passes. We additionally provide empirical insights as to how our model learns to distinguish between In-Distribution (ID) and OOD samples while only being explicitly trained on ID samples via exposure to misclassified ID examples at training time. Lastly, we show the efficacy of our method in identifying predicted bounding boxes and pixels corresponding to OOD objects in object detection and semantic segmentation, respectively - with an AUROC increase of $5.15\\%$ in object detection and both a decrease in FPR@95 of $41.48\\%$ and an increase in AUPRC of $34.20\\%$ on average in semantic segmentation compared to previous state of the art.

This approach is referred to as coded elastic computing. Some limitations of this approach include that it assumes all virtual machines have the same computing speeds and storage capacities, and it cannot tolerate stragglers for matrix-matrix multiplications. In order to resolve these limitations, in this paper, we introduce a new combinatorial optimization framework, named uncoded storage coded transmission elastic computing (USCTEC), for heterogeneous speeds and storage constraints, aiming to minimize the expected computation time for matrix-matrix multiplications, under the consideration of straggler tolerance. Within this framework, we propose optimal solutions with straggler tolerance under relaxed storage constraints. Moreover, we propose a heuristic algorithm that considers the heterogeneous storage constraints. Our results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms baseline solutions utilizing cyclic storage placements, in terms of both expected computation time and storage size. ",

    "abstract": "Consumer Internet of Things (IoT) devices often leverage the local network to communicate with the corresponding companion app or other devices. This has benefits in terms of efficiency since it offloads the cloud. ENISA and NIST security guidelines underscore the importance of enabling default local communication for safety and reliability. Indeed, an IoT device should continue to function in case the cloud connection is not available. While the security of cloud-device connections is typically strengthened through the usage of standard protocols, local connectivity security is frequently overlooked. Neglecting the security of local communication opens doors to various threats, including replay attacks. In this paper, we investigate this class of attacks by designing a systematic methodology for automatically testing IoT devices vulnerability to replay attacks. Specifically, we propose a tool, named REPLIOT, able to test whether a replay attack is successful or not, without prior knowledge of the target devices. We perform thousands of automated experiments using popular commercial devices spanning various vendors and categories. Notably, our study reveals that among these devices, 51% of them do not support local connectivity, thus they are not compliant with the reliability and safety requirements of the ENISA/NIST guidelines. We find that 75% of the remaining devices are vulnerable to replay attacks with REPLIOT having a detection accuracy of 0.98-1. Finally, we investigate the possible causes of this vulnerability, discussing possible mitigation strategies. ",

Moreover, with the rise of public interest in large language models (LLMs), Embeddings as a Service (EaaS) has rapidly gained traction as a business model. This is not without outstanding security risks, as previous research has demonstrated that sensitive data can be reconstructed from embeddings, even without knowledge of the underlying model that generated them. However, such work is limited by its sole focus on English, leaving all other languages vulnerable to attacks by malicious actors. %As many international and multilingual companies leverage EaaS, there is an urgent need for research into multilingual LLM security. To this end, this work investigates LLM security from the perspective of multilingual embedding inversion. Concretely, we define the problem of black-box multilingual and cross-lingual inversion attacks, with special attention to a cross-domain scenario. Our findings reveal that multilingual models are potentially more vulnerable to inversion attacks than their monolingual counterparts. This stems from the reduced data requirements for achieving comparable inversion performance in settings where the underlying language is not known a-priori. To our knowledge, this work is the first to delve into multilinguality within the context of inversion attacks, and our findings highlight the need for further investigation and enhanced defenses in the area of NLP Security.

To overcome these challenges, we propose a Programmable Sensor Array (PSA) for run-time hardware Trojan detection, localization, and identification. PSA is a tampering-resilient integrated on-chip magnetic field sensor array that can be re-programmed to change the sensors' shape, size, and location. Using PSA, EM side-channel measurement results collected from sensors at different locations on an IC can be analyzed to localize and identify the Trojan. The PSA has better performance than conventional external magnetic probes and state-of-the-art on-chip single-coil magnetic field sensors. We fabricated an AES-128 test chip with four AES Hardware Trojans.

Prior research has addressed either solving the optimum operational hydraulic setting problem or regulating the water quality dynamics as separate problems. Additionally, there have been efforts to couple these two problems and solve one compact problem resulting in trade-offs between the contradictory objectives. In contrast, this paper examines the dependency and influence from a control-theoretic standpoint. More specifically, we explore the influence of accountability for water quality controllability improvement when addressing the pump scheduling problem. We examine its effects on the cumulative cost of the interconnected systems as well as the subsequent performance of the water quality controller. To achieve this, we develop a framework that incorporates different controllability metrics within the operational hydraulic optimization problem; its aim is attaining an adequate level of water quality control across the system. We assess the aforementioned aspects' performance on various scaled networks with a wide range of numerical scenarios. ",

We show that if a preference relation over interventions satisfies certain axioms (related to standard axioms regarding counterfactuals), then we can define (i) a causal model, (ii) a probability capturing the decision-maker's uncertainty regarding the external factors in the world and (iii) a utility on outcomes such that each intervention is associated with an expected utility and such that intervention $A$ is preferred to $B$ iff the expected utility of $A$ is greater than that of $B$.

However, the challenge of designing effective quantum feature maps for real-world datasets, particularly in the absence of sufficient prior information, remains a significant obstacle. In this study, we present a data-driven approach that automates the design of problem-specific quantum feature maps. Our approach leverages feature-selection techniques to handle high-dimensional data on near-term quantum machines with limited qubits, and incorporates a deep neural predictor to efficiently evaluate the performance of various candidate quantum kernels. Through extensive numerical simulations on different datasets, we demonstrate the superiority of our proposal over prior methods, especially for the capability of eliminating the kernel concentration issue and identifying the feature map with prediction advantages. Our work not only unlocks the potential of quantum kernels for enhancing real-world tasks but also highlights the substantial role of deep learning in advancing quantum machine learning. ",

    "abstract": "The nature of deep neural networks has given rise to a variety of attacks, but little work has been done to address the effect of adversarial attacks on segmentation models trained on MRI datasets. In light of the grave consequences that such attacks could cause, we explore four models from the U-Net family and examine their responses to the Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) attack. We conduct FGSM attacks on each of them and experiment with various schemes to conduct the attacks. In this paper, we find that medical imaging segmentation models are indeed vulnerable to adversarial attacks and that there is a negligible correlation between parameter size and adversarial attack success. Furthermore, we show that using a different loss function than the one used for training yields higher adversarial attack success, contrary to what the FGSM authors suggested. In future efforts, we will conduct the experiments detailed in this paper with more segmentation models and different attacks. We will also attempt to find ways to counteract the attacks by using model ensembles or special data augmentations. Our code is available at https://github.com/ZhongxuanWang/adv_attk ",

    "abstract": "Lung cancer is one of the significant causes of cancer-related deaths globally. Early detection and treatment improve the chances of survival. Traditionally CT scans have been used to extract the most significant lung infection information and diagnose cancer. This process is carried out manually by an expert radiologist. The imbalance in the radiologists-to-population ratio in a country like India implies significant work pressure on them and thus raises the need to automate a few of their responsibilities. The tendency of modern-day Deep Neural networks to make overconfident mistakes limit their usage to detect cancer. In this paper, we propose a new task-specific loss function to calibrate the neural network to reduce the risk of overconfident mistakes. We use the state-of-the-art Multi-class Difference in Confidence and Accuracy (MDCA) loss in conjunction with the proposed task-specific loss function to achieve the same. We also integrate post-hoc calibration by performing temperature scaling on top of the train-time calibrated model. We demonstrate 5.98% improvement in the Expected Calibration Error (ECE) and a 17.9% improvement in Maximum Calibration Error (MCE) as compared to the best-performing SOTA algorithm. ",

    "title": "Quantum Architecture Search with Unsupervised Representation Learning",
    "abstract": "Utilizing unsupervised representation learning for quantum architecture search (QAS) represents a cutting-edge approach poised to realize potential quantum advantage on Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices. Most QAS algorithms combine their search space and search algorithms together and thus generally require evaluating a large number of quantum circuits during the search process. Predictor-based QAS algorithms can alleviate this problem by directly estimating the performance of circuits according to their structures. However, a high-performance predictor generally requires very time-consuming labeling to obtain a large number of labeled quantum circuits. Recently, a classical neural architecture search algorithm Arch2vec inspires us by showing that architecture search can benefit from decoupling unsupervised representation learning from the search process. Whether unsupervised representation learning can help QAS without any predictor is still an open topic. In this work, we propose a framework QAS with unsupervised representation learning and visualize how unsupervised architecture representation learning encourages quantum circuit architectures with similar connections and operators to cluster together. Specifically, our framework enables the process of QAS to be decoupled from unsupervised architecture representation learning so that the learned representation can be directly applied to different downstream applications. Furthermore, our framework is predictor-free eliminating the need for a large number of labeled quantum circuits. During the search process, we use two algorithms REINFORCE and Bayesian Optimization to directly search on the latent representation, and compare them with the method Random Search. The results show our framework can more efficiently get well-performing candidate circuits within a limited number of searches. ",

In their introductory paper, the authors made an assumption (quite usual in this area) that they only consider simple (good) drawings; i.e., drawings in which no two edges have two points in common.

However, it is unavailable at night because of the lack of sunlight. This study presents a Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (CGAN) model that generates highly accurate nighttime visible reflectance using infrared (IR) bands and sunlight direction parameters as input. The model was trained and validated using target area observations of the Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI) in the daytime. This study also presents the first nighttime model validation using the Day/Night Band (DNB) of the Visible/Infrared Imager Radiometer Suite (VIIRS). The daytime statistical results of the Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM), Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Correlation Coefficient (CC), and Bias are 0.885, 28.3, 0.0428, 0.984, and -0.0016 respectively, completely surpassing the model performance of previous studies. The nighttime statistical results of SSIM, PSNR, RMSE, and CC are 0.821, 24.4, 0.0643, and 0.969 respectively, which are slightly negatively impacted by the parallax between satellites. We performed full-disk model validation which proves our model could also be readily applied in the tropical ocean without TCs in the northern hemisphere. This model contributes to the nighttime monitoring of meteorological phenomena by providing accurate AI-generated visible imagery with adjustable virtual sunlight directions. ",

In the proposed scheme, a series of selective Gammachirp filters are adopted to emphasize the harmonic components of speech reducing the masking effects of acoustic noises. The fundamental frequency are estimated by the HHT-Amp technique. Harmonic patterns estimated with low accuracy are detected and adjusted according the FSFFE low/high pitch separation. The central frequencies of the filterbank are defined considering the third octave subbands which are best suited to cover the regions most relevant to intelligibility. Before signal reconstruction, the gammachirp filtered components are amplified by gain factors regulated by FSFFE classification. The proposed HDAG solution and three baseline techniques are examined considering six background noises with four signal-to-noise ratios. Three objective measures are adopted for the evaluation of speech intelligibility and quality. Several experiments are conducted to demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieves better speech intelligibility improvement when compared to the competing approaches. A perceptual listening test is further considered and corroborates with the objective results. ",

In this regard, we propose a speaker protection method based on adversarial attacks. The proposed method perturbs speech signals by minimally altering the original speech while rendering downstream speech generation models unable to accurately generate the voice of the target speaker. For validation, we employ the open-source pre-trained YourTTS model for speech generation and protect the target speaker's speech in the white-box scenario. Automatic speaker verification (ASV) evaluations were carried out on the generated speech as the assessment of the voice protection capability. Our experimental results show that we successfully perturbed the speaker encoder of the YourTTS model using the gradient-based I-FGSM adversarial perturbation method. Furthermore, the adversarial perturbation is effective in preventing the YourTTS model from generating the speech of the target speaker.

To address the uncertainties in communication time and computation resource availability, we propose a novel semantic compression method, autoencoder-based CNN architecture (AECNN), for effective semantic extraction and compression in partial offloading. In the semantic encoder, we introduce a feature compression module based on the channel attention mechanism in CNNs, to compress intermediate data by selecting the most informative features. In the semantic decoder, we design a lightweight decoder to reconstruct the intermediate data through learning from the received compressed data to improve accuracy. To effectively trade-off communication, computation, and inference accuracy, we design a reward function and formulate the offloading problem of CNN inference as a maximization problem with the goal of maximizing the average inference accuracy and throughput over the long term. To address this maximization problem, we propose a graph reinforcement learning-based AECNN (GRL-AECNN) method, which outperforms existing works DROO-AECNN, GRL-BottleNet++ and GRL-DeepJSCC under different dynamic scenarios. This highlights the advantages of GRL-AECNN in offloading decision-making in dynamic MEC. ",
