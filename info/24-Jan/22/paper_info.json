    "abstract": "This paper proposes new methods for set-based state estimation and active fault diagnosis (AFD) of linear descriptor systems. In contrast to simple set representations, such as intervals, ellipsoids, and zonotopes, linear static constraints on the state variables, typical of descriptor systems, can be directly incorporated in the mathematical description of constrained zonotopes. Thanks to this feature, set-based methods using constrained zonotopes, as proposed in previous works, could provide less conservative enclosures. However, an enclosure on the states was assumed to be known for all $k \\geq 0$. Such assumption is violated in the case of unstable descriptor systems. In this context, this paper proposes a new representation for unbounded sets, which allows to develop methods for state estimation and tube-based AFD of stable and unstable linear descriptor systems. The new set representation inherits most of the properties of constrained zonotopes, including efficient complexity reduction methods, while allowing to describe different classes of sets, such as strips, hyperplanes, and the entire $n$-dimensional Euclidean space. The advantages of the proposed approaches with respect to constrained zonotope methods are highlighted in numerical examples. ",

    "abstract": "A new graph neural network-based recommendation model called KGLN, which leverages Knowledge Graph (KG) information, was developed to enhance the accuracy and effectiveness of personalized recommendations. This model begins by using a single-layer neural network to merge individual node features in the graph. It then adjusts the aggregation weights of neighboring entities by incorporating influence factors. The model evolves from a single layer to multiple layers through iteration, enabling entities to access extensive multi-order associated entity information. The final step involves integrating features of entities and users to produce a recommendation score. The model's performance was evaluated by comparing its effects on various aggregation methods and influence factors. In tests using the MovieLen-1M and Book-Crossing datasets, KGLN showed an AUC (Area Under the ROC curve) improvement of 0.3% to 5.9% and 1.1% to 8.2%, respectively, over established benchmark methods like LibFM, DeepFM, Wide&Deep, and RippleNet.

    "abstract": "Non-terrestrial networks (NTNs), including low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites, are expected to play a pivotal role in achieving global coverage for Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications in sixth-generation (6G) systems. Although specific frequency bands have been identified for satellite use in NTNs, persistent challenges arise due to the limited availability of spectrum resources. The coexistence of multiple systems, including terrestrial networks (TNs), sharing these frequencies, presents a technically challenging yet feasible solution. Furthermore, the effective management and regulation of such coexistence should be under the purview of regional authorities. To facilitate efficient spectrum sharing among various systems, including NTNs and TNs, adopting open architectures is desirable, allowing for the seamless exchange of key information for spectrum sharing. Therefore, it is essential to consider open radio access networks (O-RAN) for future NTNs and TNs. In addition to O-RAN, the establishment of spectrum marketplaces, enabling different operators to trade their spectrum and dynamic resource allocation information, is necessary. In this article, we highlight the role of spectrum marketplaces and discuss a few examples. ",

    "abstract": "Non-terrestrial network (NTN) communication has garnered considerable attention from government entities, industries, and academia in recent times. NTN networks encompass a variety of systems, including Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites, Medium Earth Orbit (MEO) satellites, Geostationary Earth Orbit (GEO) satellites, High Altitude Platforms (HAPS), and Low Altitude Platforms (LAPS). Furthermore, the deployment of high-throughput satellites (HTS/VHTS) in the GEO space has gained momentum. While LEO and MEO satellites offer advantages such as low latency and reduced launching costs compared to GEO satellites, this study focuses on GEO satellites due to their stationary nature and broader coverage. In traditional cellular networks, each user equipment (UE) is allocated at least one resource block (RB), which is not shared with other UEs. However, in NTN communications, where the coverage area is extensive, dedicating an RB to only one UE is an inefficient utilization of radio resources. To address this challenge, fractional programming (FP), cognitive radio, and rate splitting multiple access (RSMA) are existing technologies. This paper aims to maximize spectral efficiency, average RBG rate, and sum rate for GEO satellite systems. However, achieving this objective involves dealing with a non-convex, NP-hard problem, as it requires the logarithmic sum of different fractions. Finding a global solution to such an NP-hard problem presents significant challenges. This paper introduces a novel alternate fractional programming algorithm specifically designed to tackle these complex NP-hard problems in the context of GEO NTN cellular networks. By employing this innovative approach, the study seeks to contribute to the optimization of NTN communication systems, enabling efficient resource allocation and improved network performance. ",

To support scalability, the bandwidth allocation policy is represented by a graph neural network (GNN), with which the number of training parameters does not change with the number of users. To enable the generalization of the GNN, we develop a hybrid-task meta-learning (HML) algorithm that trains the initial parameters of the GNN with different communication scenarios during meta-training. Next, during meta-testing, a few samples are used to fine-tune the GNN with unseen communication scenarios. Simulation results demonstrate that our HML approach can improve the initial performance by $8.79\\%$, and sampling efficiency by $73\\%$, compared with existing benchmarks. After fine-tuning, our near-optimal GNN-based policy can achieve close to the same reward with much lower inference complexity compared to the optimal policy obtained using iterative optimization. ",

However, it is difficult to demonstrate their superiority in classification accuracy, because current efforts mainly focus on designing better network structures. In this work, enlighten by brain-inspired science, we find that, not only the structure but also the learning process should be human-like. To achieve this, we investigate the power of Curriculum Learning (CL) on SNNs by designing a novel method named CSNN with two theoretically guaranteed mechanisms: The active-to-dormant training order makes the curriculum similar to that of human learning and suitable for spiking neurons; The value-based regional encoding makes the neuron activity to mimic the brain memory when learning sequential data. Experiments on multiple time series sources including simulated, sensor, motion, and healthcare demonstrate that CL has a more positive effect on SNNs than ANNs with about twice the accuracy change, and CSNN can increase about 3% SNNs' accuracy by improving network sparsity, neuron firing status, anti-noise ability, and convergence speed.

We extend the null space definition from linear to nonlinear maps and discuss the presence of a null space in neural networks. The null space of a given neural network can tell us the part of the input data that makes no contribution to the final prediction so that we can use it to trick the neural network. This reveals an inherent weakness in neural networks that can be exploited. One application described here leads to a method of image steganography. Through experiments on image datasets such as MNIST, we show that we can use null space components to force the neural network to choose a selected hidden image class, even though the overall image can be made to look like a completely different image. We conclude by showing comparisons between what a human viewer would see, and the part of the image that the neural network is actually using to make predictions and, hence, show that what the neural network ``sees'' is completely different than what we would expect.

Therefore, it is imperative to extend the single-sensor technique to Multi-Sensor Multi-Target Tracking (MSMTT) for enhanced functionality. Typical MSMTT methods presume complete randomness of all uncertain components, and therefore effective solutions such as the random finite set filter and covariance intersection method have been derived to conduct the MSMTT task. However, the presence of epistemic uncertainty, arising from incomplete information, is often disregarded within the context of MSMTT. This paper develops an innovative possibility Labeled Multi-Bernoulli (LMB) Filter based on the labeled Uncertain Finite Set (UFS) theory. The LMB filter inherits the high robustness of the possibility generalized labeled multi-Bernoulli filter with simplified computational complexity. The fusion of LMB UFSs is derived and adapted to develop a robust MSMTT scheme. Simulation results corroborate the superior performance exhibited by the proposed approach in comparison to typical probabilistic methods. ",

    "abstract": "With the scaling up of crude oil scheduling in modern refineries, large-scale crude oil scheduling problems (LSCOSPs) emerge with thousands of binary variables and non-linear constraints, which are challenging to be optimized by traditional optimization methods. To solve LSCOSPs, we take the practical crude oil scheduling from a marine-access refinery as an example and start with modeling LSCOSPs from crude unloading, transportation, crude distillation unit processing, and inventory management of intermediate products. On the basis of the proposed model, a dual-stage evolutionary algorithm driven by heuristic rules (denoted by DSEA/HR) is developed, where the dual-stage search mechanism consists of global search and local refinement. In the global search stage, we devise several heuristic rules based on the empirical operating knowledge to generate a well-performing initial population and accelerate convergence in the mixed variables space. In the local refinement stage, a repair strategy is proposed to move the infeasible solutions towards feasible regions by further optimizing the local continuous variables. During the whole evolutionary process, the proposed dual-stage framework plays a crucial role in balancing exploration and exploitation. Experimental results have shown that DSEA/HR outperforms the state-of-the-art and widely-used mathematical programming methods and metaheuristic algorithms on LSCOSP instances within a reasonable time.

GLE emergence in Geospatial Artificial Intelligence (GeoAI) is precipitated by the need for deeper geospatial awareness in our complex contemporary spaces and the success of LLMs in extracting deep meaning in Generative AI. We searched Google Scholar, Science Direct, and arXiv for papers on geospatial location embedding and LLM and reviewed articles focused on gaining deeper spatial \"knowing\" through LLMs. We screened 304 titles, 30 abstracts, and 18 full-text papers that reveal four GLE themes - Entity Location Embedding (ELE), Document Location Embedding (DLE), Sequence Location Embedding (SLE), and Token Location Embedding (TLE). Synthesis is tabular and narrative, including a dialogic conversation between \"Space\" and \"LLM.\" Though GLEs aid spatial understanding by superimposing spatial data, they emphasize the need to advance in the intricacies of spatial modalities and generalized reasoning. GLEs signal the need for a Spatial Foundation/Language Model (SLM) that embeds spatial knowing within the model architecture. The SLM framework advances Spatial Artificial Intelligence Systems (SPAIS), establishing a Spatial Vector Space (SVS) that maps to physical space. The resulting spatially imbued Language Model is unique. It simultaneously represents actual space and an AI-capable space, paving the way for AI native geo storage, analysis, and multi-modality as the basis for Spatial Artificial Intelligence Systems (SPAIS).

We propose CLAN, a two-tower contrastive learning-based novelty detection framework with diverse types of negative pairs for human activity recognition. It is tailored to challenges with human activity characteristics, including the significance of temporal and frequency features, complex activity dynamics, shared features across activities, and sensor modality variations. The framework aims to construct invariant representations of known activity robust to the challenges. To generate suitable negative pairs, it selects data augmentation methods according to the temporal and frequency characteristics of each dataset. It derives the key representations against meaningless dynamics by contrastive and classification losses-based representation learning and score function-based novelty detection that accommodate dynamic numbers of the different types of augmented samples. The proposed two-tower model extracts the representations in terms of time and frequency, mutually enhancing expressiveness for distinguishing between new and known activities, even when they share common features. Experiments on four real-world human activity datasets show that CLAN surpasses the best performance of existing novelty detection methods, improving by 8.3%, 13.7%, and 53.3% in AUROC, balanced accuracy, and FPR@TPR0.95 metrics respectively.

This work aims to predict all types of geomagnetic storms reliably and as early as possible using big data and machine learning algorithms. By fusing big data collected from multiple ground stations in the world on different aspects of solar measurements and using Random Forests regression with feature selection and downsampling on minor geomagnetic storm instances (which carry majority of the data), we are able to achieve an accuracy of 82.55% on data collected in 2021 when making early predictions three hours in advance. Given that important predictive features such as historic Kp indices are measured every 3 hours and their importance decay quickly with the amount of time in advance, an early prediction of 3 hours ahead of time is believed to be close to the practical limit.

    "abstract": "Emergence, a global property of complex adaptive systems (CASs) constituted by interactive agents, is prevalent in real-world dynamic systems, e.g., network-level traffic congestions. Detecting its formation and evaporation helps to monitor the state of a system, allowing to issue a warning signal for harmful emergent phenomena. Since there is no centralized controller of CAS, detecting emergence based on each agent's local observation is desirable but challenging. Existing works are unable to capture emergence-related spatial patterns, and fail to model the nonlinear relationships among agents. This paper proposes a hierarchical framework with spatio-temporal consistency learning to solve these two problems by learning the system representation and agent representations, respectively. Especially, spatio-temporal encoders are tailored to capture agents' nonlinear relationships and the system's complex evolution. Representations of the agents and the system are learned by preserving the intrinsic spatio-temporal consistency in a self-supervised manner. Our method achieves more accurate detection than traditional methods and deep learning methods on three datasets with well-known yet hard-to-detect emergent behaviors. Notably, our hierarchical framework is generic, which can employ other deep learning methods for agent-level and system-level detection. ",

However, there are still open questions about the effects of perturbations on trajectory predictor inputs other than state histories, and how these attacks impact downstream planning and control. In this paper, we conduct a sensitivity analysis on two trajectory prediction models, Trajectron++ and AgentFormer. We observe that between all inputs, almost all of the perturbation sensitivities for Trajectron++ lie only within the most recent state history time point, while perturbation sensitivities for AgentFormer are spread across state histories over time. We additionally demonstrate that, despite dominant sensitivity on state history perturbations, an undetectable image map perturbation made with the Fast Gradient Sign Method can induce large prediction error increases in both models. Even though image maps may contribute slightly to the prediction output of both models, this result reveals that rather than being robust to adversarial image perturbations, trajectory predictors are susceptible to image attacks. Using an optimization-based planner and example perturbations crafted from sensitivity results, we show how this vulnerability can cause a vehicle to come to a sudden stop from moderate driving speeds.

    "abstract": "Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (TTPs) represent sophisticated attack patterns in the cybersecurity domain, described encyclopedically in textual knowledge bases. Identifying TTPs in cybersecurity writing, often called TTP mapping, is an important and challenging task. Conventional learning approaches often target the problem in the classical multi-class or multilabel classification setting. This setting hinders the learning ability of the model due to a large number of classes (i.e., TTPs), the inevitable skewness of the label distribution and the complex hierarchical structure of the label space. We formulate the problem in a different learning paradigm, where the assignment of a text to a TTP label is decided by the direct semantic similarity between the two, thus reducing the complexity of competing solely over the large labeling space. To that end, we propose a neural matching architecture with an effective sampling-based learn-to-compare mechanism, facilitating the learning process of the matching model despite constrained resources.

    "abstract": "In large IT systems, software deployment is a crucial process in online services as their code is regularly updated. However, a faulty code change may degrade the target service's performance and cause cascading outages in downstream services. Thus, software deployments should be comprehensively monitored, and their anomalies should be detected timely. In this paper, we study the problem of anomaly detection for deployments. We begin by identifying the challenges unique to this anomaly detection problem, which is at entity-level (e.g., deployments), relative to the more typical problem of anomaly detection in multivariate time series (MTS). The unique challenges include the heterogeneity of deployments, the low latency tolerance, the ambiguous anomaly definition, and the limited supervision. To address them, we propose a novel framework, semi-supervised hybrid Model for Entity-Level Online Detection of anomalY (MELODY). MELODY first transforms the MTS of different entities to the same feature space by an online feature extractor, then uses a newly proposed semi-supervised deep one-class model for detecting anomalous entities. We evaluated MELODY on real data of cloud services with 1.2M+ time series. The relative F1 score improvement of MELODY over the state-of-the-art methods ranges from 7.6% to 56.5%. The user evaluation suggests MELODY is suitable for monitoring deployments in large online systems. ",

On the other hand, low-rank training, as an alternative way to train low-rank CNNs from scratch, has been exploited little yet. Unlike low-rank compression, low-rank training does not need pre-trained full-rank models, and the entire training phase is always performed on the low-rank structure, bringing attractive benefits for practical applications. However, the existing low-rank training solutions still face several challenges, such as a considerable accuracy drop and/or still needing to update full-size models during the training. In this paper, we perform a systematic investigation on low-rank CNN training. By identifying the proper low-rank format and performance-improving strategy, we propose ELRT, an efficient low-rank training solution for high-accuracy, high-compactness, low-rank CNN models. Our extensive evaluation results for training various CNNs on different datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of ELRT. ",

The emergence of foundation models (FMs) offers potential solutions to the limitations of existing FL frameworks, e.g., by generating synthetic data for model initialization. However, due to the inherent safety concerns of FMs, integrating FMs into FL could introduce new risks, which remains largely unexplored. To address this gap, we conduct the first investigation on the vulnerability of FM integrated FL (FM-FL) under adversarial threats. Based on a unified framework of FM-FL, we introduce a novel attack strategy that exploits safety issues of FM to compromise FL client models. Through extensive experiments with well-known models and benchmark datasets in both image and text domains, we reveal the high susceptibility of the FM-FL to this new threat under various FL configurations. Furthermore, we find that existing FL defense strategies offer limited protection against this novel attack approach. This research highlights the critical need for enhanced security measures in FL in the era of FMs. ",

The simulation results indicate that, for a PAC(256, 128) code, only 8% of the population requires that their fitness function be evaluated with a large list size. This represents an improvement of almost 92% over a conventional evolutionary algorithm. For a PAC(64, 32) code, this improvement is about 99%.

The object detector, You Look Only Once (YOLO), has gained popularity in agriculture in a relatively short span due to its state-of-the-art performance. YOLO offers real-time detection with good accuracy and is implemented in various agricultural tasks, including monitoring, surveillance, sensing, automation, and robotics. The research and application of YOLO in agriculture are accelerating rapidly but are fragmented and multidisciplinary. Moreover, the performance characteristics (i.e., accuracy, speed, computation) of the object detector influence the rate of technology implementation and adoption in agriculture. Thus, the study aims to collect extensive literature to document and critically evaluate the advances and application of YOLO for agricultural object recognition. First, we conducted a bibliometric review of 257 articles to understand the scholarly landscape of YOLO in agricultural domain. Secondly, we conducted a systematic review of 30 articles to identify current knowledge, gaps, and modifications in YOLO for specific agricultural tasks. The study critically assesses and summarizes the information on YOLO's end-to-end learning approach, including data acquisition, processing, network modification, integration, and deployment. We also discussed task-specific YOLO algorithm modification and integration to meet the agricultural object or environment-specific challenges. In general, YOLO-integrated digital tools and technologies show the potential for real-time, automated monitoring, surveillance, and object handling to reduce labor, production cost, and environmental impact while maximizing resource efficiency. The study provides detailed documentation and significantly advances the existing knowledge on applying YOLO in agriculture, which can greatly benefit the scientific community. ",

The integration of MEC with 5G, referred to as 5G-MEC, provides real-time processing and data-driven decision-making in close proximity to the user. The 5G-MEC has gained significant recognition in task offloading as an essential tool for applications that require low delay. Nevertheless, few studies consider the dropped task ratio metric. Disregarding this metric might possibly undermine system efficiency. In this paper, the dropped task ratio and delay has been minimized in a realistic 5G-MEC task offloading scenario implemented in NS3. We utilize Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) and Genetic Algorithm (GA) to optimize delay and dropped task ratio. We examined the effect of the number of tasks and users on the dropped task ratio and delay. Compared to two traditional offloading schemes, First Come First Serve (FCFS) and Shortest Task First (STF), our proposed method effectively works in 5G-MEC task offloading scenario. For MILP, the dropped task ratio and delay has been minimized by 20% and 2ms compared to GA. ",

    "abstract": "Few-shot node classification poses a significant challenge for Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) due to insufficient supervision and potential distribution shifts between labeled and unlabeled nodes. Self-training has emerged as a widely popular framework to leverage the abundance of unlabeled data, which expands the training set by assigning pseudo-labels to selected unlabeled nodes. Efforts have been made to develop various selection strategies based on confidence, information gain, etc. However, none of these methods takes into account the distribution shift between the training and testing node sets. The pseudo-labeling step may amplify this shift and even introduce new ones, hindering the effectiveness of self-training. Therefore, in this work, we explore the potential of explicitly bridging the distribution shift between the expanded training set and test set during self-training. To this end, we propose a novel Distribution-Consistent Graph Self-Training (DC-GST) framework to identify pseudo-labeled nodes that are both informative and capable of redeeming the distribution discrepancy and formulate it as a differentiable optimization task. A distribution-shift-aware edge predictor is further adopted to augment the graph and increase the model's generalizability in assigning pseudo labels. We evaluate our proposed method on four publicly available benchmark datasets and extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. ",

In this context, our study examines the class imbalances for vulnerable road users by focusing on class distribution analysis, performance evaluation, and bias impact assessment. We identify the concern of imbalances in class representation, leading to potential biases in detection accuracy. Utilizing popular CNN models and Vision Transformers (ViTs) with the nuScenes dataset, our performance evaluation reveals detection disparities for underrepresented classes. We propose a methodology for model optimization and bias mitigation, which includes data augmentation, resampling, and metric-specific learning. Using the proposed mitigation approaches, we see improvement in IoU(%) and NDS(%) metrics from 71.3 to 75.6 and 80.6 to 83.7 respectively, for the CNN model. Similarly, for ViT, we observe improvement in IoU and NDS metrics from 74.9 to 79.2 and 83.8 to 87.1 respectively.

    "abstract": "Blackouts in recent decades show an increasing prevalence of power outages due to extreme weather events such as hurricanes. Precisely assessing the spatiotemporal outages in distribution networks, the most vulnerable part of power systems, is critical to enhance power system resilience. The Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) simulation method is widely used for spatiotemporal risk analysis of power systems during extreme weather hazards. However, it is found here that the SMC method can lead to large errors by directly applying the fragility function or failure probability of system components in time-sequential analysis, particularly overestimating damages under evolving hazards with high-frequency sampling. To address this issue, a novel hazard resistance-based spatiotemporal risk analysis (HRSRA) method is proposed. This method converts the time-varying failure probability of a component into a hazard resistance as a time-invariant value during the simulation of evolving hazards. The proposed HRSRA provides an adaptive framework for incorporating high-spatiotemporal-resolution meteorology models into power outage simulations. By leveraging the geographic information system data of the power system and a physics-based hurricane wind field model, the superiority of the proposed method is validated using real-world time-series power outage data from Puerto Rico during Hurricane Fiona 2022.

To further characterize the stability of LoRA-based second-pass speech recognition models, we examine robustness against input perturbations. These perturbations are rooted in homophone replacements and a novel metric called N-best Perturbation-based Rescoring Robustness (NPRR), both designed to measure the relative degradation in the performance of rescoring models. Our experimental results indicate that while advanced variants of LoRA, such as dynamic rank-allocated LoRA, lead to performance degradation in $1$-best perturbation, they alleviate the degradation in $N$-best perturbation. This finding is in comparison to fully-tuned models and vanilla LoRA tuning baselines, suggesting that a comprehensive selection is needed when using LoRA-based adaptation for compute-cost savings and robust language modeling.

A DSP vocoder often gets a lower audio quality due to consuming over-smoothed acoustic model predictions of approximate representations for the vocal tract. In this paper, we propose an ultra-lightweight differential DSP (DDSP) vocoder that uses a jointly optimized acoustic model with a DSP vocoder, and learns without an extracted spectral feature for the vocal tract. The model achieves audio quality comparable to neural vocoders with a high average MOS of 4.36 while being efficient as a DSP vocoder.

Previous work has investigated the dimensional collapse problem of SSL at a global level. In this paper, we demonstrate that representations can span over high dimensional space globally, but collapse locally.

Our formulation is based on the derivation of the Fisher-Rao metric to compare and optimize local distance distributions at an asymptotically small radius for each data point. By increasing the local intrinsic dimensionality, we demonstrate through a range of experiments that LDReg improves the representation quality of SSL.

The proposed method can efficiently and accurately estimate the probabilistic characteristics of AC-OPF solutions. An adaptive domain partition strategy and expansion coefficient calculation algorithm are integrated to enhance its performance. Numerical studies on a 9-bus system demonstrate that the proposed ASSE method offers accurate and fast evaluations compared to the Monte Carlo simulations. A comparison with a sparse polynomial chaos expansion method, an existing surrogate model, further demonstrates its efficacy in accurately assessing the responses with strongly local behaviors. ",

Evolutionary algorithms (EAs) can discover diverse solutions to complex real-world problems. Motivated by the common collective and directionality of text sequence generation and evolution, this paper illustrates the strong consistency of LLMs and EAs, which includes multiple one-to-one key characteristics: token embedding and genotype-phenotype mapping, position encoding and fitness shaping, position embedding and selection, attention and crossover, feed-forward neural network and mutation, model training and parameter update, and multi-task learning and multi-objective optimization. Based on this consistency perspective, existing coupling studies are analyzed, including evolutionary fine-tuning and LLM-enhanced EAs. Leveraging these insights, we outline a fundamental roadmap for future research in coupling LLMs and EAs, while highlighting key challenges along the way. The consistency not only reveals the evolution mechanism behind LLMs but also facilitates the development of evolved artificial agents that approach or surpass biological organisms. ",

Further, the existing fault-tolerant solutions prove inadequate for effectively training GNNs in the presence of faults. In this paper, we propose a fault-aware framework referred to as FARe that mitigates the effect of faults during GNN training.

Benefiting from the powerful capabilities of deep learning backbones, recent works in face inpainting have achieved decent performance in ideal setting (square shape with $512px$).

A neighbor hybrid attention block is proposed with a hybrid attention mechanism to improve the facial understanding ability of the model without restricting the shape of the input. Finally, an implicit neural pyramid decoder is introduced to explicitly model position information and bridge the gap between low-resolution features and high-resolution output.

    "abstract": "A multitude of toxic online behaviors, ranging from network attacks to anonymous traffic and spam, have severely disrupted the smooth operation of networks. Due to the inherent sender-receiver nature of network behaviors, graph-based frameworks are commonly used for detecting anomalous behaviors. However, in real-world scenarios, the boundary between normal and anomalous behaviors tends to be ambiguous. The local heterophily of graphs interferes with the detection, and existing methods based on nodes or edges introduce unwanted noise into representation results, thereby impacting the effectiveness of detection. To address these issues, we propose PhoGAD, a graph-based anomaly detection framework. PhoGAD leverages persistent homology optimization to clarify behavioral boundaries. Building upon this, the weights of adjacent edges are designed to mitigate the effects of local heterophily. Subsequently, to tackle the noise problem, we conduct a formal analysis and propose a disentangled representation-based explicit embedding method, ultimately achieving anomaly behavior detection. Experiments on intrusion, traffic, and spam datasets verify that PhoGAD has surpassed the performance of state-of-the-art (SOTA) frameworks in detection efficacy. Notably, PhoGAD demonstrates robust detection even with diminished anomaly proportions, highlighting its applicability to real-world scenarios. The analysis of persistent homology demonstrates its effectiveness in capturing the topological structure formed by normal edge features. Additionally, ablation experiments validate the effectiveness of the innovative mechanisms integrated within PhoGAD. ",

    "abstract": "This work studies the problem of panoptic symbol spotting, which is to spot and parse both countable object instances (windows, doors, tables, etc.) and uncountable stuff (wall, railing, etc.) from computer-aided design (CAD) drawings. Existing methods typically involve either rasterizing the vector graphics into images and using image-based methods for symbol spotting, or directly building graphs and using graph neural networks for symbol recognition. In this paper, we take a different approach, which treats graphic primitives as a set of 2D points that are locally connected and use point cloud segmentation methods to tackle it. Specifically, we utilize a point transformer to extract the primitive features and append a mask2former-like spotting head to predict the final output. To better use the local connection information of primitives and enhance their discriminability, we further propose the attention with connection module (ACM) and contrastive connection learning scheme (CCL). Finally, we propose a KNN interpolation mechanism for the mask attention module of the spotting head to better handle primitive mask downsampling, which is primitive-level in contrast to pixel-level for the image. Our approach, named SymPoint, is simple yet effective, outperforming recent state-of-the-art method GAT-CADNet by an absolute increase of 9.6% PQ and 10.4% RQ on the FloorPlanCAD dataset.

To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes a 360ORB-SLAM system for panoramic images that combines with a depth completion network. The system extracts feature points from the panoramic image, utilizes a panoramic triangulation module to generate sparse depth information, and employs a depth completion network to obtain a dense panoramic depth map. Experimental results on our novel panoramic dataset constructed based on Carla demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior scale accuracy compared to existing monocular SLAM methods and effectively addresses the challenges of feature association and scale ambiguity. The integration of the depth completion network enhances system stability and mitigates the impact of dynamic elements on SLAM performance. ",

    "abstract": "Development of multi-modal, probabilistic prediction models has lead to a need for comprehensive evaluation metrics. While several metrics can characterize the accuracy of machine-learned models (e.g., negative log-likelihood, Jensen-Shannon divergence), these metrics typically operate on probability densities. Applying them to purely sample-based prediction models thus requires that the underlying density function is estimated. However, common methods such as kernel density estimation (KDE) have been demonstrated to lack robustness, while more complex methods have not been evaluated in multi-modal estimation problems. In this paper, we present ROME (RObust Multi-modal density Estimator), a non-parametric approach for density estimation which addresses the challenge of estimating multi-modal, non-normal, and highly correlated distributions. ROME utilizes clustering to segment a multi-modal set of samples into multiple uni-modal ones and then combines simple KDE estimates obtained for individual clusters in a single multi-modal estimate. We compared our approach to state-of-the-art methods for density estimation as well as ablations of ROME, showing that it not only outperforms established methods but is also more robust to a variety of distributions. Our results demonstrate that ROME can overcome the issues of over-fitting and over-smoothing exhibited by other estimators, promising a more robust evaluation of probabilistic machine learning models.

To address these challenges, we propose an efficient defense mechanism, PuriDefense, that employs random patch-wise purifications with an ensemble of lightweight purification models at a low level of inference cost. These models leverage the local implicit function and rebuild the natural image manifold. Our theoretical analysis suggests that this approach slows down the convergence of query-based attacks by incorporating randomness into purifications. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet validate the effectiveness of our proposed purifier-based defense mechanism, demonstrating significant improvements in robustness against query-based attacks.

Nevertheless, the emergence of recent adversarial attacks has had a detrimental impact on the balance-related information. Similar to how structure learning can restore unsigned graphs, balance learning can be applied to signed graphs by improving the balance degree of the poisoned graph. However, this approach encounters the challenge \"Irreversibility of Balance-related Information\" - while the balance degree improves, the restored edges may not be the ones originally affected by attacks, resulting in poor defense effectiveness. To address this challenge, we propose a robust SGNN framework called Balance Augmented-Signed Graph Contrastive Learning (BA-SGCL), which combines Graph Contrastive Learning principles with balance augmentation techniques. Experimental results demonstrate that BA-SGCL not only enhances robustness against existing adversarial attacks but also achieves superior performance on link sign prediction task across various datasets.

Although ST data offers valuable insights into the micro-environment of tumors, its acquisition cost remains expensive. Therefore, directly predicting the ST expressions from digital pathology images is desired. Current methods usually adopt existing regression backbones for this task, which ignore the inherent multi-scale hierarchical data structure of digital pathology images. To address this limit, we propose M2ORT, a many-to-one regression Transformer that can accommodate the hierarchical structure of the pathology images through a decoupled multi-scale feature extractor. Different from traditional models that are trained with one-to-one image-label pairs, M2ORT accepts multiple pathology images of different magnifications at a time to jointly predict the gene expressions at their corresponding common ST spot, aiming at learning a many-to-one relationship through training. We have tested M2ORT on three public ST datasets and the experimental results show that M2ORT can achieve state-of-the-art performance with fewer parameters and floating-point operations (FLOPs).

In recent years, causal inference methods have been increasingly used in fair machine learning to measure unfairness by causal effects. However, current methods assume that the true causal graph is given, which is often not true in real-world applications. To address this limitation, this paper proposes a framework for achieving causal fairness based on the notion of interventions when the true causal graph is partially known. The proposed approach involves modeling fair prediction using a Partially Directed Acyclic Graph (PDAG), specifically, a class of causal DAGs that can be learned from observational data combined with domain knowledge. The PDAG is used to measure causal fairness, and a constrained optimization problem is formulated to balance between fairness and accuracy. Results on both simulated and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of this method. ",

However, existing D-truss-based work cannot perform efficient community searches on large graphs because it consumes too many computing resources to retrieve the maximal D-truss. To overcome this issue, we introduce an innovative merge relation known as D-truss-connected to capture the inherent density and cohesiveness of edges within D-truss. This relation allows us to partition all the edges in the original graph into a series of D-truss-connected classes. Then, we construct a concise and compact index, ConDTruss, based on D-truss-connected. Using ConDTruss, the efficiency of maximum D-truss retrieval will be greatly improved, making it a theoretically optimal approach.

    "abstract": "We propose a comprehensive dataset for object detection in diverse driving environments across 9 districts in Bangladesh. The dataset, collected exclusively from smartphone cameras, provided a realistic representation of real-world scenarios, including day and night conditions. Most existing datasets lack suitable classes for autonomous navigation on Bangladeshi roads, making it challenging for researchers to develop models that can handle the intricacies of road scenarios. To address this issue, the authors proposed a new set of classes based on characteristics rather than local vehicle names. The dataset aims to encourage the development of models that can handle the unique challenges of Bangladeshi road scenarios for the effective deployment of autonomous vehicles. The dataset did not consist of any online images to simulate real-world conditions faced by autonomous vehicles. The classification of vehicles is challenging because of the diverse range of vehicles on Bangladeshi roads, including those not found elsewhere in the world. The proposed classification system is scalable and can accommodate future vehicles, making it a valuable resource for researchers in the autonomous vehicle sector. ",

    "title": "PTPsec: Securing the Precision Time Protocol Against Time Delay Attacks  Using Cyclic Path Asymmetry Analysis",
    "abstract": "High-precision time synchronization is a vital prerequisite for many modern applications and technologies, including Smart Grids, Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN), and 5G networks. Although the Precision Time Protocol (PTP) can accomplish this requirement in trusted environments, it becomes unreliable in the presence of specific cyber attacks. Mainly, time delay attacks pose the highest threat to the protocol, enabling attackers to diverge targeted clocks undetected. With the increasing danger of cyber attacks, especially against critical infrastructure, there is a great demand for effective countermeasures to secure both time synchronization and the applications that depend on it. However, current solutions are not sufficiently capable of mitigating sophisticated delay attacks. For example, they lack proper integration into the PTP protocol, scalability, or sound evaluation with the required microsecond-level accuracy. This work proposes an approach to detect and counteract delay attacks against PTP based on cyclic path asymmetry measurements over redundant paths. For that, we provide a method to find redundant paths in arbitrary networks and show how this redundancy can be exploited to reveal and mitigate undesirable asymmetries on the synchronization path that cause the malicious clock divergence. Furthermore, we propose PTPsec, a secure PTP protocol and its implementation based on the latest IEEE 1588-2019 standard. With PTPsec, we advance the conventional PTP to support reliable delay attack detection and mitigation. We validate our approach on a hardware testbed, which includes an attacker capable of performing static and incremental delay attacks at a microsecond precision. Our experimental results show that all attack scenarios can be reliably detected and mitigated with minimal detection time. ",

Our results show that the proposed approach provides an average accuracy of over 99% across multiple attack datasets with 0.64% false detection rates while consuming 94% less energy and achieving 51.8% reduction in per-message processing latency when compared to IDS implementations on GPUs.

    "abstract": "Rising connectivity in vehicles is enabling new capabilities like connected autonomous driving and advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) for improving the safety and reliability of next-generation vehicles. This increased access to in-vehicle functions compromises critical capabilities that use legacy invehicle networks like Controller Area Network (CAN), which has no inherent security or authentication mechanism. Intrusion detection and mitigation approaches, particularly using machine learning models, have shown promising results in detecting multiple attack vectors in CAN through their ability to generalise to new vectors. However, most deployments require dedicated computing units like GPUs to perform line-rate detection, consuming much higher power. In this paper, we present a lightweight multi-attack quantised machine learning model that is deployed using Xilinx's Deep Learning Processing Unit IP on a Zynq Ultrascale+ (XCZU3EG) FPGA, which is trained and validated using the public CAN Intrusion Detection dataset. The quantised model detects denial of service and fuzzing attacks with an accuracy of above 99 % and a false positive rate of 0.07%, which are comparable to the state-of-the-art techniques in the literature. The Intrusion Detection System (IDS) execution consumes just 2.0 W with software tasks running on the ECU and achieves a 25 % reduction in per-message processing latency over the state-of-the-art implementations. This deployment allows the ECU function to coexist with the IDS with minimal changes to the tasks, making it ideal for real-time IDS in in-vehicle systems. ",

    "abstract": "espite being widely used in network intrusion detection systems (NIDSs), machine learning (ML) has proven to be highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks. White-box and black-box adversarial attacks of NIDS have been explored in several studies. However, white-box attacks unrealistically assume that the attackers have full knowledge of the target NIDSs. Meanwhile, existing black-box attacks can not achieve high attack success rate due to the weak adversarial transferability between models (e.g., neural networks and tree models). Additionally, neither of them explains why adversarial examples exist and why they can transfer across models. To address these challenges, this paper introduces ETA, an Explainable Transfer-based Black-Box Adversarial Attack framework. ETA aims to achieve two primary objectives: 1) create transferable adversarial examples applicable to various ML models and 2) provide insights into the existence of adversarial examples and their transferability within NIDSs. Specifically, we first provide a general transfer-based adversarial attack method applicable across the entire ML space. Following that, we exploit a unique insight based on cooperative game theory and perturbation interpretations to explain adversarial examples and adversarial transferability. On this basis, we propose an Important-Sensitive Feature Selection (ISFS) method to guide the search for adversarial examples, achieving stronger transferability and ensuring traffic-space constraints.

However, equipping AI models with robust cross-modality reasoning ability remains challenging since the cognition scheme of humans has not been understood systematically. In this paper, we believe that if we can collect visual clues in the given image as much as possible, we will recognize the image more accurately, understand the question better, recall relevant knowledge more easily, and finally reason out the answer. We discover these rich visual clues by mining question-answer pairs in images and sending them into multi-modal large language models as prompts. We call the proposed method Q&A Prompts. Specifically, we first use the image-answer pairs and the corresponding questions in the training set as inputs and outputs to train a visual question generation model. Then, we use an image tagging model to identify various instances and send packaged image-tag pairs into the visual question generation model to generate relevant questions with the extracted image tags as answers. Finally, we encode these generated question-answer pairs as prompts with a visual-aware prompting module and send them into pre-trained multi-modal large language models to reason out the final answers. Experimental results show that, compared with state-of-the-art methods, our Q&A Prompts achieves substantial improvements on the challenging visual question answering datasets requiring reasoning over diverse world knowledge, such as OK-VQA and A-OKVQA.

Specifically, we represent programs as parse trees -- also known as concrete syntax trees (CSTs) -- and adapt pre-trained models on serialized CSTs. Although the models that we adapt have been pre-trained only on the surface form of programs, we find that a small amount of continual pre-training and fine-tuning on CSTs without changing the model architecture yields improvements over the baseline approach across various code tasks. The improvements are found to be particularly significant when there are limited training examples, demonstrating the effectiveness of integrating program structures with plain-text representation even when working with backbone models that have not been pre-trained with structures.

    "abstract": "Increasing automation in vehicles enabled by increased connectivity to the outside world has exposed vulnerabilities in previously siloed automotive networks like controller area networks (CAN). Attributes of CAN such as broadcast-based communication among electronic control units (ECUs) that lowered deployment costs are now being exploited to carry out active injection attacks like denial of service (DoS), fuzzing, and spoofing attacks. Research literature has proposed multiple supervised machine learning models deployed as Intrusion detection systems (IDSs) to detect such malicious activity; however, these are largely limited to identifying previously known attack vectors. With the ever-increasing complexity of active injection attacks, detecting zero-day (novel) attacks in these networks in real-time (to prevent propagation) becomes a problem of particular interest. This paper presents an unsupervised-learning-based convolutional autoencoder architecture for detecting zero-day attacks, which is trained only on benign (attack-free) CAN messages. We quantise the model using Vitis-AI tools from AMD/Xilinx targeting a resource-constrained Zynq Ultrascale platform as our IDS-ECU system for integration. The proposed model successfully achieves equal or higher classification accuracy (> 99.5%) on unseen DoS, fuzzing, and spoofing attacks from a publicly available attack dataset when compared to the state-of-the-art unsupervised learning-based IDSs. Additionally, by cleverly overlapping IDS operation on a window of CAN messages with the reception, the model is able to meet line-rate detection (0.43 ms per window) of high-speed CAN, which when coupled with the low energy consumption per inference, makes this architecture ideally suited for detecting zero-day attacks on critical CAN networks.

Leveraging the complementary characteristics of RGB and IR images, the object detector provides reliable and robust object localization from day to night. Existing fusion strategies directly inject RGB and IR images into convolution neural networks, leading to inferior detection performance. Since the RGB and IR features have modality-specific noise, these strategies will worsen the fused features along with the propagation. Inspired by the mechanism of human brain processing multimodal information, this work introduces a new coarse-to-fine perspective to purify and fuse two modality features. Specifically, following this perspective, we design a Redundant Spectrum Removal module to coarsely remove interfering information within each modality and a Dynamic Feature Selection module to finely select the desired features for feature fusion. To verify the effectiveness of the coarse-to-fine fusion strategy, we construct a new object detector called Removal and Selection Detector (RSDet). Extensive experiments on three RGB-IR object detection datasets verify the superior performance of our method. ",

Text may include the sender's name, position in the Byzantine aristocracy, and elements of prayers. Both text and iconography are precious literary sources that wait to be exploited electronically, so the development of computerized systems for interpreting seals images is of paramount importance. This work's contribution is hence a deep, two-stages, character reading pipeline for transcribing Byzantine seal images. A first deep convolutional neural network (CNN) detects characters in the seal (character localization). A second convolutional network reads the localized characters (character classification). Finally, a diplomatic transcription of the seal is provided by post-processing the two network outputs. We provide an experimental evaluation of each CNN in isolation and both CNNs in combination. All performances are evaluated by cross-validation. Character localization achieves a mean average precision (mAP@0.5) greater than 0.9. Classification of characters cropped from ground truth bounding boxes achieves Top-1 accuracy greater than 0.92. End-to-end evaluation shows the efficiency of the proposed approach when compared to the SoTA for similar tasks. ",

To test such a loop on a living network, one should first learn how to run it quickly and efficiently, reaching most effective stimuli (ones that maximize certain neurons activation) in least possible number of iterations. We present a framework with an effective design of such a loop, successfully testing it on an artificial spiking neural network (SNN, a model that mimics the behaviour of NNs in living brains). Our optimization method used for activation maximization (AM) was based on low-rank tensor decomposition (Tensor Train, TT) of the activation function's discretization over its domain the latent parameter space of stimuli (CIFAR10-size color images, generated by either VQ-VAE or SN-GAN from their latent description vectors, fed to the SNN).

These disparities in image quality present significant challenges for understanding image pairs semantically and extracting change features, ultimately resulting in a notable decline in performance. To tackle this challenge, we introduce an innovative training strategy grounded in knowledge distillation. The core idea revolves around leveraging task knowledge acquired from high-quality image pairs to guide the model's learning process when dealing with image pairs that exhibit differences in quality. Additionally, we develop a hierarchical correlation distillation approach (involving self-correlation, cross-correlation, and global correlation). This approach compels the student model to replicate the correlations inherent in the teacher model, rather than focusing solely on individual features.

This work introduces Starlit, a novel scalable privacy-preserving FL mechanism that overcomes these limitations. It has various applications, such as enhancing financial fraud detection, mitigating terrorism, and enhancing digital health. We implemented Starlit and conducted a thorough performance analysis using synthetic data from a key player in global financial transactions. The evaluation indicates Starlit's scalability, efficiency, and accuracy. ",

    "abstract": "Semantic communication has gained attention as a key enabler for intelligent and context-aware communication. However, one of the key challenges of semantic communications is the need to tailor the resource allocation to meet the specific requirements of semantic transmission. In this paper, we focus on networks with limited resources where devices are constrained to transmit with limited bandwidth and power over large distance. Specifically, we devise an efficient strategy to select the most pertinent semantic features and participating users, taking into account the channel quality, the transmission time, and the recovery accuracy. To this end, we formulate an optimization problem with the goal of selecting the most relevant and accurate semantic features over devices while satisfying constraints on transmission time and quality of the channel. This involves optimizing communication resources, identifying participating users, and choosing specific semantic information for transmission. The underlying problem is inherently complex due to its non-convex nature and combinatorial constraints. To overcome this challenge, we efficiently approximate the optimal solution by solving a series of integer linear programming problems. Our numerical findings illustrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach in managing semantic communications in networks with limited resources. ",

However, input-to-state stability depends on high-gain feedback generated by nonlinear damping terms, and closed-loop exponential stability with parameter convergence involves a stringent condition named persistent excitation (PE). This paper proposes a composite learning backstepping control (CLBC) strategy based on modular backstepping and high-order tuners to compensate for the transient process of parameter estimation and achieve closed-loop exponential stability without the nonlinear damping terms and the PE condition. A novel composite learning mechanism that maximizes the staged exciting strength is designed for parameter estimation, such that parameter convergence can be achieved under a condition of interval excitation (IE) or even partial IE that is strictly weaker than PE. An extra prediction error is employed in the adaptive law to ensure the transient performance without nonlinear damping terms. The exponential stability of the closed-loop system is proved rigorously under the partial IE or IE condition. Simulations have demonstrated the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method in both parameter estimation and control compared to state-of-the-art methods. ",

    "abstract": "Although accuracy and other common metrics can provide a useful window into the performance of an object detection model, they lack a deeper view of the model's decision process. Regardless of the quality of the training data and process, the features that an object detection model learns cannot be guaranteed. A model may learn a relationship between certain background context, i.e., scene level objects, and the presence of the labeled classes. Furthermore, standard performance verification and metrics would not identify this phenomenon. This paper presents a new black box explainability method for additional verification of object detection models by finding the impact of scene level objects on the identification of the objects within the image. By comparing the accuracies of a model on test data with and without certain scene level objects, the contributions of these objects to the model's performance becomes clearer. The experiment presented here will assess the impact of buildings and people in image context on the detection of emergency road vehicles by a fine-tuned YOLOv8 model. A large increase in accuracy in the presence of a scene level object will indicate the model's reliance on that object to make its detections. The results of this research lead to providing a quantitative explanation of the object detection model's decision process, enabling a deeper understanding of the model's performance. ",

The scale of initialisation is a crucial factor, as small initialisations are generally associated to a feature learning regime, for which gradient descent is implicitly biased towards simple solutions. This work provides a general and quantitative description of the early alignment phase, originally introduced by Maennel et al. (2018) . For small initialisation and one hidden ReLU layer networks, the early stage of the training dynamics leads to an alignment of the neurons towards key directions. This alignment induces a sparse representation of the network, which is directly related to the implicit bias of gradient flow at convergence. This sparsity inducing alignment however comes at the expense of difficulties in minimising the training objective: we also provide a simple data example for which overparameterised networks fail to converge towards global minima and only converge to a spurious stationary point instead.

    "abstract": "The performance analytics domain in High Performance Computing (HPC) uses tabular data to solve regression problems, such as predicting the execution time. Existing Machine Learning (ML) techniques leverage the correlations among features given tabular datasets, not leveraging the relationships between samples directly. Moreover, since high-quality embeddings from raw features improve the fidelity of the downstream predictive models, existing methods rely on extensive feature engineering and pre-processing steps, costing time and manual effort. To fill these two gaps, we propose a novel idea of transforming tabular performance data into graphs to leverage the advancement of Graph Neural Network-based (GNN) techniques in capturing complex relationships between features and samples. In contrast to other ML application domains, such as social networks, the graph is not given; instead, we need to build it. To address this gap, we propose graph-building methods where nodes represent samples, and the edges are automatically inferred iteratively based on the similarity between the features in the samples. We evaluate the effectiveness of the generated embeddings from GNNs based on how well they make even a simple feed-forward neural network perform for regression tasks compared to other state-of-the-art representation learning techniques. Our evaluation demonstrates that even with up to 25% random missing values for each dataset, our method outperforms commonly used graph and Deep Neural Network (DNN)-based approaches and achieves up to 61.67% & 78.56% improvement in MSE loss over the DNN baseline respectively for HPC dataset and Machine Learning Datasets.

Methods: A custom robotic actuator with a pressure sensor was used to generate an oscillatory vacuum excitation and sense the pressure inside the extracorporeal portion of the catheter. Vacuum pressure profiles and robotic motion data were used to train a support vector machine (SVM) classification model to detect contact between the aspiration catheter tip and a mock thrombus. Validation consisted of benchtop accuracy verification, as well as user study comparison to the current standard of angiographic presentation. Results: Benchtop accuracy of the sensing modality was shown to be 99.67%. The user study demonstrated statistically significant improvement in identifying catheter-thrombus contact compared to the current standard. The odds ratio of successful detection of clot contact was 2.86 (p=0.03) when using the proposed sensory method compared to without it. Conclusion: The results of this work indicate that the proposed sensing modality can offer intraoperative feedback to interventionalists that can improve their ability to detect contact between the distal tip of a catheter and a thrombus. Significance: By offering a relatively low-cost technology that affords off-the-shelf aspiration catheters as clot-detecting sensors, interventionalists can improve the first-pass effect of the mechanical thrombectomy procedure while reducing procedural times and mental burden.

    "abstract": "Quantum networks (QNs) relying on free-space optical (FSO) quantum channels can support quantum applications in environments wherein establishing an optical fiber infrastructure is challenging and costly. However, FSO-based QNs require a clear line-of-sight (LoS) between users, which is challenging due to blockages and natural obstacles. In this paper, a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted FSO-based QN is proposed as a cost-efficient framework providing a virtual LoS between users for entanglement distribution. A novel modeling of the quantum noise and losses experienced by quantum states over FSO channels defined by atmospheric losses, turbulence, and pointing errors is derived. Then, the joint optimization of entanglement distribution and RIS placement problem is formulated, under heterogeneous entanglement rate and fidelity constraints. This problem is solved using a simulated annealing metaheuristic algorithm. Simulation results show that the proposed framework effectively meets the minimum fidelity requirements of all users' quantum applications. This is in stark contrast to baseline algorithms that lead to a drop of at least 83% in users' end-to-end fidelities. The proposed framework also achieves a 64% enhancement in the fairness level between users compared to baseline rate maximizing frameworks. Finally, the weather conditions, e.g., rain, are observed to have a more significant effect than pointing errors and turbulence. ",

A particular challenge relates to the use of coded language by groups interested in both creating a sense of belonging for its users and evading detection. Coded language evolves quickly and its use varies over time. This paper proposes a methodology for detecting emerging coded hate-laden terminology. The methodology is tested in the context of online antisemitic discourse. The approach considers posts scraped from social media platforms, often used by extremist users. The posts are scraped using seed expressions related to previously known discourse of hatred towards Jews. The method begins by identifying the expressions most representative of each post and calculating their frequency in the whole corpus. It filters out grammatically incoherent expressions as well as previously encountered ones so as to focus on emergent well-formed terminology. This is followed by an assessment of semantic similarity to known antisemitic terminology using a fine-tuned large language model, and subsequent filtering out of the expressions that are too distant from known expressions of hatred. Emergent antisemitic expressions containing terms clearly relating to Jewish topics are then removed to return only coded expressions of hatred. ",

    "abstract": "Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) that operate in an event-driven manner and employ binary spike representation have recently emerged as promising candidates for energy-efficient computing. However, a cost bottleneck arises in obtaining high-performance SNNs: training a SNN model requires a large number of time steps in addition to the usual learning iterations, hence this limits their energy efficiency. This paper proposes a general training framework that enhances feature learning and activation efficiency within a limited time step, providing a new solution for more energy-efficient SNNs. Our framework allows SNN neurons to learn robust spike feature from different receptive fields and update neuron states by utilizing both current stimuli and recurrence information transmitted from other neurons. This setting continuously complements information within a single time step. Additionally, we propose a projection function to merge these two stimuli to smoothly optimize neuron weights (spike firing threshold and activation). We evaluate the proposal for both convolution and recurrent models. Our experimental results indicate state-of-the-art visual classification tasks, including CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and TinyImageNet.Our framework achieves 72.41% and 72.31% top-1 accuracy with only 1 time step on CIFAR100 for CNNs and RNNs, respectively.

However, researchers have not yet reached consensus about how best to translate the stochastic responses from these networks into discrete decisions, a process known as population decoding. Despite being an often underexamined part of SNNs, in this work we show that population decoding has a significanct impact on the classification performance of WTA networks. For this purpose, we apply a WTA network to the problem of cancer subtype diagnosis from multi omic data, using datasets from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). In doing so we utilise a novel implementation of gene similarity networks, a feature encoding technique based on Kohoens self organising map algorithm.

Ensembler leverages model ensembling on the adversarial server, running in parallel with existing approaches that introduce perturbations to sensitive data during colloborative inference. Our experiments demonstrate that when combined with even basic Gaussian noise, Ensembler can effectively shield images from reconstruction attacks, achieving recognition levels that fall below human performance in some strict settings, significantly outperforming baseline methods lacking the Ensembler framework.

Similarly, the increasing number of orbital satellites has made it easier to gather high-resolution images capturing a snapshot of a geographical area in sub-daily temporal frequency. We propose a novel data fusion methodology integrating satellite imagery with privacy-enhanced mobile data to augment the event inference task, whether in real-time or historical.

In the first inverse problem, we are given data that is offset by spatially varying systematic error (i.e., the bias, also known the epistemic uncertainty). The task is to uncover from the biased data the true state, which is the solution of the PDE. In the second inverse problem, we are given sparse information on the solution of a PDE. The task is to reconstruct the solution in space with high-resolution. First, we present the PC-CNN, which constrains the PDE with a simple time-windowing scheme to handle sequential data. Second, we analyse the performance of the PC-CNN for uncovering solutions from biased data. We analyse both linear and nonlinear convection-diffusion equations, and the Navier-Stokes equations, which govern the spatiotemporally chaotic dynamics of turbulent flows. We find that the PC-CNN correctly recovers the true solution for a variety of biases, which are parameterised as non-convex functions. Third, we analyse the performance of the PC-CNN for reconstructing solutions from biased data for the turbulent flow. We reconstruct the spatiotemporal chaotic solution on a high-resolution grid from only 2\\% of the information contained in it. For both tasks, we further analyse the Navier-Stokes solutions. We find that the inferred solutions have a physical spectral energy content, whereas traditional methods, such as interpolation, do not.

    "abstract": "Functional connectivity (FC) as derived from fMRI has emerged as a pivotal tool in elucidating the intricacies of various psychiatric disorders and delineating the neural pathways that underpin cognitive and behavioral dynamics inherent to the human brain. While Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) offer a structured approach to represent neuroimaging data, they are limited by their need for a predefined graph structure to depict associations between brain regions, a detail not solely provided by FCs. To bridge this gap, we introduce the Gated Graph Transformer (GGT) framework, designed to predict cognitive metrics based on FCs. Empirical validation on the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort (PNC) underscores the superior predictive prowess of our model, further accentuating its potential in identifying pivotal neural connectivities that correlate with human cognitive processes.

On-site excavation requires hard obstacles to be recognized prior to drilling in order to avoid damaging the tunnel boring machine and to adjust the propagation velocity. The efficiency of the structural anomaly detection can be increased with intelligent optimization techniques and machine learning. In this research, the anomaly in a simple structure is detected by comparing the experimental measurements of the structural vibrations with numerical simulations using parameter estimation methods.

    "title": "Harmonized Spatial and Spectral Learning for Robust and Generalized  Medical Image Segmentation",
    "abstract": "Deep learning has demonstrated remarkable achievements in medical image segmentation. However, prevailing deep learning models struggle with poor generalization due to (i) intra-class variations, where the same class appears differently in different samples, and (ii) inter-class independence, resulting in difficulties capturing intricate relationships between distinct objects, leading to higher false negative cases. This paper presents a novel approach that synergies spatial and spectral representations to enhance domain-generalized medical image segmentation. We introduce the innovative Spectral Correlation Coefficient objective to improve the model's capacity to capture middle-order features and contextual long-range dependencies. This objective complements traditional spatial objectives by incorporating valuable spectral information. Extensive experiments reveal that optimizing this objective with existing architectures like UNet and TransUNet significantly enhances generalization, interpretability, and noise robustness, producing more confident predictions. For instance, in cardiac segmentation, we observe a 0.81 pp and 1.63 pp (pp = percentage point) improvement in DSC over UNet and TransUNet, respectively. Our interpretability study demonstrates that, in most tasks, objectives optimized with UNet outperform even TransUNet by introducing global contextual information alongside local details. These findings underscore the versatility and effectiveness of our proposed method across diverse imaging modalities and medical domains. ",

Rotating machines in the bulk system can absorb smooth changes in the dynamic states of the system. In this context, we present a novel reservoir computing (RC) method for estimating power system quasi-steady states. By exploiting the behavior of an RC-based recurrent neural network, the proposed method can capture the inherent nonlinearities in the power flow equations. Our approach is compared with traditional methods, including least squares, Kalman filtering, and particle filtering. We demonstrate the estimation performance for all the methods under normal operation and sudden load change. Extensive experiments tested on the standard IEEE 14-bus and 300-bus cases corroborate the merit of the proposed approach. ",

    "abstract": "Room geometry inference (RGI) aims at estimating room shapes from measured room impulse responses (RIRs) and has received lots of attention for its importance in environment-aware audio rendering and virtual acoustic representation of a real venue. A lot of estimation models utilizing time difference of arrival (TDoA) or time of arrival (ToA) information in RIRs have been proposed. However, an estimation model should be able to handle more general features and complex relations between reflections to cope with various room shapes and uncertainties such as the unknown number of walls. In this study, we propose a deep neural network that can estimate various room shapes without prior assumptions on the shape or number of walls. The proposed model consists of three sub-networks: a feature extractor, parameter estimation, and evaluation networks, which extract key features from RIRs, estimate parameters, and evaluate the confidence of estimated parameters, respectively. The network is trained by about 40,000 RIRs simulated in rooms of different shapes using a single source and spherical microphone array and tested for rooms of unseen shapes and dimensions. The proposed algorithm achieves almost perfect accuracy in finding the true number of walls and shows negligible errors in room shapes. ",

    "abstract": "Unsupervised anomaly detection has gained significant attention in the field of medical imaging due to its capability of relieving the costly pixel-level annotation. To achieve this, modern approaches usually utilize generative models to produce healthy references of the diseased images and then identify the abnormalities by comparing the healthy references and the original diseased images. Recently, diffusion models have exhibited promising potential for unsupervised anomaly detection in medical images for their good mode coverage and high sample quality. However, the intrinsic characteristics of the medical images, e.g. the low contrast, and the intricate anatomical structure of the human body make the reconstruction challenging. Besides, the global information of medical images often remain underutilized. To address these two issues, we propose a novel Masked Autoencoder-enhanced Diffusion Model (MAEDiff) for unsupervised anomaly detection in brain images. The MAEDiff involves a hierarchical patch partition. It generates healthy images by overlapping upper-level patches and implements a mechanism based on the masked autoencoders operating on the sub-level patches to enhance the condition on the unnoised regions. Extensive experiments on data of tumors and multiple sclerosis lesions demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. ",

We evaluate the proposed method across various imaging modalities, including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain, pediatric wrist X-ray, and chest X-ray, and demonstrate superior performance in detecting anomalies compared to existing state-of-the-art methods.
