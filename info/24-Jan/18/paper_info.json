In this research, traditional challenges faced by neural style transfer methods in handling binary sketch transformations are effectively addressed through the utilization of parametric shape-editing rules, efficient curve-to-pixel conversion techniques, and the fine-tuning of VGG19 on ImageNet-Sketch, enhancing its role as a feature pyramid network for precise style extraction. By harmonizing intuitive curve-based imagery with rule-based editing, this study holds the potential to significantly enhance design articulation and elevate the practice of style transfer within the realm of product design.

    "abstract": "There exists a correlation between geospatial activity temporal patterns and type of land use. A novel self-supervised approach is proposed to stratify landscape based on mobility activity time series. First, the time series signal is transformed to the frequency domain and then compressed into task-agnostic temporal embeddings by a contractive autoencoder, which preserves cyclic temporal patterns observed in time series. The pixel-wise embeddings are converted to image-like channels that can be used for task-based, multimodal modeling of downstream geospatial tasks using deep semantic segmentation. Experiments show that temporal embeddings are semantically meaningful representations of time series data and are effective across different tasks such as classifying residential area and commercial areas. Temporal embeddings transform sequential, spatiotemporal motion trajectory data into semantically meaningful image-like tensor representations that can be combined (multimodal fusion) with other data modalities that are or can be transformed into image-like tensor representations (for e.g., RBG imagery, graph embeddings of road networks, passively collected imagery like SAR, etc.) to facilitate multimodal learning in geospatial computer vision. Multimodal computer vision is critical for training machine learning models for geospatial feature detection to keep a geospatial mapping service up-to-date in real-time and can significantly improve user experience and above all, user safety.

Previous works have illustrated that inductive bias in the early layers of the encoder in the form of human specified quasi-invariant filters can serve as a powerful inductive bias to attain better robustness and transparency in learned classifiers. This paper explores this further in the context of representation learning with local plasticity rules i.e. bio-inspired Hebbian learning . We propose a modular framework trained with a bio-inspired variant of contrastive predictive coding (Hinge CLAPP Loss). Our framework is composed of parallel encoders each leveraging a different invariant visual descriptor as an inductive bias. We evaluate the representation learning capacity of our system in a classification scenario on image data of various difficulties (GTSRB, STL10, CODEBRIM) as well as video data (UCF101). Our findings indicate that this form of inductive bias can be beneficial in closing the gap between models with local plasticity rules and backpropagation models as well as learning more robust representations in general.

Most existing 3D convolutional neural network (CNN)-based methods for video-level representation learning are clip-based and focus only on short-term motion and appearances. These CNN-based methods lack the capacity to incorporate and model the long-range spatiotemporal representation of the underlying video and ignore the long-range video-level context during training. In this study, we propose a factorized 4D CNN architecture with attention (F4D) that is capable of learning more effective, finer-grained, long-term spatiotemporal video representations. We demonstrate that the proposed F4D architecture yields significant performance improvements over the conventional 2D, and 3D CNN architectures proposed in the literature. Experiment evaluation on five action recognition benchmark datasets, i.e., Something-Something-v1, SomethingSomething-v2, Kinetics-400, UCF101, and HMDB51 demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed F4D network architecture for video-level action recognition.

Social video anomaly detection plays a critical role in applications from e-commerce to e-learning. Traditionally, anomaly detection techniques are applied to find anomalies in video broadcasting. However, they neglect the live social video streams which contain interactive talk, speech, or lecture with audience. In this paper, we propose a generic framework for effectively online detecting Anomalies Over social Video LIve Streaming (AOVLIS). Specifically, we propose a novel deep neural network model called Coupling Long Short-Term Memory (CLSTM) that adaptively captures the history behaviours of the presenters and audience, and their mutual interactions to predict their behaviour at next time point over streams. Then we well integrate the CLSTM with a decoder layer, and propose a new reconstruction error-based scoring function $RE_{IA}$ to calculate the anomaly score of each video segment for anomaly detection. After that, we propose a novel model update scheme that incrementally maintains CLSTM and decoder. Moreover, we design a novel upper bound and ADaptive Optimisation Strategy (ADOS) for improving the efficiency of our solution. Extensive experiments are conducted to prove the superiority of AOVLIS.

Traditional fruit size measurement methods are laborious and time-consuming. This study employs the state-of-the-art YOLOv8 object detection and instance segmentation algorithm in conjunction with geometric shape fitting techniques on 3D point cloud data to accurately determine the size of immature green apples (or fruitlet) in a commercial orchard environment. The methodology utilized two RGB-D sensors: the Intel RealSense D435i and the Microsoft Azure Kinect DK. Notably, the YOLOv8 instance segmentation models exhibited proficiency in immature green apple detection, with the YOLOv8m-seg model clinching the highest AP@0.5 and AP@0.75 scores of 0.94 and 0.91, respectively. Leveraging the ellipsoid fitting technique on images from the Azure Kinect, we observed remarkable metrics, including an RMSE of 2.35, MAE of 1.66, MAPE of 6.15, and an R-squared value of 0.9. Challenges such as partial occlusion, where YOLOv8 sometimes misinterpreted immature green apple clusters, were recognized. In a comparison of 102 outdoor samples, the Microsoft Azure Kinect showed better performance than the Intel Realsense D435i, as supported by the MAE data. This study emphasizes the combined effectiveness of shape-fitting methods and 3D sensors in improving fruitlet sizing for agriculture. ",

Specifically, the typical UAV is required to collect data from multiple distributed IoT nodes under collision avoidance, mission completion deadline, and kinematic constraints in the presence of jamming attacks. We first design a fixed ground jammer with continuous jamming attack and periodical jamming attack strategies to jam the link between the typical UAV and IoT nodes. Defensive strategies involving a reinforcement learning (RL) based virtual jammer and the adoption of higher SINR thresholds are proposed to counteract against such attacks. Secondly, we design an intelligent UAV jammer, which utilizes the RL algorithm to choose actions based on its observation. Then, an intelligent UAV anti-jamming strategy is constructed to deal with such attacks, and the optimal trajectory of the typical UAV is obtained via dueling double deep Q-network (D3QN). Simulation results show that both non-intelligent and intelligent jamming attacks have significant influence on the UAV's performance, and the proposed defense strategies can recover the performance close to that in no-jammer scenarios.

    "abstract": "Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) capture the information processing mechanism of the brain by taking advantage of spiking neurons, such as the Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) model neuron, which incorporates temporal dynamics and transmits information via discrete and asynchronous spikes. However, the simplified biological properties of LIF ignore the neuronal coupling and dendritic structure of real neurons, which limits the spatio-temporal dynamics of neurons and thus reduce the expressive power of the resulting SNNs. In this work, we leverage a more biologically plausible neural model with complex dynamics, i.e., a pulse-coupled neural network (PCNN), to improve the expressiveness and recognition performance of SNNs for vision tasks. The PCNN is a type of cortical model capable of emulating the complex neuronal activities in the primary visual cortex. We construct deep pulse-coupled neural networks (DPCNNs) by replacing commonly used LIF neurons in SNNs with PCNN neurons. The intra-coupling in existing PCNN models limits the coupling between neurons only within channels. To address this limitation, we propose inter-channel coupling, which allows neurons in different feature maps to interact with each other. Experimental results show that inter-channel coupling can efficiently boost performance with fewer neurons, synapses, and less training time compared to widening the networks. For instance, compared to the LIF-based SNN with wide VGG9, DPCNN with VGG9 uses only 50%, 53%, and 73% of neurons, synapses, and training time, respectively. Furthermore, we propose receptive field and time dependent batch normalization (RFTD-BN) to speed up the convergence and performance of DPCNNs. ",

Maneuver generation models play a crucial role in the testing and evaluation of aircraft prototypes, providing insights into the maneuverability and agility of the aircraft. However, constructing the models typically requires extensive amounts of real pilot data, which can be time-consuming and costly to obtain. Moreover, models built with limited data often struggle to generalize beyond the specific flight conditions covered in the original dataset. To address these challenges, we propose a hybrid architecture that leverages a simulation model, referred to as the source model. This open-source agile aircraft simulator shares similar dynamics with the target aircraft and allows us to generate unlimited data for building a proxy maneuver generation model. We then fine-tune this model to the target aircraft using a limited amount of real pilot data. Our approach combines techniques from imitation learning, transfer learning, and reinforcement learning to achieve this objective. To validate our methodology, we utilize real agile pilot data provided by Turkish Aerospace Industries (TAI). By employing the F-16 as the source model, we demonstrate that it is possible to construct a maneuver generation model that generalizes across various trim conditions and aircraft parameters without requiring any additional real pilot data. Our results showcase the effectiveness of our approach in developing robust and adaptable models for agile aircraft. ",

It has been extensively studied with a plethora of methods developed in the literature. This problem is tackled with an OOD score computation, however, previous methods compute the OOD scores with limited usage of the in-distribution dataset. For instance, the OOD scores are computed with information from a small portion of the in-distribution data. Furthermore, these methods encode images with a neural image encoder. The robustness of these methods is rarely checked with respect to image encoders of different training methods and architectures. In this work, we introduce the diffusion process into the OOD task. The diffusion model integrates information on the whole training set into the predicted noise vectors. What's more, we deduce a closed-form solution for the noise vector (stable point). Then the noise vector is converted into our OOD score, we test both the deep model predicted noise vector and the closed-form noise vector on the OOD benchmarks \\cite{openood}. Our method outperforms previous OOD methods across all types of image encoders (Table. \\ref{main}). A $3.5\\%$ performance gain is achieved with the MAE-based image encoder.

    "title": "MA2GCN: Multi Adjacency relationship Attention Graph Convolutional  Networks for Traffic Prediction using Trajectory data",
    "abstract": "The problem of traffic congestion not only causes a large amount of economic losses, but also seriously endangers the urban environment. Predicting traffic congestion has important practical significance. So far, most studies have been based on historical data from sensors placed on different roads to predict future traffic flow and speed, to analyze the traffic congestion conditions of a certain road segment. However, due to the fixed position of sensors, it is difficult to mine new information. On the other hand, vehicle trajectory data is more flexible and can extract traffic information as needed. Therefore, we proposed a new traffic congestion prediction model - Multi Adjacency relationship Attention Graph Convolutional Networks(MA2GCN). This model transformed vehicle trajectory data into graph structured data in grid form, and proposed a vehicle entry and exit matrix based on the mobility between different grids. At the same time, in order to improve the performance of the model, this paper also built a new adaptive adjacency matrix generation method and adjacency matrix attention module. This model mainly used gated temporal convolution and graph convolution to extract temporal and spatial information, respectively. Compared with multiple baselines, our model achieved the best performance on Shanghai taxi GPS trajectory dataset. The code is available at https://github.com/zachysun/Taxi Traffic Benchmark. ",

    "abstract": "Deep neural networks are widely known to be vulnerable to adversarial examples. However, vanilla adversarial examples generated under the white-box setting often exhibit low transferability across different models. Since adversarial transferability poses more severe threats to practical applications, various approaches have been proposed for better transferability, including gradient-based, input transformation-based, and model-related attacks, \\etc. In this work, we find that several tiny changes in the existing adversarial attacks can significantly affect the attack performance, \\eg, the number of iterations and step size. Based on careful studies of existing adversarial attacks, we propose a bag of tricks to enhance adversarial transferability, including momentum initialization, scheduled step size, dual example, spectral-based input transformation, and several ensemble strategies. Extensive experiments on the ImageNet dataset validate the high effectiveness of our proposed tricks and show that combining them can further boost adversarial transferability. Our work provides practical insights and techniques to enhance adversarial transferability, and offers guidance to improve the attack performance on the real-world application through simple adjustments.

    "abstract": "3D Reconstruction of moving articulated objects without additional information about object structure is a challenging problem. Current methods overcome such challenges by employing category-specific skeletal models. Consequently, they do not generalize well to articulated objects in the wild. We treat an articulated object as an unknown, semi-rigid skeletal structure surrounded by nonrigid material (e.g., skin). Our method simultaneously estimates the visible (explicit) representation (3D shapes, colors, camera parameters) and the implicit skeletal representation, from motion cues in the object video without 3D supervision. Our implicit representation consists of four parts. (1) Skeleton, which specifies how semi-rigid parts are connected. (2) \\textcolor{black}{Skinning Weights}, which associates each surface vertex with semi-rigid parts with probability. (3) Rigidity Coefficients, specifying the articulation of the local surface. (4) Time-Varying Transformations, which specify the skeletal motion and surface deformation parameters. We introduce an algorithm that uses physical constraints as regularization terms and iteratively estimates both implicit and explicit representations. Our method is category-agnostic, thus eliminating the need for category-specific skeletons, we show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art across standard video datasets. ",

    "abstract": "Despite the recent advances in large-scale diffusion models, little progress has been made on the layout-to-image (L2I) synthesis task. Current L2I models either suffer from poor editability via text or weak alignment between the generated image and the input layout. This limits their usability in practice. To mitigate this, we propose to integrate adversarial supervision into the conventional training pipeline of L2I diffusion models (ALDM). Specifically, we employ a segmentation-based discriminator which provides explicit feedback to the diffusion generator on the pixel-level alignment between the denoised image and the input layout. To encourage consistent adherence to the input layout over the sampling steps, we further introduce the multistep unrolling strategy. Instead of looking at a single timestep, we unroll a few steps recursively to imitate the inference process, and ask the discriminator to assess the alignment of denoised images with the layout over a certain time window. Our experiments show that ALDM enables layout faithfulness of the generated images, while allowing broad editability via text prompts. Moreover, we showcase its usefulness for practical applications: by synthesizing target distribution samples via text control, we improve domain generalization of semantic segmentation models by a large margin (~12 mIoU points).

Specifically, we use data from Spotify to investigate how a link sent from one user to another results in the receiver engaging with the music of the shared artist. We consider several factors that may influence this process, such as the strength of the sender-receiver relationship, the user's role in the Spotify social network, their music social cohesion, and how similar the new artist is to the receiver's taste. We find that the receiver of a link is more likely to engage with a new artist when (1) they have similar music taste to the sender and the shared track is a good fit for their taste, (2) they have a stronger and more intimate tie with the sender, and (3) the shared artist is popular with the receiver's connections. Finally, we use these findings to build a Random Forest classifier to predict whether a shared music track will result in the receiver's engagement with the shared artist. This model elucidates which type of social and contextual features are most predictive, although peak performance is achieved when a diverse set of features are included. These findings provide new insights into the multifaceted mechanisms underpinning the interplay between music discovery and social processes. ",

More recently, counterfactuals have begun to emerge as a technique being applied within visualization research.

In this paper, we primarily focus on assessing the quality of users' understanding of data when provided with counterfactual visualizations. We propose a preliminary model of causality comprehension by connecting theories from causal inference and visual data communication. Leveraging this model, we conducted an empirical study to explore how counterfactuals can improve users' understanding of data in static visualizations. Our results indicate that visualizing counterfactuals had a positive impact on participants' interpretations of causal relations within datasets.

    "abstract": "High-quality annotation of fine-grained visual categories demands great expert knowledge, which is taxing and time consuming. Alternatively, learning fine-grained visual representation from enormous unlabeled images (e.g., species, brands) by self-supervised learning becomes a feasible solution. However, recent researches find that existing self-supervised learning methods are less qualified to represent fine-grained categories. The bottleneck lies in that the pre-text representation is built from every patch-wise embedding, while fine-grained categories are only determined by several key patches of an image. In this paper, we propose a Cross-level Multi-instance Distillation (CMD) framework to tackle the challenge. Our key idea is to consider the importance of each image patch in determining the fine-grained pre-text representation by multiple instance learning. To comprehensively learn the relation between informative patches and fine-grained semantics, the multi-instance knowledge distillation is implemented on both the region/image crop pairs from the teacher and student net, and the region-image crops inside the teacher / student net, which we term as intra-level multi-instance distillation and inter-level multi-instance distillation. Extensive experiments on CUB-200-2011, Stanford Cars and FGVC Aircraft show that the proposed method outperforms the contemporary method by upto 10.14% and existing state-of-the-art self-supervised learning approaches by upto 19.78% on both top-1 accuracy and Rank-1 retrieval metric.

Ensuring effective coordination of x-applications (xAPPs) is crucial to enhance flexibility and optimize network performance within the O-RAN.

Our proposed method focuses on maximizing the weighted throughput among user equipments (UE), as well as allocating physical resource blocks (PRBs). We prioritize two service types, namely enhanced Mobile Broadband and Ultra Reliable Low Latency Communication. To achieve this, we have designed two xAPPs: a power control xAPP for each UE and a PRB allocation xAPP. The proposed method consists of a two-part training phase, where the first part uses supervised learning with a Variational Autoencoder trained to regress the power transmission as well as the user association and PRB allocation decisions, and the second part uses unsupervised learning with a contrastive loss approach to improve the generalization and robustness of the model. We evaluate the performance of our proposed method by comparing its results to those obtained from an exhaustive search algorithm, deep Q-network algorithm, and by reporting performance metrics for the regression task. We also evaluate the proposed model's performance in different scenarios among the service types.

    "abstract": "Multi-touch attribution (MTA) currently plays a pivotal role in achieving a fair estimation of the contributions of each advertising touchpoint to-wards conversion behavior, deeply influencing budget allocation and advertising recommenda-tion. Traditional multi-touch attribution methods initially build a conversion prediction model, an-ticipating learning the inherent relationship be-tween touchpoint sequences and user purchasing behavior through historical data. Based on this, counterfactual touchpoint sequences are con-structed from the original sequence subset, and conversions are estimated using the prediction model, thus calculating advertising contributions. A covert assumption of these methods is the un-biased nature of conversion prediction models. However, due to confounding variables factors arising from user preferences and internet recom-mendation mechanisms such as homogenization of ad recommendations resulting from past shop-ping records, bias can easily occur in conversion prediction models trained on observational data. This paper redefines the causal effect of user fea-tures on conversions and proposes a novel end-to-end approach, Deep Causal Representation for MTA (DCRMTA). Our model while eliminating confounding variables, extracts features with causal relations to conversions from users.

Herein, we employ neural operators to solve Riemann problems encountered in compressible flows for extreme pressure jumps (up to $10^{10}$ pressure ratio). In particular, we first consider the DeepONet that we train in a two-stage process, following the recent work of Lee and Shin, wherein the first stage, a basis is extracted from the trunk net, which is orthonormalized and subsequently is used in the second stage in training the branch net. This simple modification of DeepONet has a profound effect on its accuracy, efficiency, and robustness and leads to very accurate solutions to Riemann problems compared to the vanilla version. It also enables us to interpret the results physically as the hierarchical data-driven produced basis reflects all the flow features that would otherwise be introduced using ad hoc feature expansion layers. We also compare the results with another neural operator based on the U-Net for low, intermediate, and very high-pressure ratios that are very accurate for Riemann problems, especially for large pressure ratios, due to their multiscale nature but computationally more expensive. Overall, our study demonstrates that simple neural network architectures, if properly pre-trained, can achieve very accurate solutions of Riemann problems for real-time forecasting. ",

Typically embeddings are evaluated on the basis of the performance they provide in a wide range of downstream tasks, however few studies have investigated the local properties of the embedding spaces themselves which are important in nearest neighbor algorithms, commonly used in music search and recommendation. In this work we show that when learning audio representations on music datasets via contrastive learning, musical properties that are typically homogeneous within a track (e.g., key and tempo) are reflected in the locality of neighborhoods in the resulting embedding space. By applying appropriate data augmentation strategies, localisation of such properties can not only be reduced but the localisation of other attributes is increased. For example, locality of features such as pitch and tempo that are less relevant to non-expert listeners, may be mitigated while improving the locality of more salient features such as genre and mood, achieving state-of-the-art performance in nearest neighbor retrieval accuracy. Similarly, we show that the optimal selection of data augmentation strategies for contrastive learning of music audio embeddings is dependent on the downstream task, highlighting this as an important embedding design decision.

Given that annotating tempo is time-consuming and requires certain musical expertise, few publicly available data sources exist to train machine learning models for this task. Towards alleviating this issue, we propose a fully self-supervised approach that does not rely on any human labeled data. Our method builds on the fact that generic (music) audio embeddings already encode a variety of properties, including information about tempo, making them easily adaptable for downstream tasks. While recent work in self-supervised tempo estimation aimed to learn a tempo specific representation that was subsequently used to train a supervised classifier, we reformulate the task into the binary classification problem of predicting whether a target track has the same or a different tempo compared to a reference. While the former still requires labeled training data for the final classification model, our approach uses arbitrary unlabeled music data in combination with time-stretching for model training as well as a small set of synthetically created reference samples for predicting the final tempo. Evaluation of our approach in comparison with the state-of-the-art reveals highly competitive performance when the constraint of finding the precise tempo octave is relaxed. ",

Due to the subjectivity of audio similarity, it can be desirable to design systems that answer not only whether audio is similar, but similar in what way (e.g., wrt. tempo, mood or genre). Previous works have proposed disentangled embedding spaces where subspaces representing specific, yet possibly correlated, attributes can be weighted to emphasize those attributes in downstream tasks. However, no research has been conducted into the independence of these subspaces, nor their manipulation, in order to retrieve tracks that are similar but different in a specific way. Here, we explore the manipulation of tempo in embedding spaces as a case-study towards this goal. We propose tempo translation functions that allow for efficient manipulation of tempo within a pre-existing embedding space whilst maintaining other properties such as genre. As this translation is specific to tempo it enables retrieval of tracks that are similar but have specifically different tempi. We show that such a function can be used as an efficient data augmentation strategy for both training of downstream tempo predictors, and improved nearest neighbor retrieval of properties largely independent of tempo.

    "abstract": "Adversarial Attacks on Face Recognition (FR) encompass two types: impersonation attacks and evasion attacks. We observe that achieving a successful impersonation attack on FR does not necessarily ensure a successful dodging attack on FR in the black-box setting. Introducing a novel attack method named Pre-training Pruning Restoration Attack (PPR), we aim to enhance the performance of dodging attacks whilst avoiding the degradation of impersonation attacks. Our method employs adversarial example pruning, enabling a portion of adversarial perturbations to be set to zero, while tending to maintain the attack performance. By utilizing adversarial example pruning, we can prune the pre-trained adversarial examples and selectively free up certain adversarial perturbations. Thereafter, we embed adversarial perturbations in the pruned area, which enhances the dodging performance of the adversarial face examples.

    "abstract": "An important development direction in the Single-Image Super-Resolution (SISR) algorithms is to improve the efficiency of the algorithms. Recently, efficient Super-Resolution (SR) research focuses on reducing model complexity and improving efficiency through improved deep small kernel convolution, leading to a small receptive field. The large receptive field obtained by large kernel convolution can significantly improve image quality, but the computational cost is too high. To improve the reconstruction details of efficient super-resolution reconstruction, we propose a Symmetric Visual Attention Network (SVAN) by applying large receptive fields. The SVAN decomposes a large kernel convolution into three different combinations of convolution operations and combines them with an attention mechanism to form a Symmetric Large Kernel Attention Block (SLKAB), which forms a symmetric attention block with a bottleneck structure by the size of the receptive field in the convolution combination to extract depth features effectively as the basic component of the SVAN. Our network gets a large receptive field while minimizing the number of parameters and improving the perceptual ability of the model. The experimental results show that the proposed SVAN can obtain high-quality super-resolution reconstruction results using only about 30% of the parameters of existing SOTA methods. ",

    "abstract": "Physical side-channel attacks can compromise the security of integrated circuits. Most of the physical side-channel attacks (e.g., power or electromagnetic) exploit the dynamic behavior of a chip, typically manifesting as changes in current consumption or voltage fluctuations where algorithmic countermeasures, such as masking, can effectively mitigate the attacks. However, as demonstrated recently, these mitigation techniques are not entirely effective against backscattered side-channel attacks such as impedance analysis. In the case of an impedance attack, an adversary exploits the data-dependent impedance variations of chip power delivery network (PDN) to extract secret information. In this work, we introduce RandOhm, which exploits moving target defense (MTD) strategy based on partial reconfiguration of mainstream FPGAs, to defend against impedance side-channel attacks. We demonstrate that the information leakage through the PDN impedance could be reduced via run-time reconfiguration of the secret-sensitive parts of the circuitry. Hence, by constantly randomizing the placement and routing of the circuit, one can decorrelate the data-dependent computation from the impedance value. To validate our claims, we present a systematic approach equipped with two different partial reconfiguration strategies on implementations of the AES cipher realized on 28-nm FPGAs. We investigate the overhead of our mitigation in terms of delay and performance and provide security analysis by performing non-profiled and profiled impedance analysis attacks against these implementations to demonstrate the resiliency of our approach.

    "abstract": "Continual learning, the ability of a model to learn over time without forgetting previous knowledge and, therefore, be adaptive to new data, is paramount in dynamic fields such as disease outbreak prediction. Deep neural networks, i.e., LSTM, are prone to error due to catastrophic forgetting. This study introduces a novel CEL model for continual learning by leveraging domain adaptation via Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC). This model aims to mitigate the catastrophic forgetting phenomenon in a domain incremental setting. The Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) is constructed with EWC to develop a regularization term that penalizes changes to important parameters, namely, the important previous knowledge. CEL's performance is evaluated on three distinct diseases, Influenza, Mpox, and Measles, with different metrics. The high R-squared values during evaluation and reevaluation outperform the other state-of-the-art models in several contexts, indicating that CEL adapts to incremental data well. CEL's robustness and reliability are underscored by its minimal 65% forgetting rate and 18% higher memory stability compared to existing benchmark studies. This study highlights CEL's versatility in disease outbreak prediction, addressing evolving data with temporal patterns. It offers a valuable model for proactive disease control with accurate, timely predictions. ",

    "abstract": "The escalating reliance on revolutionary online web services has introduced heightened security risks, with persistent challenges posed by phishing despite extensive security measures. Traditional phishing systems, reliant on machine learning and manual features, struggle with evolving tactics. Recent advances in deep learning offer promising avenues for tackling novel phishing challenges and malicious URLs. This paper introduces a two-phase stack generalized model named AntiPhishStack, designed to detect phishing sites. The model leverages the learning of URLs and character-level TF-IDF features symmetrically, enhancing its ability to combat emerging phishing threats. In Phase I, features are trained on a base machine learning classifier, employing K-fold cross-validation for robust mean prediction. Phase II employs a two-layered stacked-based LSTM network with five adaptive optimizers for dynamic compilation, ensuring premier prediction on these features. Additionally, the symmetrical predictions from both phases are optimized and integrated to train a meta-XGBoost classifier, contributing to a final robust prediction. The significance of this work lies in advancing phishing detection with AntiPhishStack, operating without prior phishing-specific feature knowledge. Experimental validation on two benchmark datasets, comprising benign and phishing or malicious URLs, demonstrates the model's exceptional performance, achieving a notable 96.04% accuracy compared to existing studies. This research adds value to the ongoing discourse on symmetry and asymmetry in information security and provides a forward-thinking solution for enhancing network security in the face of evolving cyber threats.

    "abstract": "Trajectory optimization is a widely used technique in robot motion planning for letting the dynamics and constraints on the system shape and synthesize complex behaviors. Several previous works have shown its benefits in high-dimensional continuous state spaces and under differential constraints. However, long time horizons and planning around obstacles in non-convex spaces pose challenges in guaranteeing convergence or finding optimal solutions. As a result, discrete graph search planners and sampling-based planers are preferred when facing obstacle-cluttered environments. A recently developed algorithm called INSAT effectively combines graph search in the low-dimensional subspace and trajectory optimization in the full-dimensional space for global kinodynamic planning over long horizons. Although INSAT successfully reasoned about and solved complex planning problems, the numerous expensive calls to an optimizer resulted in large planning times, thereby limiting its practical use. Inspired by the recent work on edge-based parallel graph search, we present PINSAT, which introduces systematic parallelization in INSAT to achieve lower planning times and higher success rates, while maintaining significantly lower costs over relevant baselines. We demonstrate PINSAT by evaluating it on 6 DoF kinodynamic manipulation planning with obstacles. ",

In this work, we build on this idea and introduce the problem of detecting hearing loss from an individual's facial expressions during a conversation. Building machine learning models that can represent hearing-related facial expression changes is a challenge. In addition, models need to disentangle spurious age-related correlations from hearing-driven expressions. To this end, we propose a self-supervised pre-training strategy tailored for the modeling of expression variations. We also use adversarial representation learning to mitigate the age bias. We evaluate our approach on a large-scale egocentric dataset with real-world conversational scenarios involving subjects with hearing loss and show that our method for hearing loss detection achieves superior performance over baselines.

Addressing the issue of low accuracy existing in the current radio map construction, this paper presents a novel radio map construction method based on generative adversarial network (GAN) in which the Aggregated Contextual-Transformation (AOT) block, Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM), and Transposed Convolution (T-Conv) block are applied to the generator, and we name it as ACT-GAN. It significantly improves the reconstruction accuracy and local texture of the radio maps. The performance of ACT-GAN across three different scenarios is demonstrated. Experiment results reveal that in the scenario without sparse discrete observations, the proposed method reduces the root mean square error (RMSE) by 14.6% in comparison to the state-of-the-art models. In the scenario with sparse discrete observations, the RMSE is diminished by 13.2%. Furthermore, the predictive results of the proposed model show a more lucid representation of electromagnetic spatial field distribution. To verify the universality of this model in radio map construction tasks, the scenario of unknown radio emission source is investigated. The results indicate that the proposed model is robust radio map construction and accurate in predicting the location of the emission source. ",

To address this challenge, we introduce an innovative end-to-end poisoning framework P-GAN. Specifically, the malicious participant initially employs semi-supervised learning to train a surrogate target model. Subsequently, this participant employs a GAN-based method to produce adversarial perturbations to degrade the surrogate target model's performance. Finally, the generator is obtained and tailored for VFL poisoning. Besides, we develop an anomaly detection algorithm based on a deep auto-encoder (DAE), offering a robust defense mechanism to VFL scenarios.

By its design, ElliDock is independently equivariant with respect to arbitrary rotations/translations of the proteins, which is an indispensable property to ensure the generalization of the docking process. Experimental evaluations show that ElliDock achieves the fastest inference time among all compared methods and is strongly competitive with current state-of-the-art learning-based models such as DiffDock-PP and Multimer particularly for antibody-antigen docking.

One of the major problems is that most existing FAS datasets are relatively small and lack data diversity.

In this paper, we conduct an Anomalous cue Guided FAS (AG-FAS) method, which leverages real faces for improving model generalization via a De-spoofing Face Generator (DFG). Specifically, the DFG trained only on the real faces gains the knowledge of what a real face should be like and can generate a \"real\" version of the face corresponding to any given input face. The difference between the generated \"real\" face and the input face can provide an anomalous cue for the downstream FAS task. We then propose an Anomalous cue Guided FAS feature extraction Network (AG-Net) to further improve the FAS feature generalization via a cross-attention transformer. Extensive experiments on a total of nine public datasets show our method achieves state-of-the-art results under cross-domain evaluations with unseen scenarios and unknown presentation attacks. ",

In this paper, we conduct a thorough empirical study of the ResNet architecture in classification tasks by linearizing its constituent residual blocks using Residual Jacobians and measuring their singular value decompositions. Our measurements reveal a process called Residual Alignment (RA) characterized by four properties: (RA1) intermediate representations of a given input are equispaced on a line, embedded in high dimensional space, as observed by Gai and Zhang [2021]; (RA2) top left and right singular vectors of Residual Jacobians align with each other and across different depths; (RA3) Residual Jacobians are at most rank C for fully-connected ResNets, where C is the number of classes; and (RA4) top singular values of Residual Jacobians scale inversely with depth. RA consistently occurs in models that generalize well, in both fully-connected and convolutional architectures, across various depths and widths, for varying numbers of classes, on all tested benchmark datasets, but ceases to occur once the skip connections are removed. It also provably occurs in a novel mathematical model we propose. This phenomenon reveals a strong alignment between residual branches of a ResNet (RA2+4), imparting a highly rigid geometric structure to the intermediate representations as they progress linearly through the network (RA1) up to the final layer, where they undergo Neural Collapse.

We compare $10$ different neural network architectures that process point cloud sequences including a novel augmentation strategy introducing a temporal offset between frames of a sequence during training and evaluate the effectiveness of all strategies on lidar point clouds under adverse weather conditions through experiments. Our research provides a comprehensive study of effective methods for mitigating the effects of adverse weather on the reliability of lidar-based object detection using sequential data that are evaluated using public datasets such as nuScenes, Dense, and the Canadian Adverse Driving Conditions Dataset. Our findings demonstrate that our novel method, involving temporal offset augmentation through randomized frame skipping in sequences, enhances object detection accuracy compared to both the baseline model (Pillar-based Object Detection) and no augmentation.

Traditional supervised learning methods encounter limitations due to data scarcity and challenges in label acquisition. To address these issues, we propose a self-supervised learning method that leverages the cross-modal relationship between point cloud videos and image videos to acquire meaningful feature representations. Intra-modal and cross-modal contrastive learning techniques are employed to facilitate effective comprehension of point cloud video. We also propose a multi-level contrastive approach for both modalities. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our method significantly surpasses previous state-of-the-art approaches, and we conduct comprehensive ablation studies to validate the effectiveness of our proposed designs.

To fully exploit the benefits offered by caching, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and device-to-device (D2D) communication can be further utilized. In contrast to prior works, that strictly limits the content delivery routes up to two hops, we explore a multi-hop communications scenario, where the UAVs, the UEs, or both can relay the content to individual users. In this context, we formulate the problem for joint route selection and power allocation to minimize the overall system content delivery duration. First, motivated by the limitations of existing works, we consider the case where the nodes may transmit content simultaneously rather than sequentially and propose simple yet effective approach to allocate the transmission power. Second, we design a low-complexity greedy algorithm jointly handling route selection and power allocation. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed greedy algorithm outperforms the benchmark algorithm by up to 56.98% in terms of content delivery duration while it achieves close-to-optimal performance.

Various continual learning (CL) methods often rely on exemplar buffers or/and network expansion for balancing model stability and plasticity, which, however, compromises their practical value due to privacy and memory concerns. Instead, this paper considers a strict yet realistic setting, where the training data from previous tasks is unavailable and the model size remains relatively constant during sequential training. To achieve such desiderata, we propose a conceptually simple yet effective method that attributes forgetting to layer-wise parameter overwriting and the resulting decision boundary distortion. This is achieved by the synergy between two key components: HSIC-Bottleneck Orthogonalization (HBO) implements non-overwritten parameter updates mediated by Hilbert-Schmidt independence criterion in an orthogonal space and EquiAngular Embedding (EAE) enhances decision boundary adaptation between old and new tasks with predefined basis vectors. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves competitive accuracy performance, even with absolute superiority of zero exemplar buffer and 1.02x the base model. ",

It is widely used in recommendation, decision-making, question-answering, search, and other fields. However, previous studies mainly used low-level knowledge in the KG for reasoning, which may result in insufficient generalization and poor robustness of reasoning. To this end, this paper proposes a new inference approach using a novel knowledge augmentation strategy to improve the generalization capability of KG. This framework extracts high-level pyramidal knowledge from low-level knowledge and applies it to reasoning in a multi-level hierarchical KG, called knowledge pyramid in this paper. We tested some medical data sets using the proposed approach, and the experimental results show that the proposed knowledge pyramid has improved the knowledge inference performance with better generalization.

    "abstract": "Whilst spectral Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are theoretically well-founded in the spectral domain, their practical reliance on polynomial approximation implies a profound linkage to the spatial domain. As previous studies rarely examine spectral GNNs from the spatial perspective, their spatial-domain interpretability remains elusive, e.g., what information is essentially encoded by spectral GNNs in the spatial domain? In this paper, to answer this question, we establish a theoretical connection between spectral filtering and spatial aggregation, unveiling an intrinsic interaction that spectral filtering implicitly leads the original graph to an adapted new graph, explicitly computed for spatial aggregation. Both theoretical and empirical investigations reveal that the adapted new graph not only exhibits non-locality but also accommodates signed edge weights to reflect label consistency between nodes. These findings thus highlight the interpretable role of spectral GNNs in the spatial domain and inspire us to rethink graph spectral filters beyond the fixed-order polynomials, which neglect global information. Built upon the theoretical findings, we revisit the state-of-the-art spectral GNNs and propose a novel Spatially Adaptive Filtering (SAF) framework, which leverages the adapted new graph by spectral filtering for an auxiliary non-local aggregation. Notably, our proposed SAF comprehensively models both node similarity and dissimilarity from a global perspective, therefore alleviating persistent deficiencies of GNNs related to long-range dependencies and graph heterophily. Extensive experiments over 13 node classification benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our proposed framework to the state-of-the-art models. ",

We also go beyond straight line program simulation with sorting algorithms and nested loops, and we show the computational complexity of a routine directly affects the ability of an LLM to simulate its execution. We observe that LLMs execute instructions sequentially and with a low error margin only for short programs or standard procedures. LLMs' code simulation is in tension with their pattern recognition and memorisation capabilities: on tasks where memorisation is detrimental, we propose a novel prompting method to simulate code execution line by line.

These are largely interpreted in terms of the 'HHH' criteria: making outputs more helpful and honest, and avoiding harmful (biased, toxic, or inaccurate) statements. Whilst this semantic focus is useful from the perspective of viewing LLM agents as mere mediums for information, it fails to account for pragmatic factors that can make the same utterance seem more or less offensive or tactless in different social situations. We propose an approach to ethics that is more centred on relational and situational factors, exploring what it means for a system, as a social actor, to treat an individual respectfully in a (series of) interaction(s). Our work anticipates a set of largely unexplored risks at the level of situated interaction, and offers practical suggestions to help LLM technologies behave as 'good' social actors and treat people respectfully.

    "abstract": "Traditional Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) architectures, such as LSTM and GRU, have historically held prominence in time series tasks. However, they have recently seen a decline in their dominant position across various time series tasks. As a result, recent advancements in time series forecasting have seen a notable shift away from RNNs towards alternative architectures such as Transformers, MLPs, and CNNs. To go beyond the limitations of traditional RNNs, we design an efficient RNN-based model for time series tasks, named RWKV-TS, with three distinctive features: (i) A novel RNN architecture characterized by $O(L)$ time complexity and memory usage. (ii) An enhanced ability to capture long-term sequence information compared to traditional RNNs. (iii) High computational efficiency coupled with the capacity to scale up effectively. Through extensive experimentation, our proposed RWKV-TS model demonstrates competitive performance when compared to state-of-the-art Transformer-based or CNN-based models. Notably, RWKV-TS exhibits not only comparable performance but also demonstrates reduced latency and memory utilization. The success of RWKV-TS encourages further exploration and innovation in leveraging RNN-based approaches within the domain of Time Series. The combination of competitive performance, low latency, and efficient memory usage positions RWKV-TS as a promising avenue for future research in time series tasks.

    "abstract": "Accurate and robust localization and mapping are essential components for most autonomous robots. In this paper, we propose a SLAM system for building globally consistent maps, called PIN-SLAM, that is based on an elastic and compact point-based implicit neural map representation. Taking range measurements as input, our approach alternates between incremental learning of the local implicit signed distance field and the pose estimation given the current local map using a correspondence-free, point-to-implicit model registration. Our implicit map is based on sparse optimizable neural points, which are inherently elastic and deformable with the global pose adjustment when closing a loop. Loops are also detected using the neural point features. Extensive experiments validate that PIN-SLAM is robust to various environments and versatile to different range sensors such as LiDAR and RGB-D cameras. PIN-SLAM achieves pose estimation accuracy better or on par with the state-of-the-art LiDAR odometry or SLAM systems and outperforms the recent neural implicit SLAM approaches while maintaining a more consistent, and highly compact implicit map that can be reconstructed as accurate and complete meshes. Finally, thanks to the voxel hashing for efficient neural points indexing and the fast implicit map-based registration without closest point association, PIN-SLAM can run at the sensor frame rate on a moderate GPU.

SendingNetwork addresses this need by creating a reliable and secure decentralized communication network, targeting essential challenges like privacy protection, scalability, efficiency, and composability. Central to our approach is the incorporation of edge computing to form an adaptive relay network with the modular libp2p library. We introduce a dynamic group chat encryption mechanism based on the Double Ratchet algorithm for secure communication and propose a Delegation scheme for efficient message processing in large group chats, enhancing both resilience and scalability. Our theoretical analyses affirm the Delegation scheme's superior performance. To bolster system stability and encourage node participation, we integrate two innovative consensus mechanisms: \"Proof of Relay\" for validating message relay workload based on the novel KZG commitment, and \"Proof of Availability\" for ensuring network consistency and managing incentives through Verkle trees. Our whitepaper details the network's key components and architecture, concluding with a roadmap and a preview of future enhancements to SendingNetwork. ",

    "abstract": "Graphs with heterophily have been regarded as challenging scenarios for Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), where nodes are connected with dissimilar neighbors through various patterns. In this paper, we present theoretical understandings of the impacts of different heterophily patterns for GNNs by incorporating the graph convolution (GC) operations into fully connected networks via the proposed Heterophilous Stochastic Block Models (HSBM), a general random graph model that can accommodate diverse heterophily patterns. Firstly, we show that by applying a GC operation, the separability gains are determined by two factors, i.e., the Euclidean distance of the neighborhood distributions and $\\sqrt{\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\operatorname{deg}\\right]}$, where $\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\operatorname{deg}\\right]$ is the averaged node degree. It reveals that the impact of heterophily on classification needs to be evaluated alongside the averaged node degree. Secondly, we show that the topological noise has a detrimental impact on separability, which is equivalent to degrading $\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\operatorname{deg}\\right]$. Finally, when applying multiple GC operations, we show that the separability gains are determined by the normalized distance of the $l$-powered neighborhood distributions. It indicates that the nodes still possess separability as $l$ goes to infinity in a wide range of regimes. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world data verify the effectiveness of our theory. ",

A popular paradigm to enforce robustness is adversarial training (AT), however, this introduces many computational and theoretical difficulties. Recent works have developed a connection between AT in the multiclass classification setting and multimarginal optimal transport (MOT), unlocking a new set of tools to study this problem. In this paper, we leverage the MOT connection to propose computationally tractable numerical algorithms for computing universal lower bounds on the optimal adversarial risk and identifying optimal classifiers. We propose two main algorithms based on linear programming (LP) and entropic regularization (Sinkhorn). Our key insight is that one can harmlessly truncate the higher order interactions between classes, preventing the combinatorial run times typically encountered in MOT problems. We validate these results with experiments on MNIST and CIFAR-$10$, which demonstrate the tractability of our approach. ",

    "abstract": "Only the chairs can edit In the fight against cyber attacks, Network Softwarization (NS) is a flexible and adaptable shield, using advanced software to spot malicious activity in regular network traffic. However, the availability of comprehensive datasets for mobile networks, which are fundamental for the development of Machine Learning (ML) solutions for attack detection near their source, is still limited. Cross-Domain Artificial Intelligence (AI) can be the key to address this, although its application in Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) is still at its infancy. To address these challenges, we deployed an end-to-end O-RAN network, that was used to collect data from the RAN and the transport network. These datasets allow us to combine the knowledge from an in-network ML traffic classifier for attack detection to bolster the training of an ML-based traffic classifier specifically tailored for the RAN. Our results demonstrate the potential of the proposed approach, achieving an accuracy rate of 93%. This approach not only bridges critical gaps in mobile network security but also showcases the potential of cross-domain AI in enhancing the efficacy of network security measures. ",

    "abstract": "Adversaries have been targeting unique identifiers to launch typo-squatting, mobile app squatting and even voice squatting attacks. Anecdotal evidence suggest that online social networks (OSNs) are also plagued with accounts that use similar usernames. This can be confusing to users but can also be exploited by adversaries. However, to date no study characterizes this problem on OSNs. In this work, we define the username squatting problem and design the first multi-faceted measurement study to characterize it on X. We develop a username generation tool (UsernameCrazy) to help us analyze hundreds of thousands of username variants derived from celebrity accounts. Our study reveals that thousands of squatted usernames have been suspended by X, while tens of thousands that still exist on the network are likely bots. Out of these, a large number share similar profile pictures and profile names to the original account signalling impersonation attempts. We found that squatted accounts are being mentioned by mistake in tweets hundreds of thousands of times and are even being prioritized in searches by the network's search recommendation algorithm exacerbating the negative impact squatted accounts can have in OSNs. We use our insights and take the first step to address this issue by designing a framework (SQUAD) that combines UsernameCrazy with a new classifier to efficiently detect suspicious squatted accounts. Our evaluation of SQUAD's prototype implementation shows that it can achieve 94% F1-score when trained on a small dataset. ",

In contrast to this, Laplacian dynamics (LD) is an approach to consider the information flow across a network as a dynamical process. We adapt and apply LD to the context of LONs. As a testbed, we consider instances from the quadratic assignment problem (QAP) library. Metrics related to LD are proposed and these are compared with existing LON metrics.

There is a consensus that an efficient and scalable provisioning of network resources is crucial for the success of the NGN, mainly in what concerns access networks. Previous solutions for the control of multi-user sessions rely mostly on uncoordinated actions to allocate per-flow bandwidth and multicast trees. This paper introduces a Multiuser Aggregated Resource Allocation mechanism (MARA) that coordinates the control of class-based bandwidth and multicast resources in a scalable manner. In comparison with previous work, MARA significantly reduces signaling, state and processing overhead. The performance benefits of MARA are analyzed though simulations, which successfully demonstrated the significant optimization in the network performance. ",

Previous methodologies have treated CTBD as either a visual relation extraction challenge within computer vision or as a sequence modeling problem from the perspective of natural language processing. We introduce a new framework that frames CTBD as a graph generation problem. This methodology consists of two essential procedures: identifying individual text units as graph nodes and discerning the sequential reading order relationships among these units as graph edges. Leveraging the cutting-edge capabilities of DQ-DETR for node detection, our framework innovates further by integrating a novel mechanism, a Dynamic Relation Transformer (DRFormer), dedicated to edge generation. DRFormer incorporates a dual interactive transformer decoder that deftly manages a dynamic graph structure refinement process. Through this iterative process, the model systematically enhances the graph's fidelity, ultimately resulting in improved precision in detecting contextual text blocks. Comprehensive experimental evaluations conducted on both SCUT-CTW-Context and ReCTS-Context datasets substantiate that our method achieves state-of-the-art results, underscoring the effectiveness and potential of our graph generation framework in advancing the field of CTBD.

But for some specific symmetries, representations, and choice of coordinates, the most common point-wise activations, such as ReLU, are not equivariant, hence they cannot be employed in the design of equivariant neural networks. The theorem we present in this paper describes all possible combinations of finite-dimensional representations, choice of coordinates and point-wise activations to obtain an exactly equivariant layer, generalizing and strengthening existing characterizations. Notable cases of practical relevance are discussed as corollaries. Indeed, we prove that rotation-equivariant networks can only be invariant, as it happens for any network which is equivariant with respect to connected compact groups. Then, we discuss implications of our findings when applied to important instances of exactly equivariant networks. First, we completely characterize permutation equivariant networks such as Invariant Graph Networks with point-wise nonlinearities and their geometric counterparts, highlighting a plethora of models whose expressive power and performance are still unknown. Second, we show that feature spaces of disentangled steerable convolutional neural networks are trivial representations. ",

    "abstract": "Visuomotor policies, which learn control mechanisms directly from high-dimensional visual observations, confront challenges in adapting to new environments with intricate visual variations. Data augmentation emerges as a promising method for bridging these generalization gaps by enriching data variety. However, straightforwardly augmenting the entire observation shall impose excessive burdens on policy learning and may even result in performance degradation. In this paper, we propose to improve the generalization ability of visuomotor policies as well as preserve training stability from two aspects: 1) We learn a control-aware mask through a self-supervised reconstruction task with three auxiliary losses and then apply strong augmentation only to those control-irrelevant regions based on the mask to reduce the generalization gaps. 2) To address training instability issues prevalent in visual reinforcement learning (RL), we distill the knowledge from a pretrained RL expert processing low-level environment states, to the student visuomotor policy. The policy is subsequently deployed to unseen environments without any further finetuning. We conducted comparison and ablation studies across various benchmarks: the DMControl Generalization Benchmark (DMC-GB), the enhanced Robot Manipulation Distraction Benchmark (RMDB), and a specialized long-horizontal drawer-opening robotic task. The extensive experimental results well demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, e.g., showing a 17\\% improvement over previous methods in the video-hard setting of DMC-GB. ",

    "abstract": "Wireless Federated Learning (FL) is an emerging distributed machine learning paradigm, particularly gaining momentum in domains with confidential and private data on mobile clients. However, the location-dependent performance, in terms of transmission rates and susceptibility to transmission errors, poses major challenges for wireless FL's convergence speed and accuracy. The challenge is more acute for hostile environments without a metric that authenticates the data quality and security profile of the clients. In this context, this paper proposes a novel risk-aware accelerated FL framework that accounts for the clients heterogeneity in the amount of possessed data, transmission rates, transmission errors, and trustworthiness. Classifying clients according to their location-dependent performance and trustworthiness profiles, we propose a dynamic risk-aware global model aggregation scheme that allows clients to participate in descending order of their transmission rates and an ascending trustworthiness constraint. In particular, the transmission rate is the dominant participation criterion for initial rounds to accelerate the convergence speed. Our model then progressively relaxes the transmission rate restriction to explore more training data at cell-edge clients. The aggregation rounds incorporate a debiasing factor that accounts for transmission errors. Risk-awareness is enabled by a validation set, where the base station eliminates non-trustworthy clients at the fine-tuning stage. The proposed scheme is benchmarked against a conservative scheme (i.e., only allowing trustworthy devices) and an aggressive scheme (i.e., oblivious to the trust metric). The numerical results highlight the superiority of the proposed scheme in terms of accuracy and convergence speed when compared to both benchmarks. ",

Recently, neural operators have emerged as a promising technique to solve elliptic PDEs more efficiently by directly mapping the input to solutions. However, existing networks typically cannot handle complex geometries and inhomogeneous boundary values present in the real world. Here we introduce Boundary-Embedded Neural Operators (BENO), a novel neural operator architecture that embeds the complex geometries and inhomogeneous boundary values into the solving of elliptic PDEs. Inspired by classical Green's function, BENO consists of two branches of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for interior source term and boundary values, respectively. Furthermore, a Transformer encoder maps the global boundary geometry into a latent vector which influences each message passing layer of the GNNs. We test our model extensively in elliptic PDEs with various boundary conditions. We show that all existing baseline methods fail to learn the solution operator. In contrast, our model, endowed with boundary-embedded architecture, outperforms state-of-the-art neural operators and strong baselines by an average of 60.96\\%.

In recent years, CD tasks have mostly used architectures such as CNN and Transformer to identify these changes. However, these architectures have shortcomings in representing boundary details and are prone to false alarms and missed detections under complex lighting and weather conditions. For that, we propose a new network, Siamese Meets Diffusion Network (SMDNet). This network combines the Siam-U2Net Feature Differential Encoder (SU-FDE) and the denoising diffusion implicit model to improve the accuracy of image edge change detection and enhance the model's robustness under environmental changes. First, we propose an innovative SU-FDE module that utilizes shared weight features to capture differences between time series images and identify similarities between features to enhance edge detail detection. Furthermore, we add an attention mechanism to identify key coarse features to improve the model's sensitivity and accuracy. Finally, the diffusion model of progressive sampling is used to fuse key coarse features, and the noise reduction ability of the diffusion model and the advantages of capturing the probability distribution of image data are used to enhance the adaptability of the model in different environments. Our method's combination of feature extraction and diffusion models demonstrates effectiveness in change detection in remote sensing images. The performance evaluation of SMDNet on LEVIR-CD, DSIFN-CD, and CDD datasets yields validated F1 scores of 90.99%, 88.40%, and 88.47%, respectively.

We propose a novel methodology to learn neural contractive dynamical systems, where our neural architecture ensures contraction, and hence, global stability. To efficiently scale the method to high-dimensional dynamical systems, we develop a variant of the variational autoencoder that learns dynamics in a low-dimensional latent representation space while retaining contractive stability after decoding. We further extend our approach to learning contractive systems on the Lie group of rotations to account for full-pose end-effector dynamic motions. The result is the first highly flexible learning architecture that provides contractive stability guarantees with capability to perform obstacle avoidance. Empirically, we demonstrate that our approach encodes the desired dynamics more accurately than the current state-of-the-art, which provides less strong stability guarantees. ",

Finally, we demonstrate quantitatively the strengths of the proposed model on several open-vocabulary tasks: Zero-shot 3D semantic segmentation using existing datasets; 3D grounding and retrieval of free-form language queries, using a small dataset that we propose as an extension of nuScenes.

Building efficient and generic vision backbones purely upon SSMs is an appealing direction. However, representing visual data is challenging for SSMs due to the position-sensitivity of visual data and the requirement of global context for visual understanding. In this paper, we show that the reliance of visual representation learning on self-attention is not necessary and propose a new generic vision backbone with bidirectional Mamba blocks (Vim), which marks the image sequences with position embeddings and compresses the visual representation with bidirectional state space models. On ImageNet classification, COCO object detection, and ADE20k semantic segmentation tasks, Vim achieves higher performance compared to well-established vision transformers like DeiT, while also demonstrating significantly improved computation & memory efficiency. For example, Vim is 2.8$\\times$ faster than DeiT and saves 86.8% GPU memory when performing batch inference to extract features on images with a resolution of 1248$\\times$1248. The results demonstrate that Vim is capable of overcoming the computation & memory constraints on performing Transformer-style understanding for high-resolution images and it has great potential to become the next-generation backbone for vision foundation models.

    "abstract": "Practical applications of quantum computing depend on fault-tolerant devices with error correction. Today, the most promising approach is a class of error-correcting codes called surface codes. In this paper, we study the problem of compiling quantum circuits for quantum computers implementing surface codes. The problem involves (1) mapping circuit qubits to the device qubits and (2) routing execution paths between pairs of interacting qubits. We call this the surface code mapping and routing problem (SCMR). Solving SCMR near-optimally is critical for both efficiency and correctness. An optimal solution limits the cost of a computation in terms of precious quantum resources and also minimizes the probability of incurring an undetected logical error, which increases with each additional time step. We study SCMR from a theoretical and practical perspective. First, we prove that SCMR, as well as a constrained version of the problem, is NP-complete. Second, we present a optimal algorithm for solving SCMR that is based on a SAT encoding. Third, we present a spectrum of efficient relaxations of SCMR, for example, by exploiting greedy algorithms for solving the problem of node-disjoint paths. Finally, we implement and evaluate our algorithms on a large suite of real and synthetic circuits. Our results suggest that our relaxations are a powerful tool for compiling realistic workloads. The relaxation-based algorithms are orders of magnitude faster than the optimal algorithm (solving instances with tens of thousands of gates in minutes), while still finding high-quality solutions, achieving the theoretical lower bound on up to 55 out of 168 circuits from a diverse benchmark suite.

    "abstract": "Metallic Glasses (MGs) are widely used disordered materials. Understanding the relationship between the local structure and physical properties of MGs is one of the greatest challenges for both material science and condensed matter physics. In this work, we utilize Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to model the atomic graph structure and study the connection between the structure and the corresponding local energy barrier, which is believed to govern many critical physical properties in MGs. One of our key contributions is to propose a novel Symmetrized GNN (SymGNN) model for predicting the energy barriers, which is invariant under orthogonal transformations of the structure, e.g., rotations and reflections. Such invariance is a desired property that standard GNNs like Graph Convolutional Networks cannot capture. SymGNNs handle the invariance by aggregating over orthogonal transformations of the graph structure for representation learning, and an optimal distribution over all 3D orthogonal transformations $\\mathcal{O}_3$ is learned to maximize the benefit of invariance. We demonstrate in our experiments that SymGNN can significantly improve the energy barrier prediction over other GNNs and non-graph machine learning models. With such an accurate model, we also apply graph explanation algorithms to better reveal the structure-property relationship of MGs. Our GNN framework allows effective prediction of material physical properties and bolsters material science research through the use of AI models. ",

First, various adaptive sampling approaches for collocation points are investigated to verify their effectiveness in the mesh-free framework of PINNs, which allows automated construction of virtual representation without manual mesh generation. Then, the overall performance of the data-driven PINNs (DD-PINNs) framework is examined, which can utilize the acquired datasets in DT scenarios. Its scalability to more general physics is validated within parametric Navier-Stokes equations, where PINNs do not need to be retrained as the Reynolds number varies. In addition, since datasets can be often collected from different fidelity/sparsity in practice, multi-fidelity DD-PINNs are also proposed and evaluated. They show remarkable prediction performance even in the extrapolation tasks, with $42\\sim62\\%$ improvement over the single-fidelity approach. Finally, the uncertainty quantification performance of multi-fidelity DD-PINNs is investigated by the ensemble method to verify their potential in DT, where an accurate measure of predictive uncertainty is critical. The DD-PINN frameworks explored in this study are found to be more suitable for DT scenarios than traditional PINNs from the above perspectives, bringing engineers one step closer to seamless DT realization.

    "abstract": "Wave runup is a critical factor affecting coastal flooding, shoreline changes, and damage to coastal structures. Climate change is also expected to amplify wave runup's impact on coastal areas. Therefore, fast and accurate wave runup estimation is essential for effective coastal engineering design and management. However, predicting the time-dependent wave runup is challenging due to the intrinsic nonlinearities and non-stationarity of the process, even with the use of the most advanced machine learning techniques. In this study, a physics-informed machine learning-based approach is proposed to efficiently and accurately simulate time-series wave runup. The methodology combines the computational efficiency of the Surfbeat (XBSB) mode with the accuracy of the nonhydrostatic (XBNH) mode of the XBeach model. Specifically, a conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN) is used to map the image representation of wave runup from XBSB to the corresponding image from XBNH. These images are generated by first converting wave runup signals into time-frequency scalograms and then transforming them into image representations. The cGAN model achieves improved performance in image-to-image mapping tasks by incorporating physics-based knowledge from XBSB. After training the model, the high-fidelity XBNH-based scalograms can be predicted, which are then employed to reconstruct the time-series wave runup using the inverse wavelet transform. The simulation results underscore the efficiency and robustness of the proposed model in predicting wave runup, suggesting its potential value for applications in risk assessment and management. ",

The proposed workflow leverages deep neural network surrogates trained on data obtained from numerical simulations. The use of surrogates allows for a more flexible and faster evaluation of novel designs. The success history-based adaptive differential evolution with linear reduction and the multi-objective evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition were identified as the best-performing algorithms and used to determine the influence of different objectives in the single-objective optimisation and their combined impact on the draft tube design in the multi-objective optimisation. The results for the single-objective algorithm are consistent with those of the multi-objective algorithm when the objectives are considered separately. Multi-objective approach, however, should typically be chosen, especially for computationally inexpensive surrogates. A multi-criteria decision analysis method was used to obtain optimal multi-objective results, showing an improvement of 1.5% and 17% for the pressure recovery factor and drag coefficient, respectively. The difference between the predictions and the numerical results is less than 0.5% for the pressure recovery factor and 3% for the drag coefficient. As the demand for renewable energy continues to increase, the relevance of data-driven optimisation workflows, as discussed in this study, will become increasingly important, especially in the context of global sustainability efforts.

We aim to develop metrics using mutual information to help practical problems such as model design and selection. We use linear probes to estimate the mutual information between the target information and learned representations, showing another insight into the accessibility to the target information from speech representations. Further, we explore the potential of evaluating representations in a self-supervised fashion, where we estimate the mutual information between different parts of the data without using any labels. Finally, we show that both supervised and unsupervised measures echo the performance of the models on layer-wise linear probing and speech recognition. ",

We demonstrate the model is not only generalizable to a commercially available device with a slightly different microphone geometry, but also outperforms our previous work which uses one additional microphone on the same device.

Leveraging SAM's exceptional zero-shot transfer capability, high-quality segmentation maps of optical images can be obtained. Thus, we can directly compare these two heterogeneous data forms in the so-called segmentation domain. We then introduce two strategies for guiding SAM's segmentation process: the 'no-prompt' and 'box/mask prompt' methods. The two strategies are designed to detect land-cover changes in general scenarios and to identify new land-cover objects within existing backgrounds, respectively. Experimental results on three datasets indicate that the proposed approach can achieve more competitive results compared to representative unsupervised multimodal change detection methods. ",

The study involves designing sensory inputs simulating the visual stimuli from Billock and Tsou's experiments. The after-images induced by these inputs are then theoretically and numerically studied to determine their capacity to replicate the experimentally observed visual effects. A key aspect of this research is investigating the effects induced by the nonlinear nature of neural responses. In particular, by highlighting the importance of both excitatory and inhibitory neurons in the emergence of certain visual phenomena, this study suggests that an interplay of both types of neuronal activities plays an essential role in visual processes, challenging the assumption that the latter is mainly driven by excitatory activities alone.

Clinical evidence supports that accurate longitudinal deformable registration without deforming treated tumor regions is key to quantifying tumor changes. We propose a conditional pyramid registration network based on unsupervised keypoint detection and selective volume-preserving to quantify changes over time. In this approach, we extract the structural and the abnormal keypoints from DCE-MRI, apply the structural keypoints for the registration algorithm to restrict large deformation, and employ volume-preserving loss based on abnormal keypoints to keep the volume of the tumor unchanged after registration. We use a clinical dataset with 1630 MRI scans from 314 patients treated with NAC. The results demonstrate that our method registers with better performance and better volume preservation of the tumors. Furthermore, a local-global-combining biomarker based on the proposed method achieves high accuracy in pathological complete response (pCR) prediction, indicating that predictive information exists outside tumor regions. The biomarkers could potentially be used to avoid unnecessary surgeries for certain patients. It may be valuable for clinicians and/or computer systems to conduct follow-up tumor segmentation and response prediction on images registered by our method.
