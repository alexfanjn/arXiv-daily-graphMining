    "abstract": "As legal case law databases such as HUDOC continue to grow rapidly, it has become essential for legal researchers to find efficient methods to handle such large-scale data sets. Such case law databases usually consist of the textual content of cases together with the citations between them. This paper focuses on case law from the European Court of Human Rights on Article 8 of the European Convention of Human Rights, the right to respect private and family life, home and correspondence. In this study, we demonstrate and compare the potential of topic modelling and citation network to find and organize case law on Article 8 based on their general themes and citation patterns, respectively. Additionally, we explore whether combining these two techniques leads to better results compared to the application of only one of the methods. We evaluate the effectiveness of the combined method on a unique manually collected and annotated dataset of Aricle 8 case law on evictions. The results of our experiments show that our combined (text and citation-based) approach provides the best results in finding and grouping case law, providing scholars with an effective way to extract and analyse relevant cases on a specific issue.

    "title": "Improving conversion rate prediction via self-supervised pre-training in  online advertising",
    "abstract": "The task of predicting conversion rates (CVR) lies at the heart of online advertising systems aiming to optimize bids to meet advertiser performance requirements. Even with the recent rise of deep neural networks, these predictions are often made by factorization machines (FM), especially in commercial settings where inference latency is key. These models are trained using the logistic regression framework on labeled tabular data formed from past user activity that is relevant to the task at hand. Many advertisers only care about click-attributed conversions. A major challenge in training models that predict conversions-given-clicks comes from data sparsity - clicks are rare, conversions attributed to clicks are even rarer. However, mitigating sparsity by adding conversions that are not click-attributed to the training set impairs model calibration. Since calibration is critical to achieving advertiser goals, this is infeasible. In this work we use the well-known idea of self-supervised pre-training, and use an auxiliary auto-encoder model trained on all conversion events, both click-attributed and not, as a feature extractor to enrich the main CVR prediction model. Since the main model does not train on non click-attributed conversions, this does not impair calibration. We adapt the basic self-supervised pre-training idea to our online advertising setup by using a loss function designed for tabular data, facilitating continual learning by ensuring auto-encoder stability, and incorporating a neural network into a large-scale real-time ad auction that ranks tens of thousands of ads, under strict latency constraints, and without incurring a major engineering cost. We show improvements both offline, during training, and in an online A/B test. Following its success in A/B tests, our solution is now fully deployed to the Yahoo native advertising system. ",

    "title": "Within-basket Recommendation via Neural Pattern Associator",
    "abstract": "Within-basket recommendation (WBR) refers to the task of recommending items to the end of completing a non-empty shopping basket during a shopping session. While the latest innovations in this space demonstrate remarkable performance improvement on benchmark datasets, they often overlook the complexity of user behaviors in practice, such as 1) co-existence of multiple shopping intentions, 2) multi-granularity of such intentions, and 3) interleaving behavior (switching intentions) in a shopping session. This paper presents Neural Pattern Associator (NPA), a deep item-association-mining model that explicitly models the aforementioned factors. Specifically, inspired by vector quantization, the NPA model learns to encode common user intentions (or item-combination patterns) as quantized representations (a.k.a. codebook), which permits identification of users's shopping intentions via attention-driven lookup during the reasoning phase. This yields coherent and self-interpretable recommendations. We evaluated the proposed NPA model across multiple extensive datasets, encompassing the domains of grocery e-commerce (shopping basket completion) and music (playlist extension), where our quantitative evaluations show that the NPA model significantly outperforms a wide range of existing WBR solutions, reflecting the benefit of explicitly modeling complex user intentions.

    "abstract": "As VR devices become more prevalent in the consumer space, VR applications are likely to be increasingly used by users unfamiliar with VR. Detecting the familiarity level of a user with VR as an interaction medium provides the potential of providing on-demand training for acclimatization and prevents the user from being burdened by the VR environment in accomplishing their tasks. In this work, we present preliminary results of using deep classifiers to conduct automatic detection of familiarity with VR by using hand tracking of the user as they interact with a numeric passcode entry panel to unlock a VR door. We use a VR door as we envision it to the first point of entry to collaborative virtual spaces, such as meeting rooms, offices, or clinics. Users who are unfamiliar with VR will have used their hands to open doors with passcode entry panels in the real world. Thus, while the user may not be familiar with VR, they would be familiar with the task of opening the door. Using a pilot dataset consisting of 7 users familiar with VR, and 7 not familiar with VR, we acquire highest accuracy of 88.03\\% when 6 test users, 3 familiar and 3 not familiar, are evaluated with classifiers trained using data from the remaining 8 users. Our results indicate potential for using user movement data to detect familiarity for the simple yet important task of secure passcode-based access. ",

If the network reconfiguration following cyber-attacks is imperfect, secondary incidents may delay or interrupt post-attack restoration of the power grid. This paper proposes a framework of resilient transmission network reconfiguration, taking into account the impacts of cyber-attacks in the network reconfiguration process. First, the mechanism of cyber-attack propagation is analyzed based on the characteristics of network reconfiguration. Second, systematic resilience indices are specially extracted in which the impact of cyber-attacks on network reconfiguration is quantified. These indices are defined in terms of the restoration characteristics of the transmission power system. Third, representative cyber-attack incidents motivate an optimization-based model of resilient transmission network reconfiguration, and an optimal reconstruction scheme is obtained. Finally, simulation results based on the IEEE 39-bus system verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed framework in enhancing power grid resilience to cyber-attacks. ",

It utilizes Transformer to overcome the limitations of recurrent neural networks in capturing long-term sequences, and employs Chebyshev polynomial graph convolution to capture complex spatial dependencies. Furthermore, considering the impact of spatio-temporal heterogeneity on traffic speed, we design two self-supervised learning tasks to model the temporal and spatial heterogeneity, thereby improving the accuracy and generalization ability of the model. Experimental evaluations are conducted on two real-world datasets, PeMS04 and PeMS08, and the results are visualized and analyzed, demonstrating the superior performance of the proposed model. ",

    "abstract": "The problem of the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) prediction, aiming at providing an accurate estimate of the remaining time from the current predicting moment to the complete failure of the device, has gained significant attention from researchers in recent years. In this paper, to overcome the shortcomings of rigid combination for temporal and spatial features in most existing RUL prediction approaches, a spatial-temporal homogeneous feature extractor, named Dual-Mixer model, is firstly proposed. Flexible layer-wise progressive feature fusion is employed to ensure the homogeneity of spatial-temporal features and enhance the prediction accuracy. Secondly, the Feature Space Global Relationship Invariance (FSGRI) training method is introduced based on supervised contrastive learning. This method maintains the consistency of relationships among sample features with their degradation patterns during model training, simplifying the subsequently regression task in the output layer and improving the model's performance in RUL prediction. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is validated through comparisons with other latest research works on the C-MAPSS dataset. The Dual-Mixer model demonstrates superiority across most metrics, while the FSGRI training method shows an average improvement of 7.00% and 2.41% in RMSE and MAPE, respectively, for all baseline models.

    "abstract": "Pneumatic systems are common in manufacturing, healthcare, transportation, robotics, and many other fields. Failures in these systems can have very serious consequences, particularly if they go undetected. In this work, we present an air-powered error detector device that can detect and respond to failures in pneumatically actuated systems. The device contains 21 monolithic membrane valves that act like transistors in a pneumatic logic \"circuit\" that uses vacuum to represent TRUE and atmospheric pressure as FALSE. Three pneumatic exclusive-OR (XOR) gates are used to calculate the parity bit corresponding to the values of several control bits. If the calculated value of the parity bit differs from the expected value, then an error (like a leak or a blocked air line) has been detected and the device outputs a pneumatic error signal which can in turn be used to alert a user, shut down the system, or take some other action. As a proof-of-concept, we used our pneumatic error detector to monitor the operation of a medical device, an intermittent pneumatic compression (IPC) device commonly used to prevent the formation of life-threatening blood clots in the wearer's legs. Experiments confirm that when the IPC device was damaged, the pneumatic error detector immediately recognized the error (a leak) and alerted the wearer using sound. By providing a simple and low-cost way to add fault detection to pneumatic actuation systems without using sensors, our pneumatic error detector can promote safety and reliability across the wide range of pneumatic systems.

Many speakers on social media, share their regretful experiences and opinions regularly. It might cause a re-evaluation of one's choices and a desire to make a different option if given the chance. As a result, knowing the source of regret is critical for investigating its impact on behavior and decision-making. This study focuses on regret and how it is expressed, specifically in Hindi, on various social media platforms. In our study, we present a novel dataset from three different sources, where each sentence has been manually classified into one of three classes \"Regret by action\", \"Regret by inaction\", and \"No regret\". Next, we use this dataset to investigate the linguistic expressions of regret in Hindi text and also identify the textual domains that are most frequently associated with regret. Our findings indicate that individuals on social media platforms frequently express regret for both past inactions and actions, particularly within the domain of interpersonal relationships. We use a pre-trained BERT model to generate word embeddings for the Hindi dataset and also compare deep learning models with conventional machine learning models in order to demonstrate accuracy. Our results show that BERT embedding with CNN consistently surpassed other models. This described the effectiveness of BERT for conveying the context and meaning of words in the regret domain. ",

Our results also show some notable differences between reliable media and fringe media's use of tweets. Namely, fringe media embed tweets more and use those tweets as the source of news more than reliable media.

However, while there are several potential applications of channel simulation - lossy compression with realism constraints or differential privacy, to name a few - little is known about its fundamental limitations. In this paper, we restrict our attention to a subclass of channel simulation protocols called causal rejection samplers (CRS), establish new, tighter lower bounds on their expected runtime and codelength, and demonstrate the bounds' achievability. Concretely, for an arbitrary CRS, let $Q$ and $P$ denote a target and proposal distribution supplied as input, and let $K$ be the number of samples examined by the algorithm. We show that the expected runtime $\\mathbb{E}[K]$ of any CRS scales at least as $\\exp_2(D_\\infty[Q || P])$, where $D_\\infty[Q || P]$ is the R\\'enyi $\\infty$-divergence. Regarding the codelength, we show that $D_{KL}[Q || P] \\leq D_{CS}[Q || P] \\leq \\mathbb{H}[K]$, where $D_{CS}[Q || P]$ is a new quantity we call the channel simulation divergence. Furthermore, we prove that our new lower bound, unlike the $D_{KL}[Q || P]$ lower bound, is achievable tightly, i.e. there is a CRS such that $\\mathbb{H}[K] \\leq D_{CS}[Q || P] + \\log_2 (e + 1)$. Finally, we conduct numerical studies of the asymptotic scaling of the codelength of Gaussian and Laplace channel simulation algorithms. ",

This manuscript presents an overview of the challenges of modeling LDES technologies, as well as a discussion regarding the capabilities and limitations of existing approaches. We used two test power systems with high shares of both solar photovoltaics- and wind (70% - 90% annual variable renewable energy shares) to assess LDES dispatch approaches. Our results estimate that better dispatch modeling of LDES could increase the associated operational value by 4% - 14% and increase the standard capacity credit by 14% - 34%. Thus, a better LDES dispatch could represent significant cost saving opportunities for electric utilities and system operators. In addition, existing LDES dispatch modeling approaches were tested in terms of both improved system value (e.g., based on production cost and standard capacity credit) and scalability (e.g., based on central processing unit time and peak memory usage). Both copper plate and nodal representations of the power system were considered. Although the end volume target dispatch approach, i.e., based on mid-term scheduling, showed promising performance in terms of both improved system value and scalability, there is a need for robust and scalable dispatch approaches for LDES in transmission-constrained electric grids. Moreover, more research is required to better understand the optimal operation of LDES considering extreme climate/weather events, reliability applications, and power system operational uncertainties.

These moderators must regularly make decisions about how to govern, yet it is challenging to determine what governance strategies are most successful, as measuring the `success' of governance is complex and nuanced. Furthermore, the incredible diversity in community topic, size, and membership all but guarantee that there is no `one-size-fits-all' solution for community governance. In this work, we measure governance by assessing how community members publicly discuss their own moderators. We quantify perceptions of moderators through 1.89 million labeled posts and comments made on reddit over an 18 month period, and relate these perceptions to characteristics of community governance and to different actions that community moderators can take. We identify key differences between different types of communities, and highlight promising strategies for moderator teams. Amongst other findings, we show that positive perceptions of moderators are associated with other measures of community health, and that strict rule enforcement is perceived more favorably for certain topics, such as news communities, than others. We investigate what kinds of moderators have the most positive impact on the community when they join the mod team, and find that moderators who are active community members before and during their mod tenures result in the largest improvement of community members' perceptions of moderators.

Recently, pretrained language models (LMs) have become prominent in this field. Various approaches have been proposed to fine-tune LMs using supervised fine-tuning (SFT) techniques for code completion. However, the inherent exposure bias of these models can cause errors to accumulate early in the sequence completion, leading to even more errors in subsequent completions. To address this problem, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is an alternative technique for fine-tuning LMs for code completion, which can improve the generalization capabilities and overall performance. Nevertheless, integrating DRL-based strategies into code completion faces two major challenges: 1) The dynamic nature of the code context requires the completion model to quickly adapt to changes, which poses difficulties for conventional DRL strategies that focus on delayed rewarding of the final code state. 2) It is difficult to evaluate the correctness of partial code, thus the reward redistribution-based strategies cannot be adapted to code completion. To tackle these challenges, we propose IRCoCo, a code completion-specific DRL-based fine-tuning framework. This framework is designed to provide immediate rewards as feedback for detecting dynamic context changes arising from continuous edits during code completion. With the aid of immediate feedback, the fine-tuned LM can gain a more precise understanding of the current context, thereby enabling effective adjustment of the LM and optimizing code completion in a more refined manner. Experimental results demonstrate that fine-tuning pretrained LMs with IRCoCo leads to significant improvements in the code completion task, outperforming both SFT-based and other DRL-based baselines.

    "abstract": "Collaborative learning (CL) is a distributed learning framework that aims to protect user privacy by allowing users to jointly train a model by sharing their gradient updates only. However, gradient inversion attacks (GIAs), which recover users' training data from shared gradients, impose severe privacy threats to CL. Existing defense methods adopt different techniques, e.g., differential privacy, cryptography, and perturbation defenses, to defend against the GIAs. Nevertheless, all current defense methods suffer from a poor trade-off between privacy, utility, and efficiency. To mitigate the weaknesses of existing solutions, we propose a novel defense method, Dual Gradient Pruning (DGP), based on gradient pruning, which can improve communication efficiency while preserving the utility and privacy of CL. Specifically, DGP slightly changes gradient pruning with a stronger privacy guarantee. And DGP can also significantly improve communication efficiency with a theoretical analysis of its convergence and generalization. Our extensive experiments show that DGP can effectively defend against the most powerful GIAs and reduce the communication cost without sacrificing the model's utility. ",

    "abstract": "In material sciences, characterizing faults in periodic structures is vital for understanding material properties. To characterize magnetic labyrinthine patterns, it is necessary to accurately identify junctions and terminals, often featuring over a thousand closely packed defects per image. This study introduces a new technique called TM-CNN (Template Matching - Convolutional Neural Network) designed to detect a multitude of small objects in images, such as defects in magnetic labyrinthine patterns. TM-CNN was used to identify these structures in 444 experimental images, and the results were explored to deepen the understanding of magnetic materials. It employs a two-stage detection approach combining template matching, used in initial detection, with a convolutional neural network, used to eliminate incorrect identifications. To train a CNN classifier, it is necessary to create a large number of training images. This difficulty prevents the use of CNN in many practical applications. TM-CNN significantly reduces the manual workload for creating training images by automatically making most of the annotations and leaving only a small number of corrections to human reviewers. In testing, TM-CNN achieved an impressive F1 score of 0.988, far outperforming traditional template matching and CNN-based object detection algorithms. ",

    "abstract": "Deep learning has been widely adopted across various fields, but there has been little focus on evaluating the performance of deep learning pipelines. With the increased use of large datasets and complex models, it has become common to run the training process only once and compare the result to previous benchmarks. However, this procedure can lead to imprecise comparisons due to the variance in neural network evaluation metrics. The metric variance comes from the randomness inherent in the training process of deep learning pipelines. Traditional solutions such as running the training process multiple times are usually not feasible in deep learning due to computational limitations. In this paper, we propose a new metric framework, Calibrated Loss Metric, that addresses this issue by reducing the variance in its vanilla counterpart. As a result, the new metric has a higher accuracy to detect effective modeling improvement. Our approach is supported by theoretical justifications and extensive experimental validations in the context of Deep Click-Through Rate Prediction Models. ",

We show the classical stability model for power networks that overlooks this property, known as the \"swing equation\", may become inadequate to analyze systems with high shares of inverter-based resources, commonly known as \"low-inertia power systems\". Subsequently, we introduce a plane wave dynamic model, consistent with the structural properties of emerging power systems with up to 100% inverter-based resources, which identifies the concept of inertia in power grids as a time-varying component. We leverage our theory to discuss a number of open questions in the electric power industry.

    "abstract": "Leveraging the rich information extracted from light field (LF) cameras is instrumental for dense prediction tasks. However, adapting light field data to enhance Salient Object Detection (SOD) still follows the traditional RGB methods and remains under-explored in the community. Previous approaches predominantly employ a custom two-stream design to discover the implicit angular feature within light field cameras, leading to significant information isolation between different LF representations. In this study, we propose an efficient paradigm (LF Tracy) to address this limitation. We eschew the conventional specialized fusion and decoder architecture for a dual-stream backbone in favor of a unified, single-pipeline approach. This comprises firstly a simple yet effective data augmentation strategy called MixLD to bridge the connection of spatial, depth, and implicit angular information under different LF representations. A highly efficient information aggregation (IA) module is then introduced to boost asymmetric feature-wise information fusion. Owing to this innovative approach, our model surpasses the existing state-of-the-art methods, particularly demonstrating a 23% improvement over previous results on the latest large-scale PKU dataset. By utilizing only 28.9M parameters, the model achieves a 10% increase in accuracy with 3M additional parameters compared to its backbone using RGB images and an 86% rise to its backbone using LF images.

Current face morphing attacks can be categorized into landmark-based and generation-based approaches. Landmark-based methods use geometric transformations to warp facial regions according to averaged landmarks but often produce morphed images with poor visual quality. Generation-based methods, which employ generation models to blend multiple face images, can achieve better visual quality but are often unsuccessful in generating morphed images that can effectively evade state-of-the-art face recognition systems~(FRSs). Our proposed method overcomes the limitations of previous approaches by optimizing the morphing landmarks and using Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) to combine landmark and appearance features. We model facial landmarks as nodes in a bipartite graph that is fully connected and utilize GCNs to simulate their spatial and structural relationships. The aim is to capture variations in facial shape and enable accurate manipulation of facial appearance features during the warping process, resulting in morphed facial images that are highly realistic and visually faithful. Experiments on two public datasets prove that our method inherits the advantages of previous landmark-based and generation-based methods and generates morphed images with higher quality, posing a more significant threat to state-of-the-art FRSs.

We developed a novel semantic-preserving algorithm to create a multilingual jailbreak dataset and conducted an exhaustive evaluation on both widely-used open-source and commercial LLMs, including GPT-4 and LLaMa. Additionally, we performed interpretability analysis to uncover patterns in Multilingual Jailbreak attacks and implemented a fine-tuning mitigation method.

While there are a number of existing algorithms designed for this purpose, they mostly require precise information about the network, such as large-scale fading coefficients, small-scale fading channel statistics, noise variance at the access points, and user activity probability. Acquiring these information would take a significant overhead and their estimated values might not be accurate. This problem is even more severe in cell-free networks as there are many of these parameters to be acquired. Therefore, this paper sets out to investigate the activity detection problem without the above-mentioned information. In order to handle so many unknown parameters, this paper employs the Bayesian approach, where the unknown variables are endowed with prior distributions which effectively act as regularizations. Together with the likelihood function, a maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimator and a variational inference algorithm are derived. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed methods, even without the knowledge of these system parameters, perform better than existing state-of-the-art methods, such as covariance-based and approximate message passing methods.

However, GNNs may inherit prejudice from the training data and make discriminatory predictions based on sensitive attributes, such as gender and race. Recently, there has been an increasing interest in ensuring fairness on GNNs, but all of them are under the assumption that the training and testing data are under the same distribution, i.e., training data and testing data are from the same graph. Will graph fairness performance decrease under distribution shifts? How does distribution shifts affect graph fairness learning? All these open questions are largely unexplored from a theoretical perspective. To answer these questions, we first theoretically identify the factors that determine bias on a graph. Subsequently, we explore the factors influencing fairness on testing graphs, with a noteworthy factor being the representation distances of certain groups between the training and testing graph. Motivated by our theoretical analysis, we propose our framework FatraGNN. Specifically, to guarantee fairness performance on unknown testing graphs, we propose a graph generator to produce numerous graphs with significant bias and under different distributions. Then we minimize the representation distances for each certain group between the training graph and generated graphs. This empowers our model to achieve high classification and fairness performance even on generated graphs with significant bias, thereby effectively handling unknown testing graphs.

Despite its versatility, SVR encounters challenges when confronted with outliers and noise, primarily due to the use of the $\\varepsilon$-insensitive loss function. To address this limitation, SVR with bounded loss functions has emerged as an appealing alternative, offering enhanced generalization performance and robustness. Notably, recent developments focus on designing bounded loss functions with smooth characteristics, facilitating the adoption of gradient-based optimization algorithms. However, it's crucial to highlight that these bounded and smooth loss functions do not possess an insensitive zone. In this paper, we address the aforementioned constraints by introducing a novel symmetric loss function named the HawkEye loss function. It is worth noting that the HawkEye loss function stands out as the first loss function in SVR literature to be bounded, smooth, and simultaneously possess an insensitive zone. Leveraging this breakthrough, we integrate the HawkEye loss function into the least squares framework of SVR and yield a new fast and robust model termed HE-LSSVR. The optimization problem inherent to HE-LSSVR is addressed by harnessing the adaptive moment estimation (Adam) algorithm, known for its adaptive learning rate and efficacy in handling large-scale problems. To our knowledge, this is the first time Adam has been employed to solve an SVR problem. To empirically validate the proposed HE-LSSVR model, we evaluate it on UCI, synthetic, and time series datasets. The experimental outcomes unequivocally reveal the superiority of the HE-LSSVR model both in terms of its remarkable generalization performance and its efficiency in training time. ",

The presence of extensive missing values in EHR makes it challenging for deep neural networks to directly model the patient's health status based on EHR. Existing deep learning training protocols require the use of statistical information or imputation models to reconstruct missing values; however, the protocols inject non-realistic data into downstream EHR analysis models, significantly limiting model performance. This paper introduces Learnable Prompt as Pseudo Imputation (PAI) as a new training protocol. PAI no longer introduces any imputed data but constructs a learnable prompt to model the implicit preferences of the downstream model for missing values, resulting in a significant performance improvement for all EHR analysis models. Additionally, our experiments show that PAI exhibits higher robustness in situations of data insufficiency and high missing rates. More importantly, in a real-world application involving cross-institutional data with zero-shot evaluation, PAI demonstrates stronger model generalization capabilities for non-overlapping features.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose an online algorithm \"mspace\" for forecasting node features in temporal graphs, which adeptly captures spatial cross-correlation among different nodes as well as the temporal autocorrelation within a node. The algorithm can be used for both probabilistic and deterministic multi-step forecasting, making it applicable for estimation and generation tasks. Comparative evaluations against various baselines, including graph neural network (GNN) based models and classical Kalman filters, demonstrate that mspace performs at par with the state-of-the-art and even surpasses them on some datasets. Importantly, mspace demonstrates consistent robustness across datasets with varying training sizes, a notable advantage over GNN-based methods requiring abundant training samples to learn the spatiotemporal trends in the data effectively. Therefore, employing mspace is advantageous in scenarios where the training sample availability is limited. Additionally, we establish theoretical bounds on multi-step forecasting error of mspace and show that it scales as $O(q)$ for $q$-step forecast. ",

    "abstract": "Modeling time series data remains a pervasive issue as the temporal dimension is inherent to numerous domains. Despite significant strides in time series forecasting, high noise-to-signal ratio, non-normality, non-stationarity, and lack of data continue challenging practitioners. In response, we leverage a simple representation augmentation technique to overcome these challenges. Our augmented representation acts as a statistical-space prior encoded at each time step. In response, we name our method Statistical-space Augmented Representation (SSAR). The underlying high-dimensional data-generating process inspires our representation augmentation. We rigorously examine the empirical generalization performance on two data sets with two downstream temporal learning algorithms. Our approach significantly beats all five up-to-date baselines. Moreover, the highly modular nature of our approach can easily be applied to various settings. Lastly, fully-fledged theoretical perspectives are available throughout the writing for a clear and rigorous understanding. ",

    "title": "An Embeddable Implicit IUVD Representation for Part-based 3D Human  Surface Reconstruction",
    "abstract": "To reconstruct a 3D human surface from a single image, it is important to consider human pose, shape and clothing details simultaneously. In recent years, a combination of parametric body models (such as SMPL) that capture body pose and shape prior, and neural implicit functions that learn flexible clothing details, has been used to integrate the advantages of both approaches. However, the combined representation introduces additional computation, e.g. signed distance calculation, in 3D body feature extraction, which exacerbates the redundancy of the implicit query-and-infer process and fails to preserve the underlying body shape prior. To address these issues, we propose a novel IUVD-Feedback representation, which consists of an IUVD occupancy function and a feedback query algorithm. With this representation, the time-consuming signed distance calculation is replaced by a simple linear transformation in the IUVD space, leveraging the SMPL UV maps. Additionally, the redundant query points in the query-and-infer process are reduced through a feedback mechanism. This leads to more reasonable 3D body features and more effective query points, successfully preserving the parametric body prior. Moreover, the IUVD-Feedback representation can be embedded into any existing implicit human reconstruction pipelines without modifying the trained neural networks. Experiments on THuman2.0 dataset demonstrate that the proposed IUVD-Feedback representation improves result robustness and achieves three times faster acceleration in the query-and-infer process. Furthermore, this representation has the potential to be used in generative applications by leveraging its inherited semantic information from the parametric body model. ",

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have been widely deployed for their remarkable capability to generate texts resembling human language. However, they could be misused by criminals to create deceptive content, such as fake news and phishing emails, which raises ethical concerns. Watermarking is a key technique to mitigate the misuse of LLMs, which embeds a watermark (e.g., a bit string) into a text generated by a LLM. Consequently, this enables the detection of texts generated by a LLM as well as the tracing of generated texts to a specific user. The major limitation of existing watermark techniques is that they cannot accurately or efficiently extract the watermark from a text, especially when the watermark is a long bit string. This key limitation impedes their deployment for real-world applications, e.g., tracing generated texts to a specific user. This work introduces a novel watermarking method for LLM-generated text grounded in \\textbf{error-correction codes} to address this challenge. We provide strong theoretical analysis, demonstrating that under bounded adversarial word/token edits (insertion, deletion, and substitution), our method can correctly extract watermarks, offering a provable robustness guarantee. This breakthrough is also evidenced by our extensive experimental results. The experiments show that our method substantially outperforms existing baselines in both accuracy and robustness on benchmark datasets. For instance, when embedding a bit string of length 12 into a 200-token generated text, our approach attains an impressive match rate of $98.4\\%$, surpassing the performance of Yoo et al. (state-of-the-art baseline) at $85.6\\%$. When subjected to a copy-paste attack involving the injection of 50 tokens to generated texts with 200 words, our method maintains a substantial match rate of $90.8\\%$, while the match rate of Yoo et al. diminishes to below $65\\%$.

In this study, we address the prevalent issue of data integrity in network traffic datasets, which are instrumental in developing machine learning (ML) models for anomaly detection. We introduce two refined versions of the CICIDS-2017 dataset, NFS-2023-nTE and NFS-2023-TE, processed using NFStream to ensure methodologically sound flow expiration and labeling.

We observe that the RF model exhibits exceptional robustness, achieving consistent high-performance metrics irrespective of the underlying dataset quality, which prompts a critical discussion on the actual impact of data integrity on ML efficacy.

Going beyond focusing on a single locomotion skill, we develop a general control solution that can be used for a range of dynamic bipedal skills, from periodic walking and running to aperiodic jumping and standing. Our RL-based controller incorporates a novel dual-history architecture, utilizing both a long-term and short-term input/output (I/O) history of the robot. This control architecture, when trained through the proposed end-to-end RL approach, consistently outperforms other methods across a diverse range of skills in both simulation and the real world.The study also delves into the adaptivity and robustness introduced by the proposed RL system in developing locomotion controllers. We demonstrate that the proposed architecture can adapt to both time-invariant dynamics shifts and time-variant changes, such as contact events, by effectively using the robot's I/O history. Additionally, we identify task randomization as another key source of robustness, fostering better task generalization and compliance to disturbances. The resulting control policies can be successfully deployed on Cassie, a torque-controlled human-sized bipedal robot. This work pushes the limits of agility for bipedal robots through extensive real-world experiments. We demonstrate a diverse range of locomotion skills, including: robust standing, versatile walking, fast running with a demonstration of a 400-meter dash, and a diverse set of jumping skills, such as standing long jumps and high jumps.

Contemporary methods for entity alignment have predominantly utilized knowledge embedding models to procure entity embeddings that encapsulate various similarities-structural, relational, and attributive. These embeddings are then integrated through attention-based information fusion mechanisms. Despite this progress, effectively harnessing multifaceted information remains challenging due to inherent heterogeneity. Moreover, while Large Language Models (LLMs) have exhibited exceptional performance across diverse downstream tasks by implicitly capturing entity semantics, this implicit knowledge has yet to be exploited for entity alignment. In this study, we propose a Large Language Model-enhanced Entity Alignment framework (LLMEA), integrating structural knowledge from KGs with semantic knowledge from LLMs to enhance entity alignment. Specifically, LLMEA identifies candidate alignments for a given entity by considering both embedding similarities between entities across KGs and edit distances to a virtual equivalent entity. It then engages an LLM iteratively, posing multiple multi-choice questions to draw upon the LLM's inference capability. The final prediction of the equivalent entity is derived from the LLM's output. Experiments conducted on three public datasets reveal that LLMEA surpasses leading baseline models. Additional ablation studies underscore the efficacy of our proposed framework. ",

    "abstract": "One of the most critical aspects of multimodal Reinforcement Learning (RL) is the effective integration of different observation modalities. Having robust and accurate representations derived from these modalities is key to enhancing the robustness and sample efficiency of RL algorithms. However, learning representations in RL settings for visuotactile data poses significant challenges, particularly due to the high dimensionality of the data and the complexity involved in correlating visual and tactile inputs with the dynamic environment and task objectives. To address these challenges, we propose Multimodal Contrastive Unsupervised Reinforcement Learning (M2CURL). Our approach employs a novel multimodal self-supervised learning technique that learns efficient representations and contributes to faster convergence of RL algorithms. Our method is agnostic to the RL algorithm, thus enabling its integration with any available RL algorithm. We evaluate M2CURL on the Tactile Gym 2 simulator and we show that it significantly enhances the learning efficiency in different manipulation tasks. This is evidenced by faster convergence rates and higher cumulative rewards per episode, compared to standard RL algorithms without our representation learning approach. ",

The concept, in principle, can be applied to other SC algorithms to achieve robustness to the presence of such type of corruption. We validated proposed approach on two well-known datasets with linear robust SSC algorithm as a baseline model.

    "abstract": "Recently, there has been increasing concern about the vulnerability of deep neural network (DNN)-based synthetic aperture radar (SAR) automatic target recognition (ATR) to adversarial attacks, where a DNN could be easily deceived by clean input with imperceptible but aggressive perturbations. This paper studies the synthetic-to-measured (S2M) transfer setting, where an attacker generates adversarial perturbation based solely on synthetic data and transfers it against victim models trained with measured data. Compared with the current measured-to-measured (M2M) transfer setting, our approach does not need direct access to the victim model or the measured SAR data. We also propose the transferability estimation attack (TEA) to uncover the adversarial risks in this more challenging and practical scenario. The TEA makes full use of the limited similarity between the synthetic and measured data pairs for blind estimation and optimization of S2M transferability, leading to feasible surrogate model enhancement without mastering the victim model and data. Comprehensive evaluations based on the publicly available synthetic and measured paired labeled experiment (SAMPLE) dataset demonstrate that the TEA outperforms state-of-the-art methods and can significantly enhance various attack algorithms in computer vision and remote sensing applications.

Existing methods often resort to post-hoc techniques or prototypes to explain the decision-making process, which can be indirect and lack intrinsic illustration. In this research, we introduce ViTree, a novel approach for fine-grained visual categorization that combines the popular vision transformer as a feature extraction backbone with neural decision trees. By traversing the tree paths, ViTree effectively selects patches from transformer-processed features to highlight informative local regions, thereby refining representations in a step-wise manner. Unlike previous tree-based models that rely on soft distributions or ensembles of paths, ViTree selects a single tree path, offering a clearer and simpler decision-making process. This patch and path selectivity enhances model interpretability of ViTree, enabling better insights into the model's inner workings. Remarkably, extensive experimentation validates that this streamlined approach surpasses various strong competitors and achieves state-of-the-art performance while maintaining exceptional interpretability which is proved by multi-perspective methods.

In this work it is proposed a combination of sensors and algorithms that can lead to the building of a navigation system for visually impaired people.

The combination gives robustness and reliability to the system as well as a wide field of view that allows to obtain many information from the environment. This combination of sensors is inspired by human vision where the center of the retina (fovea) provides more accurate information than the periphery, where humans have a wider field of view. The proposed system is mounted on a wearable device that provides the obstacle-free zones of the scene, allowing the planning of trajectories for people guidance. ",

Most existing data generation methods face challenges to ensure the temporal consistency of the dynamic information for action. In addition, the data generated by these methods lack diversity when only a few training samples are available. To solve those problems, We propose a novel active generative network (AGN), which can adaptively learn various action categories by motion style transfer to generate new actions when the data for a particular action is only a single sample or few samples. The AGN consists of an action generation network and an uncertainty metric network. The former, with ST-GCN as the Backbone, can implicitly learn the morphological features of the target action while preserving the category features of the source action. The latter guides generating actions. Specifically, an action recognition model generates prediction vectors for each action, which is then scored using an uncertainty metric. Finally, UMN provides the uncertainty sampling basis for the generated actions. ",

This problem is critical in transportation planning applications where the sensor coverage is low and the planned interventions have network-wide impacts. The proposed model, named the Macroscopic Traffic Estimator (MaTE), can perform network-wide estimations of traffic flow and travel time only using the set of observed measurements of these quantities. Because MaTE is grounded in macroscopic flow theory, all parameters and variables are interpretable. The estimated traffic flow satisfies fundamental flow conservation constraints and exhibits an increasing monotonic relationship with the estimated travel time. Using logit-based stochastic traffic assignment as the principle for routing flow behavior makes the model fully differentiable with respect to the model parameters. This property facilitates the application of computational graphs to learn parameters from vast amounts of spatiotemporal data. We also integrate neural networks and polynomial kernel functions to capture link flow interactions and enrich the mapping of traffic flows into travel times. MaTE also adds a destination choice model and a trip generation model that uses historical data on the number of trips generated by location. Experiments on synthetic data show that the model can accurately estimate travel time and traffic flow in out-of-sample links. Results obtained using real-world multi-source data from a large-scale transportation network suggest that MaTE outperforms data-driven benchmarks, especially in travel time estimation. The estimated parameters of MaTE are also informative about the hourly change in travel demand and supply characteristics of the transportation network. ",

Motivated by this observation, GraphCG learns the steerable factors via maximizing the mutual information between semantic-rich directions, where the controlled graph moving along the same direction will share the same steerable factors. We quantitatively verify that GraphCG outperforms four competitive baselines on two graph DGMs pretrained on two molecule datasets. Additionally, we qualitatively illustrate seven steerable factors learned by GraphCG on five pretrained DGMs over five graph datasets, including two for molecules and three for point clouds. ",

DP requires to specify a uniform privacy level $\\varepsilon$ that expresses the maximum privacy loss that each data point in the entire dataset is willing to tolerate. Yet, in practice, different data points often have different privacy requirements. Having to set one uniform privacy level is usually too restrictive, often forcing a learner to guarantee the stringent privacy requirement, at a large cost to accuracy. To overcome this limitation, we introduce our novel Personalized-DP Output Perturbation method (PDP-OP) that enables to train Ridge regression models with individual per data point privacy levels. We provide rigorous privacy proofs for our PDP-OP as well as accuracy guarantees for the resulting model. This work is the first to provide such theoretical accuracy guarantees when it comes to personalized DP in machine learning, whereas previous work only provided empirical evaluations. We empirically evaluate PDP-OP on synthetic and real datasets and with diverse privacy distributions. We show that by enabling each data point to specify their own privacy requirement, we can significantly improve the privacy-accuracy trade-offs in DP. We also show that PDP-OP outperforms the personalized privacy techniques of Jorgensen et al. (2015). ",

UltraTool focuses on the entire process of using tools - from planning and creating to applying them in complex tasks. It emphasizes real-world complexities, demanding accurate, multi-step planning for effective problem-solving. A key feature of UltraTool is its independent evaluation of planning with natural language, which happens before tool usage and simplifies the task solving by mapping out the intermediate steps. Thus, unlike previous work, it eliminates the restriction of pre-defined toolset during planning. Through extensive experiments on various LLMs, we offer novel insights into the evaluation of capabilities of LLMs in tool utilization, thereby contributing a fresh perspective to this rapidly evolving field.

Additionally, we estimate hidden states like velocity and spin for trajectory prediction. Furthermore, to enhance spin inference early in the ball's flight, where limited observations are available, we integrate human pose data using a temporal convolutional network (TCN) to compute spin priors within the factor graph. This refinement provides more accurate spin priors at the beginning of the factor graph, leading to improved early-stage hidden state inference for prediction. Our result shows the trained TCN can predict the spin priors with RMSE of 5.27 Hz. Integrating TCN into the factor graph reduces the prediction error of landing positions by over 63.6% compared to a baseline method that utilized an adaptive extended Kalman filter. ",

Three-dimensional polarized light imaging (3D-PLI) is a microscopic imaging technique that enables insights into the fine-grained organization of myelinated nerve fibers with high resolution. Descriptors characterizing the fiber architecture observed in 3D-PLI would enable downstream analysis tasks such as multimodal correlation studies, clustering, and mapping. However, best practices for observer-independent characterization of fiber architecture in 3D-PLI are not yet available. To this end, we propose the application of a fully data-driven approach to characterize nerve fiber architecture in 3D-PLI images using self-supervised representation learning. We introduce a 3D-Context Contrastive Learning (CL-3D) objective that utilizes the spatial neighborhood of texture examples across histological brain sections of a 3D reconstructed volume to sample positive pairs for contrastive learning. We combine this sampling strategy with specifically designed image augmentations to gain robustness to typical variations in 3D-PLI parameter maps. The approach is demonstrated for the 3D reconstructed occipital lobe of a vervet monkey brain. We show that extracted features are highly sensitive to different configurations of nerve fibers, yet robust to variations between consecutive brain sections arising from histological processing.

    "abstract": "In this work we propose a fine grained approach with self-adaptive migration rate for distributed evolutionary computation. Our target is to gain some insights on the effects caused by communication when the algorithm scales. To this end, we consider a set of basic topologies in order to avoid the overlapping of algorithmic effects between communication and topological structures. We analyse the approach viability by comparing how solution quality and algorithm speed change when the number of processors increases and compare it with an Island model based implementation. A finer-grained approach implies a better chance of achieving a larger scalable system; such a feature is crucial concerning large-scale parallel architectures such as Peer-to-Peer systems. In order to check scalability, we perform a threefold experimental evaluation of this model: First, we concentrate on the algorithmic results when the problem scales up to eight nodes in comparison with how it does following the Island model. Second, we analyse the computing time speedup of the approach while scaling. Finally, we analyse the network performance with the proposed self-adaptive migration rate policy that depends on the link latency and bandwidth. With this experimental setup, our approach shows better scalability than the Island model and a equivalent robustness on the average of the three test functions under study. ",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in NLP show that language models retain a discernible level of knowledge in deontological ethics and moral norms. However, existing works often treat morality as binary, ranging from right to wrong. This simplistic view does not capture the nuances of moral judgment. Pluralist moral philosophers argue that human morality can be deconstructed into a finite number of elements, respecting individual differences in moral judgment. In line with this view, we build a pluralist moral sentence embedding space via a state-of-the-art contrastive learning approach. We systematically investigate the embedding space by studying the emergence of relationships among moral elements, both quantitatively and qualitatively. Our results show that a pluralist approach to morality can be captured in an embedding space. However, moral pluralism is challenging to deduce via self-supervision alone and requires a supervised approach with human labels. ",

Recent studies have highlighted the potential of using neural data to mimic brain processing; however, these often reply on invasive neural recordings from non-human subjects, leaving a critical gap in our understanding of human visual perception and the development of more human brain-like vision models. Addressing this gap, we present, for the first time, \"Re(presentational)Al(ignment)net\", a vision model aligned with human brain activity based on non-invasive EEG recordings, demonstrating a significantly higher similarity to human brain representations. Our innovative image-to-brain multi-layer encoding alignment framework not only optimizes multiple layers of the model, marking a substantial leap in neural alignment, but also enables the model to efficiently learn and mimic human brain's visual representational patterns across object categories and different neural data modalities. Furthermore, we discover that alignment with human brain representations improves the model's adversarial robustness. Our findings suggest that ReAlnet sets a new precedent in the field, bridging the gap between artificial and human vision, and paving the way for more brain-like artificial intelligence systems. ",

A well-posedness result within a Sobolev framework for (BP), considering a time dependent bottom, is presented. Then, the inverse problem is reformulated as a nonlinear PDEconstrained optimization one. An existence result of the minimum, under constraints on the admissible set of bottoms, is presented. Moreover, an implementation of the gradient descent approach, via the adjoint method, is considered. For solving numerically both, the forward (BP) and its adjoint system, we derive a universal and low-dissipation scheme, which contains non-conservative products. The scheme is based on the FORCE-{\\alpha} method proposed in [Toro, E. F., Saggiorato, B., Tokareva, S., and Hidalgo, A. (2020).

To achieve this, we propose the first adversarial objective for defending LMs against jailbreaking attacks and an algorithm, robust prompt optimization (RPO), that uses gradient-based token optimization to enforce harmless outputs. This results in an easily accessible suffix that significantly improves robustness to both jailbreaks seen during optimization and unknown, held-out jailbreaks, reducing the attack success rate on Starling-7B from 84% to 8.66% across 20 jailbreaks. In addition, we find that RPO has a minor effect on normal LM use, is successful under adaptive attacks, and can transfer to black-box models, reducing the success rate of the strongest attack on GPT-4 from 92% to 6%.

This expectation is based on the reduced complexity, as well as the fact that we choose hyperparameters based on simple heuristics, that transfer to other datasets. We then re-arrange the xView2 dataset splits such that the test locations are not seen during training, contrary to the competition setup. In this setting, we find that both the complex and the simplified model fail to generalize to unseen locations. Analyzing the dataset indicates that this failure to generalize is not only a model-based problem, but that the difficulty might also be influenced by the unequal class distributions between events.

In order to assist forecasters in warning the public, several algorithms have been developed to automatically detect tornadic signatures in weather radar observations. Recently, Machine Learning (ML) algorithms, which learn directly from large amounts of labeled data, have been shown to be highly effective for this purpose. Since tornadoes are extremely rare events within the corpus of all available radar observations, the selection and design of training datasets for ML applications is critical for the performance, robustness, and ultimate acceptance of ML algorithms. This study introduces a new benchmark dataset, TorNet to support development of ML algorithms in tornado detection and prediction. TorNet contains full-resolution, polarimetric, Level-II WSR-88D data sampled from 10 years of reported storm events. A number of ML baselines for tornado detection are developed and compared, including a novel deep learning (DL) architecture capable of processing raw radar imagery without the need for manual feature extraction required for existing ML algorithms. Despite not benefiting from manual feature engineering or other preprocessing, the DL model shows increased detection performance compared to non-DL and operational baselines. The TorNet dataset, as well as source code and model weights of the DL baseline trained in this work, are made freely available. ",

    "abstract": "Sequential neural posterior estimation (SNPE) techniques have been recently proposed for dealing with simulation-based models with intractable likelihoods. They are devoted to learning the posterior from adaptively proposed simulations using neural network-based conditional density estimators. As a SNPE technique, the automatic posterior transformation (APT) method proposed by Greenberg et al. (2019) performs notably and scales to high dimensional data. However, the APT method bears the computation of an expectation of the logarithm of an intractable normalizing constant, i.e., a nested expectation. Although atomic APT was proposed to solve this by discretizing the normalizing constant, it remains challenging to analyze the convergence of learning. In this paper, we propose a nested APT method to estimate the involved nested expectation instead. This facilitates establishing the convergence analysis. Since the nested estimators for the loss function and its gradient are biased, we make use of unbiased multi-level Monte Carlo (MLMC) estimators for debiasing. To further reduce the excessive variance of the unbiased estimators, this paper also develops some truncated MLMC estimators by taking account of the trade-off between the bias and the average cost. Numerical experiments for approximating complex posteriors with multimodal in moderate dimensions are provided. ",

However, conventional image sensors are intensity-based and inherently lack the capability to directly measure the phase distribution of a field. This limitation can be overcome using interferometric or holographic methods, often supplemented by iterative phase retrieval algorithms, leading to a considerable increase in hardware complexity and computational demand. Here, we present a complex field imager design that enables snapshot imaging of both the amplitude and quantitative phase information of input fields using an intensity-based sensor array without any digital processing. Our design utilizes successive deep learning-optimized diffractive surfaces that are structured to collectively modulate the input complex field, forming two independent imaging channels that perform amplitude-to-amplitude and phase-to-intensity transformations between the input and output planes within a compact optical design, axially spanning ~100 wavelengths. The intensity distributions of the output fields at these two channels on the sensor plane directly correspond to the amplitude and quantitative phase profiles of the input complex field, eliminating the need for any digital image reconstruction algorithms. We experimentally validated the efficacy of our complex field diffractive imager designs through 3D-printed prototypes operating at the terahertz spectrum, with the output amplitude and phase channel images closely aligning with our numerical simulations. We envision that this complex field imager will have various applications in security, biomedical imaging, sensing and material science, among others. ",

Specifically, our framework comprises three components: (i) a balancing autoencoder that uses representation learning to embed high-dimensional country characteristics while addressing treatment selection bias; (ii) a counterfactual generator to compute counterfactual outcomes for varying aid volumes to address small sample-size settings; and (iii) an inference model that is used to predict heterogeneous treatment-response curves. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework using data with official development aid earmarked to end HIV/AIDS in 105 countries, amounting to more than USD 5.2 billion. For this, we first show that our framework successfully computes heterogeneous treatment-response curves using semi-synthetic data. Then, we demonstrate our framework using real-world HIV data. Our framework points to large opportunities for a more effective aid allocation, suggesting that the total number of new HIV infections could be reduced by up to 3.3% (~50,000 cases) compared to the current allocation practice.

    "abstract": "Quantum computing shows great potential, but errors pose a significant challenge. This study explores new strategies for mitigating quantum errors using artificial neural networks (ANN) and the Yang-Baxter equation (YBE). Unlike traditional error correction methods, which are computationally intensive, we investigate artificial error mitigation. The manuscript introduces the basics of quantum error sources and explores the potential of using classical computation for error mitigation. The Yang-Baxter equation plays a crucial role, allowing us to compress time dynamics simulations into constant-depth circuits. By introducing controlled noise through the YBE, we enhance the dataset for error mitigation. We train an ANN model on partial data from quantum simulations, demonstrating its effectiveness in correcting errors in time-evolving quantum states. ",

    "abstract": "The classical Andr\\'{a}sfai-Erd\\H{o}s-S\\'{o}s Theorem states that for $\\ell\\ge 2$, every $n$-vertex $K_{\\ell+1}$-free graph with minimum degree greater than $\\frac{3\\ell-4}{3\\ell-1}n$ must be $\\ell$-partite. We establish a simple criterion for $r$-graphs, $r \\geq 2$, to exhibit an Andr\\'{a}sfai-Erd\\H{o}s-S\\'{o}s-type property (AES), leading to a classification of most previously studied hypergraph families with this property. For every AES $r$-graph $F$, we present a simple algorithm to decide the $F$-freeness of an $n$-vertex $r$-graph with minimum degree greater than $(\\pi(F) - \\varepsilon_F)\\binom{n}{r-1}$ in time $O(n^r)$, where $\\varepsilon_F >0$ is a constant. In particular, for the complete graph $K_{\\ell+1}$, we can take $\\varepsilon_{K_{\\ell+1}} = (3\\ell^2-\\ell)^{-1}$. Based on a result by Chen-Huang-Kanj-Xia, we show that for every fixed $C > 0$, this problem cannot be solved in time $n^{o(\\ell)}$ if we replace $\\varepsilon_{K_{\\ell+1}}$ with $(C\\ell)^{-1}$ unless ETH fails. Furthermore, we establish an algorithm to decide the $K_{\\ell+1}$-freeness of an $n$-vertex graph with $\\mathrm{ex}(n,K_{\\ell+1})-k$ edges in time $(\\ell+1)n^2$ for $k \\le n/30\\ell$ and $\\ell \\le \\sqrt{n/6}$, partially improving upon the recently provided running time of $2.49^k n^{O(1)}$ by Fomin--Golovach--Sagunov--Simonov. Moreover, we show that for every fixed $\\delta > 0$, this problem cannot be solved in time $n^{o(\\ell)}$ if $k$ is of order $n^{1+\\delta}$ unless ETH fails. As an intermediate step, we show that for a specific class of $r$-graphs $F$, the (surjective) $F$-coloring problem can be solved in time $O(n^r)$, provided the input $r$-graph has $n$ vertices and a large minimum degree, refining several previous results.
