    "abstract": "Emotion Recognition in Conversation (ERC) plays a crucial role in enabling dialogue systems to effectively respond to user requests. The emotions in a conversation can be identified by the representations from various modalities, such as audio, visual, and text. However, due to the weak contribution of non-verbal modalities to recognize emotions, multimodal ERC has always been considered a challenging task. In this paper, we propose Teacher-leading Multimodal fusion network for ERC (TelME). TelME incorporates cross-modal knowledge distillation to transfer information from a language model acting as the teacher to the non-verbal students, thereby optimizing the efficacy of the weak modalities. We then combine multimodal features using a shifting fusion approach in which student networks support the teacher. TelME achieves state-of-the-art performance in MELD, a multi-speaker conversation dataset for ERC. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our components through additional experiments. ",

    "abstract": "In recent years, knowledge graph completion (KGC) models based on pre-trained language model (PLM) have shown promising results. However, the large number of parameters and high computational cost of PLM models pose challenges for their application in downstream tasks. This paper proposes a progressive distillation method based on masked generation features for KGC task, aiming to significantly reduce the complexity of pre-trained models. Specifically, we perform pre-distillation on PLM to obtain high-quality teacher models, and compress the PLM network to obtain multi-grade student models. However, traditional feature distillation suffers from the limitation of having a single representation of information in teacher models. To solve this problem, we propose masked generation of teacher-student features, which contain richer representation information. Furthermore, there is a significant gap in representation ability between teacher and student. Therefore, we design a progressive distillation method to distill student models at each grade level, enabling efficient knowledge transfer from teachers to students. The experimental results demonstrate that the model in the pre-distillation stage surpasses the existing state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, in the progressive distillation stage, the model significantly reduces the model parameters while maintaining a certain level of performance. Specifically, the model parameters of the lower-grade student model are reduced by 56.7\\% compared to the baseline. ",

    "abstract": "Nowadays, the need for causal discovery is ubiquitous. A better understanding of not just the stochastic dependencies between parts of a system, but also the actual cause-effect relations, is essential for all parts of science. Thus, the need for reliable methods to detect causal directions is growing constantly. In the last 50 years, many causal discovery algorithms have emerged, but most of them are applicable only under the assumption that the systems have no feedback loops and that they are causally sufficient, i.e. that there are no unmeasured subsystems that can affect multiple measured variables. This is unfortunate since those restrictions can often not be presumed in practice. Feedback is an integral feature of many processes, and real-world systems are rarely completely isolated and fully measured. Fortunately, in recent years, several techniques, that can cope with cyclic, causally insufficient systems, have been developed. And with multiple methods available, a practical application of those algorithms now requires knowledge of the respective strengths and weaknesses. Here, we focus on the problem of causal discovery for sparse linear models which are allowed to have cycles and hidden confounders. We have prepared a comprehensive and thorough comparative study of four causal discovery techniques: two versions of the LLC method [10] and two variants of the ASP-based algorithm [11]. The evaluation investigates the performance of those techniques for various experiments with multiple interventional setups and different dataset sizes. ",

    "abstract": "We propose a novel methodology for validating software product line (PL) models by integrating Statistical Model Checking (SMC) with Process Mining (PM). Our approach focuses on the feature-oriented language QFLan in the PL engineering domain, allowing modeling of PLs with rich cross-tree and quantitative constraints, as well as aspects of dynamic PLs like staged configurations. This richness leads to models with infinite state-space, requiring simulation-based analysis techniques like SMC. For instance, we illustrate with a running example involving infinite state space. SMC involves generating samples of system dynamics to estimate properties such as event probabilities or expected values. On the other hand, PM uses data-driven techniques on execution logs to identify and reason about the underlying execution process. In this paper, we propose, for the first time, applying PM techniques to SMC simulations' byproducts to enhance the utility of SMC analyses. Typically, when SMC results are unexpected, modelers must determine whether they stem from actual system characteristics or model bugs in a black-box manner. We improve on this by using PM to provide a white-box perspective on the observed system dynamics. Samples from SMC are fed into PM tools, producing a compact graphical representation of observed dynamics. The mined PM model is then transformed into a QFLan model, accessible to PL engineers. Using two well-known PL models, we demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of our methodology in pinpointing issues and suggesting fixes. Additionally, we show its generality by applying it to the security domain. ",

A network is modeled as a simple connected undirected n-node graph with unlabeled nodes, and all ports at any node of degree d are arbitrarily numbered 0,.....,d-1. Each of two identical mobile agents, initially situated at distinct nodes, has to visit all nodes and stop. Agents execute the same deterministic algorithm and move in synchronous rounds: in each round, an agent can either remain at the same node or move to an adjacent node. Exploration must be collision-free: in every round at most one agent can be at any node. We assume that agents have vision of radius 2: an awake agent situated at a node v can see the subgraph induced by all nodes at a distance at most 2 from v, sees all port numbers in this subgraph, and the agents located at these nodes. Agents do not know the entire graph but they know an upper bound n on its size. The time of an exploration is the number of rounds since the wakeup of the later agent to the termination by both agents. We show a collision-free exploration algorithm working in time polynomial in n, for arbitrary graphs of size larger than 2. Moreover, we show that if agents have only vision of radius 1, then collision-free exploration is impossible, e.g., in any tree of diameter 2. ",

    "abstract": "Current techniques in Visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (VSLAM) estimate camera displacement by comparing image features of consecutive scenes. These algorithms depend on scene continuity, hence requires frequent camera inputs. However, processing images frequently can lead to significant memory usage and computation overhead. In this study, we introduce SemanticSLAM, an end-to-end visual-inertial odometry system that utilizes semantic features extracted from an RGB-D sensor. This approach enables the creation of a semantic map of the environment and ensures reliable camera localization. SemanticSLAM is scene-agnostic, which means it doesn't require retraining for different environments. It operates effectively in indoor settings, even with infrequent camera input, without prior knowledge. The strength of SemanticSLAM lies in its ability to gradually refine the semantic map and improve pose estimation. This is achieved by a convolutional long-short-term-memory (ConvLSTM) network, trained to correct errors during map construction. Compared to existing VSLAM algorithms, SemanticSLAM improves pose estimation by 17%. The resulting semantic map provides interpretable information about the environment and can be easily applied to various downstream tasks, such as path planning, obstacle avoidance, and robot navigation.

Researchers have used SVI data for estimating pedestrian volumes, demographic surveillance, and to better understand built and natural environments in cityscapes. However, the most common source of publicly available SVI data is Google Street View. Google Street View images are collected infrequently, making temporal analysis challenging, especially in low population density areas. Our main contribution is the development of an open-source data pipeline for processing 360-degree video recorded from a car-mounted camera. The video data is used to generate SVIs, which then can be used as an input for temporal analysis. We demonstrate the use of the pipeline by collecting a SVI dataset over a 38-month longitudinal survey of Seattle, WA, USA during the COVID-19 pandemic. The output of our pipeline is validated through statistical analyses of pedestrian traffic in the images. We confirm known results in the literature and provide new insights into outdoor pedestrian traffic patterns. This study demonstrates the feasibility and value of collecting and using SVI for research purposes beyond what is possible with currently available SVI data. Limitations and future improvements on the data pipeline and case study are also discussed. ",

One of the key challenges in demand forecasting is accounting for relationships and interactions between articles. Most modern forecasting approaches provide independent article-level predictions that do not consider the impact of related articles. Recent research has attempted addressing this challenge using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and showed promising results. This paper builds on previous research on GNNs and makes two contributions. First, we integrate a GNN encoder into a state-of-the-art DeepAR model. The combined model produces probabilistic forecasts, which are crucial for decision-making under uncertainty. Second, we propose to build graphs using article attribute similarity, which avoids reliance on a pre-defined graph structure. Experiments on three real-world datasets show that the proposed approach consistently outperforms non-graph benchmarks. We also show that our approach produces article embeddings that encode article similarity and demand dynamics and are useful for other downstream business tasks beyond forecasting. ",

Multiple causal pathways emerge in the data analysis, with mobility identified as a mediator in one of them. The study further identifies specific challenges faced by rural seniors, such as the reduced accessibility in reaching medical services and assisting others. These challenges stem primarily from aging and geographic obstacles that not only diminish their willingness to travel but also restrict more in the group from choosing transportation modes with higher mobility. The insights gained from this study serve as a foundation for devising effective methods to enhance transportation accessibility for seniors in rural areas. ",

While such generalization might not be important in teams of virtual agents that can retrain policies on-demand, it is pivotal in multi-robot systems that are deployed in the real-world and must readily adapt to inevitable changes. As such, multi-robot policies must remain robust to team changes -- an ability we call adaptive teaming. In this work, we investigate if awareness and communication of robot capabilities can provide such generalization by conducting detailed experiments involving an established multi-robot test bed. We demonstrate that shared decentralized policies, that enable robots to be both aware of and communicate their capabilities, can achieve adaptive teaming by implicitly capturing the fundamental relationship between collective capabilities and effective coordination.

In the first stage, we train a landmark-conditioned face generation model on a large dataset of real faces. In the second stage, we fine-tune the above model on a small dataset of image-landmark pairs with text prompts for controlling the domain. Our new designs enable our method to generate high-quality synthetic paired datasets from multiple domains while preserving the alignment between landmarks and facial features. Finally, we fine-tuned a pre-trained face landmark detection model on the synthetic dataset to achieve multi-domain face landmark detection.

Directly applying them to continually expanding graphs, however, leads to the potential memory explosion problem due to the need to buffer representative nodes and their associated topological neighborhood structures. To this end, we systematically analyze the key challenges in the memory explosion problem, and present a general framework, i.e., Parameter Decoupled Graph Neural Networks (PDGNNs) with Topology-aware Embedding Memory (TEM), to tackle this issue. The proposed framework not only reduces the memory space complexity from $\\mathcal{O}(nd^L)$ to $\\mathcal{O}(n)$~\\footnote{$n$: memory budget, $d$: average node degree, $L$: the radius of the GNN receptive field}, but also fully utilizes the topological information for memory replay. Specifically, PDGNNs decouple trainable parameters from the computation ego-subgraph via \\textit{Topology-aware Embeddings} (TEs), which compress ego-subgraphs into compact vectors (i.e., TEs) to reduce the memory consumption. Based on this framework, we discover a unique \\textit{pseudo-training effect} in continual learning on expanding graphs and this effect motivates us to develop a novel \\textit{coverage maximization sampling} strategy that can enhance the performance with a tight memory budget. Thorough empirical studies demonstrate that, by tackling the memory explosion problem and incorporating topological information into memory replay, PDGNNs with TEM significantly outperform state-of-the-art techniques, especially in the challenging class-incremental setting.

Motivated by the fact that different image regions have distinctive weights in classification, this paper proposes a black-box adversarial generative framework by jointly designing enhanced input diversity and adaptive step sizes. We design local mixup to randomly mix a group of transformed adversarial images, strengthening the input diversity. For precise adversarial generation, we project the perturbation into the $tanh$ space to relax the boundary constraint. Moreover, the step sizes of different regions can be dynamically adjusted by integrating a second-order momentum.Extensive experiments on ImageNet validate that our framework can achieve superior transferability compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

As a pivotal component for bolstering web security and enhancing the robustness of graph-based applications, the significance of graph anomaly detection is continually increasing. While Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated efficacy in supervised and semi-supervised graph anomaly detection, their performance is contingent upon the availability of sufficient ground truth labels. The labor-intensive nature of identifying anomalies from complex graph structures poses a significant challenge in real-world applications. Despite that, the indirect supervision signals from other tasks (e.g., node classification) are relatively abundant. In this paper, we propose a novel MultItask acTIve Graph Anomaly deTEction framework, namely MITIGATE. Firstly, by coupling node classification tasks, MITIGATE obtains the capability to detect out-of-distribution nodes without known anomalies. Secondly, MITIGATE quantifies the informativeness of nodes by the confidence difference across tasks, allowing samples with conflicting predictions to provide informative yet not excessively challenging information for subsequent training. Finally, to enhance the likelihood of selecting representative nodes that are distant from known patterns, MITIGATE adopts a masked aggregation mechanism for distance measurement, considering both inherent features of nodes and current labeled status. Empirical studies on four datasets demonstrate that MITIGATE significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods for anomaly detection.

The incorrectly classified samples of the training set are removed and replaced with the adversarially corrected samples to form a new training set, and then, in the second stage, domain adaptation is performed back to the original training set. Extensive experimental validations show significant accuracy boosts of over 5% on the CIFAR-100 dataset.

    "abstract": "Recently, methods based on deep learning have been successfully applied to ship detection for synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images. Despite the development of numerous ship detection methodologies, detecting small and coastal ships remains a significant challenge due to the limited features and clutter in coastal environments. For that, a novel adaptive multi-hierarchical attention module (AMAM) is proposed to learn multi-scale features and adaptively aggregate salient features from various feature layers, even in complex environments. Specifically, we first fuse information from adjacent feature layers to enhance the detection of smaller targets, thereby achieving multi-scale feature enhancement. Then, to filter out the adverse effects of complex backgrounds, we dissect the previously fused multi-level features on the channel, individually excavate the salient regions, and adaptively amalgamate features originating from different channels. Thirdly, we present a novel adaptive multi-hierarchical attention network (AMANet) by embedding the AMAM between the backbone network and the feature pyramid network (FPN). Besides, the AMAM can be readily inserted between different frameworks to improve object detection. Lastly, extensive experiments on two large-scale SAR ship detection datasets demonstrate that our AMANet method is superior to state-of-the-art methods. ",

    "abstract": "In contrast to traditional image restoration methods, all-in-one image restoration techniques are gaining increased attention for their ability to restore images affected by diverse and unknown corruption types and levels. However, contemporary all-in-one image restoration methods omit task-wise difficulties and employ the same networks to reconstruct images afflicted by diverse degradations. This practice leads to an underestimation of the task correlations and suboptimal allocation of computational resources. To elucidate task-wise complexities, we introduce a novel concept positing that intricate image degradation can be represented in terms of elementary degradation. Building upon this foundation, we propose an innovative approach, termed the Unified-Width Adaptive Dynamic Network (U-WADN), consisting of two pivotal components: a Width Adaptive Backbone (WAB) and a Width Selector (WS). The WAB incorporates several nested sub-networks with varying widths, which facilitates the selection of the most apt computations tailored to each task, thereby striking a balance between accuracy and computational efficiency during runtime. For different inputs, the WS automatically selects the most appropriate sub-network width, taking into account both task-specific and sample-specific complexities. Extensive experiments across a variety of image restoration tasks demonstrate that the proposed U-WADN achieves better performance while simultaneously reducing up to 32.3\\% of FLOPs and providing approximately 15.7\\% real-time acceleration.

When skills vary across crowdworkers or their estimates correlate, the weighted sum offers a more accurate group estimate than the average. Existing algorithms such as expectation maximization can, at least in principle, produce similarly accurate group estimates. However, their computational requirements become onerous when complex models, such as neural networks, are required to express relationships among crowdworkers.

To study this, we first propose a robust labeling method to quantify color contrast scores of each image and validate our method by showing small labeling variations. More importantly, applying our method to \\textit{the only} diverse-skin tone and pathologically-confirmed skin disease dataset DDI, yields \\textbf{DDI-CoCo Dataset}, and we observe a performance gap between the high and low color difference groups. This disparity remains consistent across various state-of-the-art (SoTA) image classification models, which supports our hypothesis.

    "abstract": "The age of social media is flooded with Internet memes, necessitating a clear grasp and effective identification of harmful ones. This task presents a significant challenge due to the implicit meaning embedded in memes, which is not explicitly conveyed through the surface text and image. However, existing harmful meme detection methods do not present readable explanations that unveil such implicit meaning to support their detection decisions. In this paper, we propose an explainable approach to detect harmful memes, achieved through reasoning over conflicting rationales from both harmless and harmful positions. Specifically, inspired by the powerful capacity of Large Language Models (LLMs) on text generation and reasoning, we first elicit multimodal debate between LLMs to generate the explanations derived from the contradictory arguments. Then we propose to fine-tune a small language model as the debate judge for harmfulness inference, to facilitate multimodal fusion between the harmfulness rationales and the intrinsic multimodal information within memes. In this way, our model is empowered to perform dialectical reasoning over intricate and implicit harm-indicative patterns, utilizing multimodal explanations originating from both harmless and harmful arguments. Extensive experiments on three public meme datasets demonstrate that our harmful meme detection approach achieves much better performance than state-of-the-art methods and exhibits a superior capacity for explaining the meme harmfulness of the model predictions.

Through our GAN-based augmentation methods, we observe improvements in model performance, both in non-private (0.45% F1) and private (11.90-15.48% F1) training scenarios.

Currently, the design of EENNs is carried out manually by experts, a complex and time-consuming task that requires accounting for many aspects, including the correct placement, the thresholding, and the computational overhead of the EECs. For this reason, the research is exploring the use of Neural Architecture Search (NAS) to automatize the design of EENNs. Currently, few comprehensive NAS solutions for EENNs have been proposed in the literature, and a fully automated, joint design strategy taking into consideration both the backbone and the EECs remains an open problem. To this end, this work presents Neural Architecture Search for Hardware Constrained Early Exit Neural Networks (NACHOS), the first NAS framework for the design of optimal EENNs satisfying constraints on the accuracy and the number of Multiply and Accumulate (MAC) operations performed by the EENNs at inference time. In particular, this provides the joint design of backbone and EECs to select a set of admissible (i.e., respecting the constraints) Pareto Optimal Solutions in terms of best tradeoff between the accuracy and number of MACs. The results show that the models designed by NACHOS are competitive with the state-of-the-art EENNs.

While many existing approaches are based on the idea of agents as imperfect reasoners, who must spend their resources to perform logical inference, this is not the only way to introduce resource constraints into logical settings. In this paper we study agents as perfect reasoners, who may purchase a new piece of information from a trustworthy source. For this purpose we propose dynamic epistemic logic for semi-public queries for resource-bounded agents. In this logic (groups of) agents can perform a query (ask a question) about whether some formula is true and receive a correct answer. These queries are called semi-public, because the very fact of the query is public, while the answer is private. We also assume that every query has a cost and every agent has a budget constraint. Finally, our framework allows us to reason about group queries, in which agents may share resources to obtain a new piece of information together. We demonstrate that our logic is complete, decidable and has an efficient model checking procedure. ",

We also formalize individual experience as additional causal knowledge that comes with and is used by an individual. Further, we define and discuss loaded attributes, which are attributes prone to evoke perception. Sensitive attributes, such as gender and race, are clear examples of loaded attributes. We define two kinds of causal perception, unfaithful and inconsistent, based on the causal properties of faithfulness and consistency. We illustrate our framework through a series of decision-making examples and discuss relevant fairness applications.

    "abstract": "The main objective of an Information Retrieval system is to provide a user with the most relevant documents to the user's query. To do this, modern IR systems typically deploy a re-ranking pipeline in which a set of documents is retrieved by a lightweight first-stage retrieval process and then re-ranked by a more effective but expensive model. However, the success of a re-ranking pipeline is heavily dependent on the performance of the first stage retrieval, since new documents are not usually identified during the re-ranking stage. Moreover, this can impact the amount of exposure that a particular group of documents, such as documents from a particular demographic group, can receive in the final ranking. For example, the fair allocation of exposure becomes more challenging or impossible if the first stage retrieval returns too few documents from certain groups, since the number of group documents in the ranking affects the exposure more than the documents' positions. With this in mind, it is beneficial to predict the amount of exposure that a group of documents is likely to receive in the results of the first stage retrieval process, in order to ensure that there are a sufficient number of documents included from each of the groups. In this paper, we introduce the novel task of query exposure prediction (QEP). Specifically, we propose the first approach for predicting the distribution of exposure that groups of documents will receive for a given query. Our new approach, called GEP, uses lexical information from individual groups of documents to estimate the exposure the groups will receive in a ranking. Our experiments on the TREC 2021 and 2022 Fair Ranking Track test collections show that our proposed GEP approach results in exposure predictions that are up to 40 % more accurate than the predictions of adapted existing query performance prediction and resource allocation approaches.

    "abstract": "In the rapidly advancing field of multi-agent systems, ensuring robustness in unfamiliar and adversarial settings is crucial. Notwithstanding their outstanding performance in familiar environments, these systems often falter in new situations due to overfitting during the training phase. This is especially pronounced in settings where both cooperative and competitive behaviours are present, encapsulating a dual nature of overfitting and generalisation challenges. To address this issue, we present Multi-Agent Diagnostics for Robustness via Illuminated Diversity (MADRID), a novel approach for generating diverse adversarial scenarios that expose strategic vulnerabilities in pre-trained multi-agent policies. Leveraging the concepts from open-ended learning, MADRID navigates the vast space of adversarial settings, employing a target policy's regret to gauge the vulnerabilities of these settings. We evaluate the effectiveness of MADRID on the 11vs11 version of Google Research Football, one of the most complex environments for multi-agent reinforcement learning. Specifically, we employ MADRID for generating a diverse array of adversarial settings for TiZero, the state-of-the-art approach which \"masters\" the game through 45 days of training on a large-scale distributed infrastructure. We expose key shortcomings in TiZero's tactical decision-making, underlining the crucial importance of rigorous evaluation in multi-agent systems. ",

    "abstract": "University rankings, despite facing criticism, continue to maintain their popularity. In the 2023 Scopus Ranking of Ukrainian Universities, certain institutions stood out due to their high h-index, despite modest publication and citation numbers. This phenomenon can be attributed to influential research topics or involvement in international collaborative research. However, these results may also be due to the authors' own efforts to increase the number of citations of their publications in order to improve their h-index. To investigate this, the publications from the top 30 universities in the ranking were analysed, revealing humpback rank-citation curves for two universities. These humpbacks indicate unusual trends in the citation data, especially considering the high percentage of self-citations and FWCI of analysed papers. While quantitative analysis has limitations, the combination of humped rank-citation curves, self-citations, FWCI, and previous research findings raises concerns about the possible causes of these anomalies in the citation data of the analysed universities. The method presented in this paper can aid ranking compilers and citation databases managers in identifying potential instances of citation data anomalies, emphasizing the importance of expert assessment for accurate conclusions.

Recently, deep learning has shown great potential in solving PDEs especially in learning solution operators. Inspired by Neumann series in Helmholtz equation, we design a novel network architecture in which U-Net is embedded inside to capture the multiscale feature. Extensive experiments show that the proposed NSNO significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art FNO with at least 60\\% lower relative $L^2$-error, especially in the large wavenumber case, and has 50\\% lower computational cost and less data requirement. Moreover, NSNO can be used as the surrogate model in inverse scattering problems. Numerical tests show that NSNO is able to give comparable results with traditional finite difference forward solver while the computational cost is reduced tremendously. ",

    "abstract": "Objective: To investigate GPT-3.5 in generating and coding medical documents with ICD-10 codes for data augmentation on low-resources labels. Materials and Methods: Employing GPT-3.5 we generated and coded 9,606 discharge summaries based on lists of ICD-10 code descriptions of patients with infrequent (generation) codes within the MIMIC-IV dataset. Combined with the baseline training set, this formed an augmented training set. Neural coding models were trained on baseline and augmented data and evaluated on a MIMIC-IV test set. We report micro- and macro-F1 scores on the full codeset, generation codes, and their families. Weak Hierarchical Confusion Matrices were employed to determine within-family and outside-of-family coding errors in the latter codesets. The coding performance of GPT-3.5 was evaluated both on prompt-guided self-generated data and real MIMIC-IV data. Clinical professionals evaluated the clinical acceptability of the generated documents. Results: Augmentation slightly hinders the overall performance of the models but improves performance for the generation candidate codes and their families, including one unseen in the baseline training data. Augmented models display lower out-of-family error rates. GPT-3.5 can identify ICD-10 codes by the prompted descriptions, but performs poorly on real data. Evaluators note the correctness of generated concepts while suffering in variety, supporting information, and narrative. Discussion and Conclusion: GPT-3.5 alone is unsuitable for ICD-10 coding. Augmentation positively affects generation code families but mainly benefits codes with existing examples. Augmentation reduces out-of-family errors. Discharge summaries generated by GPT-3.5 state prompted concepts correctly but lack variety, and authenticity in narratives. They are unsuitable for clinical practice. ",

To address thislimitation, we propose Delocate, a novel Deepfake detection model that can both recognize andlocalize unknown domain Deepfake videos. Ourmethod consists of two stages named recoveringand localization. In the recovering stage, the modelrandomly masks regions of interest (ROIs) and reconstructs real faces without tampering traces, resulting in a relatively good recovery effect for realfaces and a poor recovery effect for fake faces. Inthe localization stage, the output of the recoveryphase and the forgery ground truth mask serve assupervision to guide the forgery localization process. This process strategically emphasizes the recovery phase of fake faces with poor recovery, facilitating the localization of tampered regions. Ourextensive experiments on four widely used benchmark datasets demonstrate that Delocate not onlyexcels in localizing tampered areas but also enhances cross-domain detection performance. ",

    "abstract": "Without human annotations, a typical Unsupervised Video Anomaly Detection (UVAD) method needs to train two models that generate pseudo labels for each other. In previous work, the two models are closely entangled with each other, and it is not known how to upgrade their method without modifying their training framework significantly. Second, previous work usually adopts fixed thresholding to obtain pseudo labels, however the user-specified threshold is not reliable which inevitably introduces errors into the training process. To alleviate these two problems, we propose a novel interleaved framework that alternately trains a One-Class Classification (OCC) model and a Weakly-Supervised (WS) model for UVAD. The OCC or WS models in our method can be easily replaced with other OCC or WS models, which facilitates our method to upgrade with the most recent developments in both fields. For handling the fixed thresholding problem, we break through the conventional cognitive boundary and propose a weighted OCC model that can be trained on both normal and abnormal data. We also propose an adaptive mechanism for automatically finding the optimal threshold for the WS model in a loose to strict manner. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed UVAD method outperforms previous approaches. ",

    "abstract": "This work explores an emerging security threat against deep neural networks (DNNs) based image classification, i.e., backdoor attack. In this scenario, the attacker aims to inject a backdoor into the model by manipulating training data, such that the backdoor could be activated by a particular trigger and bootstraps the model to make a target prediction at inference. Currently, most existing data poisoning-based attacks struggle to achieve success at low poisoning ratios, increasing the risk of being defended by defense methods. In this paper, we propose a novel frequency-based backdoor attack via Wavelet Packet Decomposition (WPD), WPD decomposes the original image signal to a spectrogram that contains frequency information with different semantic meanings. We leverage WPD to statistically analyze the frequency distribution of the dataset to infer the key frequency regions the DNNs would focus on, and the trigger information is only injected into the key frequency regions. Our method mainly includes three parts: 1) the selection of the poisoning frequency regions in spectrogram; 2) trigger generation; 3) the generation of the poisoned dataset. Our method is stealthy and precise, evidenced by the 98.12% Attack Success Rate (ASR) on CIFAR-10 with the extremely low poisoning ratio 0.004% (i.e., only 2 poisoned samples among 50,000 training samples) and can bypass most existing defense methods. Besides, we also provide visualization analyses to explain why our method works. ",

To this end, we introduce a method for generating exhaustive and high-quality training data, which allows us to train compact (e.g., run on a mobile device), task-specific QA models that are competitive against GPT variants. The key technological enabler is a novel mechanism for automatic question-answer generation from procedural text which can ingest large amounts of textual instructions and produce exhaustive in-domain QA training data. While current QA data generation methods can produce well-formed and varied data, their non-exhaustive nature is sub-optimal for training a QA model. In contrast, we leverage the highly structured aspect of procedural text and represent each step and the overall flow of the procedure as graphs. We then condition on graph nodes to automatically generate QA pairs in an exhaustive and controllable manner. Comprehensive evaluations of our method show that: 1) small models trained with our data achieve excellent performance on the target QA task, even exceeding that of GPT3 and ChatGPT despite being several orders of magnitude smaller. 2) semantic coverage is the key indicator for downstream QA performance. Crucially, while large language models excel at syntactic diversity, this does not necessarily result in improvements on the end QA model. In contrast, the higher semantic coverage provided by our method is critical for QA performance. ",

We utilize custom text mining pipelines to mine semantic relations between elements of an expert-curated hierarchical model. We evaluate the KG structure and relation extraction using graph quality-control metrics and the comparison of algorithmic semantic-similarities to expert-defined ones. The results show that the relations in the KG are semantically comparable to those defined by domain experts, and that the proposed KG improves representing and linking the contexts of LOs through increasing graph communities and betweenness centrality.

These methods regularize the representation space by pulling similar sentence representations closer and pushing away the dissimilar ones and have been proven effective in various NLP tasks, e.g., semantic textual similarity (STS) tasks. However, it is challenging for these methods to learn fine-grained semantics as they only learn from the inter-sentence perspective, i.e., their supervision signal comes from the relationship between data samples. In this work, we propose a novel denoising objective that inherits from another perspective, i.e., the intra-sentence perspective. By introducing both discrete and continuous noise, we generate noisy sentences and then train our model to restore them to their original form. Our empirical evaluations demonstrate that this approach delivers competitive results on both semantic textual similarity (STS) and a wide range of transfer tasks, standing up well in comparison to contrastive-learning-based methods. Notably, the proposed intra-sentence denoising objective complements existing inter-sentence contrastive methodologies and can be integrated with them to further enhance performance.

    "abstract": "Cooperative driving is an emerging paradigm to enhance the safety and efficiency of autonomous vehicles. To ensure successful cooperation, road users must reach a consensus for making collective decisions, while recording vehicular data to analyze and address failures related to such agreements. This data has the potential to provide valuable insights into various vehicular events, while also potentially improving accountability measures. Furthermore, vehicles may benefit from the ability to negotiate and trade services among themselves, adding value to the cooperative driving framework. However, the majority of proposed systems aiming to ensure data security, consensus, or service trading, lack efficient and thoroughly validated mechanisms that consider the distinctive characteristics of vehicular networks. These limitations are amplified by a dependency on the centralized support provided by the infrastructure. Furthermore, corresponding mechanisms must diligently address security concerns, especially regarding potential malicious or misbehaving nodes, while also considering inherent constraints of the wireless medium. We introduce the Verifiable Event Extension (VEE), an applicational extension designed for Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) messages. The VEE operates seamlessly with any existing standardized vehicular communications protocol, addressing crucial aspects of data security, consensus, and trading with minimal overhead. To achieve this, we employ blockchain techniques, Byzantine fault tolerance (BFT) consensus protocols, and cryptocurrency-based mechanics. To assess our proposal's feasibility and lightweight nature, we employed a hardware-in-the-loop setup for analysis. Experimental results demonstrate the viability and efficiency of the VEE extension in overcoming the challenges posed by the distributed and opportunistic nature of wireless vehicular communications.

This approach leverages Graph-Informed Neural Networks (GINNs) and sparse grids to address discontinuity detection also in domains of dimension larger than 3. GINNs, trained to identify troubled points on sparse grids, exploit graph structures built on the grids to achieve efficient and accurate discontinuity detection performances. We also introduce a recursive algorithm for general sparse grid-based detectors, characterized by convergence properties and easy applicability. Numerical experiments on functions with dimensions n = 2 and n = 4 demonstrate the efficiency and robust generalization of GINNs in detecting discontinuity interfaces.

    "abstract": "The prevalent perspective in quantitative research on opinion dynamics flattens the landscape of the online political discourse into a traditional left--right dichotomy. While this approach helps simplify the analysis and modeling effort, it also neglects the intrinsic multidimensional richness of ideologies. In this study, we analyze social interactions on Reddit, under the lens of a multi-dimensional ideological framework: the political compass. We examine over 8 million comments posted on the subreddits /r/PoliticalCompass and /r/PoliticalCompassMemes during 2020--2022. By leveraging their self-declarations, we disentangle the ideological dimensions of users into economic (left--right) and social (libertarian--authoritarian) axes. In addition, we characterize users by their demographic attributes (age, gender, and affluence). We find significant homophily for interactions along the social axis of the political compass and demographic attributes. Compared to a null model, interactions among individuals of similar ideology surpass expectations by 6%. In contrast, we uncover a significant heterophily along the economic axis: left/right interactions exceed expectations by 10%. Furthermore, heterophilic interactions are characterized by a higher language toxicity than homophilic interactions, which hints at a conflictual discourse between every opposite ideology. Our results help reconcile apparent contradictions in recent literature, which found a superposition of homophilic and heterophilic interactions in online political discussions. By disentangling such interactions into the economic and social axes we pave the way for a deeper understanding of opinion dynamics on social media. ",

    "abstract": "Widespread adoption of AI for medical decision making is still hindered due to ethical and safety-related concerns. For AI-based decision support systems in healthcare settings it is paramount to be reliable and trustworthy. Common deep learning approaches, however, have the tendency towards overconfidence under data shift. Such inappropriate extrapolation beyond evidence-based scenarios may have dire consequences. This highlights the importance of reliable estimation of local uncertainty and its communication to the end user. While stochastic neural networks have been heralded as a potential solution to these issues, this study investigates their actual reliability in clinical applications. We centered our analysis on the exemplary use case of mortality prediction for ICU hospitalizations using EHR from MIMIC3 study. For predictions on the EHR time series, Encoder-Only Transformer models were employed. Stochasticity of model functions was achieved by incorporating common methods such as Bayesian neural network layers and model ensembles. Our models achieve state of the art performance in terms of discrimination performance (AUC ROC: 0.868+-0.011, AUC PR: 0.554+-0.034) and calibration on the mortality prediction benchmark. However, epistemic uncertainty is critically underestimated by the selected stochastic deep learning methods. A heuristic proof for the responsible collapse of the posterior distribution is provided. Our findings reveal the inadequacy of commonly used stochastic deep learning approaches to reliably recognize OoD samples. In both methods, unsubstantiated model confidence is not prevented due to strongly biased functional posteriors, rendering them inappropriate for reliable clinical decision support. This highlights the need for approaches with more strictly enforced or inherent distance-awareness to known data points, e.g., using kernel-based techniques. ",

    "abstract": "Single-Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) is widely applied for the diagnosis of coronary artery diseases. Low-dose (LD) SPECT aims to minimize radiation exposure but leads to increased image noise. Limited-view (LV) SPECT, such as the latest GE MyoSPECT ES system, enables accelerated scanning and reduces hardware expenses but degrades reconstruction accuracy. Additionally, Computed Tomography (CT) is commonly used to derive attenuation maps ($\\mu$-maps) for attenuation correction (AC) of cardiac SPECT, but it will introduce additional radiation exposure and SPECT-CT misalignments. Although various methods have been developed to solely focus on LD denoising, LV reconstruction, or CT-free AC in SPECT, the solution for simultaneously addressing these tasks remains challenging and under-explored. Furthermore, it is essential to explore the potential of fusing cross-domain and cross-modality information across these interrelated tasks to further enhance the accuracy of each task. Thus, we propose a Dual-Domain Coarse-to-Fine Progressive Network (DuDoCFNet), a multi-task learning method for simultaneous LD denoising, LV reconstruction, and CT-free $\\mu$-map generation of cardiac SPECT. Paired dual-domain networks in DuDoCFNet are cascaded using a multi-layer fusion mechanism for cross-domain and cross-modality feature fusion. Two-stage progressive learning strategies are applied in both projection and image domains to achieve coarse-to-fine estimations of SPECT projections and CT-derived $\\mu$-maps. Our experiments demonstrate DuDoCFNet's superior accuracy in estimating projections, generating $\\mu$-maps, and AC reconstructions compared to existing single- or multi-task learning methods, under various iterations and LD levels.

    "abstract": "This study presents a deep convolutional auto-encoder network for filtering reverberation artifacts, from transthoracic echocardiographic (TTE) image sequences. Given the spatiotemporal nature of these artifacts, the filtering network was built using 3D convolutional layers to suppress the clutter patterns throughout the cardiac cycle. The network was designed by taking advantage of: i) an attention mechanism to focus primarily on cluttered regions and ii) residual learning to preserve fine structures of the image frames. To train the deep network, a diverse set of artifact patterns was simulated and the simulated patterns were superimposed onto artifact-free ultra-realistic synthetic TTE sequences of six ultrasound vendors to generate input of the filtering network. The artifact-free sequences served as ground-truth. Performance of the filtering network was evaluated using unseen synthetic as well as in-vivo artifactual sequences. Satisfactory results obtained using the latter dataset confirmed the good generalization performance of the proposed network which was trained using the synthetic sequences and simulated artifact patterns. Suitability of the clutter-filtered sequences for further processing was assessed by computing segmental strain curves from them. The results showed that the large discrepancy between the strain profiles computed from the cluttered segments and their corresponding segments in the clutter-free images was significantly reduced after filtering the sequences using the proposed network. The trained deep network could process an artifactual TTE sequence in a fraction of a second and can be used for real-time clutter filtering. Moreover, it can improve the precision of the clinical indexes that are computed from the TTE sequences.

We represent each genome as pseudo-images and map them to a taxonomy-aware embedding space for reasoning and classification. This embedding space captures compositional and phylogenetic relationships of species, enabling predictions in extensive search spaces.

Colonoscopy is considered the best-performing procedure for CRC screening. To ease the examination, deep learning based methods for automatic polyp detection have been developed for conventional white-light imaging (WLI). Compared with WLI, narrow-band imaging (NBI) can improve polyp classification during colonoscopy but requires special equipment. We propose a CycleGAN-based framework to convert images captured with regular WLI to synthetic NBI (SNBI) as a pre-processing method for improving object detection on WLI when NBI is unavailable. This paper first shows that better results for polyp detection can be achieved on NBI compared to a relatively similar dataset of WLI. Secondly, experimental results demonstrate that our proposed modality translation can achieve improved polyp detection on SNBI images generated from WLI compared to the original WLI. This is because our WLI-to-SNBI translation model can enhance the observation of polyp surface patterns in the generated SNBI images. ",

    "abstract": "Despite the advancement in computational modeling towards brain tumor segmentation, of which several models have been developed, it is evident from the computational complexity of existing models which are still at an all-time high, that performance and efficiency under clinical application scenarios are limited. Therefore, this paper proposes a shallow encoder and decoder network named SEDNet for brain tumor segmentation. The proposed network is adapted from the U-Net structure. Though brain tumors do not assume complex structures like the task the traditional U-Net was designed for, their variance in appearance, shape, and ambiguity of boundaries makes it a compelling complex task to solve. SEDNet architecture design is inspired by the localized nature of brain tumors in brain images, thus consists of sufficient hierarchical convolutional blocks in the encoding pathway capable of learning the intrinsic features of brain tumors in brain slices, and a decoding pathway with selective skip path sufficient for capturing miniature local-level spatial features alongside the global-level features of brain tumor. SEDNet with the integration of the proposed preprocessing algorithm and optimization function on the BraTS2020 set reserved for testing achieves impressive dice and Hausdorff scores of 0.9308, 0.9451, 0.9026, and 0.7040, 1.2866, 0.7762 for non-enhancing tumor core (NTC), peritumoral edema (ED), and enhancing tumor (ET), respectively. Furthermore, through transfer learning with initialized SEDNet pre-trained weights, termed SEDNetX, a performance increase is observed.

They play significant roles in cardiomyocytes such as providing mechanical stability for the contracting sarcomere, cell signalling and autophagy. Changes in Z-disk architecture have been associated with impaired cardiac function. Hence, there is a strong need to create tools to segment Z-disks from microscopy images, that overcome traditional limitations such as variability in image brightness and staining technique. In this study, we apply deep learning based segmentation models to extract Z-disks in images of striated muscle tissue. We leverage a novel Airyscan confocal dataset, which comprises high resolution images of Z-disks of healthy heart tissue, stained with Affimers for specific Z-disk proteins. We employed an interactive labelling tool, Ilastik to obtain ground truth segmentation masks and use the resulting data set to train and evaluate the performance of several state-of-the-art segmentation networks. On the test set, UNet++ achieves best segmentation performance for Z-disks in cardiomyocytes, with an average Dice score of 0.91 and outperforms other established segmentation methods including UNet, FPN, DeepLabv3+ and pix2pix. However, pix2pix demonstrates improved generalisation, when tested on an additional dataset of cardiomyocytes with a titin mutation. This is the first study to demonstrate that automated machine learning-based segmentation approaches may be used effectively to segment Z-disks in confocal microscopy images. Automated segmentation approaches and predicted segmentation masks could be used to derive morphological features of Z-disks (e.g. width and orientation), and subsequently, to quantify disease-related changes to cardiac microstructure.

    "abstract": "Adversarial training is a widely used method to improve the robustness of deep neural networks (DNNs) over adversarial perturbations. However, it is empirically observed that adversarial training on over-parameterized networks often suffers from the \\textit{robust overfitting}: it can achieve almost zero adversarial training error while the robust generalization performance is not promising. In this paper, we provide a theoretical understanding of the question of whether overfitted DNNs in adversarial training can generalize from an approximation viewpoint. Specifically, our main results are summarized into three folds: i) For classification, we prove by construction the existence of infinitely many adversarial training classifiers on over-parameterized DNNs that obtain arbitrarily small adversarial training error (overfitting), whereas achieving good robust generalization error under certain conditions concerning the data quality, well separated, and perturbation level. ii) Linear over-parameterization (meaning that the number of parameters is only slightly larger than the sample size) is enough to ensure such existence if the target function is smooth enough. iii) For regression, our results demonstrate that there also exist infinitely many overfitted DNNs with linear over-parameterization in adversarial training that can achieve almost optimal rates of convergence for the standard generalization error. Overall, our analysis points out that robust overfitting can be avoided but the required model capacity will depend on the smoothness of the target function, while a robust generalization gap is inevitable. We hope our analysis will give a better understanding of the mathematical foundations of robustness in DNNs from an approximation view. ",
