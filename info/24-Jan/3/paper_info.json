Specifically, we develop an unsupervised clustering algorithm based on Matrix Product States (MPS) and apply it in the context of a real use-case of adversary-generated threat intelligence.

Our approach naturally facilitates the extraction of feature-wise probabilities, Von Neumann Entropy, and mutual information, offering a compelling narrative for classification of anomalies and fostering an unprecedented level of transparency and interpretability, something fundamental to understand the rationale behind artificial intelligence decisions.

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have proven powerful, but the risk of privacy leakage remains a significant concern. Traditional privacy-preserving methods, such as Differential Privacy and Homomorphic Encryption, are inadequate for black-box API-only settings, demanding either model transparency or heavy computational resources. We propose Prompt2Forget (P2F), the first framework designed to tackle the LLM local privacy challenge by teaching LLM to forget. The method involves decomposing full questions into smaller segments, generating fabricated answers, and obfuscating the model's memory of the original input. A benchmark dataset was crafted with questions containing privacy-sensitive information from diverse fields. P2F achieves zero-shot generalization, allowing adaptability across a wide range of use cases without manual adjustments. Experimental results indicate P2F's robust capability to obfuscate LLM's memory, attaining a forgetfulness score of around 90\\% without any utility loss. This represents an enhancement of up to 63\\% when contrasted with the naive direct instruction technique, highlighting P2F's efficacy in mitigating memory retention of sensitive information within LLMs. Our findings establish the first benchmark in the novel field of the LLM forgetting task, representing a meaningful advancement in privacy preservation in the emerging LLM domain.

First, it enhances 3D plane detection with concurrent appearance and geometry knowledge. Second, a lightweight plane fitting module is proposed to estimate plane parameters. Third, a novel global memory bank structure with an update mechanism is introduced, ensuring consistent cross-frame correspondence. The flexible architecture of PlanarNeRF allows it to function in both 2D-supervised and self-supervised solutions, in each of which it can effectively learn from sparse training signals, significantly improving training efficiency. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of PlanarNeRF in various scenarios and remarkable improvement over existing works. ",

In this study, we perform a Bayesian analysis of state-of-the-art self-supervised learning objectives, elucidating the underlying probabilistic graphical models in each class and presenting a standardized methodology for their derivation from first principles. The analysis also indicates a natural means of integrating self-supervised learning with likelihood-based generative models. We instantiate this concept within the realm of cluster-based self-supervised learning and energy models, introducing a novel lower bound which is proven to reliably penalize the most important failure modes. Furthermore, this newly proposed lower bound enables the training of a standard backbone architecture without the necessity for asymmetric elements such as stop gradients, momentum encoders, or specialized clustering layers - typically introduced to avoid learning trivial solutions. Our theoretical findings are substantiated through experiments on synthetic and real-world data, including SVHN, CIFAR10, and CIFAR100, thus showing that our objective function allows to outperform existing self-supervised learning strategies in terms of clustering, generation and out-of-distribution detection performance by a wide margin.

Recent advancements employ graph neural networks (GNNs) to utilize graph structures in brains, improving detection performances. Current methods use correlation measures between ROI's blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signals to generate the graph structure. Other methods use the training samples to learn the optimal graph structure through end-to-end learning. However, implementing those methods independently leads to some issues with noisy data for the correlation graphs and overfitting problems for the optimal graph. In this work, we proposed Bargrain (balanced graph structure for brains), which models two graph structures: filtered correlation matrix and optimal sample graph using graph convolution networks (GCNs). This approach aims to get advantages from both graphs and address the limitations of only relying on a single type of structure. Based on our extensive experiment, Bargrain outperforms state-of-the-art methods in classification tasks on brain disease datasets, as measured by average F1 scores. ",

    "abstract": "Self-supervised pre-training paradigms have been extensively explored in the field of skeleton-based action recognition. In particular, methods based on masked prediction have pushed the performance of pre-training to a new height. However, these methods take low-level features, such as raw joint coordinates or temporal motion, as prediction targets for the masked regions, which is suboptimal. In this paper, we show that using high-level contextualized features as prediction targets can achieve superior performance. Specifically, we propose Skeleton2vec, a simple and efficient self-supervised 3D action representation learning framework, which utilizes a transformer-based teacher encoder taking unmasked training samples as input to create latent contextualized representations as prediction targets. Benefiting from the self-attention mechanism, the latent representations generated by the teacher encoder can incorporate the global context of the entire training samples, leading to a richer training task. Additionally, considering the high temporal correlations in skeleton sequences, we propose a motion-aware tube masking strategy which divides the skeleton sequence into several tubes and performs persistent masking within each tube based on motion priors, thus forcing the model to build long-range spatio-temporal connections and focus on action-semantic richer regions. Extensive experiments on NTU-60, NTU-120, and PKU-MMD datasets demonstrate that our proposed Skeleton2vec outperforms previous methods and achieves state-of-the-art results. ",

    "abstract": "In standard hospital blood tests, the traditional process requires doctors to manually isolate leukocytes from microscopic images of patients' blood using microscopes. These isolated leukocytes are then categorized via automatic leukocyte classifiers to determine the proportion and volume of different types of leukocytes present in the blood samples, aiding disease diagnosis. This methodology is not only time-consuming and labor-intensive, but it also has a high propensity for errors due to factors such as image quality and environmental conditions, which could potentially lead to incorrect subsequent classifications and misdiagnosis. To address these issues, this paper proposes an innovative method of leukocyte detection: the Multi-level Feature Fusion and Deformable Self-attention DETR (MFDS-DETR). To tackle the issue of leukocyte scale disparity, we designed the High-level Screening-feature Fusion Pyramid (HS-FPN), enabling multi-level fusion. This model uses high-level features as weights to filter low-level feature information via a channel attention module and then merges the screened information with the high-level features, thus enhancing the model's feature expression capability. Further, we address the issue of leukocyte feature scarcity by incorporating a multi-scale deformable self-attention module in the encoder and using the self-attention and cross-deformable attention mechanisms in the decoder, which aids in the extraction of the global features of the leukocyte feature maps. The effectiveness, superiority, and generalizability of the proposed MFDS-DETR method are confirmed through comparisons with other cutting-edge leukocyte detection models using the private WBCDD, public LISC and BCCD datasets.

Since the advent of Transformers, SNNs have struggled to compete with artificial networks on modern sequential tasks, as they inherit limitations from recurrent neural networks (RNNs), with the added challenge of training with non-differentiable binary spiking activations. However, a recent renewed interest in efficient alternatives to Transformers has given rise to state-of-the-art recurrent architectures named state space models (SSMs). This work systematically investigates, for the first time, the intersection of state-of-the-art SSMs with SNNs for long-range sequence modelling. Results suggest that SSM-based SNNs can outperform the Transformer on all tasks of a well-established long-range sequence modelling benchmark. It is also shown that SSM-based SNNs can outperform current state-of-the-art SNNs with fewer parameters on sequential image classification. Finally, a novel feature mixing layer is introduced, improving SNN accuracy while challenging assumptions about the role of binary activations in SNNs. This work paves the way for deploying powerful SSM-based architectures, such as large language models, to neuromorphic hardware for energy-efficient long-range sequence modelling. ",

Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study on 72,072 adult non-traumatic ICU patients admitted to a high-volume US metropolitan academic hospital between 2016 and 2020. We developed a meta-learner and various machine learning models to serve as predictors, training them annually with four-year data and evaluating on the fifth, unseen year, iteratively over five years. Results: The experimental results revealed that the meta-model surpasses the other models in different development scenarios. It achieved notable performance metrics, including an Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (AUROC) curve of 0.97, an accuracy rate of 0.93, and an F1-score of 0.89 in the best scenario. Conclusion: This study pioneers the use of machine learning models for predicting blood transfusion needs in a diverse cohort of critically ill patients.

    "abstract": "Constrained multi-objective optimization problems (CMOPs) pervade real-world applications in science, engineering, and design. Constraint violation has been a building block in designing evolutionary multi-objective optimization algorithms for solving constrained multi-objective optimization problems. However, in certain scenarios, constraint functions might be unknown or inadequately defined, making constraint violation unattainable and potentially misleading for conventional constrained evolutionary multi-objective optimization algorithms. To address this issue, we present the first of its kind evolutionary optimization framework, inspired by the principles of the alternating direction method of multipliers that decouples objective and constraint functions. This framework tackles CMOPs with unknown constraints by reformulating the original problem into an additive form of two subproblems, each of which is allotted a dedicated evolutionary population. Notably, these two populations operate towards complementary evolutionary directions during their optimization processes. In order to minimize discrepancy, their evolutionary directions alternate, aiding the discovery of feasible solutions. Comparative experiments conducted against five state-of-the-art constrained evolutionary multi-objective optimization algorithms, on 120 benchmark test problem instances with varying properties, as well as two real-world engineering optimization problems, demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our proposed framework.

    "title": "3D Visibility-aware Generalizable Neural Radiance Fields for Interacting  Hands",
    "abstract": "Neural radiance fields (NeRFs) are promising 3D representations for scenes, objects, and humans. However, most existing methods require multi-view inputs and per-scene training, which limits their real-life applications. Moreover, current methods focus on single-subject cases, leaving scenes of interacting hands that involve severe inter-hand occlusions and challenging view variations remain unsolved. To tackle these issues, this paper proposes a generalizable visibility-aware NeRF (VA-NeRF) framework for interacting hands. Specifically, given an image of interacting hands as input, our VA-NeRF first obtains a mesh-based representation of hands and extracts their corresponding geometric and textural features. Subsequently, a feature fusion module that exploits the visibility of query points and mesh vertices is introduced to adaptively merge features of both hands, enabling the recovery of features in unseen areas. Additionally, our VA-NeRF is optimized together with a novel discriminator within an adversarial learning paradigm. In contrast to conventional discriminators that predict a single real/fake label for the synthesized image, the proposed discriminator generates a pixel-wise visibility map, providing fine-grained supervision for unseen areas and encouraging the VA-NeRF to improve the visual quality of synthesized images. Experiments on the Interhand2.6M dataset demonstrate that our proposed VA-NeRF outperforms conventional NeRFs significantly. Project Page: \\url{https://github.com/XuanHuang0/VANeRF}. ",

This greatly affects the detection accuracy of deep learning models. To overcome these problems, we concentrate on deep learning models for real-time detection of cars and tanks in an occluded environment with a cluttered background employing SSD and YOLO algorithms and improved precision of detection and reduce problems faced by these models. The developed method makes the custom dataset and employs a preprocessing technique to clean the noisy dataset. For training the developed model we apply the data augmentation technique to balance and diversify the data. We fine-tuned, trained, and evaluated these models on the established dataset by applying these techniques and highlighting the results we got more accurately than without applying these techniques. The accuracy and frame per second of the SSD-Mobilenet v2 model are higher than YOLO V3 and YOLO V4. Furthermore, by employing various techniques like data enhancement, noise reduction, parameter optimization, and model fusion we improve the effectiveness of detection and recognition. We further added a counting algorithm, and target attributes experimental comparison, and made a graphical user interface system for the developed model with features of object counting, alerts, status, resolution, and frame per second.

    "abstract": "Prompt injection attacks exploit vulnerabilities in large language models (LLMs) to manipulate the model into unintended actions or generate malicious content. As LLM integrated applications gain wider adoption, they face growing susceptibility to such attacks. This study introduces a novel evaluation framework for quantifying the resilience of applications. The framework incorporates innovative techniques designed to ensure representativeness, interpretability, and robustness. To ensure the representativeness of simulated attacks on the application, a meticulous selection process was employed, resulting in 115 carefully chosen attacks based on coverage and relevance. For enhanced interpretability, a second LLM was utilized to evaluate the responses generated from these simulated attacks. Unlike conventional malicious content classifiers that provide only a confidence score, the LLM-based evaluation produces a score accompanied by an explanation, thereby enhancing interpretability. Subsequently, a resilience score is computed by assigning higher weights to attacks with greater impact, thus providing a robust measurement of the application resilience. To assess the framework's efficacy, it was applied on two LLMs, namely Llama2 and ChatGLM. Results revealed that Llama2, the newer model exhibited higher resilience compared to ChatGLM. This finding substantiates the effectiveness of the framework, aligning with the prevailing notion that newer models tend to possess greater resilience. Moreover, the framework exhibited exceptional versatility, requiring only minimal adjustments to accommodate emerging attack techniques and classifications, thereby establishing itself as an effective and practical solution. Overall, the framework offers valuable insights that empower organizations to make well-informed decisions to fortify their applications against potential threats from prompt injection. ",

    "abstract": "The emergence of LLM (Large Language Model) integrated virtual assistants has brought about a rapid transformation in communication dynamics. During virtual assistant development, some developers prefer to leverage the system message, also known as an initial prompt or custom prompt, for preconditioning purposes. However, it is important to recognize that an excessive reliance on this functionality raises the risk of manipulation by malicious actors who can exploit it with carefully crafted prompts. Such malicious manipulation poses a significant threat, potentially compromising the accuracy and reliability of the virtual assistant's responses. Consequently, safeguarding the virtual assistants with detection and defense mechanisms becomes of paramount importance to ensure their safety and integrity. In this study, we explored three detection and defense mechanisms aimed at countering attacks that target the system message. These mechanisms include inserting a reference key, utilizing an LLM evaluator, and implementing a Self-Reminder. To showcase the efficacy of these mechanisms, they were tested against prominent attack techniques. Our findings demonstrate that the investigated mechanisms are capable of accurately identifying and counteracting the attacks. The effectiveness of these mechanisms underscores their potential in safeguarding the integrity and reliability of virtual assistants, reinforcing the importance of their implementation in real-world scenarios. By prioritizing the security of virtual assistants, organizations can maintain user trust, preserve the integrity of the application, and uphold the high standards expected in this era of transformative technologies.

    "abstract": "The size of deep learning models in artificial intelligence (AI) software is increasing rapidly, hindering the large-scale deployment on resource-restricted devices (e.g., smartphones). To mitigate this issue, AI software compression plays a crucial role, which aims to compress model size while keeping high performance. However, the intrinsic defects in a big model may be inherited by the compressed one. Such defects may be easily leveraged by adversaries, since a compressed model is usually deployed in a large number of devices without adequate protection. In this article, we aim to address the safe model compression problem from the perspective of safety-performance co-optimization. Specifically, inspired by the test-driven development (TDD) paradigm in software engineering, we propose a test-driven sparse training framework called SafeCompress. By simulating the attack mechanism as safety testing, SafeCompress can automatically compress a big model to a small one following the dynamic sparse training paradigm. Then, considering two kinds of representative and heterogeneous attack mechanisms, i.e., black-box membership inference attack and white-box membership inference attack, we develop two concrete instances called BMIA-SafeCompress and WMIA-SafeCompress. Further, we implement another instance called MMIA-SafeCompress by extending SafeCompress to defend against the occasion when adversaries conduct black-box and white-box membership inference attacks simultaneously. We conduct extensive experiments on five datasets for both computer vision and natural language processing tasks. The results show the effectiveness and generalizability of our framework. We also discuss how to adapt SafeCompress to other attacks besides membership inference attack, demonstrating the flexibility of SafeCompress. ",

The development of 6G must also be compliant with this goal. Unfortunately, developing a sustainable and net-zero emission systems to meet the users' fast growing demands on mobile services, especially smart services and applications, may be much more challenging than expected. Particularly, despite the energy efficiency improvement in both hardware and software designs, the overall energy consumption and carbon emission of mobile networks are still increasing at a tremendous speed. The growing penetration of resource-demanding AI algorithms and solutions further exacerbate this challenge. In this article, we identify the major emission sources and introduce an evaluation framework for analyzing the lifecycle of network AI implementations. A novel joint dynamic energy trading and task allocation optimization framework, called DETA, has been introduced to reduce the overall carbon emissions. We consider a federated edge intelligence-based network AI system as a case study to verify the effectiveness of our proposed solution. Experimental results based on a hardware prototype suggest that our proposed solution can reduce carbon emissions of network AI systems by up to 74.9%.

However, continual learning methods primarily rely on supervised annotations, while the application in UAD is limited due to the absence of supervision. Current UAD methods train separate models for different classes sequentially, leading to catastrophic forgetting and a heavy computational burden. To address this issue, we introduce a novel Unsupervised Continual Anomaly Detection framework called UCAD, which equips the UAD with continual learning capability through contrastively-learned prompts. In the proposed UCAD, we design a Continual Prompting Module (CPM) by utilizing a concise key-prompt-knowledge memory bank to guide task-invariant `anomaly' model predictions using task-specific `normal' knowledge. Moreover, Structure-based Contrastive Learning (SCL) is designed with the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to improve prompt learning and anomaly segmentation results. Specifically, by treating SAM's masks as structure, we draw features within the same mask closer and push others apart for general feature representations. We conduct comprehensive experiments and set the benchmark on unsupervised continual anomaly detection and segmentation, demonstrating that our method is significantly better than anomaly detection methods, even with rehearsal training.

    "abstract": "Programming problems can be solved in a multitude of functionally correct ways, but the quality of these solutions (e.g. readability, maintainability) can vary immensely. When code quality is poor, symptoms emerge in the form of 'code smells', which are specific negative characteristics (e.g. duplicate code) that can be resolved by applying refactoring patterns. Many undergraduate computing curricula train students on this software engineering practice, often doing so via exercises on unfamiliar instructor-provided code. Our observation, however, is that this makes it harder for novices to internalise refactoring as part of their own development practices. In this paper, we propose a new approach to teaching refactoring, in which students must first complete a programming exercise constrained to ensure they will produce a code smell. This simple intervention is based on the idea that learning refactoring is easier if students are familiar with the code (having built it), that it brings refactoring closer to their regular development practice, and that it presents a powerful opportunity to learn from a 'mistake'. We designed and conducted a study with 35 novice undergraduates in which they completed various refactoring exercises alternately taught using a traditional and our 'mistake-based' approach, finding that students were significantly more effective and confident at completing exercises using the latter.

Our experiments demonstrate that SSL significantly enhances the Transformer model's ability to learn representations, improving its robustness in artifact classification tasks. Among various SSL techniques, including masking, contrastive learning, and DINO (self-distillation with no labels)-contrastive learning exhibited the most stable and superior performance in small PPG datasets. Further, we delve into optimizing contrastive loss functions, which are crucial for contrastive SSL. Inspired by InfoNCE, we introduce a novel contrastive loss function that facilitates smoother training and better convergence, thereby enhancing performance in artifact classification. In summary, this study establishes the efficacy of SSL in leveraging unlabeled data, particularly in enhancing the capabilities of the Transformer model. This approach holds promise for broader applications in PICU environments, where annotated data is often limited. ",

Despite their advantages, utilizing deep learning for event-based vision encounters a significant obstacle due to the scarcity of annotated data caused by the relatively recent emergence of event-based cameras. To overcome this limitation, leveraging the knowledge available from annotated data obtained with conventional frame-based cameras presents an effective solution based on unsupervised domain adaptation. We propose a new algorithm tailored for adapting a deep neural network trained on annotated frame-based data to generalize well on event-based unannotated data. Our approach incorporates uncorrelated conditioning and self-supervised learning in an adversarial learning scheme to close the gap between the two source and target domains. By applying self-supervised learning, the algorithm learns to align the representations of event-based data with those from frame-based camera data, thereby facilitating knowledge transfer.Furthermore, the inclusion of uncorrelated conditioning ensures that the adapted model effectively distinguishes between event-based and conventional data, enhancing its ability to classify event-based images accurately.Through empirical experimentation and evaluation, we demonstrate that our algorithm surpasses existing approaches designed for the same purpose using two benchmarks. The superior performance of our solution is attributed to its ability to effectively utilize annotated data from frame-based cameras and transfer the acquired knowledge to the event-based vision domain.

    "abstract": "Pre-trained code models have recently achieved substantial improvements in many code intelligence tasks. These models are first pre-trained on large-scale unlabeled datasets in a task-agnostic manner using self-supervised learning, and then fine-tuned on labeled datasets in downstream tasks. However, the labeled datasets are usually limited in size (i.e., human intensive efforts), which may hinder the performance of pre-trained code models in specific tasks. To mitigate this, one possible solution is to leverage the large-scale unlabeled data in the tuning stage by pseudo-labeling. However, directly employing the pseudo-labeled data can bring a large amount of noise, i.e., incorrect labels, leading to suboptimal performance. How to effectively leverage the noisy pseudo-labeled data is a challenging yet under-explored problem.In this paper, we propose a novel approach named HINT to improve pre-trained code models with large-scale unlabeled datasets by better utilizing the pseudo-labeled data. HINT includes two main modules: HybrId pseudo-labeled data selection and Noise-tolerant Training. In the hybrid pseudo-data selection module, considering the robustness issue, apart from directly measuring the quality of pseudo labels through training loss, we further propose to employ a retrieval-based method to filter low-quality pseudo-labeled data. The noise-tolerant training module aims to further mitigate the influence of errors in pseudo labels by training the model with a noise-tolerant loss function and by regularizing the consistency of model predictions.The experimental results show that HINT can better leverage those unlabeled data in a task-specific way and provide complementary benefits for pre-trained models, e.g., improving the best baseline model by 15.33%, 16.50%, and 8.98% on code summarization, defect detection, and assertion generation, respectively.

    "abstract": "In robust optimization problems, the magnitude of perturbations is relatively small. Consequently, solutions within certain regions are less likely to represent the robust optima when perturbations are introduced. Hence, a more efficient search process would benefit from increased opportunities to explore promising regions where global optima or good local optima are situated. In this paper, we introduce a novel robust evolutionary algorithm named the dual-stage robust evolutionary algorithm (DREA) aimed at discovering robust solutions. DREA operates in two stages: the peak-detection stage and the robust solution-searching stage. The primary objective of the peak-detection stage is to identify peaks in the fitness landscape of the original optimization problem. Conversely, the robust solution-searching stage focuses on swiftly identifying the robust optimal solution using information obtained from the peaks discovered in the initial stage. These two stages collectively enable the proposed DREA to efficiently obtain the robust optimal solution for the optimization problem. This approach achieves a balance between solution optimality and robustness by separating the search processes for optimal and robust optimal solutions. Experimental results demonstrate that DREA significantly outperforms five state-of-the-art algorithms across 18 test problems characterized by diverse complexities. Moreover, when evaluated on higher-dimensional robust optimization problems (100-$D$ and 200-$D$), DREA also demonstrates superior performance compared to all five counterpart algorithms. ",

    "title": "Aircraft Landing Time Prediction with Deep Learning on Trajectory Images",
    "abstract": "Aircraft landing time (ALT) prediction is crucial for air traffic management, especially for arrival aircraft sequencing on the runway. In this study, a trajectory image-based deep learning method is proposed to predict ALTs for the aircraft entering the research airspace that covers the Terminal Maneuvering Area (TMA). Specifically, the trajectories of all airborne arrival aircraft within the temporal capture window are used to generate an image with the target aircraft trajectory labeled as red and all background aircraft trajectory labeled as blue. The trajectory images contain various information, including the aircraft position, speed, heading, relative distances, and arrival traffic flows. It enables us to use state-of-the-art deep convolution neural networks for ALT modeling. We also use real-time runway usage obtained from the trajectory data and the external information such as aircraft types and weather conditions as additional inputs. Moreover, a convolution neural network (CNN) based module is designed for automatic holding-related featurizing, which takes the trajectory images, the leading aircraft holding status, and their time and speed gap at the research airspace boundary as its inputs. Its output is further fed into the final end-to-end ALT prediction. The proposed ALT prediction approach is applied to Singapore Changi Airport (ICAO Code: WSSS) using one-month Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) data from November 1 to November 30, 2022. Experimental results show that by integrating the holding featurization, we can reduce the mean absolute error (MAE) from 82.23 seconds to 43.96 seconds, and achieve an average accuracy of 96.1\\%, with 79.4\\% of the predictions errors being less than 60 seconds.

While advancements in NLP models have led to extensive research into their backdoor vulnerabilities, the potential for these advancements to introduce new backdoor threats remains unexplored. This paper proposes Imperio, which harnesses the language understanding capabilities of NLP models to enrich backdoor attacks. Imperio provides a new model control experience. It empowers the adversary to control the victim model with arbitrary output through language-guided instructions. This is achieved using a language model to fuel a conditional trigger generator, with optimizations designed to extend its language understanding capabilities to backdoor instruction interpretation and execution. Our experiments across three datasets, five attacks, and nine defenses confirm Imperio's effectiveness. It can produce contextually adaptive triggers from text descriptions and control the victim model with desired outputs, even in scenarios not encountered during training. The attack maintains a high success rate across complex datasets without compromising the accuracy of clean inputs and also exhibits resilience against representative defenses.

    "abstract": "Hyperspectral anomaly detection (HAD) aims to localize pixel points whose spectral features differ from the background. HAD is essential in scenarios of unknown or camouflaged target features, such as water quality monitoring, crop growth monitoring and camouflaged target detection, where prior information of targets is difficult to obtain. Existing HAD methods aim to objectively detect and distinguish background and anomalous spectra, which can be achieved almost effortlessly by human perception. However, the underlying processes of human visual perception are thought to be quite complex. In this paper, we analyze hyperspectral image (HSI) features under human visual perception, and transfer the solution process of HAD to the more robust feature space for the first time. Specifically, we propose a small target aware detector (STAD), which introduces saliency maps to capture HSI features closer to human visual perception. STAD not only extracts more anomalous representations, but also reduces the impact of low-confidence regions through a proposed small target filter (STF). Furthermore, considering the possibility of HAD algorithms being applied to edge devices, we propose a full connected network to convolutional network knowledge distillation strategy. It can learn the spectral and spatial features of the HSI while lightening the network. We train the network on the HAD100 training set and validate the proposed method on the HAD100 test set. Our method provides a new solution space for HAD that is closer to human visual perception with high confidence. Sufficient experiments on real HSI with multiple method comparisons demonstrate the excellent performance and unique potential of the proposed method.

By exploiting the manifold hypothesis, various techniques for nonlinear dimension reduction have been developed to facilitate visualization, classification, clustering, and gaining key insights. Although existing manifold learning methods have achieved remarkable successes, they still suffer from extensive distortions incurred in the global structure, which hinders the understanding of underlying patterns. Scalability issues also limit their applicability for handling large-scale data. Here, we propose a scalable manifold learning (scML) method that can manipulate large-scale and high-dimensional data in an efficient manner. It starts by seeking a set of landmarks to construct the low-dimensional skeleton of the entire data and then incorporates the non-landmarks into the landmark space based on the constrained locally linear embedding (CLLE). We empirically validated the effectiveness of scML on synthetic datasets and real-world benchmarks of different types, and applied it to analyze the single-cell transcriptomics and detect anomalies in electrocardiogram (ECG) signals. scML scales well with increasing data sizes and exhibits promising performance in preserving the global structure. The experiments demonstrate notable robustness in embedding quality as the sample rate decreases. ",

To address this challenge, this paper introduces the CVGAN model, a novel framework capable of generating one-dimensional vibration signals in both horizontal and vertical directions, conditioned on historical vibration data and remaining useful life. In addition, we propose an autoregressive generation method that can iteratively utilize previously generated vibration information to guide the generation of current signals. The effectiveness of the CVGAN model is validated through experiments conducted on the PHM 2012 dataset. Our findings demonstrate that the CVGAN model, in terms of both MMD and FID metrics, outperforms many advanced methods in both autoregressive and non-autoregressive generation modes. Notably, training using the full lifecycle data generated by the CVGAN model significantly improves the performance of the predictive model. This result highlights the effectiveness of the data generated by CVGans in enhancing the predictive power of these models. ",

While previous works have explored image generation conditioned on scene graphs or layouts, our task is distinctive and important as it involves generating scene graphs themselves unconditionally from noise, enabling efficient and interpretable control for image generation. Our task is challenging, requiring the generation of plausible scene graphs with heterogeneous attributes for nodes (objects) and edges (relations among objects), including continuous object bounding boxes and discrete object and relation categories. We introduce a novel diffusion model, DiffuseSG, that jointly models the adjacency matrix along with heterogeneous node and edge attributes. We explore various types of encodings for the categorical data, relaxing it into a continuous space. With a graph transformer being the denoiser, DiffuseSG successively denoises the scene graph representation in a continuous space and discretizes the final representation to generate the clean scene graph. Additionally, we introduce an IoU regularization to enhance the empirical performance. Our model significantly outperforms existing methods in scene graph generation on the Visual Genome and COCO-Stuff datasets, both on standard and newly introduced metrics that better capture the problem complexity. Moreover, we demonstrate the additional benefits of our model in two downstream applications: 1) excelling in a series of scene graph completion tasks, and 2) improving scene graph detection models by using extra training samples generated from DiffuseSG.

Spiker+ presents a configurable multi-layer hardware SNN, a library of highly efficient neuron architectures, and a design framework, enabling the development of complex neural network accelerators with few lines of Python code. Spiker+ is tested on two benchmark datasets, the MNIST and the Spiking Heidelberg Digits (SHD). On the MNIST, it demonstrates competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art SNN accelerators. It outperforms them in terms of resource allocation, with a requirement of 7,612 logic cells and 18 Block RAMs (BRAMs), which makes it fit in very small FPGA, and power consumption, draining only 180mW for a complete inference on an input image. The latency is comparable to the ones observed in the state-of-the-art, with 780us/img. To the authors' knowledge, Spiker+ is the first SNN accelerator tested on the SHD. In this case, the accelerator requires 18,268 logic cells and 51 BRAM, with an overall power consumption of 430mW and a latency of 54 us for a complete inference on input data. This underscores the significance of Spiker+ in the hardware-accelerated SNN landscape, making it an excellent solution to deploy configurable and tunable SNN architectures in resource and power-constrained edge applications.

However, we still lack empirical evidence to support organizations in deciding whether their requirements are good enough or impede subsequent activities. Objective: We aim to contribute empirical evidence to the effect that requirements quality defects have on a software engineering activity that depends on this requirement. Method: We replicate a controlled experiment in which 25 participants from industry and university generate domain models from four natural language requirements containing different quality defects. We evaluate the resulting models using both frequentist and Bayesian data analysis. Results: Contrary to our expectations, our results show that the use of passive voice only has a minor impact on the resulting domain models. The use of ambiguous pronouns, however, shows a strong effect on various properties of the resulting domain models. Most notably, ambiguous pronouns lead to incorrect associations in domain models. Conclusion: Despite being equally advised against by literature and frequentist methods, the Bayesian data analysis shows that the two investigated quality defects have vastly different impacts on software engineering activities and, hence, deserve different levels of attention. Our employed method can be further utilized by researchers to improve reliable, detailed empirical evidence on requirements quality. ",

When decoding marker codes, perfect channel state information (CSI), i.e., insertion and deletion probabilities, are required to detect insertion and deletion errors. Sometimes, the perfect CSI is not easy to obtain or the accurate channel model is unknown. Therefore, it is deserved to develop detecting algorithms for marker code without the knowledge of perfect CSI. In this paper, we propose two CSI-agnostic detecting algorithms for marker code based on deep learning. The first one is a model-driven deep learning method, which deep unfolds the original iterative detecting algorithm of marker code. In this method, CSI become weights in neural networks and these weights can be learned from training data. The second one is a data-driven method which is an end-to-end system based on the deep bidirectional gated recurrent unit network. Simulation results show that error performances of the proposed methods are significantly better than that of the original detection algorithm with CSI uncertainty. Furthermore, the proposed data-driven method exhibits better error performances than other methods for unknown channel models. ",

For the case with unknown semantic source distribution, while only a set of the source samples is available, we propose a neural-network-based method by leveraging the generative networks to learn the semantic source distribution. Furthermore, for a special case where the semantic state is a deterministic function of the observation, we design a cascade neural network to estimate the SRDF. For the case with perfectly known semantic source distribution, we propose a general Blahut-Arimoto algorithm to effectively compute the SRDF.

These numerical features provide the input for all kinds of machine learning tasks on continuous optimization problems, ranging, i.a., from High-level Property Prediction to Automated Algorithm Selection and Automated Algorithm Configuration. Without ELA features, analyzing and understanding the characteristics of single-objective continuous optimization problems would be impossible. Yet, despite their undisputed usefulness, ELA features suffer from several drawbacks. These include, in particular, (1.) a strong correlation between multiple features, as well as (2.) its very limited applicability to multi-objective continuous optimization problems. As a remedy, recent works proposed deep learning-based approaches as alternatives to ELA. In these works, e.g., point-cloud transformers were used to characterize an optimization problem's fitness landscape. However, these approaches require a large amount of labeled training data. Within this work, we propose a hybrid approach, Deep-ELA, which combines (the benefits of) deep learning and ELA features. Specifically, we pre-trained four transformers on millions of randomly generated optimization problems to learn deep representations of the landscapes of continuous single- and multi-objective optimization problems. Our proposed framework can either be used out-of-the-box for analyzing single- and multi-objective continuous optimization problems, or subsequently fine-tuned to various tasks focussing on algorithm behavior and problem understanding.

This article explores various typical application scenarios of buffer-aided relaying in B5G/6G networks to emphasize the importance of incorporating BACN. Additionally, we delve into the crucial technical challenges in BACN, including stringent delay constraints, high reliability, imperfect channel state information (CSI), transmission security, and integrated network architecture. To address the challenges, we propose leveraging deep learning-based methods for the design and operation of B5G/6G networks with BACN, deviating from conventional buffer-aided relay selection approaches. In particular, we present two case studies to demonstrate the efficacy of centralized deep reinforcement learning (DRL) and decentralized DRL in buffer-aided non-terrestrial networks.

    "abstract": "Most of the approaches proposed so far to craft targeted adversarial examples against Deep Learning classifiers are highly suboptimal and typically rely on increasing the likelihood of the target class, thus implicitly focusing on one-hot encoding settings. In this paper, we propose a more general, theoretically sound, targeted attack that resorts to the minimization of a Jacobian-induced MAhalanobis distance (JMA) term, taking into account the effort (in the input space) required to move the latent space representation of the input sample in a given direction. The minimization is solved by exploiting the Wolfe duality theorem, reducing the problem to the solution of a Non-Negative Least Square (NNLS) problem. The proposed algorithm provides an optimal solution to a linearized version of the adversarial example problem originally introduced by Szegedy et al. \\cite{szegedy2013intriguing}. The experiments we carried out confirm the generality of the proposed attack which is proven to be effective under a wide variety of output encoding schemes. Noticeably, the JMA attack is also effective in a multi-label classification scenario, being capable to induce a targeted modification of up to half the labels in a complex multilabel classification scenario with 20 labels, a capability that is out of reach of all the attacks proposed so far. As a further advantage, the JMA attack usually requires very few iterations, thus resulting more efficient than existing methods. ",

Blockchain ensures that model parameters stored in the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) remain unaltered. A novel adaptive differential privacy addition algorithm is simultaneously applied to local and global models, preserving the privacy of local models and preventing a decrease in the security of the global model due to the presence of numerous local models in federated learning. Additionally, we introduce a new mix transactions mechanism to better protect the identity privacy of local training clients. Security analysis and experimental results demonstrate that PPBFL outperforms baseline methods in both model performance and security. ",

However, mainstream counting methods ignore precise individual localization and suffer from annotation noise because of counting from estimating density maps. Additionally, they also struggle with high-density images.To address these issues, we propose an end-to-end model called Fine-Grained Extraction Network (FGENet). Different from methods estimating density maps, FGENet directly learns the original coordinate points that represent the precise localization of individuals.This study designs a fusion module, named Fine-Grained Feature Pyramid(FGFP), that is used to fuse feature maps extracted by the backbone of FGENet. The fused features are then passed to both regression and classification heads, where the former provides predicted point coordinates for a given image, and the latter determines the confidence level for each predicted point being an individual. At the end, FGENet establishes correspondences between prediction points and ground truth points by employing the Hungarian algorithm. For training FGENet, we design a robust loss function, named Three-Task Combination (TTC), to mitigate the impact of annotation noise. Extensive experiments are conducted on four widely used crowd counting datasets. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of FGENet. Notably, our method achieves a remarkable improvement of 3.14 points in Mean Absolute Error (MAE) on the ShanghaiTech Part A dataset, showcasing its superiority over the existing state-of-the-art methods. Even more impressively, FGENet surpasses previous benchmarks on the UCF\\_CC\\_50 dataset with an astounding enhancement of 30.16 points in MAE. ",

A new approach has been proposed to address the issues of low accuracy, high false detection rates and computational cost of solder joint defect detection in surface mount technology of industrial scenarios. The proposed solution is a hybrid attention mechanism designed specifically for the solder joint defect detection algorithm to improve quality control in the manufacturing process by increasing the accuracy while reducing the computational cost.

In light of the issues above, we propose the problem of \\emph{Motif-aware Riemannian Graph Representation Learning}, seeking a numerically stable encoder to capture motif regularity in a diverse-curvature manifold without labels.

First, we propose a new type of Riemannian GCN (D-GCN), in which we construct a diverse-curvature manifold by a product layer with the diversified factor, and replace the exponential/logarithmic map by a stable kernel layer. Second, we introduce a motif-aware Riemannian generative-contrastive learning to capture motif regularity in the constructed manifold and learn motif-aware node representation without external labels.

This propagation leads to an exponential growth of a node's current representation at every propagation step, making it extremely challenging to capture valuable dependencies between long-distance nodes. To address this issue, we introduce Graph Elimination Networks (GENs), which employ a specific algorithm to eliminate redundancies during neighborhood propagation. We demonstrate that GENs can enhance nodes' perception of distant neighborhoods and extend the depth of network propagation.

Herein, inferring future interaction is of fundamental importance, and previous efforts are mainly focused on the dynamics in the classic zero-curvature Euclidean space. Despite the promising results achieved by previous methods, a range of significant issues still largely remains open: On the bipartite nature, is it appropriate to place user and item nodes in one identical space regardless of their inherent difference? On the network dynamics, instead of a fixed curvature space, will the representation spaces evolve when new interactions arrive continuously? On the learning paradigm, can we get rid of the label information costly to acquire? To address the aforementioned issues, we propose a novel Contrastive model for Sequential Interaction Network learning on Co-Evolving RiEmannian spaces, CSINCERE. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to introduce a couple of co-evolving representation spaces, rather than a single or static space, and propose a co-contrastive learning for the sequential interaction network. In CSINCERE, we formulate a Cross-Space Aggregation for message-passing across representation spaces of different Riemannian geometries, and design a Neural Curvature Estimator based on Ricci curvatures for modeling the space evolvement over time. Thereafter, we present a Reweighed Co-Contrast between the temporal views of the sequential network, so that the couple of Riemannian spaces interact with each other for the interaction prediction without labels.

Previous inquiries on the effectiveness of this intervention are inconclusive because 1) they consider only few deplatforming events; 2) they consider only overt engagement traces (e.g., likes and posts) but not passive engagement (e.g., views); 3) they do not consider all the potential places users impacted by the deplatforming event might migrate to. We address these limitations in a longitudinal, quasi-experimental study of 165 deplatforming events targeted at 101 influencers. We collect deplatforming events from Reddit posts and then manually curate the data, ensuring the correctness of a large dataset of deplatforming events. Then, we link these events to Google Trends and Wikipedia page views, platform-agnostic measures of online attention that capture the general public's interest in specific influencers. Through a difference-in-differences approach, we find that deplatforming reduces online attention toward influencers. After 12 months, we estimate that online attention toward deplatformed influencers is reduced by -63% (95% CI [-75%,-46%]) on Google and by -43% (95% CI [-57%,-24%]) on Wikipedia. Further, as we study over a hundred deplatforming events, we can analyze in which cases deplatforming is more or less impactful, revealing nuances about the intervention. Notably, we find that both permanent and temporary deplatforming reduce online attention toward influencers; Overall, this work contributes to the ongoing effort to map the effectiveness of content moderation interventions, driving platform governance away from speculation.

    "abstract": "Large scale analytics engines have become a core dependency for modern data-driven enterprises to derive business insights and drive actions. These engines support a large number of analytic jobs processing huge volumes of data on a daily basis, and workloads are often inundated with overlapping computations across multiple jobs. Reusing common computation is crucial for efficient cluster resource utilization and reducing job execution time. Detecting common computation is the first and key step for reducing this computational redundancy. However, detecting equivalence on large-scale analytics engines requires efficient and scalable solutions that are fully automated. In addition, to maximize computation reuse, equivalence needs to be detected at the semantic level instead of just the syntactic level (i.e., the ability to detect semantic equivalence of seemingly different-looking queries). Unfortunately, existing solutions fall short of satisfying these requirements. In this paper, we take a major step towards filling this gap by proposing GEqO, a portable and lightweight machine-learning-based framework for efficiently identifying semantically equivalent computations at scale. GEqO introduces two machine-learning-based filters that quickly prune out nonequivalent subexpressions and employs a semi-supervised learning feedback loop to iteratively improve its model with an intelligent sampling mechanism. Further, with its novel database-agnostic featurization method, GEqO can transfer the learning from one workload and database to another. Our extensive empirical evaluation shows that, on TPC-DS-like queries, GEqO yields significant performance gains-up to 200x faster than automated verifiers-and finds up to 2x more equivalences than optimizer and signature-based equivalence detection approaches.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we validate the performance of the a sensor fusion-based Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) spoofing attack detection framework for Autonomous Vehicles (AVs). To collect data, a vehicle equipped with a GNSS receiver, along with Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) is used. The detection framework incorporates two strategies: The first strategy involves comparing the predicted location shift, which is the distance traveled between two consecutive timestamps, with the inertial sensor-based location shift. For this purpose, data from low-cost in-vehicle inertial sensors such as the accelerometer and gyroscope sensor are fused and fed into a long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network. The second strategy employs a Random-Forest supervised machine learning model to detect and classify turns, distinguishing between left and right turns using the output from the steering angle sensor. In experiments, two types of spoofing attack models: turn-by-turn and wrong turn are simulated. These spoofing attacks are modeled as SQL injection attacks, where, upon successful implementation, the navigation system perceives injected spoofed location information as legitimate while being unable to detect legitimate GNSS signals. Importantly, the IMU data remains uncompromised throughout the spoofing attack. To test the effectiveness of the detection framework, experiments are conducted in Tuscaloosa, AL, mimicking urban road structures. The results demonstrate the framework's ability to detect various sophisticated GNSS spoofing attacks, even including slow position drifting attacks. Overall, the experimental results showcase the robustness and efficacy of the sensor fusion-based spoofing attack detection approach in safeguarding AVs against GNSS spoofing threats. ",

    "abstract": "The structure of a network has a major effect on dynamical processes on that network. Many studies of the interplay between network structure and dynamics have focused on models of phenomena such as disease spread, opinion formation and changes, coupled oscillators, and random walks. In parallel to these developments, there have been many studies of wave propagation and other spatially extended processes on networks. These latter studies consider metric networks, in which the edges are associated with real intervals. Metric networks give a mathematical framework to describe dynamical processes that include both temporal and spatial evolution of some quantity of interest -- such as the concentration of a diffusing substance or the amplitude of a wave -- by using edge-specific intervals that quantify distance information between nodes. Dynamical processes on metric networks often take the form of partial differential equations (PDEs). In this paper, we present a collection of techniques and paradigmatic linear PDEs that are useful to investigate the interplay between structure and dynamics in metric networks. We start by considering a time-independent Schr\\\"odinger equation. We then use both finite-difference and spectral approaches to study the Poisson, heat, and wave equations as paradigmatic examples of elliptic, parabolic, and hyperbolic PDE problems on metric networks. Our spectral approach is able to account for degenerate eigenmodes. In our numerical experiments, we consider metric networks with up to about $10^4$ nodes and about $10^4$ edges. A key contribution of our paper is to increase the accessibility of studying PDEs on metric networks.

    "title": "The role of direct sound spherical harmonics representation in  externalization using binaural reproduction",
    "abstract": "The importance of the information in the direct sound to human perception of spatial sound sources is an ongoing research topic. The classification between direct sound and diffuse or reverberant sound forms the basis of numerous studies in the field of spatial audio. In particular, parametric spatial audio representation methods use this classification and employ signal processing in order to enhance the audio quality at reproduction. However, current literature does not provide information concerning the impact of ideal direct sound representation on externalization, in the context of Ambisonics. This paper aims to assess the importance of the spatial information in the direct sound in the externalization of a sound field when using binaural reproduction. This is done in the spherical harmonics (SH) domain, where an ideal direct sound representation within an otherwise Ambisonics signal is simulated, and its perceived externalization is evaluated in a formal listening test. This investigation leads to the conclusion that externalization of a first order Ambisonics signal may be significantly improved by enhancing the direct sound component, up to a level similar to a third order Ambisonics signal.

    "title": "Enhancing Automatic Modulation Recognition through Robust Global Feature  Extraction",
    "abstract": "Automatic Modulation Recognition (AMR) plays a crucial role in wireless communication systems. Deep learning AMR strategies have achieved tremendous success in recent years. Modulated signals exhibit long temporal dependencies, and extracting global features is crucial in identifying modulation schemes. Traditionally, human experts analyze patterns in constellation diagrams to classify modulation schemes. Classical convolutional-based networks, due to their limited receptive fields, excel at extracting local features but struggle to capture global relationships. To address this limitation, we introduce a novel hybrid deep framework named TLDNN, which incorporates the architectures of the transformer and long short-term memory (LSTM). We utilize the self-attention mechanism of the transformer to model the global correlations in signal sequences while employing LSTM to enhance the capture of temporal dependencies. To mitigate the impact like RF fingerprint features and channel characteristics on model generalization, we propose data augmentation strategies known as segment substitution (SS) to enhance the model's robustness to modulation-related features. Experimental results on widely-used datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance and exhibits significant advantages in terms of complexity. Our proposed framework serves as a foundational backbone that can be extended to different datasets. We have verified the effectiveness of our augmentation approach in enhancing the generalization of the models, particularly in few-shot scenarios.

    "abstract": "This paper introduces HAAQI-Net, a non-intrusive deep learning model for music quality assessment tailored to hearing aid users. In contrast to traditional methods like the Hearing Aid Audio Quality Index (HAAQI), HAAQI-Net utilizes a Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BLSTM) with attention. It takes an assessed music sample and a hearing loss pattern as input, generating a predicted HAAQI score. The model employs the pre-trained Bidirectional Encoder representation from Audio Transformers (BEATs) for acoustic feature extraction. Comparing predicted scores with ground truth, HAAQI-Net achieves a Longitudinal Concordance Correlation (LCC) of 0.9257, Spearman's Rank Correlation Coefficient (SRCC) of 0.9394, and Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 0.0080. Notably, this high performance comes with a substantial reduction in inference time: from 62.52 seconds (by HAAQI) to 2.71 seconds (by HAAQI-Net), serving as an efficient music quality assessment model for hearing aid users.

    "abstract": "In recent years, privacy-preserving machine learning algorithms have attracted increasing attention because of their important applications in many scientific fields. However, in the literature, most privacy-preserving algorithms demand learning objectives to be strongly convex and Lipschitz smooth, which thus cannot cover a wide class of robust loss functions (e.g., quantile/least absolute loss). In this work, we aim to develop a fast privacy-preserving learning solution for a sparse robust regression problem. Our learning loss consists of a robust least absolute loss and an $\\ell_1$ sparse penalty term. To fast solve the non-smooth loss under a given privacy budget, we develop a Fast Robust And Privacy-Preserving Estimation (FRAPPE) algorithm for least absolute deviation regression. Our algorithm achieves a fast estimation by reformulating the sparse LAD problem as a penalized least square estimation problem and adopts a three-stage noise injection to guarantee the $(\\epsilon,\\delta)$-differential privacy. We show that our algorithm can achieve better privacy and statistical accuracy trade-off compared with the state-of-the-art privacy-preserving regression algorithms. In the end, we conduct experiments to verify the efficiency of our proposed FRAPPE algorithm. ",

    "abstract": "The quasi-optical propagation of millimeter-wave signals enables high-accuracy localization algorithms that employ geometric approaches or machine learning models. However, most algorithms require information on the indoor environment, may entail the collection of large training datasets, or bear an infeasible computational burden for commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) devices. In this work, we propose to use tiny neural networks (NNs) to learn the relationship between angle difference-of-arrival (ADoA) measurements and locations of a receiver in an indoor environment. To relieve training data collection efforts, we resort to a self-supervised approach by bootstrapping the training of our neural network through location estimates obtained from a state-of-the-art localization algorithm. We evaluate our scheme via mmWave measurements from indoor 60-GHz double-directional channel sounding. We process the measurements to yield dominant multipath components, use the corresponding angles to compute ADoA values, and finally obtain location fixes. Results show that the tiny NN achieves sub-meter errors in 74\\% of the cases, thus performing as good as or even better than the state-of-the-art algorithm, with significantly lower computational complexity.
