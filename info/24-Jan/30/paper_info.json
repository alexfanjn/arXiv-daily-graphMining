    "abstract": "Material or crystal property prediction using machine learning has grown popular in recent years as it provides a computationally efficient replacement to classical simulation methods. A crucial first step for any of these algorithms is the representation used for a periodic crystal. While similar objects like molecules and proteins have a finite number of atoms and their representation can be built based upon a finite point cloud interpretation, periodic crystals are unbounded in size, making their representation more challenging. In the present work, we adapt the Pointwise Distance Distribution (PDD), a continuous and generically complete isometry invariant for periodic point sets, as a representation for our learning algorithm. While the PDD is effective in distinguishing periodic point sets up to isometry, there is no consideration for the composition of the underlying material. We develop a transformer model with a modified self-attention mechanism that can utilize the PDD and incorporate compositional information via a spatial encoding method. This model is tested on the crystals of the Materials Project and Jarvis-DFT databases and shown to produce accuracy on par with state-of-the-art methods while being several times faster in both training and prediction time.

    "abstract": "Symbolic regression aims to derive interpretable symbolic expressions from data in order to better understand and interpret data. %which plays an important role in knowledge discovery and interpretable machine learning. In this study, a symbolic network called PruneSymNet is proposed for symbolic regression. This is a novel neural network whose activation function consists of common elementary functions and operators. The whole network is differentiable and can be trained by gradient descent method. Each subnetwork in the network corresponds to an expression, and our goal is to extract such subnetworks to get the desired symbolic expression. Therefore, a greedy pruning algorithm is proposed to prune the network into a subnetwork while ensuring the accuracy of data fitting. The proposed greedy pruning algorithm preserves the edge with the least loss in each pruning, but greedy algorithm often can not get the optimal solution. In order to alleviate this problem, we combine beam search during pruning to obtain multiple candidate expressions each time, and finally select the expression with the smallest loss as the final result. It was tested on the public data set and compared with the current popular algorithms. The results showed that the proposed algorithm had better accuracy. ",

In an online setting, however, the main challenge is to decide whether to ask for more annotations for each item to efficiently trade off cost (i.e., the number of annotations) for quality of the aggregated annotations. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for general complex annotation (such as bounding boxes and taxonomy paths), that works in an online crowdsourcing setting. We prove that the expected average similarity of a labeler is linear in their accuracy \\emph{conditional on the reported label}. This enables us to infer reported label accuracy in a broad range of scenarios. We conduct extensive evaluations on real-world crowdsourcing data from Meta and show the effectiveness of our proposed online algorithms in improving the cost-quality trade-off. ",

The historical spatial context of the agent provides a similarity signal for self-supervised contrastive learning. We present a unique approach, termed Environmental Spatial Similarity (ESS), that complements existing contrastive learning methods. Using images from simulated, photorealistic environments as an experimental setting, we demonstrate that ESS outperforms traditional instance discrimination approaches. Moreover, sampling additional data from the same environment substantially improves accuracy and provides new augmentations. ESS allows remarkable proficiency in room classification and spatial prediction tasks, especially in unfamiliar environments. This learning paradigm has the potential to enable rapid visual learning in agents operating in new environments with unique visual characteristics. Potentially transformative applications span from robotics to space exploration. Our proof of concept demonstrates improved efficiency over methods that rely on extensive, disconnected datasets. ",

Most existing results assume real-valued inputs and parameters as well as exact operations during the evaluation of neural networks. However, neural networks are typically executed on computers that can only represent a tiny subset of the reals and apply inexact operations. In this work, we analyze the expressive power of neural networks under a more realistic setup: when we use floating-point numbers and operations. Our first set of results assumes floating-point operations where the significand of a float is represented by finite bits but its exponent can take any integer value. Under this setup, we show that neural networks using a binary threshold unit or ReLU can memorize any finite input/output pairs and can approximate any continuous function within a small error. We also show similar results on memorization and universal approximation when floating-point operations use finite bits for both significand and exponent; these results are applicable to many popular floating-point formats such as those defined in the IEEE 754 standard (e.g., 32-bit single-precision format) and bfloat16.

Nevertheless, they typically demand extensive training data to acquire a generalizable representation map, which conflicts with scenarios of a few available samples, thereby limiting their performance. To overcome the limitation, we propose \\textbf{AnomalyLLM}, a knowledge distillation-based time series anomaly detection approach where the student network is trained to mimic the features of the large language model (LLM)-based teacher network that is pretrained on large-scale datasets. During the testing phase, anomalies are detected when the discrepancy between the features of the teacher and student networks is large. To circumvent the student network from learning the teacher network's feature of anomalous samples, we devise two key strategies. 1) Prototypical signals are incorporated into the student network to consolidate the normal feature extraction. 2) We use synthetic anomalies to enlarge the representation gap between the two networks. AnomalyLLM demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on 15 datasets, improving accuracy by at least 14.5\\% in the UCR dataset. ",

These include both communication and sensing attacks, which potentially jeopardize not only individual vehicles but also overall traffic safety and efficiency. While much research has focused on communication attacks, sensing attacks, which are equally critical, have garnered less attention. To address this gap, this study offers a comprehensive review of potential sensing attacks and their impact on target vehicles, focusing on commonly deployed sensors in CAVs such as cameras, LiDAR, Radar, ultrasonic sensors, and GPS. Based on this review, we discuss the feasibility of integrating hardware-in-the-loop experiments with microscopic traffic simulations. We also design baseline scenarios to analyze the macro-level impact of sensing attacks on traffic flow. This study aims to bridge the research gap between individual vehicle sensing attacks and broader macroscopic impacts, thereby laying the foundation for future systemic understanding and mitigation.

    "abstract": "Graphs are widely used to model relational data. As graphs are getting larger and larger in real-world scenarios, there is a trend to store and compute subgraphs in multiple local systems. For example, recently proposed \\emph{subgraph federated learning} methods train Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) distributively on local subgraphs and aggregate GNN parameters with a central server. However, existing methods have the following limitations: (1) The links between local subgraphs are missing in subgraph federated learning. This could severely damage the performance of GNNs that follow message-passing paradigms to update node/edge features. (2) Most existing methods overlook the subgraph heterogeneity issue, brought by subgraphs being from different parts of the whole graph. To address the aforementioned challenges, we propose a scalable \\textbf{Fed}erated \\textbf{G}raph \\textbf{T}ransformer (\\textbf{FedGT}) in the paper. Firstly, we design a hybrid attention scheme to reduce the complexity of the Graph Transformer to linear while ensuring a global receptive field with theoretical bounds. Specifically, each node attends to the sampled local neighbors and a set of curated global nodes to learn both local and global information and be robust to missing links. The global nodes are dynamically updated during training with an online clustering algorithm to capture the data distribution of the corresponding local subgraph. Secondly, FedGT computes clients' similarity based on the aligned global nodes with optimal transport. The similarity is then used to perform weighted averaging for personalized aggregation, which well addresses the data heterogeneity problem. Moreover, local differential privacy is applied to further protect the privacy of clients. Finally, extensive experimental results on 6 datasets and 2 subgraph settings demonstrate the superiority of FedGT. ",

    "abstract": "Query optimizers in relational database management systems (RDBMSs) search for execution plans expected to be optimal for a given queries. They use parameter estimates, often inaccurate, and make assumptions that may not hold in practice. Consequently, they may select execution plans that are suboptimal at runtime, when these estimates and assumptions are not valid, which may result in poor query performance. Therefore, query optimizers do not sufficiently support robust query optimization. Recent years have seen a surge of interest in using machine learning (ML) to improve efficiency of data systems and reduce their maintenance overheads, with promising results obtained in the area of query optimization in particular. In this paper, inspired by these advancements, and based on several years of experience of IBM Db2 in this journey, we propose Robust Optimization of Queries, (Roq), a holistic framework that enables robust query optimization based on a risk-aware learning approach. Roq includes a novel formalization of the notion of robustness in the context of query optimization and a principled approach for its quantification and measurement based on approximate probabilistic ML. It also includes novel strategies and algorithms for query plan evaluation and selection. Roq also includes a novel learned cost model that is designed to predict query execution cost and the associated risks and performs query optimization accordingly. We demonstrate experimentally that Roq provides significant improvements to robust query optimization compared to the state-of-the-art. ",

We refer to these design principles as User-Centered Data Sharing (UCDS). To evaluate our UCDS principles, we implemented a mobile application representing one possible instance of these improved data collection techniques and evaluated the viability of using the app to collect WhatsApp chat data. Second, we surveyed WhatsApp users to gather user perceptions on common existing WhatsApp data collection methods as well as UCDS methods. Our results show that we were able to glean similar informative insights into WhatsApp chats using UCDS principles in our prototype app to common, less privacy-preserving methods. Our survey showed that methods following the UCDS principles are preferred by users because they offered users more control over the data collection process. Future user studies could further expand upon UCDS principles to overcome complications of researcher-to-group communication in research on WhatsApp chats and evaluate these principles in other data sharing contexts.

Existing models for determining modifiers of clinical entities involve regular expression or features weights that are trained independently for each modifier.

We evaluate the effectiveness of our multi-task learning approach versus previously published systems and assess the feasibility of transfer learning for clinical entity modifiers when only a portion of clinical modifiers are shared. Results: Our approach achieved state-of-the-art results on the ShARe corpus from SemEval 2015 Task 14, showing an increase of 1.1% on weighted accuracy, 1.7% on unweighted accuracy, and 10% on micro F1 scores.

To protect the Intellectual Property (IP) of the original owners over such DNN models, backdoor-based watermarks have been extensively studied. However, most of such watermarks fail upon model extraction attack, which utilizes input samples to query the target model and obtains the corresponding outputs, thus training a substitute model using such input-output pairs. In this paper, we propose a novel watermark to protect IP of DNN models against model extraction, named MEA-Defender. In particular, we obtain the watermark by combining two samples from two source classes in the input domain and design a watermark loss function that makes the output domain of the watermark within that of the main task samples. Since both the input domain and the output domain of our watermark are indispensable parts of those of the main task samples, the watermark will be extracted into the stolen model along with the main task during model extraction. We conduct extensive experiments on four model extraction attacks, using five datasets and six models trained based on supervised learning and self-supervised learning algorithms. The experimental results demonstrate that MEA-Defender is highly robust against different model extraction attacks, and various watermark removal/detection approaches. ",

    "abstract": "Pre-training is known to generate universal representations for downstream tasks in large-scale deep learning such as large language models. Existing literature, e.g., \\cite{kim2020adversarial}, empirically observe that the downstream tasks can inherit the adversarial robustness of the pre-trained model. We provide theoretical justifications for this robustness inheritance phenomenon. Our theoretical results reveal that feature purification plays an important role in connecting the adversarial robustness of the pre-trained model and the downstream tasks in two-layer neural networks. Specifically, we show that (i) with adversarial training, each hidden node tends to pick only one (or a few) feature; (ii) without adversarial training, the hidden nodes can be vulnerable to attacks. This observation is valid for both supervised pre-training and contrastive learning. With purified nodes, it turns out that clean training is enough to achieve adversarial robustness in downstream tasks. ",

    "title": "SAM-based instance segmentation models for the automation of masonry  crack detection",
    "abstract": "Automating visual inspection for capturing defects based on civil structures appearance is crucial due to its currently labour-intensive and time-consuming nature. An important aspect of automated inspection is image acquisition, which is rapid and cost-effective considering the pervasive developments in both software and hardware computing in recent years. Previous studies largely focused on concrete and asphalt, with less attention to masonry cracks. The latter also lacks publicly available datasets. In this paper, we first present a corresponding data set for instance segmentation with 1,300 annotated images (640 pixels x 640 pixels), named as MCrack1300, covering bricks, broken bricks, and cracks. We then test several leading algorithms for benchmarking, including the latest large-scale model, the prompt-based Segment Anything Model (SAM). We fine-tune the encoder using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and proposed two novel methods for automation of SAM execution. The first method involves abandoning the prompt encoder and connecting the SAM encoder to other decoders, while the second method introduces a learnable self-generating prompter. In order to ensure the seamless integration of the two proposed methods with SAM encoder section, we redesign the feature extractor. Both proposed methods exceed state-of-the-art performance, surpassing the best benchmark by approximately 3% for all classes and around 6% for cracks specifically. Based on successful detection, we propose a method based on a monocular camera and the Hough Line Transform to automatically transform images into orthographic projection maps. By incorporating known real sizes of brick units, we accurately estimate crack dimensions, with the results differing by less than 10% from those obtained by laser scanning. Overall, we address important research gaps in automated masonry crack detection and size estimation. ",

    "abstract": "Federated reinforcement learning (FRL) has emerged as a promising paradigm for reducing the sample complexity of reinforcement learning tasks by exploiting information from different agents. However, when each agent interacts with a potentially different environment, little to nothing is known theoretically about the non-asymptotic performance of FRL algorithms. The lack of such results can be attributed to various technical challenges and their intricate interplay: Markovian sampling, linear function approximation, multiple local updates to save communication, heterogeneity in the reward functions and transition kernels of the agents' MDPs, and continuous state-action spaces. Moreover, in the on-policy setting, the behavior policies vary with time, further complicating the analysis. In response, we introduce FedSARSA, a novel federated on-policy reinforcement learning scheme, equipped with linear function approximation, to address these challenges and provide a comprehensive finite-time error analysis. Notably, we establish that FedSARSA converges to a policy that is near-optimal for all agents, with the extent of near-optimality proportional to the level of heterogeneity. Furthermore, we prove that FedSARSA leverages agent collaboration to enable linear speedups as the number of agents increases, which holds for both fixed and adaptive step-size configurations. ",

These transparent glasses share the visual appearance of both transmitted arbitrary background scenes and reflected objects, thus having no fixed patterns.Recent visual foundation models, which are trained on vast amounts of data, have manifested stunning performance in terms of image perception and image generation. To segment glass surfaces with higher accuracy, we make full use of two visual foundation models: Segment Anything (SAM) and Stable Diffusion.Specifically, we devise a simple glass surface segmentor named GEM, which only consists of a SAM backbone, a simple feature pyramid, a discerning query selection module, and a mask decoder. The discerning query selection can adaptively identify glass surface features, assigning them as initialized queries in the mask decoder. We also propose a Synthetic but photorealistic large-scale Glass Surface Detection dataset dubbed S-GSD via diffusion model with four different scales, which contain 1x, 5x, 10x, and 20x of the original real data size. This dataset is a feasible source for transfer learning. The scale of synthetic data has positive impacts on transfer learning, while the improvement will gradually saturate as the amount of data increases.

While backdoor attacks have been extensively studied in a body of works, most of them were focused on single-trigger attacks that poison a dataset using a single type of trigger. Arguably, real-world backdoor attacks can be much more complex, e.g., the existence of multiple adversaries for the same dataset if it is of high value. In this work, we investigate the practical threat of backdoor attacks under the setting of \\textbf{multi-trigger attacks} where multiple adversaries leverage different types of triggers to poison the same dataset. By proposing and investigating three types of multi-trigger attacks, including parallel, sequential, and hybrid attacks, we provide a set of important understandings of the coexisting, overwriting, and cross-activating effects between different triggers on the same dataset. Moreover, we show that single-trigger attacks tend to cause overly optimistic views of the security of current defense techniques, as all examined defense methods struggle to defend against multi-trigger attacks. Finally, we create a multi-trigger backdoor poisoning dataset to help future evaluation of backdoor attacks and defenses. Although our work is purely empirical, we hope it can help steer backdoor research toward more realistic settings. ",

If odometry data of a target robot is not directly transmitted but estimated by the ego-robot then there must be both range and bearing measurements to guarantee the observability of relative pose estimation. For ROS/Gazebo simulations, we consider four different sensing and communication structures in which extended Kalman filtering (EKF) and pose graph optimization (PGO) estimation with different robust loss functions (filtering and smoothing with different batch sizes of sliding window) are compared in terms of estimation accuracy.

To achieve this, we propose an online learning-based behavior prediction model and an efficient planner for Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs). We develop a learning-based prediction model, enhanced with a recurrent neural memory network, to dynamically update latent belief states and infer the intentions of other agents. The model can also integrate the ego vehicle's intentions to reflect closed-loop interactions among agents, and it learns from both offline data and online interactions. For planning, we employ an option-based Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) planner, which reduces computational complexity by searching over action sequences. Inside the MCTS planner, we use predicted long-term multi-modal trajectories to approximate future updates, which eliminates iterative belief updating and improves the running efficiency. Our approach also incorporates deep Q-learning (DQN) as a search prior, which significantly improves the performance of the MCTS planner. Experimental results from simulated environments validate the effectiveness of our proposed method. The online belief update model can significantly enhance the accuracy and temporal consistency of predictions, leading to improved decision-making performance. Employing DQN as a search prior in the MCTS planner considerably boosts its performance and outperforms an imitation learning-based prior. Additionally, we show that the option-based MCTS substantially outperforms the vanilla method in terms of performance and efficiency. ",

Motivated by the fact that humans could leverage the bottom-up positional clues to locate objects in 3D space from a single image, in this paper, we explore the position modeling from the image feature column and propose a new method named You Only Look Bottum-Up (YOLOBU). Specifically, our YOLOBU leverages Column-based Cross Attention to determine how much a pixel contributes to pixels above it. Next, the Row-based Reverse Cumulative Sum (RRCS) is introduced to build the connections of pixels in the bottom-up direction.

    "abstract": "The emergence of novel the dummy data injection attack (DDIA) poses a severe threat to the secure and stable operation of power systems. These attacks are particularly perilous due to the minimal Euclidean spatial separation between the injected malicious data and legitimate data, rendering their precise detection challenging using conventional distance-based methods. Furthermore, existing research predominantly focuses on various machine learning techniques, often analyzing the temporal data sequences post-attack or relying solely on Euclidean spatial characteristics. Unfortunately, this approach tends to overlook the inherent topological correlations within the non-Euclidean spatial attributes of power grid data, consequently leading to diminished accuracy in attack localization. To address this issue, this study takes a comprehensive approach. Initially, it examines the underlying principles of these new DDIAs on power systems. Here, an intricate mathematical model of the DDIA is designed, accounting for incomplete topological knowledge and alternating current (AC) state estimation from an attacker's perspective. Subsequently, by integrating a priori knowledge of grid topology and considering the temporal correlations within measurement data and the topology-dependent attributes of the power grid, this study introduces temporal and spatial attention matrices. These matrices adaptively capture the spatio-temporal correlations within the attacks. Leveraging gated stacked causal convolution and graph wavelet sparse convolution, the study jointly extracts spatio-temporal DDIA features. Finally, the research proposes a DDIA localization method based on spatio-temporal graph neural networks. The accuracy and effectiveness of the DDIA model are rigorously demonstrated through comprehensive analytical cases. ",

However, in real-world scenarios, a professional judge not only needs to assimilate the law case experience that thrives on past sentenced legal judgments but also depends on the professional legal grounded reasoning that learned from professional legal knowledge. In this paper, we propose a LegalDuet model, which pretrains language models to learn a tailored embedding space for making legal judgments. It proposes a dual-view legal clue reasoning mechanism, which derives from two reasoning chains of judges: 1) Law Case Reasoning, which makes legal judgments according to the judgment experiences learned from analogy/confusing legal cases; 2) Legal Ground Reasoning, which lies in matching the legal clues between criminal cases and legal decisions. Our experiments show that LegalDuet achieves state-of-the-art performance on the CAIL2018 dataset and outperforms baselines with about 4% improvements on average. Our dual-view reasoning based pretraining can capture critical legal clues to learn a tailored embedding space to distinguish criminal cases. It reduces LegalDuet's uncertainty during prediction and brings pretraining advances to the confusing/low frequent charges. All codes are available at https://github.com/NEUIR/LegalDuet. ",

    "abstract": "In the last decade, the sound quality of electric induction motors is a hot topic in the research field. Specially, due to its high number of applications, the population is exposed to physical and psychological discomfort caused by the noise emission. Therefore, it is necessary to minimise its psychological impact on the population. In this way, the main goal of this work is to evaluate the use of multitask artificial neural networks as a modelling technique for simultaneously predicting psychoacoustic parameters of induction motors. Several inputs are used, such as, the electrical magnitudes of the motor power signal and the number of poles, instead of separating the noise of the electric motor from the environmental noise. Two different kind of artificial neural networks are proposed to evaluate the acoustic quality of induction motors, by using the equivalent sound pressure, the loudness, the roughness and the sharpness as outputs. Concretely, two different topologies have been considered: simple models and more complex models. The former are more interpretable, while the later lead to higher accuracy at the cost of hiding the cause-effect relationship. Focusing on the simple interpretable models, product unit neural networks achieved the best results: for MSE and for SEP. The main benefit of this product unit model is its simplicity, since only 10 inputs variables are used, outlining the effective transfer mechanism of multitask artificial neural networks to extract common features of multiple tasks. Finally, a deep analysis of the acoustic quality of induction motors in done using the best product unit neural networks. ",

    "title": "Open-RadVLAD: Fast and Robust Radar Place Recognition",
    "abstract": "Radar place recognition often involves encoding a live scan as a vector and matching this vector to a database in order to recognise that the vehicle is in a location that it has visited before. Radar is inherently robust to lighting or weather conditions, but place recognition with this sensor is still affected by: (1) viewpoint variation, i.e. translation and rotation, (2) sensor artefacts or \"noises\". For 360-degree scanning radar, rotation is readily dealt with by in some way aggregating across azimuths. Also, we argue in this work that it is more critical to deal with the richness of representation and sensor noises than it is to deal with translational invariance - particularly in urban driving where vehicles predominantly follow the same lane when repeating a route. In our method, for computational efficiency, we use only the polar representation. For partial translation invariance and robustness to signal noise, we use only a one-dimensional Fourier Transform along radial returns. We also achieve rotational invariance and a very discriminative descriptor space by building a vector of locally aggregated descriptors. Our method is more comprehensively tested than all prior radar place recognition work - over an exhaustive combination of all 870 pairs of trajectories from 30 Oxford Radar RobotCar Dataset sequences (each approximately 10 km). Code and detailed results are provided at github.com/mttgdd/open-radvlad, as an open implementation and benchmark for future work in this area. We achieve a median of 91.52% in Recall@1, outstripping the 69.55% for the only other open implementation, RaPlace, and at a fraction of its computational cost (relying on fewer integral transforms e.g. Radon, Fourier, and inverse Fourier).

    "abstract": "Large models, encompassing large language and diffusion models, have shown exceptional promise in approximating human-level intelligence, garnering significant interest from both academic and industrial spheres. However, the training of these large models necessitates vast quantities of high-quality data, and with continuous updates to these models, the existing reservoir of high-quality data may soon be depleted. This challenge has catalyzed a surge in research focused on data augmentation methods. Leveraging large models, these data augmentation techniques have outperformed traditional approaches. This paper offers an exhaustive review of large model-driven data augmentation methods, adopting a comprehensive perspective. We begin by establishing a classification of relevant studies into three main categories: image augmentation, text augmentation, and paired data augmentation. Following this, we delve into various data post-processing techniques pertinent to large model-based data augmentation. Our discussion then expands to encompass the array of applications for these data augmentation methods within natural language processing, computer vision, and audio signal processing. We proceed to evaluate the successes and limitations of large model-based data augmentation across different scenarios. Concluding our review, we highlight prospective challenges and avenues for future exploration in the field of data augmentation. Our objective is to furnish researchers with critical insights, ultimately contributing to the advancement of more sophisticated large models.

    "abstract": "The advances of deep learning (DL) have paved the way for automatic software vulnerability repair approaches, which effectively learn the mapping from the vulnerable code to the fixed code. Nevertheless, existing DL-based vulnerability repair methods face notable limitations: 1) they struggle to handle lengthy vulnerable code, 2) they treat code as natural language texts, neglecting its inherent structure, and 3) they do not tap into the valuable expert knowledge present in the expert system. To address this, we propose VulMaster, a Transformer-based neural network model that excels at generating vulnerability repairs by comprehensively understanding the entire vulnerable code, irrespective of its length. This model also integrates diverse information, encompassing vulnerable code structures and expert knowledge from the CWE system. We evaluated VulMaster on a real-world C/C++ vulnerability repair dataset comprising 1,754 projects with 5,800 vulnerable functions. The experimental results demonstrated that VulMaster exhibits substantial improvements compared to the learning-based state-of-the-art vulnerability repair approach. Specifically, VulMaster improves the EM, BLEU, and CodeBLEU scores from 10.2\\% to 20.0\\%, 21.3\\% to 29.3\\%, and 32.5\\% to 40.9\\%, respectively. ",

Fortunately, popular search engines have the means to crawl, capture, and surface social media data on their Search Engine Results Pages (SERP) if provided the proper search query, and may provide a solution to this dilemma. In the present work we ask: does SERP provide a complete and unbiased sample of social media data? Is SERP a viable alternative to direct API-access? To answer these questions, we perform a comparative analysis between (Google) SERP results and nonsampled data from Reddit and Twitter/X. We find that SERP results are highly biased in favor of popular posts; against political, pornographic, and vulgar posts; are more positive in their sentiment; and have large topical gaps.

However, since most of the literature in the field is currently focused on opaque models, the use of RL in high-stakes scenarios, where interpretability is crucial, is still limited. Recently, some approaches to interpretable RL, e.g., based on Decision Trees, have been proposed, but one of the main limitations of these techniques is their training cost. To overcome this limitation, we propose a new population-based method, called Social Interpretable RL (SIRL), inspired by social learning principles, to improve learning efficiency. Our method mimics a social learning process, where each agent in a group learns to solve a given task based both on its own individual experience as well as the experience acquired together with its peers. Our approach is divided into two phases. In the \\emph{collaborative phase}, all the agents in the population interact with a shared instance of the environment, where each agent observes the state and independently proposes an action. Then, voting is performed to choose the action that will actually be performed in the environment. In the \\emph{individual phase}, each agent refines its individual performance by interacting with its own instance of the environment. This mechanism makes the agents experience a larger number of episodes while simultaneously reducing the computational cost of the process. Our results on six well-known benchmarks show that SIRL reaches state-of-the-art performance w.r.t. the alternative interpretable methods from the literature. ",

Recognizing the difficulties posed by a confined field of view and the absence of detailed gesture tracking in VR, our proposed method aims to mitigate the challenges of noticing new speakers attempting to join the conversation.

Through group interview studies, we gathered insights to guide our design, resulting in a prototype that employs \"light\" as a diegetic guidance mechanism, complemented by spatial audio. The combination creates an intuitive and immersive meeting environment, effectively directing users' attention to new speakers. An evaluation study, comparing our method to state-of-the-art attention guidance approaches, demonstrated significantly faster response times (p < 0.001), heightened perceived conversation satisfaction (p < 0.001), and preference (p < 0.001) for our method.

To prevent harmful disinformation spreading fallaciously from malicious social media (e.g., content farms), we propose a novel verification framework, Style-News, using publisher metadata to imply a publisher's template with the corresponding text types, political stance, and credibility. Based on threat modeling aspects, a style-aware neural news generator is introduced as an adversary for generating news content conditioning for a specific publisher, and style and source discriminators are trained to defend against this attack by identifying which publisher the style corresponds with, and discriminating whether the source of the given news is human-written or machine-generated. To evaluate the quality of the generated content, we integrate various dimensional metrics (language fluency, content preservation, and style adherence) and demonstrate that Style-News significantly outperforms the previous approaches by a margin of 0.35 for fluency, 15.24 for content, and 0.38 for style at most. Moreover, our discriminative model outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in terms of publisher prediction (up to 4.64%) and neural fake news detection (+6.94% $\\sim$ 31.72%). ",

    "abstract": "Rich textual and topological information of textual graphs need to be modeled in real-world applications such as webpages, e-commerce, and academic articles. Practitioners have been long following the path of adopting a shallow text encoder and a subsequent graph neural network (GNN) to solve this problem. In light of recent advancements in large language models (LLMs), it is apparent that integrating LLMs for enhanced textual encoding can substantially improve the performance of textual graphs. Nevertheless, the efficiency of these methods poses a significant challenge. In this paper, we propose ENGINE, a parameter- and memory-efficient fine-tuning method for textual graphs with an LLM encoder. The key insight is to combine the LLMs and GNNs through a tunable side structure, which significantly reduces the training complexity without impairing the joint model's capacity. Extensive experiments on textual graphs demonstrate our method's effectiveness by achieving the best model performance, meanwhile having the lowest training cost compared to previous methods. Moreover, we introduce two variants with caching and dynamic early exit to further enhance training and inference speed. Specifically, caching accelerates ENGINE's training by 12x, and dynamic early exit achieves up to 5x faster inference with a negligible performance drop (at maximum 1.17% relevant drop across 7 datasets).

    "abstract": "Infrared image destriping seeks to restore high-quality content from degraded images. Recent works mainly address this task by leveraging prior knowledge to separate stripe noise from the degraded image. However, constructing a robust decoupling model for that purpose remains challenging, especially when significant similarities exist between the stripe noise and vertical background structure. Addressing that, we introduce Asymmetric Residual wavelet Column correction Network (ARCNet) for image destriping, aiming to consistently preserve spatially precise high-resolution representations. Our neural model leverages a novel downsampler, residual haar discrete wavelet transform (RHDWT), stripe directional prior knowledge and data-driven learning to induce a model with enriched feature representation of stripe noise and background. In our technique, the inverse wavelet transform is replaced by transposed convolution for feature upsampling, which can suppress noise crosstalk and encourage the network to focus on robust image reconstruction. After each sampling, a proposed column non-uniformity correction module (CNCM) is leveraged by our method to enhance column uniformity, spatial correlation, and global self-dependence between each layer component. CNCM can establish structural characteristics of stripe noise and utilize contextual information at long-range dependencies to distinguish stripes with varying intensities and distributions. Extensive experiments on synthetic data, real data, and infrared small target detection tasks show that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art single-image destriping methods both visually and quantitatively by a considerable margin.

    "abstract": "Infrared small target detection (IRSTD) has recently benefitted greatly from U-shaped neural models. However, largely overlooking effective global information modeling, existing techniques struggle when the target has high similarities with the background. We present a Spatial-channel Cross Transformer Network (SCTransNet) that leverages spatial-channel cross transformer blocks (SCTBs) on top of long-range skip connections to address the aforementioned challenge. In the proposed SCTBs, the outputs of all encoders are interacted with cross transformer to generate mixed features, which are redistributed to all decoders to effectively reinforce semantic differences between the target and clutter at full scales. Specifically, SCTB contains the following two key elements: (a) spatial-embedded single-head channel-cross attention (SSCA) for exchanging local spatial features and full-level global channel information to eliminate ambiguity among the encoders and facilitate high-level semantic associations of the images, and (b) a complementary feed-forward network (CFN) for enhancing the feature discriminability via a multi-scale strategy and cross-spatial-channel information interaction to promote beneficial information transfer. Our SCTransNet effectively encodes the semantic differences between targets and backgrounds to boost its internal representation for detecting small infrared targets accurately. Extensive experiments on three public datasets, NUDT-SIRST, NUAA-SIRST, and IRSTD-1k, demonstrate that the proposed SCTransNet outperforms existing IRSTD methods.

The majority of existing GNNs employ a graph convolution operation by using both attribute and structure information through coupled learning. In essence, GNNs, from an optimization perspective, seek to learn a consensus and compromise embedding representation that balances attribute and graph information, selectively exploring and retaining valid information. To obtain a more comprehensive embedding representation of nodes, a novel GNNs framework, dubbed Decoupled Graph Neural Networks (DGNN), is introduced. DGNN explores distinctive embedding representations from the attribute and graph spaces by decoupled terms. Considering that semantic graph, constructed from attribute feature space, consists of different node connection information and provides enhancement for the topological graph, both topological and semantic graphs are combined for the embedding representation learning. Further, structural consistency among attribute embedding and graph embeddings is promoted to effectively remove redundant information and establish soft connection. This involves promoting factor sharing for adjacency reconstruction matrices, facilitating the exploration of a consensus and high-level correlation. Finally, a more powerful and complete representation is achieved through the concatenation of these embeddings. Experimental results conducted on several graph benchmark datasets verify its superiority in node classification task. ",

To capture such complex relationships, several hypergraph neural networks have been proposed for learning hypergraph structure, which propagate information from nodes to hyperedges and then from hyperedges back to nodes. However, most existing methods focus on information propagation between hyperedges and nodes, neglecting the interactions among hyperedges themselves. In this paper, we propose HeIHNN, a hyperedge interaction-aware hypergraph neural network, which captures the interactions among hyperedges during the convolution process and introduce a novel mechanism to enhance information flow between hyperedges and nodes. Specifically, HeIHNN integrates the interactions between hyperedges into the hypergraph convolution by constructing a three-stage information propagation process. After propagating information from nodes to hyperedges, we introduce a hyperedge-level convolution to update the hyperedge embeddings. Finally, the embeddings that capture rich information from the interaction among hyperedges will be utilized to update the node embeddings. Additionally, we introduce a hyperedge outlier removal mechanism in the information propagation stages between nodes and hyperedges, which dynamically adjusts the hypergraph structure using the learned embeddings, effectively removing outliers. Extensive experiments conducted on real-world datasets show the competitive performance of HeIHNN compared with state-of-the-art methods. ",

These models typically assume that eigenvalues for the normalized Laplacian matrix are distinct from each other, thus expecting a polynomial filter to have a high fitting ability. However, this paper empirically observes that normalized Laplacian matrices frequently possess repeated eigenvalues. Moreover, we theoretically establish that the number of distinguishable eigenvalues plays a pivotal role in determining the expressive power of spectral graph neural networks. In light of this observation, we propose an eigenvalue correction strategy that can free polynomial filters from the constraints of repeated eigenvalue inputs. Concretely, the proposed eigenvalue correction strategy enhances the uniform distribution of eigenvalues, thus mitigating repeated eigenvalues, and improving the fitting capacity and expressive power of polynomial filters.

    "abstract": "Diffusion models have emerged as a powerful tool rivaling GANs in generating high-quality samples with improved fidelity, flexibility, and robustness. A key component of these models is to learn the score function through score matching. Despite empirical success on various tasks, it remains unclear whether gradient-based algorithms can learn the score function with a provable accuracy. As a first step toward answering this question, this paper establishes a mathematical framework for analyzing score estimation using neural networks trained by gradient descent. Our analysis covers both the optimization and the generalization aspects of the learning procedure. In particular, we propose a parametric form to formulate the denoising score-matching problem as a regression with noisy labels. Compared to the standard supervised learning setup, the score-matching problem introduces distinct challenges, including unbounded input, vector-valued output, and an additional time variable, preventing existing techniques from being applied directly. In this paper, we show that with a properly designed neural network architecture, the score function can be accurately approximated by a reproducing kernel Hilbert space induced by neural tangent kernels. Furthermore, by applying an early-stopping rule for gradient descent and leveraging certain coupling arguments between neural network training and kernel regression, we establish the first generalization error (sample complexity) bounds for learning the score function despite the presence of noise in the observations. Our analysis is grounded in a novel parametric form of the neural network and an innovative connection between score matching and regression analysis, facilitating the application of advanced statistical and optimization techniques.

An effective approach involves the modeling and development of hardware components, such as interconnects and shared memory resources, to evaluate or enforce their deterministic behavior. Unfortunately, these IPs are often closed-source, and these studies are limited to the single modules that must later be integrated with third-party IPs in more complex SoCs, hindering the precision and scope of modeling and compromising the overall predictability. With the coming-of-age of open-source instruction set architectures (RISC-V) and hardware, major opportunities for changing this status quo are emerging. This study introduces an innovative methodology for modeling and analyzing State-of-the-Art (SoA) open-source SoCs for low-power cyber-physical systems. Our approach models and analyzes the entire set of open-source IPs within these SoCs and then provides a comprehensive analysis of the entire architecture.

To this end, we design an Effective Curriculum Learning strategy ECL to enhance DA-based VQA methods. Intuitively, ECL trains VQA models on relatively ``easy'' samples first, and then gradually changes to ``harder'' samples, and less-valuable samples are dynamically removed.

Among these methods, semantic segmentation algorithms have demonstrated promising results in pixel-wise crack detection tasks. However, training such data-driven algorithms requires a large amount of human-annotated datasets with pixel-level annotations, which is a highly labor-intensive and time-consuming process. Moreover, supervised learning-based methods often struggle with poor generalization ability in unseen datasets. Therefore, we propose an unsupervised pixel-wise road crack detection network, known as UP-CrackNet. Our approach first generates multi-scale square masks and randomly selects them to corrupt undamaged road images by removing certain regions. Subsequently, a generative adversarial network is trained to restore the corrupted regions by leveraging the semantic context learned from surrounding uncorrupted regions. During the testing phase, an error map is generated by calculating the difference between the input and restored images, which allows for pixel-wise crack detection. Our comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that UP-CrackNet outperforms other general-purpose unsupervised anomaly detection algorithms, and exhibits comparable performance and superior generalizability when compared with state-of-the-art supervised crack segmentation algorithms.

    "abstract": "Improving the efficiency of state-of-the-art methods in semantic segmentation requires overcoming the increasing computational cost as well as issues such as fusing semantic information from global and local contexts. Based on the recent success and problems that convolutional neural networks (CNNs) encounter in semantic segmentation, this research proposes an encoder-decoder architecture with a unique efficient residual network. Attention-boosting gates (AbGs) and attention-boosting modules (AbMs) are deployed by aiming to fuse the feature-based semantic information with the global context of the efficient residual network in the encoder. Respectively, the decoder network is developed with the additional attention-fusion networks (AfNs) inspired by AbM. AfNs are designed to improve the efficiency in the one-to-one conversion of the semantic information by deploying additional convolution layers in the decoder part. Our network is tested on the challenging CamVid and Cityscapes datasets, and the proposed methods reveal significant improvements on the existing baselines, such as ResNet-50. To the best of our knowledge, the developed network, SERNet-Former, achieves state-of-the-art results (84.62 % mean IoU) on CamVid dataset and challenging results (87.35 % mean IoU) on Cityscapes validation dataset.

    "abstract": "Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) play a pivotal role in enabling Internet of Things (IoT) devices with sensing and actuation capabilities. Operating in remote and resource-constrained environments, these IoT devices face challenges related to energy consumption, crucial for network longevity. Clustering protocols have emerged as an effective solution to alleviate energy burdens on IoT devices. This paper introduces Low-Energy Adaptive Clustering Hierarchy with Reinforcement Learning-based Controller (LEACH-RLC), a novel clustering protocol that employs a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) for strategic selection of cluster heads (CHs) and node-to-cluster assignments. Additionally, it integrates a Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent to minimize control overhead by learning optimal timings for generating new clusters. Addressing key research questions, LEACH-RLC seeks to balance control overhead reduction without compromising overall network performance. Through extensive simulations, this paper investigates the frequency and opportune moments for generating new clustering solutions. Results demonstrate the superior performance of LEACH-RLC over conventional LEACH and LEACH-C, showcasing enhanced network lifetime, reduced average energy consumption, and minimized control overhead. The proposed protocol contributes to advancing the efficiency and adaptability of WSNs, addressing critical challenges in IoT deployments. ",

    "abstract": "Machine learning shows promise in predicting the outcome of legal cases, but most research has concentrated on civil law cases rather than case law systems. We identified two unique challenges in making legal case outcome predictions with case law. First, it is crucial to identify relevant precedent cases that serve as fundamental evidence for judges during decision-making. Second, it is necessary to consider the evolution of legal principles over time, as early cases may adhere to different legal contexts. In this paper, we proposed a new model named PILOT (PredictIng Legal case OuTcome) for case outcome prediction. It comprises two modules for relevant case retrieval and temporal pattern handling, respectively. To benchmark the performance of existing legal case outcome prediction models, we curated a dataset from a large-scale case law database. We demonstrate the importance of accurately identifying precedent cases and mitigating the temporal shift when making predictions for case law, as our method shows a significant improvement over the prior methods that focus on civil law case outcome predictions.

We show that our new integrated framework provides benefits to both CI and DP that cannot be attained when each definition is considered in isolation: it enables contextually-guided tuning of the epsilon parameter in DP, and it enables CI to be applied to a broader set of information flows occurring in real-world systems, such as those involving PETs and machine learning. We conclude with a case study based on the use of DP in the U.S. Census Bureau. ",

    "abstract": "Breast cancer is the most common malignancy affecting women worldwide and is notable for its morphologic and biologic diversity, with varying risks of recurrence following treatment. The Oncotype DX Breast Recurrence Score test is an important predictive and prognostic genomic assay for estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer that guides therapeutic strategies; however, such tests can be expensive, delay care, and are not widely available. The aim of this study was to develop a multi-model approach integrating the analysis of whole slide images and clinicopathologic data to predict their associated breast cancer recurrence risks and categorize these patients into two risk groups according to the predicted score: low and high risk. The proposed novel methodology uses convolutional neural networks for feature extraction and vision transformers for contextual aggregation, complemented by a logistic regression model that analyzes clinicopathologic data for classification into two risk categories. This method was trained and tested on 993 hematoxylin and eosin-stained whole-slide images of breast cancers with corresponding clinicopathological features that had prior Oncotype DX testing. The model's performance was evaluated using an internal test set of 198 patients from Dartmouth Health and an external test set of 418 patients from the University of Chicago. The multi-model approach achieved an AUC of 0.92 (95 percent CI: 0.88-0.96) on the internal set and an AUC of 0.85 (95 percent CI: 0.79-0.90) on the external cohort. These results suggest that with further validation, the proposed methodology could provide an alternative to assist clinicians in personalizing treatment for breast cancer patients and potentially improving their outcomes.

    "abstract": "Human activities generate various event sequences such as taxi trip records, bike-sharing pick-ups, crime occurrence, and infectious disease transmission. The point process is widely used in many applications to predict such events related to human activities. However, point processes present two problems in predicting events related to human activities. First, recent high-performance point process models require the input of sufficient numbers of events collected over a long period (i.e., long sequences) for training, which are often unavailable in realistic situations. Second, the long-term predictions required in real-world applications are difficult. To tackle these problems, we propose a novel meta-learning approach for periodicity-aware prediction of future events given short sequences. The proposed method first embeds short sequences into hidden representations (i.e., task representations) via recurrent neural networks for creating predictions from short sequences. It then models the intensity of the point process by monotonic neural networks (MNNs), with the input being the task representations. We transfer the prior knowledge learned from related tasks and can improve event prediction given short sequences of target tasks. We design the MNNs to explicitly take temporal periodic patterns into account, contributing to improved long-term prediction performance. Experiments on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed method has higher prediction performance than existing alternatives. ",

However, the variable nature of RERs introduces uncertainties to DNs, frequently resulting in voltage fluctuations that threaten system security and hamper the further adoption of RERs. To incentivize more RER penetration, we propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based strategy to dynamically balance the trade-off between voltage fluctuation control and renewable accommodation. To further extract multi-time-scale spatial-temporal (ST) graphical information of a DN, our strategy draws on a multi-grained attention-based spatial-temporal graph convolution network (MG-ASTGCN), consisting of ST attention mechanism and ST convolution to explore the node correlations in the spatial and temporal views. The continuous decision-making process of balancing such a trade-off can be modeled as a Markov decision process optimized by the deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm with the help of the derived ST information. We validate our strategy on the modified IEEE 33, 69, and 118-bus radial distribution systems, with outcomes significantly outperforming the optimization-based benchmarks. Simulations also reveal that our developed MG-ASTGCN can to a great extent accelerate the convergence speed of DDPG and improve its performance in stabilizing node voltage in an RER-rich DN. Moreover, our method improves the DN's robustness in the presence of generator failures. ",

    "abstract": "The Sequential Sentence Classification task within the domain of medical abstracts, termed as SSC, involves the categorization of sentences into pre-defined headings based on their roles in conveying critical information in the abstract. In the SSC task, sentences are often sequentially related to each other. For this reason, the role of sentence embedding is crucial for capturing both the semantic information between words in the sentence and the contextual relationship of sentences within the abstract to provide a comprehensive representation for better classification. In this paper, we present a hierarchical deep learning model for the SSC task. First, we propose a LSTM-based network with multiple feature branches to create well-presented sentence embeddings at the sentence level. To perform the sequence of sentences, a convolutional-recurrent neural network (C-RNN) at the abstract level and a multi-layer perception network (MLP) at the segment level are developed that further enhance the model performance. Additionally, an ablation study is also conducted to evaluate the contribution of individual component in the entire network to the model performance at different levels.

DiFF comprises over 500,000 images that are synthesized using thirteen distinct generation methods under four conditions. In particular, this dataset leverages 30,000 carefully collected textual and visual prompts, ensuring the synthesis of images with both high fidelity and semantic consistency.

    "abstract": "Video compression performance is closely related to the accuracy of inter prediction. It tends to be difficult to obtain accurate inter prediction for the local video regions with inconsistent motion and occlusion. Traditional video coding standards propose various technologies to handle motion inconsistency and occlusion, such as recursive partitions, geometric partitions, and long-term references. However, existing learned video compression schemes focus on obtaining an overall minimized prediction error averaged over all regions while ignoring the motion inconsistency and occlusion in local regions. In this paper, we propose a spatial decomposition and temporal fusion based inter prediction for learned video compression. To handle motion inconsistency, we propose to decompose the video into structure and detail (SDD) components first. Then we perform SDD-based motion estimation and SDD-based temporal context mining for the structure and detail components to generate short-term temporal contexts. To handle occlusion, we propose to propagate long-term temporal contexts by recurrently accumulating the temporal information of each historical reference feature and fuse them with short-term temporal contexts. With the SDD-based motion model and long short-term temporal contexts fusion, our proposed learned video codec can obtain more accurate inter prediction. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that our codec outperforms the reference software of H.266/VVC on all common test datasets for both PSNR and MS-SSIM. ",

Being a convenient and straightforward model compression approach, Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) has been widely adopted in 2D vision tasks. However, applying it directly to 3D lidar-based tasks inevitably leads to performance degradation. As a remedy, we propose an effective PTQ method called LiDAR-PTQ, which is particularly curated for 3D lidar detection (both SPConv-based and SPConv-free). Our LiDAR-PTQ features three main components, \\textbf{(1)} a sparsity-based calibration method to determine the initialization of quantization parameters, \\textbf{(2)} a Task-guided Global Positive Loss (TGPL) to reduce the disparity between the final predictions before and after quantization, \\textbf{(3)} an adaptive rounding-to-nearest operation to minimize the layerwise reconstruction error. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our LiDAR-PTQ can achieve state-of-the-art quantization performance when applied to CenterPoint (both Pillar-based and Voxel-based). To our knowledge, for the very first time in lidar-based 3D detection tasks, the PTQ INT8 model's accuracy is almost the same as the FP32 model while enjoying $3\\times$ inference speedup. Moreover, our LiDAR-PTQ is cost-effective being $30\\times$ faster than the quantization-aware training method. Code will be released at \\url{https://github.com/StiphyJay/LiDAR-PTQ}. ",

    "abstract": "The interest in quantum computing has grown rapidly in recent years, and with it grows the importance of securing quantum circuits. A novel type of threat to quantum circuits that dedicated attackers could launch are power trace attacks. To address this threat, this paper presents first formalization and demonstration of using power traces to unlock and steal quantum circuit secrets. With access to power traces, attackers can recover information about the control pulses sent to quantum computers. From the control pulses, the gate level description of the circuits, and eventually the secret algorithms can be reverse engineered. This work demonstrates how and what information could be recovered. This work uses algebraic reconstruction from power traces to realize two new types of single trace attacks: per-channel and total power attacks. The former attack relies on per-channel measurements to perform a brute-force attack to reconstruct the quantum circuits. The latter attack performs a single-trace attack using Mixed-Integer Linear Programming optimization. Through the use of algebraic reconstruction, this work demonstrates that quantum circuit secrets can be stolen with high accuracy. Evaluation on 32 real benchmark quantum circuits shows that our technique is highly effective at reconstructing quantum circuits. The findings not only show the veracity of the potential attacks, but also the need to develop new means to protect quantum circuits from power trace attacks. Throughout this work real control pulse information from real quantum computers is used to demonstrate potential attacks based on simulation of collection of power traces. ",

    "abstract": "Most existing personalized federated learning approaches are based on intricate designs, which often require complex implementation and tuning. In order to address this limitation, we propose a simple yet effective personalized federated learning framework. Specifically, during each communication round, we group clients into multiple clusters based on their model training status and data distribution on the server side. We then consider each cluster center as a node equipped with model parameters and construct a graph that connects these nodes using weighted edges. Additionally, we update the model parameters at each node by propagating information across the entire graph. Subsequently, we design a precise personalized model distribution strategy to allow clients to obtain the most suitable model from the server side. We conduct experiments on three image benchmark datasets and create synthetic structured datasets with three types of typologies. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed work. ",

    "abstract": "Pre-trained models (PTMs) are extensively utilized in various downstream tasks. Adopting untrusted PTMs may suffer from backdoor attacks, where the adversary can compromise the downstream models by injecting backdoors into the PTM. However, existing backdoor attacks to PTMs can only achieve partially task-agnostic and the embedded backdoors are easily erased during the fine-tuning process. In this paper, we propose a novel transferable backdoor attack, TransTroj, to simultaneously meet functionality-preserving, durable, and task-agnostic. In particular, we first formalize transferable backdoor attacks as the indistinguishability problem between poisoned and clean samples in the embedding space. We decompose the embedding indistinguishability into pre- and post-indistinguishability, representing the similarity of the poisoned and reference embeddings before and after the attack. Then, we propose a two-stage optimization that separately optimizes triggers and victim PTMs to achieve embedding indistinguishability. We evaluate TransTroj on four PTMs and six downstream tasks. Experimental results show that TransTroj significantly outperforms SOTA task-agnostic backdoor attacks (18%$\\sim$99%, 68% on average) and exhibits superior performance under various system settings.

    "abstract": "Long-tailed object detection faces great challenges because of its extremely imbalanced class distribution. Recent methods mainly focus on the classification bias and its loss function design, while ignoring the subtle influence of the regression branch. This paper shows that the regression bias exists and does adversely and seriously impact the detection accuracy. While existing methods fail to handle the regression bias, the class-specific regression head for rare classes is hypothesized to be the main cause of it in this paper. As a result, three kinds of viable solutions to cater for the rare categories are proposed, including adding a class-agnostic branch, clustering heads and merging heads. The proposed methods brings in consistent and significant improvements over existing long-tailed detection methods, especially in rare and common classes. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance in the large vocabulary LVIS dataset with different backbones and architectures. It generalizes well to more difficult evaluation metrics, relatively balanced datasets, and the mask branch. This is the first attempt to reveal and explore rectifying of the regression bias in long-tailed object detection. ",

In this work, we introduce the Cycle to Mixer (Cy2Mixer), a novel spatio-temporal GNN based on topological non-trivial invariants of spatio-temporal graphs with gated multi-layer perceptrons (gMLP). The Cy2Mixer is composed of three blocks based on MLPs: A message-passing block for encapsulating spatial information, a cycle message-passing block for enriching topological information through cyclic subgraphs, and a temporal block for capturing temporal properties. We bolster the effectiveness of Cy2Mixer with mathematical evidence emphasizing that our cycle message-passing block is capable of offering differentiated information to the deep learning model compared to the message-passing block.

    "abstract": "Depth completion is a crucial task in autonomous driving, aiming to convert a sparse depth map into a dense depth prediction. Due to its potentially rich semantic information, RGB image is commonly fused to enhance the completion effect. Image-guided depth completion involves three key challenges: 1) how to effectively fuse the two modalities; 2) how to better recover depth information; and 3) how to achieve real-time prediction for practical autonomous driving. To solve the above problems, we propose a concise but effective network, named CENet, to achieve high-performance depth completion with a simple and elegant structure. Firstly, we use a fast guidance module to fuse the two sensor features, utilizing abundant auxiliary features extracted from the color space. Unlike other commonly used complicated guidance modules, our approach is intuitive and low-cost. In addition, we find and analyze the optimization inconsistency problem for observed and unobserved positions, and a decoupled depth prediction head is proposed to alleviate the issue. The proposed decoupled head can better output the depth of valid and invalid positions with very few extra inference time. Based on the simple structure of dual-encoder and single-decoder, our CENet can achieve superior balance between accuracy and efficiency. In the KITTI depth completion benchmark, our CENet attains competitive performance and inference speed compared with the state-of-the-art methods. To validate the generalization of our method, we also evaluate on indoor NYUv2 dataset, and our CENet still achieve impressive results.

However, these frameworks face notable challenges in practically modeling counterfactuals, formalized as parameters of the joint distribution of potential outcomes. Counterfactual reasoning holds paramount importance in contemporary decision-making processes, especially in scenarios that demand personalized incentives based on the joint values of $(Y(0), Y(1))$. This paper begins with an investigation of the PO and SCM frameworks for modeling counterfactuals. Through the analysis, we identify an inherent model capacity limitation, termed as the ``degenerative counterfactual problem'', emerging from the consistency rule that is the cornerstone of both frameworks. To address this limitation, we introduce a novel \\textit{distribution-consistency} assumption, and in alignment with it, we propose the Distribution-consistency Structural Causal Models (DiscoSCMs) offering enhanced capabilities to model counterfactuals. To concretely reveal the enhanced model capacity, we introduce a new identifiable causal parameter, \\textit{the probability of consistency}, which holds practical significance within DiscoSCM alone, showcased with a personalized incentive example. Furthermore, we provide a comprehensive set of theoretical results about the ``Ladder of Causation'' within the DiscoSCM framework. We hope it opens new avenues for future research of counterfactual modeling, ultimately enhancing our understanding of causality and its real-world applications. ",

Mathematically, the DNA storage process can be conceptualized as an insertion, deletion, and substitution (IDS) channel. Due to the mathematical complexity associated with the Levenshtein distance, creating a code that corrects for IDS remains a challenging task. In this paper, we propose a bottom-up generation approach to grow the required codebook based on the computation of Edit Computational Graph (ECG) which differs from the algebraic constructions by incorporating the Derivative-Free Optimization (DFO) method. Specifically, this approach is regardless of the type of errors. Compared the results with the work for 1-substitution-1-deletion and 2-deletion, the redundancy is reduced by about 30-bit and 60-bit, respectively. As far as we know, our method is the first IDS-correcting code designed using classical Natural Language Process (NLP) techniques, marking a turning point in the field of error correction code research. Based on the codebook generated by our method, there may be significant breakthroughs in the complexity of encoding and decoding algorithms. ",

Although current fifth-generation (5G) networks can provide high data rates in terms of Gigabytes/second, they cannot cope with the high demands of the aforementioned applications, especially in terms of the size of the high-quality live videos and images that need to be communicated in real-time. Therefore, with the help of artificial intelligence (AI)-based future sixth-generation (6G) networks, the semantic communication concept can provide the services demanded by these applications. Unlike Shannon's classical information theory, semantic communication urges the use of the semantics (meaningful contents) of the data in designing more efficient data communication schemes. Hence, in this paper, we model semantic communication as an energy minimization framework in heterogeneous wireless networks with respect to delay and quality-of-service constraints. Then, we propose a sub-optimal solution to the NP-hard combinatorial mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem (MINLP) by utilizing efficient techniques such as discrete optimization variables' relaxation. In addition, AI-based autoencoder and classifier are trained and deployed to perform semantic extraction, reconstruction, and classification services. Finally, we compare our proposed sub-optimal solution with different state-of-the-art methods, and the obtained results demonstrate its superiority. ",

However, as a class of population-based search methodology, evolutionary algorithms require a large number of evaluations of the objective functions, preventing them from being applied to a wide range of expensive MOPs. To tackle the above challenge, this work proposes for the first time a diffusion model that can learn to perform evolutionary multi-objective search, called EmoDM. This is achieved by treating the reversed convergence process of evolutionary search as the forward diffusion and learn the noise distributions from previously solved evolutionary optimization tasks. The pre-trained EmoDM can then generate a set of non-dominated solutions for a new MOP by means of its reverse diffusion without further evolutionary search, thereby significantly reducing the required function evaluations. To enhance the scalability of EmoDM, a mutual entropy-based attention mechanism is introduced to capture the decision variables that are most important for the objectives. Experimental results demonstrate the competitiveness of EmoDM in terms of both the search performance and computational efficiency compared with state-of-the-art evolutionary algorithms in solving MOPs having up to 5000 decision variables. The pre-trained EmoDM is shown to generalize well to unseen problems, revealing its strong potential as a general and efficient MOP solver. ",

Consequently, enhancing the ability of LLMs to address unfamiliar problems has emerged as a pivotal research focus. The problem-solving process of LLMs mirrors human programmers' approach to a certain extent. When confronted with new programming tasks, human programmers engage in task planning and code writing with the previously acquired knowledge about algorithms and data structures. Despite having learned such knowledge, LLMs struggle to effectively apply it when faced with specific new problems. To address this issue, we constructed a novel dataset, CodeF, which contains a portion of programming problems that ChatGPT has not previously encountered. Furthermore, we developed a Knowledge Library tailored for Python programming contest problems and introduced the concept of Knowledge-Aware Code Generation (KareCoder). KareCoder bolsters the models' understanding and problem-solving capabilities by integrating prompt and knowledge from the library into the LLMs' code generation reasoning process, especially on Pass@1 metrics. Upon testing on the CodeF and APPS datasets, KareCoder demonstrated outstanding performance in handling novel problems previously unencountered by LLMs. In contrast with the code directly generated by ChatGPT, KareCoder achieved a relative improvement of 23.3% on the Pass@1 metric on the CodeF post2021-9 dataset.

Surprisingly, even the classification accuracy on functional-correctness instances derived from the popular HumanEval benchmark is low, calling in question the depth of their comprehension and the source of their success in generating functionally-correct code in the first place.

Furthermore, there seems to be inconsistency in the choice of data normalization methods, particularly concerning operating conditions, which might influence predictive performance. To bridge these observations, this study presents the Spatio-Temporal Attention Graph Neural Network. Our model combines graph neural networks and temporal convolutional neural networks for spatial and temporal feature extraction, respectively. The cascade of these extractors, combined with multi-head attention mechanisms for both spatio-temporal dimensions, aims to improve predictive precision and refine model explainability. Comprehensive experiments were conducted on the C-MAPSS dataset to evaluate the impact of unified versus clustering normalization. The findings suggest that our model performs state-of-the-art results using only the unified normalization.

    "abstract": "The transition to 4th generation district heating creates a growing need for scalable, automated design tools that accurately capture the spatial and temporal details of heating network operation. This paper presents an automated design approach for the optimal design of district heating networks that combines scalable density-based topology optimization with a multi-period approach. In this way, temporal variations in demand, supply, and heat losses can be taken into account while optimizing the network design based on a nonlinear physics model. The transition of the automated design approach from worst-case to multi-period shows a design progression from separate branched networks to a single integrated meshed network topology connecting all producers. These integrated topologies emerge without imposing such structures a priori. They increase network connectivity, and allow for more flexible shifting of heat loads between different producers and heat consumers, resulting in more cost-effective use of heat. In a case study, this integrated design resulted in an increase in waste heat share of 42.8 % and a subsequent reduction in project cost of 17.9 %. We show how producer unavailability can be accounted for in the automated design at the cost of a 3.1 % increase in the cost of backup capacity. The resulting optimized network designs of this approach connect multiple low temperature heat sources in a single integrated network achieving high waste heat utilization and redundancy, highlighting the applicability of the approach to next-generation district heating networks.

    "title": "Deep Embedding Clustering Driven by Sample Stability",
    "abstract": "Deep clustering methods improve the performance of clustering tasks by jointly optimizing deep representation learning and clustering. While numerous deep clustering algorithms have been proposed, most of them rely on artificially constructed pseudo targets for performing clustering. This construction process requires some prior knowledge, and it is challenging to determine a suitable pseudo target for clustering. To address this issue, we propose a deep embedding clustering algorithm driven by sample stability (DECS), which eliminates the requirement of pseudo targets. Specifically, we start by constructing the initial feature space with an autoencoder and then learn the cluster-oriented embedding feature constrained by sample stability. The sample stability aims to explore the deterministic relationship between samples and all cluster centroids, pulling samples to their respective clusters and keeping them away from other clusters with high determinacy. We analyzed the convergence of the loss using Lipschitz continuity in theory, which verifies the validity of the model. The experimental results on five datasets illustrate that the proposed method achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art clustering approaches. ",

    "abstract": "Target speaker extraction (TSE) aims to extract the target speaker's voice from the input mixture. Previous studies have concentrated on high-overlapping scenarios. However, real-world applications usually meet more complex scenarios like variable speaker overlapping and target speaker absence. In this paper, we introduces a framework to perform continuous TSE (C-TSE), comprising a target speaker voice activation detection (TSVAD) and a TSE model. This framework significantly improves TSE performance on similar speakers and enhances personalization, which is lacking in traditional diarization methods. In detail, unlike conventional TSVAD deployed to refine the diarization results, the proposed Attention-target speaker voice activation detection (A-TSVAD) directly generates timestamps of the target speaker. We also explore some different integration methods of A-TSVAD and TSE by comparing the cascaded and parallel methods. The framework's effectiveness is assessed using a range of metrics, including diarization and enhancement metrics. Our experiments demonstrate that A-TSVAD outperforms conventional methods in reducing diarization errors. Furthermore, the integration of A-TSVAD and TSE in a sequential cascaded manner further enhances extraction accuracy. ",

Four typical LESSON attacks based on the proposed framework and two dimensions of attack objectives are examined, and the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed attack framework, posing serious and pressing security concerns in smart grids.

    "abstract": "Glyphosate contamination in waters is becoming a major health problem that needs to be urgently addressed, as accidental spraying, drift or leakage of this highly water-soluble herbicide can impact aquatic ecosystems. Researchers are increasingly concerned about exposure to glyphosate and the risks its poses to human health, since it may cause substantial damage, even in small doses. The detection of glyphosate residues in waters is not a simple task, as it requires complex and expensive equipment and qualified personnel. New technological tools need to be designed and developed, based on proven, but also cost-efficient, agile and user-friendly, analytical techniques, which can be used in the field and in the lab, enabled by connectivity and multi-platform software applications. This paper presents the design, development and testing of an innovative low-cost VIS-NIR (Visible and Near-Infrared) spectrometer (called SpectroGLY), based on IoT (Internet of Things) technologies, which allows potential glyphosate contamination in waters to be detected. SpectroGLY combines the functional concept of a traditional lab spectrometer with the IoT technological concept, enabling the integration of several connectivity options for rural and urban settings and digital visualization and monitoring platforms (Mobile App and Dashboard Web). Thanks to its portability, it can be used in any context and provides results in 10 minutes. Additionally, it is unnecessary to transfer the sample to a laboratory (optimizing time, costs and the capacity for corrective actions by the authorities). In short, this paper proposes an innovative, low-cost, agile and highly promising solution to avoid potential intoxications that may occur due to ingestion of water contaminated by this herbicide. ",

    "abstract": "Self-supervised graph representation learning has recently shown considerable promise in a range of fields, including bioinformatics and social networks. A large number of graph contrastive learning approaches have shown promising performance for representation learning on graphs, which train models by maximizing agreement between original graphs and their augmented views (i.e., positive views). Unfortunately, these methods usually involve pre-defined augmentation strategies based on the knowledge of human experts. Moreover, these strategies may fail to generate challenging positive views to provide sufficient supervision signals. In this paper, we present a novel approach named Graph Pooling ContraSt (GPS) to address these issues. Motivated by the fact that graph pooling can adaptively coarsen the graph with the removal of redundancy, we rethink graph pooling and leverage it to automatically generate multi-scale positive views with varying emphasis on providing challenging positives and preserving semantics, i.e., strongly-augmented view and weakly-augmented view. Then, we incorporate both views into a joint contrastive learning framework with similarity learning and consistency learning, where our pooling module is adversarially trained with respect to the encoder for adversarial robustness. Experiments on twelve datasets on both graph classification and transfer learning tasks verify the superiority of the proposed method over its counterparts. ",

Recent work defines this task as an end-to-end optimization problem, which significantly reduces the training cost and enhances the generalization of the model by a pretrained link predictors for query answering. However, most existing proposals ignore the critical semantic knowledge inherently available in KGs, such as type information, which could help answer complex logical queries. To this end, we propose TypE-based Neural Link Prediction Adapter (TENLPA), a novel model that constructs type-based entity-relation graphs to discover the latent relationships between entities and relations by leveraging type information in KGs. Meanwhile, in order to effectively combine type information with complex logical queries, an adaptive learning mechanism is introduced, which is trained by back-propagating during the complex query answering process to achieve adaptive adjustment of neural link predictors. Experiments on 3 standard datasets show that TENLPA model achieves state-of-the-art performance on complex query answering with good generalization and robustness. ",

The study covers eight language pairs, different training corpus sizes, two architectures, and three types of annotation: dummy tags (with no linguistic information at all), part-of-speech tags, and morpho-syntactic description tags, which consist of part of speech and morphological features. These linguistic annotations are interleaved in the input or output streams as a single tag placed before each word. In order to measure the performance under each scenario, we use automatic evaluation metrics and perform automatic error classification. Our experiments show that, in general, source-language annotations are helpful and morpho-syntactic descriptions outperform part of speech for some language pairs. On the contrary, when words are annotated in the target language, part-of-speech tags systematically outperform morpho-syntactic description tags in terms of automatic evaluation metrics, even though the use of morpho-syntactic description tags improves the grammaticality of the output. We provide a detailed analysis of the reasons behind this result. ",

A number of approaches have been proposed to produce synthetic parallel sentences that are similar to those in the parallel data available. These approaches work under the assumption that non-fluent target-side synthetic training samples can be harmful and may deteriorate translation performance. Even so, in this paper we demonstrate that synthetic training samples with non-fluent target sentences can improve translation performance if they are used in a multilingual machine translation framework as if they were sentences in another language. We conducted experiments on ten low-resource and four high-resource translation tasks and found out that this simple approach consistently improves translation performance as compared to state-of-the-art methods for generating synthetic training samples similar to those found in corpora. Furthermore, this improvement is independent of the size of the original training corpus, the resulting systems are much more robust against domain shift and produce less hallucinations. ",

    "abstract": "Concurrency is an important aspect of (Petri) nets to describe and simulate the behavior of complex systems. Knowing which places and transitions could be executed in parallel helps to understand nets and enables analysis techniques and the computation of other properties, such as causality, exclusivity, etc.. All techniques based on concurrency detection depend on the efficiency of this detection methodology. Kovalyov and Esparza have developed algorithms that compute all concurrent places in $O\\big((P+T)TP^2\\big)$ for live nets (where $P$ and $T$ are the numbers of places and transitions) and in $O\\big(P(P+T)^2\\big)$ for live free-choice nets. Although these algorithms have a reasonably good computational complexity, large numbers of concurrent pairs of nodes may still lead to long computation times. Furthermore, both algorithms cannot be parallelized without additional effort. This paper complements the palette of concurrency detection algorithms with the Concurrent Paths (CP) algorithm for safe, live, free-choice nets. The algorithm allows parallelization and has a worst-case computational complexity of $O\\big((P+T)^2\\big)$ for acyclic nets and of $O\\big(P^3+PT^2\\big)$ for cyclic nets. Although the computational complexity of cyclic nets has not improved, the evaluation shows the benefits of CP, especially, if the net contains many nodes in concurrency relation. ",

    "abstract": "The early prediction of battery life (EPBL) is vital for enhancing the efficiency and extending the lifespan of lithium batteries. Traditional models with fixed architectures often encounter underfitting or overfitting issues due to the diverse data distributions in different EPBL tasks. An interpretable deep learning model of flexible parallel neural network (FPNN) is proposed, which includes an InceptionBlock, a 3D convolutional neural network (CNN), a 2D CNN, and a dual-stream network. The proposed model effectively extracts electrochemical features from video-like formatted data using the 3D CNN and achieves advanced multi-scale feature abstraction through the InceptionBlock. The FPNN can adaptively adjust the number of InceptionBlocks to flexibly handle tasks of varying complexity in EPBL. The test on the MIT dataset shows that the FPNN model achieves outstanding predictive accuracy in EPBL tasks, with MAPEs of 2.47%, 1.29%, 1.08%, and 0.88% when the input cyclic data volumes are 10, 20, 30, and 40, respectively. The interpretability of the FPNN is mainly reflected in its flexible unit structure and parameter selection: its diverse branching structure enables the model to capture features at different scales, thus allowing the machine to learn informative features. The approach presented herein provides an accurate, adaptable, and comprehensible solution for early life prediction of lithium batteries, opening new possibilities in the field of battery health monitoring.

    "abstract": "Roadside perception can greatly increase the safety of autonomous vehicles by extending their perception ability beyond the visual range and addressing blind spots. However, current state-of-the-art vision-based roadside detection methods possess high accuracy on labeled scenes but have inferior performance on new scenes. This is because roadside cameras remain stationary after installation and can only collect data from a single scene, resulting in the algorithm overfitting these roadside backgrounds and camera poses. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose an innovative Scenario Generalization Framework for Vision-based Roadside 3D Object Detection, dubbed SGV3D. Specifically, we employ a Background-suppressed Module (BSM) to mitigate background overfitting in vision-centric pipelines by attenuating background features during the 2D to bird's-eye-view projection. Furthermore, by introducing the Semi-supervised Data Generation Pipeline (SSDG) using unlabeled images from new scenes, diverse instance foregrounds with varying camera poses are generated, addressing the risk of overfitting specific camera poses. We evaluate our method on two large-scale roadside benchmarks. Our method surpasses all previous methods by a significant margin in new scenes, including +42.57% for vehicle, +5.87% for pedestrian, and +14.89% for cyclist compared to BEVHeight on the DAIR-V2X-I heterologous benchmark. On the larger-scale Rope3D heterologous benchmark, we achieve notable gains of 14.48% for car and 12.41% for large vehicle. We aspire to contribute insights on the exploration of roadside perception techniques, emphasizing their capability for scenario generalization.

Using an all-at-once approach, we can solve for all time steps simultaneously using a parallelizable over time preconditioner within a standard iterative method. Due to the diagonalization of the proposed preconditioner, we can prove that most eigenvalues of preconditioned matrices are equal to 1 and the others lie in the set: $\\left\\{z\\in\\mathbb{C}: 1/(1 + \\alpha) < |z| < 1/(1 - \\alpha)~{\\rm and}~\\Re{e}(z) > 0\\right\\}$, where $0 < \\alpha < 1$ is a free parameter.

    "abstract": "Neural radiance fields (NeRFs) have exhibited potential in synthesizing high-fidelity views of 3D scenes but the standard training paradigm of NeRF presupposes an equal importance for each image in the training set. This assumption poses a significant challenge for rendering specific views presenting intricate geometries, thereby resulting in suboptimal performance. In this paper, we take a closer look at the implications of the current training paradigm and redesign this for more superior rendering quality by NeRFs. Dividing input views into multiple groups based on their visual similarities and training individual models on each of these groups enables each model to specialize on specific regions without sacrificing speed or efficiency. Subsequently, the knowledge of these specialized models is aggregated into a single entity via a teacher-student distillation paradigm, enabling spatial efficiency for online render-ing. Empirically, we evaluate our novel training framework on two publicly available datasets, namely NeRF synthetic and Tanks&Temples. Our evaluation demonstrates that our DaC training pipeline enhances the rendering quality of a state-of-the-art baseline model while exhibiting convergence to a superior minimum. ",

    "abstract": "The transformer architecture has shown remarkable success in various domains, such as natural language processing and computer vision. When it comes to graph learning, transformers are required not only to capture the interactions between pairs of nodes but also to preserve graph structures connoting the underlying relations and proximity between them, showing the expressive power to capture different graph structures. Accordingly, various structure-preserving graph transformers have been proposed and widely used for various tasks, such as graph-level tasks in bioinformatics and chemoinformatics. However, strategies related to graph structure preservation have not been well organized and systematized in the literature. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive overview of structure-preserving graph transformers and generalize these methods from the perspective of their design objective. First, we divide strategies into four main groups: node feature modulation, context node sampling, graph rewriting, and transformer architecture improvements. We then further divide the strategies according to the coverage and goals of graph structure preservation. Furthermore, we also discuss challenges and future directions for graph transformer models to preserve the graph structure and understand the nature of graphs. ",

In this work, we study a special class of such problems where distributed state feedback controllers can give near-optimal performance. More specifically, we consider networked linear-quadratic controllers with decoupled costs and spatially exponentially decaying dynamics. We aim to exploit the structure in the problem to design a scalable reinforcement learning algorithm for learning a distributed controller. Recent work has shown that the optimal controller can be well approximated only using information from a $\\kappa$-neighborhood of each agent. Motivated by these results, we show that similar results hold for the agents' individual value and Q-functions. We continue by designing an algorithm, based on the actor-critic framework, to learn distributed controllers only using local information. Specifically, the Q-function is estimated by modifying the Least Squares Temporal Difference for Q-functions method to only use local information. The algorithm then updates the policy using gradient descent. Finally, we evaluate the algorithm through simulations that indeed suggest near-optimal performance. ",

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant poten- tial for many downstream tasks, including those requiring human- level intelligence, such as vulnerability detection. However, recent attempts to use LLMs for vulnerability detection are still prelim- inary, as they lack an in-depth understanding of a subject LLM's vulnerability reasoning capability - whether it originates from the model itself or from external assistance, such as invoking tool sup- port and retrieving vulnerability knowledge. In this paper, we aim to decouple LLMs' vulnerability reason- ing capability from their other capabilities, including the ability to actively seek additional information (e.g., via function calling in SOTA models), adopt relevant vulnerability knowledge (e.g., via vector-based matching and retrieval), and follow instructions to out- put structured results. To this end, we propose a unified evaluation framework named LLM4Vuln, which separates LLMs' vulnerability reasoning from their other capabilities and evaluates how LLMs' vulnerability reasoning could be enhanced when combined with the enhancement of other capabilities. To demonstrate the effectiveness of LLM4Vuln, we have designed controlled experiments using 75 ground-truth smart contract vulnerabilities, which were extensively audited as high-risk on Code4rena from August to November 2023, and tested them in 4,950 different scenarios across three represen- tative LLMs (GPT-4, Mixtral, and Code Llama). Our results not only reveal ten findings regarding the varying effects of knowledge en- hancement, context supplementation, prompt schemes, and models but also enable us to identify 9 zero-day vulnerabilities in two pilot bug bounty programs with over 1,000 USD being awarded.

For equalization, the GNN is build upon the factor graph representations of the channel, while for JED, the factor graph is expanded by the Tanner graph of the parity-check matrix (PCM) of the channel code, sharing the variable nodes (VNs). A particularly advantageous property of the GNN is the robustness against cycles in the factor graphs which is the main problem for belief propagation (BP)-based equalization. As a result of having a fully deep learning-based receiver, joint optimization instead of individual optimization of the components is enabled, so-called end-to-end learning. Furthermore, we propose a parallel flooding schedule that further reduces the latency, which turns out to improve also the error correcting performance. The proposed approach is analyzed and compared to state-of-the-art baselines in terms of error correcting capability and latency. At a fixed low latency, the flooding GNN for JED demonstrates a gain of 2.25 dB in bit error rate (BER) compared to an iterative Bahl--Cock--Jelinek--Raviv (BCJR)-BP baseline. ",

Existing studies have attempted to capture interactions between road entities by using the definite data in history timesteps, as future information is not available and involves high uncertainty. However, without sufficient guidance for capturing future states of interacting agents, they frequently produce unrealistic trajectory overlaps. In this work, we propose Future Interaction modeling for Motion Prediction (FIMP), which captures potential future interactions in an end-to-end manner. FIMP adopts a future decoder that implicitly extracts the potential future information in an intermediate feature-level, and identifies the interacting entity pairs through future affinity learning and top-k filtering strategy. Experiments show that our future interaction modeling improves the performance remarkably, leading to superior performance on the Argoverse motion forecasting benchmark. ",

    "abstract": "CONTEXT The R programming language has a huge and active community, especially in the area of statistical computing. Its interpreted nature allows for several interesting constructs, like the manipulation of functions at run-time, that hinder the static analysis of R programs. At the same time, there is a lack of existing research regarding how these features, or even the R language as a whole are used in practice. OBJECTIVE In this paper, we conduct a large-scale, static analysis of more than 50 million lines of real-world R programs and packages to identify their characteristics and the features that are actually used. Moreover, we compare the similarities and differences between the scripts of R users and the implementations of package authors. We provide insights for static analysis tools like the lintr package as well as potential interpreter optimizations and uncover areas for future research. METHOD We analyze 4230 R scripts submitted alongside publications and the sources of 19450 CRAN packages for over 350000 R files, collecting and summarizing quantitative information for features of interest. RESULTS We find a high frequency of name-based indexing operations, assignments, and loops, but a low frequency for most of R's reflective functions. Furthermore, we find neither testing functions nor many calls to R's foreign function interface (FFI) in the publication submissions. CONCLUSION R scripts and package sources differ, for example, in their size, the way they include other packages, and their usage of R's reflective capabilities. We provide features that are used frequently and should be prioritized by static analysis tools, like operator assignments, function calls, and certain reflective functions like load. ",

However, the dependency on the formula size is non-elementary, and in fact, this is unavoidable even for the class of all trees [Frick and Grohe, LICS 2002]. On the other hand, it is known that the dependency is elementary for classes of bounded degree [Frick and Grohe, LICS 2002] as well as for classes of bounded pathwidth [Lampis, ICALP 2023]. In this paper we generalise these results and almost completely characterise subgraph-closed graph classes for which the model checking problem is fixed-parameter tractable with an elementary dependency on the formula size. Those are the graph classes for which there exists a number $d$ such that for every $r$, some tree of depth $d$ and size bounded by an elementary function of $r$ is avoided as an $({\\leq} r)$-subdivision in all graphs in the class. In particular, this implies that if the class in question excludes a fixed tree as a topological minor, then first-order model checking for graphs in the class is fixed-parameter tractable with an elementary dependency on the formula size.

We propose a player pressure map to represent a given game scene, which lowers the dimension of raw data and still contains rich contextual information. Not only does it serve as an effective tool for visualizing and evaluating the pressure on the team and each individual, but it can also be utilized as a backbone for accessing players' performance. Overall, our model provides coaches and analysts with a deeper understanding of players' performance under pressure so that they make data-oriented tactical decisions. ",

We develop a novel approach for unsupervised abstractive summarisation that produces a two-layer summary consisting of both high-level information, covering aspects useful to clinical experts, as well as accompanying time sensitive evidence from a user's social media timeline. A key methodological novelty comes from the timeline summarisation component based on a version of hierarchical variational autoencoder (VAE) adapted to represent long texts and guided by LLM-annotated key phrases. The resulting timeline summary is input into a LLM (LLaMA-2) to produce the final summary containing both the high level information, obtained through instruction prompting, as well as corresponding evidence from the user's timeline. We assess the summaries generated by our novel architecture via automatic evaluation against expert written summaries and via human evaluation with clinical experts, showing that timeline summarisation by TH-VAE results in logically coherent summaries rich in clinical utility and superior to LLM-only approaches in capturing changes over time.

In this paper, we explore the uncharted territory of cross-silo FL with record-level personalized differential privacy. We devise a novel framework named rPDP-FL, employing a two-stage hybrid sampling scheme with both client-level sampling and non-uniform record-level sampling to accommodate varying privacy requirements. A critical and non-trivial problem is to select the ideal per-record sampling probability q given the personalized privacy budget {\\epsilon}. We introduce a versatile solution named Simulation-CurveFitting, allowing us to uncover a significant insight into the nonlinear correlation between q and {\\epsilon} and derive an elegant mathematical model to tackle the problem.

With the aim of addressing these limitations, we investigate regions which are composed of axis-aligned octagons. Such octagons are particularly easy to work with, as intersections and compositions can be straightforwardly computed, while they are still sufficiently expressive to model arbitrary knowledge graphs.

Vertex splitting has been used in contexts from circuit design to statistical analysis. In this work, we explore the computational complexity of achieving a given graph property $\\Pi$ by a limited number of vertex splits, formalized as the problem $\\Pi$ Vertex Splitting ($\\Pi$-VS). We focus on hereditary graph properties and contribute four groups of results: First, we classify the classical complexity of $\\Pi$-VS for graph properties characterized by forbidden subgraphs of size at most 3. Second, we provide a framework that allows to show NP-completeness whenever one can construct a combination of a forbidden subgraph and prescribed vertex splits that satisfy certain conditions. Leveraging this framework we show NP-completeness when $\\Pi$ is characterized by forbidden subgraphs that are sufficiently well connected. In particular, we show that $F$-Free-VS is NP-complete for each biconnected graph $F$. Third, we study infinite families of forbidden subgraphs, obtaining NP-hardness for Bipartite-VS and Perfect-VS. Finally, we touch upon the parameterized complexity of $\\Pi$-VS with respect to the number of allowed splits, showing para-NP-hardness for $K_3$-Free-VS and deriving an XP-algorithm when each vertex is only allowed to be split at most once.

    "abstract": "Pretrained Graph Neural Networks have been widely adopted for various molecular property prediction tasks. Despite their ability to encode structural and relational features of molecules, traditional fine-tuning of such pretrained GNNs on the target task can lead to poor generalization. To address this, we explore the adaptation of pretrained GNNs to the target task by jointly training them with multiple auxiliary tasks. This could enable the GNNs to learn both general and task-specific features, which may benefit the target task. However, a major challenge is to determine the relatedness of auxiliary tasks with the target task. To address this, we investigate multiple strategies to measure the relevance of auxiliary tasks and integrate such tasks by adaptively combining task gradients or by learning task weights via bi-level optimization. Additionally, we propose a novel gradient surgery-based approach, Rotation of Conflicting Gradients ($\\mathtt{RCGrad}$), that learns to align conflicting auxiliary task gradients through rotation. Our experiments with state-of-the-art pretrained GNNs demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed methods, with improvements of up to 7.7% over fine-tuning. This suggests that incorporating auxiliary tasks along with target task fine-tuning can be an effective way to improve the generalizability of pretrained GNNs for molecular property prediction. ",

    "abstract": "Heterogeneous Bayesian decentralized data fusion captures the set of problems in which two robots must combine two probability density functions over non-equal, but overlapping sets of random variables. In the context of multi-robot dynamic systems, this enables robots to take a \"divide and conquer\" approach to reason and share data over complementary tasks instead of over the full joint state space. For example, in a target tracking application, this allows robots to track different subsets of targets and share data on only common targets. This paper presents a framework by which robots can each use a local factor graph to represent relevant partitions of a complex global joint probability distribution, thus allowing them to avoid reasoning over the entirety of a more complex model and saving communication as well as computation costs. From a theoretical point of view, this paper makes contributions by casting the heterogeneous decentralized fusion problem in terms of a factor graph, analyzing the challenges that arise due to dynamic filtering, and then developing a new conservative filtering algorithm that ensures statistical correctness. From a practical point of view, we show how this framework can be used to represent different multi-robot applications and then test it with simulations and hardware experiments to validate and demonstrate its statistical conservativeness, applicability, and robustness to real-world challenges.

    "abstract": "Label-efficient LiDAR-based 3D object detection is currently dominated by weakly/semi-supervised methods. Instead of exclusively following one of them, we propose MixSup, a more practical paradigm simultaneously utilizing massive cheap coarse labels and a limited number of accurate labels for Mixed-grained Supervision. We start by observing that point clouds are usually textureless, making it hard to learn semantics. However, point clouds are geometrically rich and scale-invariant to the distances from sensors, making it relatively easy to learn the geometry of objects, such as poses and shapes. Thus, MixSup leverages massive coarse cluster-level labels to learn semantics and a few expensive box-level labels to learn accurate poses and shapes. We redesign the label assignment in mainstream detectors, which allows them seamlessly integrated into MixSup, enabling practicality and universality. We validate its effectiveness in nuScenes, Waymo Open Dataset, and KITTI, employing various detectors. MixSup achieves up to 97.31% of fully supervised performance, using cheap cluster annotations and only 10% box annotations. Furthermore, we propose PointSAM based on the Segment Anything Model for automated coarse labeling, further reducing the annotation burden.

The rapid development of Large Language Models (LLMs) has shown promising potential in software development, as well as opening up new possibilities in automated security code review. To explore the challenges of applying LLMs in practical code review for security defect detection, this study compared the detection performance of three state-of-the-art LLMs (Gemini Pro, GPT-4, and GPT-3.5) under five prompts on 549 code files that contain security defects from real-world code reviews. Through analyzing 82 responses generated by the best-performing LLM-prompt combination based on 100 randomly selected code files, we extracted and categorized quality problems present in these responses into 5 themes and 16 categories. Our results indicate that the responses produced by LLMs often suffer from verbosity, vagueness, and incompleteness, highlighting the necessity to enhance their conciseness, understandability, and compliance to security defect detection. This work reveals the deficiencies of LLM-generated responses in security code review and paves the way for future optimization of LLMs towards this task. ",

    "abstract": "We propose in this paper an optimal control framework for renewable energy communities (RECs) equipped with controllable assets. Such RECs allow its members to exchange production surplus through an internal market. The objective is to control their assets in order to minimise the sum of individual electricity bills. These bills account for the electricity exchanged through the REC and with the retailers. Typically, for large companies, another important part of the bills are the costs related to the power peaks; in our framework, they are determined from the energy exchanges with the retailers. We compare rule-based control strategies with the two following control algorithms. The first one is derived from model predictive control techniques, and the second one is built with reinforcement learning techniques. We also compare variants of these algorithms that neglect the peak power costs. Results confirm that using policies accounting for the power peaks lead to a significantly lower sum of electricity bills and thus better control strategies at the cost of higher computation time. Furthermore, policies trained with reinforcement learning approaches appear promising for real-time control of the communities, where model predictive control policies may be computationally expensive in practice. These findings encourage pursuing the efforts toward development of scalable control algorithms, operating from a centralised standpoint, for renewable energy communities equipped with controllable assets.

We propose a software architecture that efficiently combines complex event processing with remote sensing data from various satellite sensors to monitor air quality in NRT, giving support to decision-makers.

Automated evaluation metrics such as coherence are often used, however, their validity has been questioned for neural topic models (NTMs) and can overlook the benefits of a model in real world applications. To this end, we conduct the first evaluation of neural, supervised and classical topic models in an interactive task based setting. We combine topic models with a classifier and test their ability to help humans conduct content analysis and document annotation. From simulated, real user and expert pilot studies, the Contextual Neural Topic Model does the best on cluster evaluation metrics and human evaluations; however, LDA is competitive with two other NTMs under our simulated experiment and user study results, contrary to what coherence scores suggest. We show that current automated metrics do not provide a complete picture of topic modeling capabilities, but the right choice of NTMs can be better than classical models on practical tasks. ",

ConFit first creates an augmented resume-job dataset by paraphrasing specific sections in a resume or a job post. Then, ConFit uses contrastive learning to further increase training samples from $B$ pairs per batch to $O(B^2)$ per batch. We evaluate ConFit on two real-world datasets and find it outperforms prior methods (including BM25 and OpenAI text-ada-002) by up to 19% and 31% absolute in nDCG@10 for ranking jobs and ranking resumes, respectively.

Another effective defense technique based on adversarial purification (AP) can enhance generalization but cannot achieve optimal robustness. Meanwhile, both methods share one common limitation on the degraded standard accuracy. To mitigate these issues, we propose a novel framework called Adversarial Training on Purification (AToP), which comprises two components: perturbation destruction by random transforms (RT) and purifier model fine-tuned (FT) by adversarial loss. RT is essential to avoid overlearning to known attacks resulting in the robustness generalization to unseen attacks and FT is essential for the improvement of robustness. To evaluate our method in an efficient and scalable way, we conduct extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNette to demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art results and exhibits generalization ability against unseen attacks.

    "abstract": "As more connectome data become available, the question of how to best analyse the structure of biological neural networks becomes increasingly pertinent. In brain networks, knowing that two areas are connected is often not sufficient, as the directionality and weight of the connection affect the dynamics in crucial ways. Still, the methods commonly used to estimate network properties, such as clustering and small-worldness, usually disregard features encoded in the directionality and strength of network connections. To address this issue, we propose using fully-weighted and directed clustering measures that provide higher sensitivity to non-random structural features. Using artificial networks, we demonstrate the problems with methods routinely used in the field and how fully-weighted and directed methods can alleviate them. Specifically, we highlight their robustness to noise and their ability to address thresholding issues, particularly in inferred networks. We further apply our method to the connectomes of different species and uncover regularities and correlations between neuronal structures and functions that cannot be detected with traditional clustering metrics. Finally, we extend the notion of small-worldness in brain networks to account for weights and directionality and show that some connectomes can no longer be considered ``small-world''. Overall, our study makes a case for a combined use of fully-weighted and directed measures to deal with the variability of brain networks and suggests the presence of complex patterns in neural connectivity that can only be revealed using such methods.

    "abstract": "The unrolling method has been investigated for learning variational models in X-ray computed tomography. However, it has been observed that directly unrolling the regularization model through gradient descent does not produce satisfactory results. In this paper, we present a novel deep learning-based CT reconstruction model, where the low-resolution image is introduced to obtain an effective regularization term for improving the network`s robustness. Our approach involves constructing the backbone network architecture by algorithm unrolling that is realized using the deep equilibrium architecture. We theoretically discuss the convergence of the proposed low-resolution prior equilibrium model and provide the conditions to guarantee convergence. Experimental results on both sparse-view and limited-angle reconstruction problems are provided, demonstrating that our end-to-end low-resolution prior equilibrium model outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in terms of noise reduction, contrast-to-noise ratio, and preservation of edge details.

    "abstract": "Training machine learning and statistical models often involves optimizing a data-driven risk criterion. The risk is usually computed with respect to the empirical data distribution, but this may result in poor and unstable out-of-sample performance due to distributional uncertainty. In the spirit of distributionally robust optimization, we propose a novel robust criterion by combining insights from Bayesian nonparametric (i.e., Dirichlet Process) theory and recent decision-theoretic models of smooth ambiguity-averse preferences. First, we highlight novel connections with standard regularized empirical risk minimization techniques, among which Ridge and LASSO regressions. Then, we theoretically demonstrate the existence of favorable finite-sample and asymptotic statistical guarantees on the performance of the robust optimization procedure. For practical implementation, we propose and study tractable approximations of the criterion based on well-known Dirichlet Process representations. We also show that the smoothness of the criterion naturally leads to standard gradient-based numerical optimization. Finally, we provide insights into the workings of our method by applying it to high-dimensional sparse linear regression and robust location parameter estimation tasks. ",

    "title": "On the Statistical Properties of Generative Adversarial Models for Low  Intrinsic Data Dimension",
    "abstract": "Despite the remarkable empirical successes of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), the theoretical guarantees for their statistical accuracy remain rather pessimistic. In particular, the data distributions on which GANs are applied, such as natural images, are often hypothesized to have an intrinsic low-dimensional structure in a typically high-dimensional feature space, but this is often not reflected in the derived rates in the state-of-the-art analyses. In this paper, we attempt to bridge the gap between the theory and practice of GANs and their bidirectional variant, Bi-directional GANs (BiGANs), by deriving statistical guarantees on the estimated densities in terms of the intrinsic dimension of the data and the latent space. We analytically show that if one has access to $n$ samples from the unknown target distribution and the network architectures are properly chosen, the expected Wasserstein-1 distance of the estimates from the target scales as $O\\left( n^{-1/d_\\mu } \\right)$ for GANs and $O\\left( n^{-1/(d_\\mu+\\ell)} \\right)$ for BiGANs, where $d_\\mu$ and $\\ell$ are the upper Wasserstein-1 dimension of the data-distribution and latent-space dimension, respectively. The theoretical analyses not only suggest that these methods successfully avoid the curse of dimensionality, in the sense that the exponent of $n$ in the error rates does not depend on the data dimension but also serve to bridge the gap between the theoretical analyses of GANs and the known sharp rates from optimal transport literature. Additionally, we demonstrate that GANs can effectively achieve the minimax optimal rate even for non-smooth underlying distributions, with the use of larger generator networks. ",

Yet, most existing approaches focus on a centralized setup, which is not computationally scalable while failing to protect data privacy. The robustness against unknown disturbances has not been well addressed either, causing safety concerns. In this paper, we propose a decentralized robust DeeP-LCC (Data-EnablEd Predictive Leading Cruise Control) approach for CAVs to smooth mixed traffic flow. In particular, each CAV computes its control input based on locally available data from its involved subsystem. Meanwhile, the interaction between neighboring subsystems is modeled as a bounded disturbance, for which appropriate estimation methods are proposed. Then, we formulate a robust optimization problem and present its tractable computational solutions. Compared with the centralized formulation, our method greatly reduces computation burden with better safety performance, while naturally preserving data privacy. Extensive traffic simulations validate its wave-dampening ability, safety performance, and computational benefits. ",

    "abstract": "The application of Graph Neural Networks (GNN) in track reconstruction is a promising approach to cope with the challenges arising at the High-Luminosity upgrade of the Large Hadron Collider (HL-LHC). GNNs show good track-finding performance in high-multiplicity scenarios and are naturally parallelizable on heterogeneous compute architectures. Typical high-energy-physics detectors have high resolution in the innermost layers to support vertex reconstruction but lower resolution in the outer parts. GNNs mainly rely on 3D space-point information, which can cause reduced track-finding performance in the outer regions. In this contribution, we present a novel combination of GNN-based track finding with the classical Combinatorial Kalman Filter (CKF) algorithm to circumvent this issue: The GNN resolves the track candidates in the inner pixel region, where 3D space points can represent measurements very well. These candidates are then picked up by the CKF in the outer regions, where the CKF performs well even for 1D measurements. Using the ACTS infrastructure, we present a proof of concept based on truth tracking in the pixels as well as a dedicated GNN pipeline trained on $t\\bar{t}$ events with pile-up 200 in the OpenDataDetector.

    "abstract": "Background: Recent studies have used basic epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) assessments (e.g., volume and mean HU) to predict risk of atherosclerosis-related, major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE). Objectives: Create novel, hand-crafted EAT features, 'fat-omics', to capture the pathophysiology of EAT and improve MACE prediction. Methods: We segmented EAT using a previously-validated deep learning method with optional manual correction. We extracted 148 radiomic features (morphological, spatial, and intensity) and used Cox elastic-net for feature reduction and prediction of MACE. Results: Traditional fat features gave marginal prediction (EAT-volume/EAT-mean-HU/ BMI gave C-index 0.53/0.55/0.57, respectively). Significant improvement was obtained with 15 fat-omics features (C-index=0.69, test set). High-risk features included volume-of-voxels-having-elevated-HU-[-50, -30-HU] and HU-negative-skewness, both of which assess high HU, which as been implicated in fat inflammation. Other high-risk features include kurtosis-of-EAT-thickness, reflecting the heterogeneity of thicknesses, and EAT-volume-in-the-top-25%-of-the-heart, emphasizing adipose near the proximal coronary arteries. Kaplan-Meyer plots of Cox-identified, high- and low-risk patients were well separated with the median of the fat-omics risk, while high-risk group having HR 2.4 times that of the low-risk group (P<0.001). Conclusion: Preliminary findings indicate an opportunity to use more finely tuned, explainable assessments on EAT for improved cardiovascular risk prediction. ",

    "abstract": "Over the past years, pseudo-healthy reconstruction for unsupervised anomaly detection has gained in popularity. This approach has the great advantage of not requiring tedious pixel-wise data annotation and offers possibility to generalize to any kind of anomalies, including that corresponding to rare diseases. By training a deep generative model with only images from healthy subjects, the model will learn to reconstruct pseudo-healthy images. This pseudo-healthy reconstruction is then compared to the input to detect and localize anomalies. The evaluation of such methods often relies on a ground truth lesion mask that is available for test data, which may not exist depending on the application. We propose an evaluation procedure based on the simulation of realistic abnormal images to validate pseudo-healthy reconstruction methods when no ground truth is available. This allows us to extensively test generative models on different kinds of anomalies and measuring their performance using the pair of normal and abnormal images corresponding to the same subject. It can be used as a preliminary automatic step to validate the capacity of a generative model to reconstruct pseudo-healthy images, before a more advanced validation step that would require clinician's expertise. We apply this framework to the reconstruction of 3D brain FDG PET using a convolutional variational autoencoder with the aim to detect as early as possible the neurodegeneration markers that are specific to dementia such as Alzheimer's disease.

The notions of output controllability and functional observability are generalizations that enable respectively the control and estimation of part of the state vector. These generalizations are of utmost importance in applications to high-dimensional systems, such as large-scale networks, in which only a target subset of variables (nodes) are sought to be controlled or estimated. Although the duality between controllability and observability is well established, the characterization of the duality between their generalized counterparts remains an outstanding problem. Here, we establish both the weak and the strong duality between output controllability and functional observability. Specifically, we show that functional observability of a system implies output controllability of a dual system (weak duality), and that under a certain condition the converse also holds (strong duality). As an application of the strong duality principle, we derive a necessary and sufficient condition for target control via static feedback. This allow us to establish a separation principle between the design of a feedback target controller and the design of a functional observer in closed-loop systems. These results generalize the well-known duality and separation principles in modern control theory. ",
