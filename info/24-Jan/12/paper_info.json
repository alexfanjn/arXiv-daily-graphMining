    "abstract": "Robustness certification, which aims to formally certify the predictions of neural networks against adversarial inputs, has become an integral part of important tool for safety-critical applications. Despite considerable progress, existing certification methods are limited to elementary architectures, such as convolutional networks, recurrent networks and recently Transformers, on benchmark datasets such as MNIST. In this paper, we focus on the robustness certification of scene text recognition (STR), which is a complex and extensively deployed image-based sequence prediction problem. We tackle three types of STR model architectures, including the standard STR pipelines and the Vision Transformer. We propose STR-Cert, the first certification method for STR models, by significantly extending the DeepPoly polyhedral verification framework via deriving novel polyhedral bounds and algorithms for key STR model components. Finally, we certify and compare STR models on six datasets, demonstrating the efficiency and scalability of robustness certification, particularly for the Vision Transformer. ",

    "title": "Developing a Resource-Constraint EdgeAI model for Surface Defect  Detection",
    "abstract": "Resource constraints have restricted several EdgeAI applications to machine learning inference approaches, where models are trained on the cloud and deployed to the edge device. This poses challenges such as bandwidth, latency, and privacy associated with storing data off-site for model building. Training on the edge device can overcome these challenges by eliminating the need to transfer data to another device for storage and model development. On-device training also provides robustness to data variations as models can be retrained on newly acquired data to improve performance. We, therefore, propose a lightweight EdgeAI architecture modified from Xception, for on-device training in a resource-constraint edge environment. We evaluate our model on a PCB defect detection task and compare its performance against existing lightweight models - MobileNetV2, EfficientNetV2B0, and MobileViT-XXS. The results of our experiment show that our model has a remarkable performance with a test accuracy of 73.45% without pre-training. This is comparable to the test accuracy of non-pre-trained MobileViT-XXS (75.40%) and much better than other non-pre-trained models (MobileNetV2 - 50.05%, EfficientNetV2B0 - 54.30%). The test accuracy of our model without pre-training is comparable to pre-trained MobileNetV2 model - 75.45% and better than pre-trained EfficientNetV2B0 model - 58.10%. In terms of memory efficiency, our model performs better than EfficientNetV2B0 and MobileViT-XXS. We find that the resource efficiency of machine learning models does not solely depend on the number of parameters but also depends on architectural considerations. Our method can be applied to other resource-constraint applications while maintaining significant performance. ",

    "abstract": "Architectures that incorporate Computing-in-Memory (CiM) using emerging non-volatile memory (NVM) devices have become strong contenders for deep neural network (DNN) acceleration due to their impressive energy efficiency. Yet, a significant challenge arises when using these emerging devices: they can show substantial variations during the weight-mapping process. This can severely impact DNN accuracy if not mitigated. A widely accepted remedy for imperfect weight mapping is the iterative write-verify approach, which involves verifying conductance values and adjusting devices if needed. In all existing publications, this procedure is applied to every individual device, resulting in a significant programming time overhead. In our research, we illustrate that only a small fraction of weights need this write-verify treatment for the corresponding devices and the DNN accuracy can be preserved, yielding a notable programming acceleration. Building on this, we introduce USWIM, a novel method based on the second derivative. It leverages a single iteration of forward and backpropagation to pinpoint the weights demanding write-verify. Through extensive tests on diverse DNN designs and datasets, USWIM manifests up to a 10x programming acceleration against the traditional exhaustive write-verify method, all while maintaining a similar accuracy level. Furthermore, compared to our earlier SWIM technique, USWIM excels, showing a 7x speedup when dealing with devices exhibiting non-uniform variations. ",

    "title": "DualTeacher: Bridging Coexistence of Unlabelled Classes for  Semi-supervised Incremental Object Detection",
    "abstract": "In real-world applications, an object detector often encounters object instances from new classes and needs to accommodate them effectively. Previous work formulated this critical problem as incremental object detection (IOD), which assumes the object instances of new classes to be fully annotated in incremental data. However, as supervisory signals are usually rare and expensive, the supervised IOD may not be practical for implementation. In this work, we consider a more realistic setting named semi-supervised IOD (SSIOD), where the object detector needs to learn new classes incrementally from a few labelled data and massive unlabelled data without catastrophic forgetting of old classes. A commonly-used strategy for supervised IOD is to encourage the current model (as a student) to mimic the behavior of the old model (as a teacher), but it generally fails in SSIOD because a dominant number of object instances from old and new classes are coexisting and unlabelled, with the teacher only recognizing a fraction of them. Observing that learning only the classes of interest tends to preclude detection of other classes, we propose to bridge the coexistence of unlabelled classes by constructing two teacher models respectively for old and new classes, and using the concatenation of their predictions to instruct the student. This approach is referred to as DualTeacher, which can serve as a strong baseline for SSIOD with limited resource overhead and no extra hyperparameters. We build various benchmarks for SSIOD and perform extensive experiments to demonstrate the superiority of our approach (e.g., the performance lead is up to 18.28 AP on MS-COCO).

Recent successes in machine learning have prompted the usage of evolutionary computation, especially genetic programming to evolve computer programs that effectively forage a multidimensional search space to iteratively find better solutions that explain network structure. Symbolic regression contributes to these approaches by replicating network morphologies using both structure and processes, all while not relying on the scientists intuition or expertise. It distinguishes itself by introducing a novel formulation of a network generator and a parameter-free fitness function to evaluate the generated network and is found to consistently retrieve synthetically generated growth processes as well as simple, interpretable rules for a range of empirical networks. We extend this approach by modifying generator semantics to create and retrieve rules for time-varying networks. Lexicon to study networks created dynamically in multiple stages is introduced. The framework was improved using methods from the genetic programming toolkit (recombination) and computational improvements (using heuristic distance measures) and used to test the consistency and robustness of the upgrades to the semantics using synthetically generated networks. Using recombination was found to improve retrieval rate and fitness of the solutions. The framework was then used on three empirical datasets - subway networks of major cities, regions of street networks and semantic co-occurrence networks of literature in Artificial Intelligence to illustrate the possibility of obtaining interpretable, decentralised growth processes from complex networks.

However, as a common problem, dynamic graph representation learning faces challenges such as high complexity and large memory overheads. Current work often uses SNNs instead of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) by using binary features instead of continuous ones for efficient training, which would overlooks graph structure information and leads to the loss of details during propagation. Additionally, optimizing dynamic spiking models typically requires propagation of information across time steps, which increases memory requirements. To address these challenges, we present a framework named \\underline{Dy}namic \\underline{S}p\\underline{i}king \\underline{G}raph \\underline{N}eural Networks (\\method{}). To mitigate the information loss problem, \\method{} propagates early-layer information directly to the last layer for information compensation. To accommodate the memory requirements, we apply the implicit differentiation on the equilibrium state, which does not rely on the exact reverse of the forward computation. While traditional implicit differentiation methods are usually used for static situations, \\method{} extends it to the dynamic graph setting. Extensive experiments on three large-scale real-world dynamic graph datasets validate the effectiveness of \\method{} on dynamic node classification tasks with lower computational costs. ",

    "abstract": "The inherent characteristics and light fluctuations of water bodies give rise to the huge difference between different layers and regions in underwater environments. When the test set is collected in a different marine area from the training set, the issue of domain shift emerges, significantly compromising the model's ability to generalize. The Domain Adversarial Learning (DAL) training strategy has been previously utilized to tackle such challenges. However, DAL heavily depends on manually one-hot domain labels, which implies no difference among the samples in the same domain. Such an assumption results in the instability of DAL. This paper introduces the concept of Domain Similarity-Perceived Label Assignment (DSP). The domain label for each image is regarded as its similarity to the specified domains. Through domain-specific data augmentation techniques, we achieved state-of-the-art results on the underwater cross-domain object detection benchmark S-UODAC2020.

But these models can have uncertain provenance, opening up the possibility that they embed hidden malicious behavior such as trojans or backdoors, where small changes to an input (triggers) can cause the model to produce incorrect outputs (e.g., to misclassify). This paper introduces a novel approach to backdoor detection that uses two tensor decomposition methods applied to network activations. This has a number of advantages relative to existing detection methods, including the ability to analyze multiple models at the same time, working across a wide variety of network architectures, making no assumptions about the nature of triggers used to alter network behavior, and being computationally efficient. We provide a detailed description of the detection pipeline along with results on models trained on the MNIST digit dataset, CIFAR-10 dataset, and two difficult datasets from NIST's TrojAI competition. These results show that our method detects backdoored networks more accurately and efficiently than current state-of-the-art methods. ",

Automated essay scoring (AES) research has made strides in evaluating written essays, but it often overlooks the specific needs of English Language Learners (ELLs) in language development. This study explores the application of BERT-related techniques to enhance the assessment of ELLs' writing proficiency within AES. To address the specific needs of ELLs, we propose the use of DeBERTa, a state-of-the-art neural language model, for improving automated feedback tools. DeBERTa, pretrained on large text corpora using self-supervised learning, learns universal language representations adaptable to various natural language understanding tasks. The model incorporates several innovative techniques, including adversarial training through Adversarial Weights Perturbation (AWP) and Metric-specific AttentionPooling (6 kinds of AP) for each label in the competition. The primary focus of this research is to investigate the impact of hyperparameters, particularly the adversarial learning rate, on the performance of the model. By fine-tuning the hyperparameter tuning process, including the influence of 6AP and AWP, the resulting models can provide more accurate evaluations of language proficiency and support tailored learning tasks for ELLs.

    "abstract": "With the help of special neuromorphic hardware, spiking neural networks (SNNs) are expected to realize artificial intelligence (AI) with less energy consumption. It provides a promising energy-efficient way for realistic control tasks by combining SNNs with deep reinforcement learning (DRL). In this paper, we focus on the task where the agent needs to learn multi-dimensional deterministic policies to control, which is very common in real scenarios. Recently, the surrogate gradient method has been utilized for training multi-layer SNNs, which allows SNNs to achieve comparable performance with the corresponding deep networks in this task. Most existing spike-based RL methods take the firing rate as the output of SNNs, and convert it to represent continuous action space (i.e., the deterministic policy) through a fully-connected (FC) layer. However, the decimal characteristic of the firing rate brings the floating-point matrix operations to the FC layer, making the whole SNN unable to deploy on the neuromorphic hardware directly. To develop a fully spiking actor network without any floating-point matrix operations, we draw inspiration from the non-spiking interneurons found in insects and employ the membrane voltage of the non-spiking neurons to represent the action. Before the non-spiking neurons, multiple population neurons are introduced to decode different dimensions of actions. Since each population is used to decode a dimension of action, we argue that the neurons in each population should be connected in time domain and space domain. Hence, the intra-layer connections are used in output populations to enhance the representation capacity. Finally, we propose a fully spiking actor network with intra-layer connections (ILC-SAN). ",

This also hinders the knowledge interaction between humans and NN, preventing humans from getting involved to give direct guidance when NN's decisions go wrong. While recent research in explainable AI has achieved interpretability of NN from various perspectives, it has not yet provided effective methods for knowledge exchange between humans and NN. To address this problem, we constructed a two-way interaction interface that uses structured representations of visual concepts and their relationships as the \"language\" for knowledge exchange between humans and NN. Specifically, NN provide intuitive reasoning explanations to humans based on the class-specific structural concepts graph (C-SCG). On the other hand, humans can modify the biases present in the C-SCG through their prior knowledge and reasoning ability, and thus provide direct knowledge guidance to NN through this interface. Through experimental validation, based on this interaction interface, NN can provide humans with easily understandable explanations of the reasoning process. Furthermore, human involvement and prior knowledge can directly and effectively contribute to enhancing the performance of NN. ",

FPRF efficiently stylizes large-scale 3D scenes by introducing a style-decomposed 3D neural radiance field, which inherits AdaIN's feed-forward stylization machinery, supporting arbitrary style reference images. Furthermore, FPRF supports multi-reference stylization with the semantic correspondence matching and local AdaIN, which adds diverse user control for 3D scene styles. FPRF also preserves multi-view consistency by applying semantic matching and style transfer processes directly onto queried features in 3D space.

    "abstract": "Ensemble methods exploit the availability of a given number of classifiers or detectors trained in single or multiple source domains and tasks to address machine learning problems such as domain adaptation or multi-source transfer learning. Existing research measures the domain distance between the sources and the target dataset, trains multiple networks on the same data with different samples per class, or combines predictions from models trained under varied hyperparameters and settings. Their solutions enhanced the performance on small or tail categories but hurt the rest. To this end, we propose a modified consensus focus for semi-supervised and long-tailed object detection. We introduce a voting system based on source confidence that spots the contribution of each model in a consensus, lets the user choose the relevance of each class in the target label space so that it relaxes minority bounding boxes suppression, and combines multiple models' results without discarding the poisonous networks. Our tests on synthetic driving datasets retrieved higher confidence and more accurate bounding boxes than the NMS, soft-NMS, and WBF. ",

    "abstract": "Social engineering (SE) aims at deceiving users into performing actions that may compromise their security and privacy. These threats exploit weaknesses in human's decision making processes by using tactics such as pretext, baiting, impersonation, etc. On the web, SE attacks include attack classes such as scareware, tech support scams, survey scams, sweepstakes, etc., which can result in sensitive data leaks, malware infections, and monetary loss. For instance, US consumers lose billions of dollars annually due to various SE attacks. Unfortunately, generic social engineering attacks remain understudied, compared to other important threats, such as software vulnerabilities and exploitation, network intrusions, malicious software, and phishing. The few existing technical studies that focus on social engineering are limited in scope and mostly focus on measurements rather than developing a generic defense. To fill this gap, we present SEShield, a framework for in-browser detection of social engineering attacks. SEShield consists of three main components: (i) a custom security crawler, called SECrawler, that is dedicated to scouting the web to collect examples of in-the-wild SE attacks; (ii) SENet, a deep learning-based image classifier trained on data collected by SECrawler that aims to detect the often glaring visual traits of SE attack pages; and (iii) SEGuard, a proof-of-concept extension that embeds SENet into the web browser and enables real-time SE attack detection. We perform an extensive evaluation of our system and show that SENet is able to detect new instances of SE attacks with a detection rate of up to 99.6% at 1% false positive, thus providing an effective first defense against SE attacks on the web.

    "abstract": "Self-supervised learning has become a popular way to pretrain a deep learning model and then transfer it to perform downstream tasks. However, most of these methods are developed on large-scale image datasets that contain natural objects with clear textures, outlines, and distinct color contrasts. It remains uncertain whether these methods are equally effective for medical imaging, where the regions of interest often blend subtly and indistinctly with the surrounding tissues. In this study, we propose an alternative method that uses contralateral mammograms to train a neural network to encode similar embeddings when a pair contains both normal images and different embeddings when a pair contains normal and abnormal images. Our approach leverages the natural symmetry of human body as weak labels to learn to distinguish abnormal lesions from background tissues in a fully unsupervised manner. Our findings suggest that it's feasible by incorporating soft labels derived from the Euclidean distances between the embeddings of the image pairs into the Siamese network loss. Our method demonstrates superior performance in mammogram patch classification compared to existing self-supervised learning methods. This approach not only leverages a vast amount of image data effectively but also minimizes reliance on costly labels, a significant advantage particularly in the field of medical imaging. ",

While machine learning has demonstrated significant potential for measuring blood flow index (BFi), an open question concerning the success of this approach pertains to its robustness in scenarios involving deviations between datasets with varying Signal-to-Noise Ratios (SNRs) originating from diverse clinical applications and various setups. This study proposes a transfer learning approach, aims to assess the influence of SNRs on the generalization ability of learned features, and demonstrate the robustness for transfer learning. A synthetic dataset with varying levels of added noise is utilized to simulate different SNRs. The proposed network takes a 1x64 autocorrelation curve as input and generates BFi and the correlation parameter beta. The proposed model demonstrates excellent performance across different SNRs, exhibiting enhanced fitting accuracy, particularly for low SNR datasets when compared with other fitting methods.

We present a novel approach that effectively identifies unknown objects by distinguishing between high and low-density regions in latent space. Our method builds upon the Open-Det (OD) framework, introducing two new elements to the loss function. These elements enhance the known embedding space's clustering and expand the unknown space's low-density regions. The first addition is the Class Wasserstein Anchor (CWA), a new function that refines the classification boundaries. The second is a spectral normalisation step, improving the robustness of the model. Together, these augmentations to the existing Contrastive Feature Learner (CFL) and Unknown Probability Learner (UPL) loss functions significantly improve OSOD performance. Our proposed OpenDet-CWA (OD-CWA) method demonstrates: a) a reduction in open-set errors by approximately 17%-22%, b) an enhancement in novelty detection capability by 1.5%-16%, and c) a decrease in the wilderness index by 2%-20% across various open-set scenarios. These results represent a substantial advancement in the field, showcasing the potential of our approach in managing the complexities of open-set object detection. ",

    "abstract": "Low-resource languages (LRLs) face challenges in supervised neural machine translation due to limited parallel data, prompting research into unsupervised methods. Unsupervised neural machine translation (UNMT) methods, including back-translation, transfer learning, and pivot-based translation, offer practical solutions for LRL translation, but they are hindered by issues like synthetic data noise, language bias, and error propagation, which can potentially be mitigated by Large Language Models (LLMs). LLMs have advanced NMT with in-context learning (ICL) and supervised fine-tuning methods, but insufficient training data results in poor performance in LRLs. We argue that LLMs can mitigate the linguistic noise with auxiliary languages to improve translations in LRLs. In this paper, we propose Probability-driven Meta-graph Prompter (POMP), a novel approach employing a dynamic, sampling-based graph of multiple auxiliary languages to enhance LLMs' translation capabilities for LRLs. POMP involves constructing a directed acyclic meta-graph for each source language, from which we dynamically sample multiple paths to prompt LLMs to mitigate the linguistic noise and improve translations during training. We use the BLEURT metric to evaluate the translations and back-propagate rewards, estimated by scores, to update the probabilities of auxiliary languages in the paths. Our experiments show significant improvements in the translation quality of three LRLs, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach. ",

This research examines how the end-user configuration of these tools is shaped by four critical psychosocial factors - fear of missing out (FoMO), social media addiction, subjective norms, and trust in moderation systems. Findings from a nationally representative sample of 1,061 participants show that FoMO and social media addiction make Facebook users more vulnerable to content-based harms by reducing their likelihood of adopting personal moderation tools to hide inappropriate posts. In contrast, descriptive and injunctive norms positively influence the use of these tools. Further, trust in Facebook's moderation systems also significantly affects users' engagement with personal moderation. This analysis highlights qualitatively different pathways through which FoMO and social media addiction make affected users disproportionately unsafe and offers design and policy solutions to address this challenge.

We find that proprietary models such as GPT-4V and Gemini Pro significantly outperform all other tested models. However, even the best model has a final accuracy of just 24%, highlighting the need for substantial improvements in reasoning. Further, models rarely understand all parts of a puzzle, and are almost always incapable of retroactively explaining the correct answer.

    "abstract": "Due to the successful application of deep learning, audio spoofing detection has made significant progress. Spoofed audio with speech synthesis or voice conversion can be well detected by many countermeasures. However, an automatic speaker verification system is still vulnerable to spoofing attacks such as replay or Deep-Fake audio. Deep-Fake audio means that the spoofed utterances are generated using text-to-speech (TTS) and voice conversion (VC) algorithms. Here, we propose a novel framework based on hybrid features with the self-attention mechanism. It is expected that hybrid features can be used to get more discrimination capacity. Firstly, instead of only one type of conventional feature, deep learning features and Mel-spectrogram features will be extracted by two parallel paths: convolution neural networks and a short-time Fourier transform (STFT) followed by Mel-frequency. Secondly, features will be concatenated by a max-pooling layer. Thirdly, there is a Self-attention mechanism for focusing on essential elements. Finally, ResNet and a linear layer are built to get the results. Experimental results reveal that the hybrid features, compared with conventional features, can cover more details of an utterance. We achieve the best Equal Error Rate (EER) of 9.67\\% in the physical access (PA) scenario and 8.94\\% in the Deep fake task on the ASVspoof 2021 dataset. Compared with the best baseline system, the proposed approach improves by 74.60\\% and 60.05\\%, respectively. ",

    "abstract": "In 1996, Karger [Kar96] gave a startling randomized algorithm that finds a minimum-cut in a (weighted) graph in time $O(m\\log^3n)$ which he termed near-linear time meaning linear (in the size of the input) times a polylogarthmic factor. In this paper, we give the first deterministic algorithm which runs in near-linear time for weighted graphs. Previously, the breakthrough results of Kawarabayashi and Thorup [KT19] gave a near-linear time algorithm for simple graphs. The main technique here is a clustering procedure that perfectly preserves minimum cuts. Recently, Li [Li21] gave an $m^{1+o(1)}$ deterministic minimum-cut algorithm for weighted graphs; this form of running time has been termed \"almost-linear''. Li uses almost-linear time deterministic expander decompositions which do not perfectly preserve minimum cuts, but he can use these clusterings to, in a sense, \"derandomize'' the methods of Karger. In terms of techniques, we provide a structural theorem that says there exists a sparse clustering that preserves minimum cuts in a weighted graph with $o(1)$ error. In addition, we construct it deterministically in near linear time. This was done exactly for simple graphs in [KT19, HRW20] and with polylogarithmic error for weighted graphs in [Li21]. Extending the techniques in [KT19, HRW20] to weighted graphs presents significant challenges, and moreover, the algorithm can only polylogarithmically approximately preserve minimum cuts. A remaining challenge is to reduce the polylogarithmic-approximate clusterings to $1+o(1/\\log n)$-approximate so that they can be applied recursively as in [Li21] over $O(\\log n)$ many levels. This is an additional challenge that requires building on properties of tree-packings in the presence of a wide range of edge weights to, for example, find sources for local flow computations which identify minimum cuts that cross clusters.

However, the task of finding a CBF that concurrently maximizes the volume of the resulting control invariant set while accommodating complex safety constraints, particularly in high relative degree systems with actuation constraints, continues to pose a substantial challenge. In this work, we propose a novel self-supervised learning framework that holistically addresses these hurdles. Given a Boolean composition of multiple state constraints that define the safe set, our approach starts with building a single continuously differentiable function whose 0-superlevel set provides an inner approximation of the safe set. We then use this function together with a smooth neural network to parameterize the CBF candidate. Finally, we design a training loss function based on a Hamilton-Jacobi partial differential equation to train the CBF while enlarging the volume of the induced control invariant set. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach via numerical experiments. ",

    "abstract": "Dynamic data race detection has emerged as a key technique for ensuring reliability of concurrent software in practice. However, dynamic approaches can often miss data races owing to nondeterminism in the thread scheduler. Predictive race detection techniques cater to this shortcoming by inferring alternate executions that may expose data races without re-executing the underlying program. More formally, the dynamic data race prediction problem asks, given a trace \\sigma of an execution of a concurrent program, can \\sigma be correctly reordered to expose a data race? Existing state-of-the art techniques for data race prediction either do not scale to executions arising from real world concurrent software, or only expose a limited class of data races, such as those that can be exposed without reversing the order of synchronization operations. In general, exposing data races by reasoning about synchronization reversals is an intractable problem. In this work, we identify a class of data races, called Optimistic Sync(hronization)-Reversal races that can be detected in a tractable manner and often include non-trivial data races that cannot be exposed by prior tractable techniques. We also propose a sound algorithm OSR for detecting all optimistic sync-reversal data races in overall quadratic time, and show that the algorithm is optimal by establishing a matching lower bound. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of OSR on our extensive suite of benchmarks, OSR reports the largest number of data races, and scales well to large execution traces. ",

    "abstract": "Cloth-changing person re-identification (CC-ReID) aims to match persons who change clothes over long periods. The key challenge in CC-ReID is to extract clothing-independent features, such as face, hairstyle, body shape, and gait. Current research mainly focuses on modeling body shape using multi-modal biological features (such as silhouettes and sketches). However, it does not fully leverage the personal description information hidden in the original RGB image. Considering that there are certain attribute descriptions which remain unchanged after the changing of cloth, we propose a Masked Attribute Description Embedding (MADE) method that unifies personal visual appearance and attribute description for CC-ReID. Specifically, handling variable clothing-sensitive information, such as color and type, is challenging for effective modeling. To address this, we mask the clothing and color information in the personal attribute description extracted through an attribute detection model. The masked attribute description is then connected and embedded into Transformer blocks at various levels, fusing it with the low-level to high-level features of the image. This approach compels the model to discard clothing information. Experiments are conducted on several CC-ReID benchmarks, including PRCC, LTCC, Celeb-reID-light, and LaST. Results demonstrate that MADE effectively utilizes attribute description, enhancing cloth-changing person re-identification performance, and compares favorably with state-of-the-art methods.

Also, we try to explore cross-triplet dependencies by jointly considering instance-level, semantic-level, and layout-level relations. Besides, we leverage the CLIP model to assist our SCTC obtain interaction-aware feature by knowledge distillation, which provides useful action clues for HOI detection.

These diverse characteristics and the relentless evolution of cyber attacks have led cyber defense to adopt modern approaches like Machine Learning to bolster defensive measures and break the attack life cycle. Among the adopted ML approaches, Graph Neural Networks have emerged as a promising approach for enhancing the effectiveness of defensive measures due to their ability to process and learn from heterogeneous cyber threat data. In this paper, we look into the application of GNNs in aiding to break each stage of one of the most renowned attack life cycles, the Lockheed Martin Cyber Kill Chain.

    "title": "HiCMAE: Hierarchical Contrastive Masked Autoencoder for Self-Supervised  Audio-Visual Emotion Recognition",
    "abstract": "Audio-Visual Emotion Recognition (AVER) has garnered increasing attention in recent years for its critical role in creating emotion-ware intelligent machines. Previous efforts in this area are dominated by the supervised learning paradigm. Despite significant progress, supervised learning is meeting its bottleneck due to the longstanding data scarcity issue in AVER. Motivated by recent advances in self-supervised learning, we propose Hierarchical Contrastive Masked Autoencoder (HiCMAE), a novel self-supervised framework that leverages large-scale self-supervised pre-training on vast unlabeled audio-visual data to promote the advancement of AVER. Following prior arts in self-supervised audio-visual representation learning, HiCMAE adopts two primary forms of self-supervision for pre-training, namely masked data modeling and contrastive learning. Unlike them which focus exclusively on top-layer representations while neglecting explicit guidance of intermediate layers, HiCMAE develops a three-pronged strategy to foster hierarchical audio-visual feature learning and improve the overall quality of learned representations. To verify the effectiveness of HiCMAE, we conduct extensive experiments on 9 datasets covering both categorical and dimensional AVER tasks. Experimental results show that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art supervised and self-supervised audio-visual methods, which indicates that HiCMAE is a powerful audio-visual emotion representation learner.

Anomaly-scoring-based methods have been prevailing for years but suffer from the high complexity of thresholding and low explanability of detection results. In this paper, we conduct pioneer research on equipping video-based large language models (VLLMs) in the framework of VAD, making the VAD model free from thresholds and able to explain the reasons for the detected anomalies. We introduce a novel network module Long-Term Context (LTC) to mitigate the incapability of VLLMs in long-range context modeling. We design a three-phase training method to improve the efficiency of fine-tuning VLLMs by substantially minimizing the requirements for VAD data and lowering the costs of annotating instruction-tuning data. Our trained model achieves the top performance on the anomaly videos of the UCF-Crime and TAD benchmarks, with the AUC improvements of +3.86\\% and +4.96\\%, respectively. More impressively, our approach can provide textual explanations for detected anomalies. ",

    "abstract": "Binary function similarity detection plays an important role in a wide range of security applications. Existing works usually assume that the query function and target function share equal semantics and compare their full semantics to obtain the similarity. However, we find that the function mapping is more complex, especially when function inlining happens. In this paper, we will systematically investigate cross-inlining binary function similarity detection. We first construct a cross-inlining dataset by compiling 51 projects using 9 compilers, with 4 optimizations, to 6 architectures, with 2 inlining flags, which results in two datasets both with 216 combinations. Then we construct the cross-inlining function mappings by linking the common source functions in these two datasets. Through analysis of this dataset, we find that three cross-inlining patterns widely exist while existing work suffers when detecting cross-inlining binary function similarity. Next, we propose a pattern-based model named CI-Detector for cross-inlining matching. CI-Detector uses the attributed CFG to represent the semantics of binary functions and GNN to embed binary functions into vectors. CI-Detector respectively trains a model for these three cross-inlining patterns. Finally, the testing pairs are input to these three models and all the produced similarities are aggregated to produce the final similarity. We conduct several experiments to evaluate CI-Detector. Results show that CI-Detector can detect cross-inlining pairs with a precision of 81% and a recall of 97%, which exceeds all state-of-the-art works. ",

To this end, we propose a new method, GO-NeRF, capable of utilizing scene context for high-quality and harmonious 3D object generation within an existing NeRF.

Moreover, we also develop tailored optimization objectives and training strategies to enhance the model's ability to exploit scene context and mitigate artifacts, such as floaters, originating from 3D object generation within a scene. Extensive experiments on both feed-forward and $360^o$ scenes show the superior performance of our proposed GO-NeRF in generating objects harmoniously composited with surrounding scenes and synthesizing high-quality novel view images.

However, this job requires extensive botanical knowledge and much wasted time. Therefore, this task and others similar to it have been extensively researched subjects in image classification. Regarding leaf disease classification, most approaches have used the more popular PlantVillage dataset while completely disregarding other datasets, like the Robusta Coffee Leaf (RoCoLe) dataset. As the RoCoLe dataset is imbalanced and does not have many samples, fine-tuning of pre-trained models and multiple augmentation techniques need to be used. The current paper uses the RoCoLe dataset and approaches based on deep learning for classifying coffee leaf diseases from images, incorporating the pix2pix model for segmentation and cycle-generative adversarial network (CycleGAN) for augmentation. Our study demonstrates the effectiveness of Transformer-based models, online augmentations, and CycleGAN augmentation in improving leaf disease classification. While synthetic data has limitations, it complements real data, enhancing model performance. These findings contribute to developing robust techniques for plant disease detection and classification.

This study investigates the effectiveness of the new paradigm, i.e., using LLMs without fine-tuning for FSA. Rooted in Minsky's theory of mind and emotions, a design framework with heterogeneous LLM agents is proposed. The framework instantiates specialized agents using prior domain knowledge of the types of FSA errors and reasons on the aggregated agent discussions. Comprehensive evaluation on FSA datasets show that the framework yields better accuracies, especially when the discussions are substantial. This study contributes to the design foundations and paves new avenues for LLMs-based FSA. Implications on business and management are also discussed. ",

    "abstract": "The detection of anomalies in multivariate time series data is crucial for various practical applications, including smart power grids, traffic flow forecasting, and industrial process control. However, real-world time series data is usually not well-structured, posting significant challenges to existing approaches: (1) The existence of missing values in multivariate time series data along variable and time dimensions hinders the effective modeling of interwoven spatial and temporal dependencies, resulting in important patterns being overlooked during model training; (2) Anomaly scoring with irregularly-sampled observations is less explored, making it difficult to use existing detectors for multivariate series without fully-observed values. In this work, we introduce a novel framework called GST-Pro, which utilizes a graph spatiotemporal process and anomaly scorer to tackle the aforementioned challenges in detecting anomalies on irregularly-sampled multivariate time series. Our approach comprises two main components. First, we propose a graph spatiotemporal process based on neural controlled differential equations. This process enables effective modeling of multivariate time series from both spatial and temporal perspectives, even when the data contains missing values. Second, we present a novel distribution-based anomaly scoring mechanism that alleviates the reliance on complete uniform observations. By analyzing the predictions of the graph spatiotemporal process, our approach allows anomalies to be easily detected. Our experimental results show that the GST-Pro method can effectively detect anomalies in time series data and outperforms state-of-the-art methods, regardless of whether there are missing values present in the data.

    "abstract": "Visible-infrared person re-identification (VIReID) primarily deals with matching identities across person images from different modalities. Due to the modality gap between visible and infrared images, cross-modality identity matching poses significant challenges. Recognizing that high-level semantics of pedestrian appearance, such as gender, shape, and clothing style, remain consistent across modalities, this paper intends to bridge the modality gap by infusing visual features with high-level semantics. Given the capability of CLIP to sense high-level semantic information corresponding to visual representations, we explore the application of CLIP within the domain of VIReID. Consequently, we propose a CLIP-Driven Semantic Discovery Network (CSDN) that consists of Modality-specific Prompt Learner, Semantic Information Integration (SII), and High-level Semantic Embedding (HSE). Specifically, considering the diversity stemming from modality discrepancies in language descriptions, we devise bimodal learnable text tokens to capture modality-private semantic information for visible and infrared images, respectively. Additionally, acknowledging the complementary nature of semantic details across different modalities, we integrate text features from the bimodal language descriptions to achieve comprehensive semantics. Finally, we establish a connection between the integrated text features and the visual features across modalities. This process embed rich high-level semantic information into visual representations, thereby promoting the modality invariance of visual representations. The effectiveness and superiority of our proposed CSDN over existing methods have been substantiated through experimental evaluations on multiple widely used benchmarks.

Recent applications require the analysis of faces in the full 360{\\deg} rotation range. Traditional approaches to solve the semi-frontal and profile cases are not directly amenable for the full rotation case. In this paper we analyze the methodology for short- and wide-range HPE and discuss which representations and metrics are adequate for each case. We show that the popular Euler angles representation is a good choice for short-range HPE, but not at extreme rotations. However, the Euler angles' gimbal lock problem prevents them from being used as a valid metric in any setting. We also revisit the current cross-data set evaluation methodology and note that the lack of alignment between the reference systems of the training and test data sets negatively biases the results of all articles in the literature. We introduce a procedure to quantify this misalignment and a new methodology for cross-data set HPE that establishes new, more accurate, SOTA for the 300W-LP|Biwi benchmark. We also propose a generalization of the geodesic angular distance metric that enables the construction of a loss that controls the contribution of each training sample to the optimization of the model.

To solve this issue, i.e., preventing Cloud from accessing the parameters while benefiting from Cloud computation, random affine transformations provide an exact yet light weight in computation solution. This research deals with analyzing privacy preserving properties of these transformations when they are adopted for MPC problems. We consider two common strategies for outsourcing the optimization required in MPC problems, namely separate and dense forms, and establish that random affine transformations utilized in these forms are vulnerable to side-knowledge from Cloud. Specifically, we prove that the privacy guarantees of these methods and their extensions for separate form are undermined when a mild side-knowledge about the problem in terms of structure of MPC cost function is available. In addition, while we prove that outsourcing the MPC problem in the dense form inherently leads to some degree of privacy for the system and cost function parameters, we also establish that affine transformations applied to this form are nevertheless prone to be undermined by a Cloud with mild side-knowledge.

To solve the problem, we propose a disentangled feature learning framework to learn a category-specific representation. Specifically, we employ different projectors to learn the frame-wise features for each category. To ensure that these feature does not contain information of other categories, we maximize the common information between frame-wise features within the same category and propose a frame-wise contrastive loss. In addition, considering that the labeled data used by the proposed method is limited, we propose a semi-supervised frame-wise contrastive loss that can leverage large amounts of unlabeled data to achieve feature disentanglement.

We consider an occluded point to be one that is imaged in the reference frame but not in the next. Estimating the motion of these points is extremely difficult, particularly in the two-frame setting. Previous work only used the current frame as the only input, which could not guarantee providing correct global reference information for occluded points, and had problems such as long calculation time and poor accuracy in predicting optical flow at occluded points. To enable both high accuracy and efficiency, We fully mine and utilize the spatiotemporal information provided by the frame pair, design a loopback judgment algorithm to ensure that correct global reference information is obtained, mine multiple necessary global information, and design an efficient refinement module that fuses these global information. Specifically, we propose a YOIO framework, which consists of three main components: an initial flow estimator, a multiple global information extraction module, and a unified refinement module. We demonstrate that optical flow estimates in the occluded regions can be significantly improved in only one iteration without damaging the performance in non-occluded regions. Compared with GMA, the optical flow prediction accuracy of this method in the occluded area is improved by more than 10%, and the occ_out area exceeds 15%, while the calculation time is 27% shorter. This approach, running up to 18.9fps with 436*1024 image resolution, obtains new state-of-the-art results on the challenging Sintel dataset among all published and unpublished approaches that can run in real-time, suggesting a new paradigm for accurate and efficient optical flow estimation.

PCF combines conventional compress-and-forward (CF) and amplify-and-forward (AF) protocols, enabling one relay to operate alternately in the CF or the AF mode, while the other relay works purely in the CF mode. As the direct link from the source to the destination is unavailable, and there is no noiseless relay in the diamond network, messages received from both relays must act as side information for each other and must be decoded jointly. We propose a joint decoder to decode two Luby transform (LT) codes received from both relays corresponding to the same original message. Numerical results show that PCF can achieve significant performance improvements compared to decode-and-forward (DF) and pure CF protocols when at least the channels connected to one of the relays are of high quality.

Since the impact of positive feedback (i.e., ACK) error is smaller than that of negative feedback (i.e., NACK) error, an asymmetric feedback detection scheme is proposed to protect NACK and further reduce the outage probability. We formulate the HARQ process as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) model to adapt to the transmission rate of each transmission attempt without enriched feedback and additional feedback cost. We aim to optimize the performance of HARQ process under certain outage probability requirements by finding optimal asymmetric detection thresholds.

This new method allows for the processing of higher resolution images on devices with limited memory, significantly expanding potential application scenarios.

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in processing both natural and programming languages, which have enabled various applications in software engineering, such as requirement engineering, code generation, and software testing. However, existing code generation benchmarks do not necessarily assess the code understanding performance of LLMs, especially for the subtle inconsistencies that may arise between code and its semantics described in natural language. In this paper, we propose a novel method to systematically assess the code understanding performance of LLMs, particularly focusing on subtle differences between code and its descriptions, by introducing code mutations to existing code generation datasets. Code mutations are small changes that alter the semantics of the original code, creating a mismatch with the natural language description. We apply different types of code mutations, such as operator replacement and statement deletion, to generate inconsistent code-description pairs. We then use these pairs to test the ability of LLMs to correctly detect the inconsistencies. We propose a new LLM testing method, called Mutation-based Consistency Testing (MCT), and conduct a case study on the two popular LLMs, GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, using the state-of-the-art code generation benchmark, HumanEval-X, which consists of six programming languages (Python, C++, Java, Go, JavaScript, and Rust). We compare the performance of the LLMs across different types of code mutations and programming languages and analyze the results. We find that the LLMs show significant variation in their code understanding performance and that they have different strengths and weaknesses depending on the mutation type and language. ",

    "abstract": "In-context learning, a paradigm bridging the gap between pre-training and fine-tuning, has demonstrated high efficacy in several NLP tasks, especially in few-shot settings. Unlike traditional fine-tuning methods, in-context learning adapts pre-trained models to unseen tasks without updating any parameters. Despite being widely applied, in-context learning is vulnerable to malicious attacks. In this work, we raise security concerns regarding this paradigm. Our studies demonstrate that an attacker can manipulate the behavior of large language models by poisoning the demonstration context, without the need for fine-tuning the model. Specifically, we have designed a new backdoor attack method, named ICLAttack, to target large language models based on in-context learning. Our method encompasses two types of attacks: poisoning demonstration examples and poisoning prompts, which can make models behave in accordance with predefined intentions. ICLAttack does not require additional fine-tuning to implant a backdoor, thus preserving the model's generality. Furthermore, the poisoned examples are correctly labeled, enhancing the natural stealth of our attack method. Extensive experimental results across several language models, ranging in size from 1.3B to 40B parameters, demonstrate the effectiveness of our attack method, exemplified by a high average attack success rate of 95.0% across the three datasets on OPT models. Our findings highlight the vulnerabilities of language models, and we hope this work will raise awareness of the possible security threats associated with in-context learning. ",

This approach enhances the generality and flexibility of KGE models.

    "abstract": "Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery is the primary data type used for sea ice mapping due to its spatio-temporal coverage and the ability to detect sea ice independent of cloud and lighting conditions. Automatic sea ice detection using SAR imagery remains problematic due to the presence of ambiguous signal and noise within the image. Conversely, ice and water are easily distinguishable using multispectral imagery (MSI), but in the polar regions the ocean's surface is often occluded by cloud or the sun may not appear above the horizon for many months. To address some of these limitations, this paper proposes a new tool trained using concurrent multispectral Visible and SAR imagery for sea Ice Detection (ViSual\\_IceD). ViSual\\_IceD is a convolution neural network (CNN) that builds on the classic U-Net architecture by containing two parallel encoder stages, enabling the fusion and concatenation of MSI and SAR imagery containing different spatial resolutions. The performance of ViSual\\_IceD is compared with U-Net models trained using concatenated MSI and SAR imagery as well as models trained exclusively on MSI or SAR imagery. ViSual\\_IceD outperforms the other networks, with a F1 score 1.60\\% points higher than the next best network, and results indicate that ViSual\\_IceD is selective in the image type it uses during image segmentation. Outputs from ViSual\\_IceD are compared to sea ice concentration products derived from the AMSR2 Passive Microwave (PMW) sensor. Results highlight how ViSual\\_IceD is a useful tool to use in conjunction with PMW data, particularly in coastal regions. As the spatial-temporal coverage of MSI and SAR imagery continues to increase, ViSual\\_IceD provides a new opportunity for robust, accurate sea ice coverage detection in polar regions. ",

Accordingly, its promising performance has led to the GAN-based adversarial attack methods in the white-box and black-box attack scenarios. The importance of transferable black-box attacks lies in their ability to be effective across different models and settings, more closely aligning with real-world applications. However, it remains challenging to retain the performance in terms of transferable adversarial examples for such methods. Meanwhile, we observe that some enhanced gradient-based transferable adversarial attack algorithms require prolonged time for adversarial sample generation. Thus, in this work, we propose a novel algorithm named GE-AdvGAN to enhance the transferability of adversarial samples whilst improving the algorithm's efficiency. The main approach is via optimising the training process of the generator parameters. With the functional and characteristic similarity analysis, we introduce a novel gradient editing (GE) mechanism and verify its feasibility in generating transferable samples on various models. Moreover, by exploring the frequency domain information to determine the gradient editing direction, GE-AdvGAN can generate highly transferable adversarial samples while minimizing the execution time in comparison to the state-of-the-art transferable adversarial attack algorithms.

To capture these dependencies, our approach incorporates a hybrid explicit-implicit tri-plane representation inspired by 3D-aware generative frameworks developed for three-dimensional object representation and employs a singular latent code to model an entire video sequence. Individual video frames are then synthesized from an intermediate tri-plane representation, which itself is derived from the primary latent code. This novel strategy reduces computational complexity by a factor of $2$ as measured in FLOPs. Consequently, our approach facilitates the efficient and temporally coherent generation of videos. Moreover, our joint frame modeling approach, in contrast to autoregressive methods, mitigates the generation of visual artifacts. We further enhance the model's capabilities by integrating an optical flow-based module within our Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) based generator architecture, thereby compensating for the constraints imposed by a smaller generator size. As a result, our model is capable of synthesizing high-fidelity video clips at a resolution of $256\\times256$ pixels, with durations extending to more than $5$ seconds at a frame rate of 30 fps. The efficacy and versatility of our approach are empirically validated through qualitative and quantitative assessments across three different datasets comprising both synthetic and real video clips.

In WavGCRN, the traffic data is decomposed into time-frequency components with Discrete Wavelet Transformation (DWT), constructing a multi-stream input structure; then Graph Convolutional Recurrent networks (GCRNs) are employed as encoders for each stream, extracting spatiotemporal features in different scales; and finally the learnable Inversed DWT and GCRN are combined as the decoder, fusing the information from all streams for traffic metrics reconstruction and prediction.

    "abstract": "Temporal Knowledge Graph Completion (TKGC) is a challenging task of predicting missing event links at future timestamps by leveraging established temporal structural knowledge. Given the formidable generative capabilities inherent in LLMs (LLMs), this paper proposes a novel approach to conceptualize temporal link prediction as an event generation task within the context of a historical event chain. We employ efficient fine-tuning methods to make LLMs adapt to specific graph textual information and patterns discovered in temporal timelines. Furthermore, we introduce structure-based historical data augmentation and the integration of reverse knowledge to emphasize LLMs' awareness of structural information, thereby enhancing their reasoning capabilities. We conduct thorough experiments on multiple widely used datasets and find that our fine-tuned model outperforms existing embedding-based models on multiple metrics, achieving SOTA results. We also carry out sufficient ablation experiments to explore the key influencing factors when LLMs perform structured temporal knowledge inference tasks. ",

    "abstract": "Neural character models can now reconstruct detailed geometry and texture from video, but they lack explicit shadows and shading, leading to artifacts when generating novel views and poses or during relighting. It is particularly difficult to include shadows as they are a global effect and the required casting of secondary rays is costly. We propose a new shadow model using a Gaussian density proxy that replaces sampling with a simple analytic formula. It supports dynamic motion and is tailored for shadow computation, thereby avoiding the affine projection approximation and sorting required by the closely related Gaussian splatting. Combined with a deferred neural rendering model, our Gaussian shadows enable Lambertian shading and shadow casting with minimal overhead. We demonstrate improved reconstructions, with better separation of albedo, shading, and shadows in challenging outdoor scenes with direct sun light and hard shadows. Our method is able to optimize the light direction without any input from the user. As a result, novel poses have fewer shadow artifacts and relighting in novel scenes is more realistic compared to the state-of-the-art methods, providing new ways to pose neural characters in novel environments, increasing their applicability.

    "abstract": "Visual dubbing is the process of generating lip motions of an actor in a video to synchronise with given audio. Recent advances have made progress towards this goal but have not been able to produce an approach suitable for mass adoption. Existing methods are split into either person-generic or person-specific models. Person-specific models produce results almost indistinguishable from reality but rely on long training times using large single-person datasets. Person-generic works have allowed for the visual dubbing of any video to any audio without further training, but these fail to capture the person-specific nuances and often suffer from visual artefacts. Our method, based on data-efficient neural rendering priors, overcomes the limitations of existing approaches. Our pipeline consists of learning a deferred neural rendering prior network and actor-specific adaptation using neural textures. This method allows for $\\textbf{high-quality visual dubbing with just a few seconds of data}$, that enables video dubbing for any actor - from A-list celebrities to background actors. We show that we achieve state-of-the-art in terms of $\\textbf{visual quality}$ and $\\textbf{recognisability}$ both quantitatively, and qualitatively through two user studies. Our prior learning and adaptation method $\\textbf{generalises to limited data}$ better and is more $\\textbf{scalable}$ than existing person-specific models.

The framework leverages the NIOSH index to perform online risk assessment, thus fitting real-time applications. In particular, the human state is retrieved via inverse kinematics/dynamics algorithms from wearable sensor data. Human action recognition and motion prediction are achieved by implementing an LSTM-based Guided Mixture of Experts architecture, which is trained offline and inferred online. With the recognized actions, a single lifting activity is divided into a series of continuous movements and the Revised NIOSH Lifting Equation can be applied for risk assessment. Moreover, the predicted motions enable anticipation of future risks. A haptic actuator, embedded in the wearable system, can alert the subject of potential risk, acting as an active prevention device. The performance of the proposed framework is validated by executing real lifting tasks, while the subject is equipped with the iFeel wearable system. ",

    "abstract": "Over the past decade, millions of smart meters have been installed by electricity suppliers worldwide, allowing them to collect a large amount of electricity consumption data, albeit sampled at a low frequency (one point every 30min). One of the important challenges these suppliers face is how to utilize these data to detect the presence/absence of different appliances in the customers' households. This valuable information can help them provide personalized offers and recommendations to help customers towards the energy transition. Appliance detection can be cast as a time series classification problem. However, the large amount of data combined with the long and variable length of the consumption series pose challenges when training a classifier. In this paper, we propose ADF, a framework that uses subsequences of a client consumption series to detect the presence/absence of appliances. We also introduce TransApp, a Transformer-based time series classifier that is first pretrained in a self-supervised way to enhance its performance on appliance detection tasks. We test our approach on two real datasets, including a publicly available one. The experimental results with two large real datasets show that the proposed approach outperforms current solutions, including state-of-the-art time series classifiers applied to appliance detection.

However, the rhythm-based approach does not take advantage of the morphological information conveyed by the different ECG waveforms, particularly the f-waves. As a result, the performance of such models may be inherently limited. Methods: To address this limitation, we have developed a deep learning model, named RawECGNet, to detect episodes of AF and atrial flutter (AFl) using the raw, single-lead ECG. We compare the generalization performance of RawECGNet on two external data sets that account for distribution shifts in geography, ethnicity, and lead position. RawECGNet is further benchmarked against a state-of-the-art deep learning model, named ArNet2, which utilizes rhythm information as input. Results: Using RawECGNet, the results for the different leads in the external test sets in terms of the F1 score were 0.91--0.94 in RBDB and 0.93 in SHDB, compared to 0.89--0.91 in RBDB and 0.91 in SHDB for ArNet2. The results highlight RawECGNet as a high-performance, generalizable algorithm for detection of AF and AFl episodes, exploiting information on both rhythm and morphology. ",

    "abstract": "As attitude and motion sensing components, inertial sensors are widely used in various portable devices. But the severe errors of inertial sensors restrain their function, especially the trajectory recovery and semantic recognition. As a mainstream signal processing method, wavelet is hailed as the mathematical microscope of signal due to the plentiful and diverse wavelet basis functions. However, complicated noise types and application scenarios of inertial sensors make selecting wavelet basis perplexing. To this end, we propose a wavelet dynamic selection network (WDSNet), which intelligently selects the appropriate wavelet basis for variable inertial signals. In addition, existing deep learning architectures excel at extracting features from input data but neglect to learn the characteristics of target categories, which is essential to enhance the category awareness capability, thereby improving the selection of wavelet basis. Therefore, we propose a category representation mechanism (CRM), which enables the network to extract and represent category features without increasing trainable parameters. Furthermore, CRM transforms the common fully connected network into category representations, which provide closer supervision to the feature extractor than the far and trivial one-hot classification labels. We call this process of imposing interpretability on a network and using it to supervise the feature extractor the feature supervision mechanism, and its effectiveness is demonstrated experimentally and theoretically in this paper. The enhanced inertial signal can perform impracticable tasks with regard to the original signal, such as trajectory reconstruction. Both quantitative and visual results show that WDSNet outperforms the existing methods. Remarkably, WDSNet, as a weakly-supervised method, achieves the state-of-the-art performance of all the compared fully-supervised methods. ",

Fortunately, up to 70 percent of people with epilepsy could live seizure-free if properly diagnosed and treated, and a reliable technique to monitor the onset of seizures could improve the quality of life of patients who are constantly facing the fear of random seizure attacks. The scalp-based EEG test, despite being the gold standard for diagnosing epilepsy, is costly, necessitates hospitalization, demands skilled professionals for operation, and is discomforting for users. In this paper, we propose EarSD, a novel lightweight, unobtrusive, and socially acceptable ear-worn system to detect epileptic seizure onsets by measuring the physiological signals from behind the user's ears. EarSD includes an integrated custom-built sensing, computing, and communication PCB to collect and amplify the signals of interest, remove the noises caused by motion artifacts and environmental impacts, and stream the data wirelessly to the computer or mobile phone nearby, where data are uploaded to the host computer for further processing. We conducted both in-lab and in-hospital experiments with epileptic seizure patients who were hospitalized for seizure studies. The preliminary results confirm that EarSD can detect seizures with up to 95.3 percent accuracy by just using classical machine learning algorithms. ",

To tackle these two challenges, we propose a graph-based representation learning approach aimed at predicting the future movements of multiple stocks. Initially, we model the complex time-varying relationships between stocks by generating dynamic multi-relational stock graphs. This is achieved through a novel edge generation algorithm that leverages information entropy and signal energy to quantify the intensity and directionality of inter-stock relations on each trading day. Then, we further refine these initial graphs through a stochastic multi-relational diffusion process, adaptively learning task-optimal edges. Subsequently, we implement a decoupled representation learning scheme with parallel retention to obtain the final graph representation. This strategy better captures the unique temporal features within individual stocks while also capturing the overall structure of the stock graph. Comprehensive experiments conducted on real-world datasets from two US markets (NASDAQ and NYSE) and one Chinese market (Shanghai Stock Exchange: SSE) validate the effectiveness of our method. Our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in forecasting next trading day stock trends across three test periods spanning seven years.

Therefore, the existing methods struggle to accurately extract RR when PPG data are collected from wrist area under free-living conditions. The increasing popularity of smartwatches, equipped with various sensors including PPG, has prompted the need for a robust RR estimation method. In this paper, we propose a convolutional neural network-based approach to extract RR from PPG, accelerometer, and gyroscope signals captured via smartwatches. Our method, including a dilated residual inception module and 1D convolutions, extract the temporal information from the signals, enabling RR estimation. Our method is trained and tested using data collected from 36 subjects under free-living conditions for one day using Samsung Gear Sport watches. For evaluation, we compare the proposed method with four state-of-the-art RR estimation methods. The RR estimates are compared with RR references obtained from a chest-band device. The results show that our method outperforms the existing methods with the Mean-Absolute-Error and Root-Mean-Square-Error of 1.85 and 2.34, while the best results obtained by the other methods are 2.41 and 3.29, respectively. Moreover, compared to the other methods, the absolute error distribution of our method was narrow (with the lowest median), indicating a higher level of agreement between the estimated and reference RR values.

    "abstract": "Recently, there has been a growing interest in the relationships between unrooted and rooted phylogenetic networks. In this context, a natural question to ask is if an unrooted phylogenetic network U can be oriented as a rooted phylogenetic network such that the latter satisfies certain structural properties. In a recent preprint, Bulteau et al. claim that it is computational hard to decide if U has a funneled (resp. funneled tree-child) orientation, for when the internal vertices of U have degree at most 5. Unfortunately, the proof of their funneled tree-child result appears to be incorrect. In this paper, we present a corrected proof and show that hardness remains for other popular classes of rooted phylogenetic networks such as funneled normal and funneled reticulation-visible. Additionally, our results hold regardless of whether U is rooted at an existing vertex or by subdividing an edge with the root. ",

The rationale is that the value of the entropy should increase in proximity of a transition between two segments that are well modelled (known) by the recognition network since it is a measure of uncertainty. The advantage of this measure is its simplicity as the posterior probabilities of each class are available in connectionist phoneme recognition. The entropy and a number of measures based on differentiation of the entropy are used in isolation and in combination. The decision methods for predicting the boundaries range from simple thresholds to neural network based procedure. The different methods are compared with respect to their precision, measured in terms of the ratio between the number C of predicted boundaries within 10 or 20 msec of the reference and the total number of predicted boundaries, and recall, measured as the ratio between C and the total number of reference boundaries.

    "abstract": "Auditory spatial attention detection (ASAD) is used to determine the direction of a listener's attention to a speaker by analyzing her/his electroencephalographic (EEG) signals. This study aimed to further improve the performance of ASAD with a short decision window (i.e., <1 s) rather than with long decision windows in previous studies. An end-to-end temporal attention network (i.e., TAnet) was introduced in this work. TAnet employs a multi-head attention (MHA) mechanism, which can more effectively capture the interactions among time steps in collected EEG signals and efficiently assign corresponding weights to those EEG time steps. Experiments demonstrated that, compared with the CNN-based method and recent ASAD methods, TAnet provided improved decoding performance in the KUL dataset, with decoding accuracies of 92.4% (decision window 0.1 s), 94.9% (0.25 s), 95.1% (0.3 s), 95.4% (0.4 s), and 95.5% (0.5 s) with short decision windows (i.e., <1 s). As a new ASAD model with a short decision window, TAnet can potentially facilitate the design of EEG-controlled intelligent hearing aids and sound recognition systems. ",

This paper proposes a method for Ambisonics encoding that uses a deep neural network (DNN) to estimate a signal transform from microphone inputs to Ambisonics signals. The approach uses a DNN consisting of a U-Net structure with a learnable preprocessing as well as a loss function consisting of mean average error, spatial correlation, and energy preservation components. The method is validated on two microphone arrays with regular and irregular shapes having four microphones, on simulated reverberant scenes with multiple sources. The results of the validation show that the proposed method can meet or exceed the performance of a conventional signal-independent Ambisonics encoder on a number of error metrics. ",

    "abstract": "Neural operators, which can act as implicit solution operators of hidden governing equations, have recently become popular tools for learning the responses of complex real-world physical systems. Nevertheless, most neural operator applications have thus far been data-driven and neglect the intrinsic preservation of fundamental physical laws in data. In this work, we introduce a novel integral neural operator architecture called the Peridynamic Neural Operator (PNO) that learns a nonlocal constitutive law from data. This neural operator provides a forward model in the form of state-based peridynamics, with objectivity and momentum balance laws automatically guaranteed. As applications, we demonstrate the expressivity and efficacy of our model in learning complex material behaviors from both synthetic and experimental data sets. We show that, owing to its ability to capture complex responses, our learned neural operator achieves improved accuracy and efficiency compared to baseline models that use predefined constitutive laws. Moreover, by preserving the essential physical laws within the neural network architecture, the PNO is robust in treating noisy data. The method shows generalizability to different domain configurations, external loadings, and discretizations. ",
