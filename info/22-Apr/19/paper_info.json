    "abstract": "Machine learning-based methods have achieved successful applications in machinery fault diagnosis. However, the main limitation that exists for these methods is that they operate as a black box and are generally not interpretable. This paper proposes a novel neural network structure, called temporal logic neural network (TLNN), in which the neurons of the network are logic propositions. More importantly, the network can be described and interpreted as a weighted signal temporal logic. TLNN not only keeps the nice properties of traditional neuron networks but also provides a formal interpretation of itself with formal language. Experiments with real datasets show the proposed neural network can obtain highly accurate fault diagnosis results with good computation efficiency. Additionally, the embedded formal language of the neuron network can provide explanations about the decision process, thus achieve interpretable fault diagnosis. ",

    "abstract": "The best neural architecture for a given machine learning problem depends on many factors: not only the complexity and structure of the dataset, but also on resource constraints including latency, compute, energy consumption, etc. Neural architecture search (NAS) for tabular datasets is an important but under-explored problem. Previous NAS algorithms designed for image search spaces incorporate resource constraints directly into the reinforcement learning rewards. In this paper, we argue that search spaces for tabular NAS pose considerable challenges for these existing reward-shaping methods, and propose a new reinforcement learning (RL) controller to address these challenges. Motivated by rejection sampling, when we sample candidate architectures during a search, we immediately discard any architecture that violates our resource constraints. We use a Monte-Carlo-based correction to our RL policy gradient update to account for this extra filtering step. Results on several tabular datasets show TabNAS, the proposed approach, efficiently finds high-quality models that satisfy the given resource constraints. ",

In this paper we revisit feature matching for self-supervised monocular depth estimation, and propose a novel transformer architecture for cost volume generation. We use depth-discretized epipolar sampling to select matching candidates, and refine predictions through a series of self- and cross-attention layers. These layers sharpen the matching probability between pixel features, improving over standard similarity metrics prone to ambiguities and local minima. The refined cost volume is decoded into depth estimates, and the whole pipeline is trained end-to-end from videos using only a photometric objective. Experiments on the KITTI and DDAD datasets show that our DepthFormer architecture establishes a new state of the art in self-supervised monocular depth estimation, and is even competitive with highly specialized supervised single-frame architectures. We also show that our learned cross-attention network yields representations transferable across datasets, increasing the effectiveness of pre-training strategies.

    "abstract": "While the theoretical analysis of evolutionary algorithms (EAs) has made significant progress for pseudo-Boolean optimization problems in the last 25 years, only sporadic theoretical results exist on how EAs solve permutation-based problems. To overcome the lack of permutation-based benchmark problems, we propose a general way to transfer the classic pseudo-Boolean benchmarks into benchmarks defined on sets of permutations. We then conduct a rigorous runtime analysis of the permutation-based $(1+1)$ EA proposed by Scharnow, Tinnefeld, and Wegener (2004) on the analogues of the \\textsc{LeadingOnes} and \\textsc{Jump} benchmarks. The latter shows that, different from bit-strings, it is not only the Hamming distance that determines how difficult it is to mutate a permutation $\\sigma$ into another one $\\tau$, but also the precise cycle structure of $\\sigma \\tau^{-1}$. For this reason, we also regard the more symmetric scramble mutation operator. We observe that it not only leads to simpler proofs, but also reduces the runtime on jump functions with odd jump size by a factor of $\\Theta(n)$. Finally, we show that a heavy-tailed version of the scramble operator, as in the bit-string case, leads to a speed-up of order $m^{\\Theta(m)}$ on jump functions with jump size~$m$.% ",

To facilitate emergency responses and mitigate losses, the U.S. Geological Survey provides a rapid hazard estimation system for earthquake-triggered landslides and liquefaction using geospatial susceptibility proxies and ShakeMap ground motion estimates. In this study, we develop a generalized causal graph-based Bayesian network that models the physical interdependencies between geospatial features, seismic ground failures, and building damage, as well as DPMs. Geospatial features provide physical insights for estimating ground failure occurrence while DPMs contain event-specific surface change observations. This physics-informed causal graph incorporates these variables with complex physical relationships in one holistic Bayesian updating scheme to effectively fuse information from both geospatial models and remote sensing data. This framework is scalable and flexible enough to deal with highly complex multi-hazard combinations. We then develop a stochastic variational inference algorithm to jointly update the intractable posterior probabilities of unobserved landslides, liquefaction, and building damage at different locations efficiently. In addition, a local graphical model pruning algorithm is presented to reduce the computational cost of large-scale seismic ground failure estimation. We apply this framework to the September 2018 Hokkaido Iburi-Tobu, Japan (M6.6) earthquake and January 2020 Southwest Puerto Rico (M6.4) earthquake to evaluate the performance of our algorithm. ",

    "abstract": "Sepsis is a life-threatening condition with organ dysfunction and is a leading cause of death and critical illness worldwide. Accurate detection of sepsis during emergency department triage would allow early initiation of lab analysis, antibiotic administration, and other sepsis treatment protocols. The purpose of this study was to determine whether EHR data can be extracted and synthesized with the latest machine learning algorithms (KATE Sepsis) and clinical natural language processing to produce accurate sepsis models, and compare KATE Sepsis performance with existing sepsis screening protocols, such as SIRS and qSOFA. A machine learning model (KATE Sepsis) was developed using patient encounters with triage data from 16 participating hospitals. KATE Sepsis, SIRS, standard screening (SIRS with source of infection) and qSOFA were tested in three settings. Cohort-A was a retrospective analysis on medical records from a single Site 1. Cohort-B was a prospective analysis of Site 1. Cohort-C was a retrospective analysis on Site 1 with 15 additional sites. Across all cohorts, KATE Sepsis demonstrates an AUC of 0.94-0.963 with 73-74.87% TPR and 3.76-7.17% FPR. Standard screening demonstrates an AUC of 0.682-0.726 with 39.39-51.19% TPR and 2.9-6.02% FPR. The qSOFA protocol demonstrates an AUC of 0.544-0.56, with 10.52-13.18% TPR and 1.22-1.68% FPR. For severe sepsis, across all cohorts, KATE Sepsis demonstrates an AUC of 0.935-0.972 with 70-82.26% TPR and 4.64-8.62% FPR. For septic shock, across all cohorts, KATE Sepsis demonstrates an AUC of 0.96-0.981 with 85.71-89.66% TPR and 4.85-8.8% FPR. SIRS, standard screening, and qSOFA demonstrate low AUC and TPR for severe sepsis and septic shock detection. KATE Sepsis provided substantially better sepsis detection performance in triage than commonly used screening protocols. ",

Such trade-offs reflect a broader class of multi-objective optimization (MOO) problems in which optimization methods seek Pareto optimal trade-offs between competing goals. In this work, we first introduce a differentiable measure that enables direct optimization of group fairness (specifically, balancing accuracy across groups) in model training. Next, we demonstrate two model-agnostic MOO frameworks for learning Pareto optimal parameterizations over different groups of neural classification models. We evaluate our methods on the specific task of hate speech detection, in which prior work has shown lack of group fairness across speakers of different English dialects. Empirical results across convolutional, sequential, and transformer-based neural architectures show superior empirical accuracy vs. fairness trade-offs over prior work. More significantly, our measure enables the Pareto machinery to ensure that each architecture achieves the best possible trade-off between fairness and accuracy w.r.t. the dataset, given user-prescribed error tolerance bounds.

    "abstract": "With the increasing adoption of NLP models in real-world products, it becomes more and more important to protect these models from privacy leakage. Because private information in language data is sparse, previous research formalized a Selective-Differential-Privacy (SDP) notion to provide protection for sensitive tokens detected by policy functions, and prove its effectiveness on RNN-based models. But the previous mechanism requires separating the private and public model parameters and thus cannot be applied on large attention-based models. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective just-fine-tune-twice privacy mechanism to first fine-tune on in-domain redacted data and then on in-domain private data, to achieve SDP for large Transformer-based language models. We also design explicit and contextual policy functions to provide protections at different levels. Experiments show that our models achieve strong performance while staying robust to the canary insertion attack. We further show that even under low-resource settings with a small amount of in-domain data, SDP can still improve the model utility. We will release the code, data and models to facilitate future research. ",

We investigate how to leverage the representations produced by Neural Collages in various tasks, including data compression and generation. Neural Collages image compressors are orders of magnitude faster than other self-similarity-based algorithms during encoding and offer compression rates competitive with implicit methods.

We utilize contrastive learning as an auxiliary objective to learn robust dialogue context representations that are invariant to perturbations injected through the augmentation method. We experiment with four benchmark dialogue datasets and demonstrate that our framework combines well with existing augmentation methods and can significantly improve over baseline BERT-based ranking architectures. Furthermore, we propose a novel data augmentation method, ConMix, that adds token level perturbations through stochastic mixing of tokens from other contexts in the batch.

To this end, we devise task-aware gating functions to route examples from different tasks to specialized experts which share subsets of network weights conditioned on the task. This results in a sparsely activated multi-task model with a large number of parameters, but with the same computational cost as that of a dense model. We demonstrate such sparse networks to improve multi-task learning along three key dimensions: (i) transfer to low-resource tasks from related tasks in the training mixture; (ii) sample-efficient generalization to tasks not seen during training by making use of task-aware routing from seen related tasks; (iii) robustness to the addition of unrelated tasks by avoiding catastrophic forgetting of existing tasks.

In addition, compressible encrypted images, called encryption-then-compression (EtC) images, can be used for both training and testing without any adaptation network.

One of the recent applications of the IoT is the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) which helps to see unprecedented growth of connected vehicles on the roads. The IoV is gaining attention due to enhancing traffic safety and providing low route information. One of the most important and major requirements of the IoV is preserving security and privacy under strict latency. Moreover, vehicles are required to be authenticated frequently and fast considering limited bandwidth, high mobility, and density of the vehicles. To address the security vulnerabilities and data integrity, an ultralight authentication scheme has been proposed in this article. Physical Unclonable Function (PUF) and XOR function are used to authenticate both server and vehicle in two message flow which makes the proposed scheme ultralight, and less computation is required. The proposed Easy-Sec can authenticate vehicles maintaining low latency and resisting known security threats. Furthermore, the proposed Easy-Sec needs low overhead so that it does not increase the burden of the IoV network. Computational ( around 4 ms) and Communication (32 bytes) overhead shows the feasibility, efficiency, and also security features are depicted using formal analysis, Burrows, Abadi, and Needham (BAN) logic, and informal analysis to show the robustness of the proposed mechanisms against security threats.

Most of the existing community search models only focus on the internal cohesiveness of a community. However, a high-quality community often has high modularity, which means dense connections inside communities and sparse connections to the nodes outside the community. In this paper, we conduct a pioneer study on searching a community with high modularity. We point out that while modularity has been popularly used in community detection (without query nodes), it has not been adopted for community search, surprisingly, and its application in community search (related to query nodes) brings in new challenges. We address these challenges by designing a new graph modularity function named Density Modularity. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work on the community search problem using graph modularity. The community search based on the density modularity, termed as DMCS, is to find a community in a social network that contains all the query nodes and has high density-modularity. We prove that the DMCS problem is NP-hard. To efficiently address DMCS, we present new algorithms that run in log-linear time to the graph size. We conduct extensive experimental studies in real-world and synthetic networks, which offer insights into the efficiency and effectiveness of our algorithms. In particular, our algorithm achieves up to 8.5 times higher accuracy in terms of NMI than baseline algorithms. ",

In this work, we introduce the framework of semantic explainable AI (S-XAI), which utilizes row-centered principal component analysis to obtain the common traits from the best combination of superpixels discovered by a genetic algorithm, and extracts understandable semantic spaces on the basis of discovered semantically sensitive neurons and visualization techniques. Statistical interpretation of the semantic space is also provided, and the concept of semantic probability is proposed for the first time. Our experimental results demonstrate that S-XAI is effective in providing a semantic interpretation for the CNN, and offers broad usage, including trustworthiness assessment and semantic sample searching.

In smart grids, identifying massive number of grid metering terminals based on network traffic analysis is almost blank and existing research has not proposed a targeted end-to-end model to solve the flow classification problem. Therefore, we proposed a hierarchical terminal recognition approach that applies the details of grid data. We have formed a two-level model structure by segmenting the grid data, which uses the statistical characteristics of network traffic and the specific behavior characteristics of grid metering terminals. Moreover, through the selection and reconstruction of features, we combine three algorithms to achieve accurate identification of terminal types that transmit network traffic. We conduct extensive experiments on a real dataset containing three types of grid metering terminals, and the results show that our research has improved performance compared to common recognition models. The combination of an autoencoder, K-Means and GradientBoost algorithm achieved the best recognition rate with F1 value of 98.3%. ",

    "abstract": "Recently, federated learning has emerged as a promising approach for training a global model using data from multiple organizations without leaking their raw data. Nevertheless, directly applying federated learning to real-world tasks faces two challenges: (1) heterogeneity in the data among different organizations; and (2) data noises inside individual organizations. In this paper, we propose a general framework to solve the above two challenges simultaneously. Specifically, we propose using distributionally robust optimization to mitigate the negative effects caused by data heterogeneity paradigm to sample clients based on a learnable distribution at each iteration. Additionally, we observe that this optimization paradigm is easily affected by data noises inside local clients, which has a significant performance degradation in terms of global model prediction accuracy. To solve this problem, we propose to incorporate mixup techniques into the local training process of federated learning. We further provide comprehensive theoretical analysis including robustness analysis, convergence analysis, and generalization ability. Furthermore, we conduct empirical studies across different drug discovery tasks, such as ADMET property prediction and drug-target affinity prediction. ",

    "abstract": "Our research aims to highlight and alleviate the complex tensions around online safety, privacy, and smartphone usage in families so that parents and teens can work together to better manage mobile privacy and security-related risks. We developed a mobile application (\"app\") for Community Oversight of Privacy and Security (\"CO-oPS\") and had parents and teens assess whether it would be applicable for use with their families. CO-oPS is an Android app that allows a group of users to co-monitor the apps installed on one another's devices and the privacy permissions granted to those apps. We conducted a study with 19 parent-teen (ages 13-17) pairs to understand how they currently managed mobile safety and app privacy within their family and then had them install, use, and evaluate the CO-oPS app. We found that both parents and teens gave little consideration to online safety and privacy before installing new apps or granting privacy permissions. When using CO-oPS, participants liked how the app increased transparency into one another's devices in a way that facilitated communication, but were less inclined to use features for in-app messaging or to hide apps from one another. Key themes related to power imbalances between parents and teens surfaced that made co-management challenging. Parents were more open to collaborative oversight than teens, who felt that it was not their place to monitor their parents, even though both often believed parents lacked the technological expertise to monitor themselves. Our study sheds light on why collaborative practices for managing online safety and privacy within families may be beneficial but also quite difficult to implement in practice. We provide recommendations for overcoming these challenges based on the insights gained from our study. ",

    "abstract": "Medical data is often highly sensitive in terms of data privacy and security concerns. Federated learning, one type of machine learning techniques, has been started to use for the improvement of the privacy and security of medical data. In the federated learning, the training data is distributed across multiple machines, and the learning process is performed in a collaborative manner. There are several privacy attacks on deep learning (DL) models to get the sensitive information by attackers. Therefore, the DL model itself should be protected from the adversarial attack, especially for applications using medical data. One of the solutions for this problem is homomorphic encryption-based model protection from the adversary collaborator. This paper proposes a privacy-preserving federated learning algorithm for medical data using homomorphic encryption. The proposed algorithm uses a secure multi-party computation protocol to protect the deep learning model from the adversaries. In this study, the proposed algorithm using a real-world medical dataset is evaluated in terms of the model performance. ",

    "abstract": "In recent years, malware detection has become an active research topic in the area of Internet of Things (IoT) security. The principle is to exploit knowledge from large quantities of continuously generated malware. Existing algorithms practice available malware features for IoT devices and lack real-time prediction behaviors. More research is thus required on malware detection to cope with real-time misclassification of the input IoT data. Motivated by this, in this paper we propose an adversarial self-supervised architecture for detecting malware in IoT networks, SETTI, considering samples of IoT network traffic that may not be labeled. In the SETTI architecture, we design three self-supervised attack techniques, namely Self-MDS, GSelf-MDS and ASelf-MDS. The Self-MDS method considers the IoT input data and the adversarial sample generation in real-time. The GSelf-MDS builds a generative adversarial network model to generate adversarial samples in the self-supervised structure. Finally, ASelf-MDS utilizes three well-known perturbation sample techniques to develop adversarial malware and inject it over the self-supervised architecture. Also, we apply a defence method to mitigate these attacks, namely adversarial self-supervised training to protect the malware detection architecture against injecting the malicious samples. To validate the attack and defence algorithms, we conduct experiments on two recent IoT datasets: IoT23 and NBIoT. Comparison of the results shows that in the IoT23 dataset, the Self-MDS method has the most damaging consequences from the attacker's point of view by reducing the accuracy rate from 98% to 74%. In the NBIoT dataset, the ASelf-MDS method is the most devastating algorithm that can plunge the accuracy rate from 98% to 77%. ",

    "abstract": "Depth prediction is a critical problem in robotics applications especially autonomous driving. Generally, depth prediction based on binocular stereo matching and fusion of monocular image and laser point cloud are two mainstream methods. However, the former usually suffers from overfitting while building cost volume, and the latter has a limited generalization due to the lack of geometric constraint. To solve these problems, we propose a novel multimodal neural network, namely UAMD-Net, for dense depth completion based on fusion of binocular stereo matching and the weak constrain from the sparse point clouds. Specifically, the sparse point clouds are converted to sparse depth map and sent to the multimodal feature encoder (MFE) with binocular image, constructing a cross-modal cost volume. Then, it will be further processed by the multimodal feature aggregator (MFA) and the depth regression layer. Furthermore, the existing multimodal methods ignore the problem of modal dependence, that is, the network will not work when a certain modal input has a problem. Therefore, we propose a new training strategy called Modal-dropout which enables the network to be adaptively trained with multiple modal inputs and inference with specific modal inputs. Benefiting from the flexible network structure and adaptive training method, our proposed network can realize unified training under various modal input conditions. Comprehensive experiments conducted on KITTI depth completion benchmark demonstrate that our method produces robust results and outperforms other state-of-the-art methods. ",

The parameter selection range of the improved FTPF is relaxed, which renders systems to achieve better transient performance. Benefitting from stochastic Lyapunov stability theory, it is shown that all signals of systems are semi-global uniformly ultimately bounded in probability, and bipartite consensus errors can satisfy the arbitrary precision with probability in the predefined time. Finally, to verify its effectiveness, the proposed control scheme is applied to BCT tasks of a group of vehicles, which manifests anticipated control performance under various uncertainties. ",

Our method employs a mesh-less architecture, thus overcoming the limitations associated with image segmentation and mesh generation required by traditional discretization methods. Indeed, we encode geometrical variability through scalar landmarks, such as coordinates of points of interest. In biomedical applications, these landmarks can be inexpensively processed from clinical images. Our approach is non-intrusive and modular, as we select a data-driven loss function. The latter can also be modified by considering additional constraints, thus leveraging available physical knowledge. Our approach can also accommodate a universal coordinate system, which supports the USM-Net in learning the correspondence between points belonging to different geometries, boosting prediction accuracy on unobserved geometries. Finally, we present two numerical test cases in computational fluid dynamics involving variable Reynolds numbers as well as computational domains of variable shape. The results show that our method allows for inexpensive but accurate approximations of velocity and pressure, avoiding computationally expensive image segmentation, mesh generation, or re-training for every new instance of physical parameters and shape of the domain.

We focus on texts that describe a chemical reaction process and questions that ask about the process's outcome under different environmental conditions. To answer questions about such processes, one needs to understand the interactions between the different entities involved in the process and to simulate their state transitions during the process execution under different conditions. A state transition is defined as the memory modification the program does to the variables during the execution. We hypothesize that generating code and executing it to simulate the process will allow answering such questions. We, therefore, define a domain-specific language (DSL) to represent processes. We contribute to the community a unique dataset curated by chemists and annotated by computer scientists. The dataset is composed of process texts, simulation questions, and their corresponding computer codes represented by the DSL.We propose a neural program synthesis approach based on reinforcement learning with a novel state-transition semantic reward. The novel reward is based on the run-time semantic similarity between the predicted code and the reference code. This allows simulating complex process transitions and thus answering simulation questions.

This paper aims to use recent advances in deep learning to address the problem of MQA. Movement quality score generation is an essential component of MQA. We propose three novel skeletal data augmentation schemes.

Finally, we propose a novel transformer based architecture for MQA. Four novel feature extractors are proposed and studied that allow the transformer network to operate on skeletal data. We show that adding the attention mechanism in the design of the proposed feature extractor allows the transformer network to pay attention to specific body parts that make a significant contribution towards executing a movement.

Most of previous works focus on either few-shot or zero-shot object detection, ignoring the complementarity of visual and semantic information. We first show that meta-learning and prompt-based learning, the most commonly-used methods for few-shot learning and zero-shot transferring from pre-trained vision-language models to downstream tasks, are conceptually similar. They both reformulate the objective of downstream tasks the same as the pre-training tasks, and mostly without tuning the parameters of pre-trained models. Based on this observation, we propose to combine meta-learning with prompt-based learning for multimodal FSOD without fine-tuning, by learning transferable class-agnostic multimodal FSOD models over many-shot base classes. Specifically, to better exploit the pre-trained vision-language models, the meta-learning based cross-modal prompting is proposed to generate soft prompts and further used to extract the semantic prototype, conditioned on the few-shot visual examples. Then, the extracted semantic prototype and few-shot visual prototype are fused to generate the multimodal prototype for detection. Our models can efficiently fuse the visual and semantic information at both token-level and feature-level. We comprehensively evaluate the proposed multimodal FSOD models on multiple few-shot object detection benchmarks, achieving promising results. ",

    "abstract": "Phoneme recognition is a largely unsolved problem in NLP, especially for low-resource languages like Urdu. The systems that try to extract the phonemes from audio speech require hand-labeled phonetic transcriptions. This requires expert linguists to annotate speech data with its relevant phonetic representation which is both an expensive and a tedious task. In this paper, we propose STRATA, a framework for supervised phoneme recognition that overcomes the data scarcity issue for low resource languages using a seq2seq neural architecture integrated with transfer learning, attention mechanism, and data augmentation. STRATA employs transfer learning to reduce the network loss in half. It uses attention mechanism for word boundaries and frame alignment detection which further reduces the network loss by 4% and is able to identify the word boundaries with 92.2% accuracy. STRATA uses various data augmentation techniques to further reduce the loss by 1.5% and is more robust towards new signals both in terms of generalization and accuracy. STRATA is able to achieve a Phoneme Error Rate of 16.5% and improves upon the state of the art by 1.1% for TIMIT dataset (English) and 11.5% for CSaLT dataset (Urdu). ",

    "abstract": "The Narrowband Internet of Things (NB-IoT) is a cellular technology introduced by the Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) to provide connectivity to a large number of low-cost IoT devices with strict energy consumption limitations. However, in an ultra-dense small cell network employing NB-IoT technology, inter-cell interference can be a problem, raising serious concerns regarding the performance of NB-IoT, particularly in uplink transmission. Thus, a power allocation method must be established to analyze uplink performance, control and predict inter-cell interference, and avoid excessive energy waste during transmission. Unfortunately, standard power allocation techniques become inappropriate as their computational complexity grows in an ultra-dense environment. Furthermore, the performance of NB-IoT is strongly dependent on the traffic generated by IoT devices. In order to tackle these challenges, we provide a consistent and distributed uplink power allocation solution under spatiotemporal fluctuation incorporating NB-IoT features such as the number of repetitions and the data rate, as well as the IoT device's energy budget, packet size, and traffic intensity, by leveraging stochastic geometry analysis and Mean-Field Game (MFG) theory. The effectiveness of our approach is illustrated via extensive numerical analysis, and many insightful discussions are presented. ",

Preamble detection is performed to maintain communication and synchronization between devices of the Internet of Everything (IoE) and next-generation nodes.

We show that when injecting 15% random noise, the detection performance degrades to 48%. We propose an informative instance-based fusion network (IIFNet) to cope with random noise and to improve detection performance, simultaneously. A novel sampling strategy for selecting informative instances from feature spaces has also been explored to improve detection performance.

    "abstract": "In large scale dynamic wireless networks, the amount of overhead caused by channel estimation (CE) is becoming one of the main performance bottlenecks. This is due to the large number users whose channels should be estimated, the user mobility, and the rapid channel change caused by the usage of the high-frequency spectrum (e.g. millimeter wave). In this work, we propose a new hybrid channel estimation/prediction (CEP) scheme to reduce overhead in time-division duplex (TDD) wireless cell-free massive multiple-input-multiple-output (mMIMO) systems. The scheme proposes sending a pilot signal from each user only once in a given number (window) of coherence intervals (CIs). Then minimum mean-square error (MMSE) estimation is used to estimate the channel of this CI, while a deep neural network (DNN) is used to predict the channels of the remaining CIs in the window. The DNN exploits the temporal correlation between the consecutive CIs and the received pilot signals to improve the channel prediction accuracy. By doing so, CE overhead is reduced by at least 50 percent at the expense of negligible CE error for practical user mobility settings. Consequently, the proposed CEP scheme improves the spectral efficiency compared to the conventional MMSE CE approach, especially when the number of users is large, which is demonstrated numerically.

    "abstract": "Similarity query is the family of queries based on some similarity metrics. Unlike the traditional database queries which are mostly based on value equality, similarity queries aim to find targets \"similar enough to\" the given data objects, depending on some similarity metric, e.g., Euclidean distance, cosine similarity and so on. To measure the similarity between data objects, traditional methods normally work on low level or syntax features(e.g., basic visual features on images or bag-of-word features of text), which makes them weak to compute the semantic similarities between objects. So for measuring data similarities semantically, neural embedding is applied. Embedding techniques work by representing the raw data objects as vectors (so called \"embeddings\" or \"neural embeddings\" since they are mostly generated by neural network models) that expose the hidden semantics of the raw data, based on which embeddings do show outstanding effectiveness on capturing data similarities, making it one of the most widely used and studied techniques in the state-of-the-art similarity query processing research. But there are still many open challenges on the efficiency of embedding based similarity query processing, which are not so well-studied as the effectiveness. In this survey, we first provide an overview of the \"similarity query\" and \"similarity query processing\" problems. Then we talk about recent approaches on designing the indexes and operators for highly efficient similarity query processing on top of embeddings (or more generally, high dimensional data). Finally, we investigate the specific solutions with and without using embeddings in selected application domains of similarity queries, including entity resolution and information retrieval. By comparing the solutions, we show how neural embeddings benefit those applications. ",

In recent years, a number of subspace trackers have been proposed and obtained impressive results. Inspired by the most recent results that the tracking performance is boosted by the subspace with discrimination capability learned over the recently localized targets and their immediately surrounding background, this work aims at solving such a problem: how to learn a robust low-dimensional subspace to accurately and discriminatively represent these target and background samples. To this end, a discriminative approach, which reliably separates the target from its surrounding background, is injected into the subspace learning by means of joint learning, achieving a dimension-adaptive subspace with superior discrimination capability. The proposed approach is extensively evaluated and compared with the state-of-the-art trackers on four popular tracking benchmarks. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed tracker performs competitively against its counterparts. In particular, it achieves more than 9% performance increase compared with the state-of-the-art subspace trackers. ",

Considering the safety critical applications of c-MARL, such as traffic management, power management and unmanned aerial vehicle control, it is crucial to test the robustness of c-MARL algorithm before it was deployed in reality. Existing adversarial attacks for MARL could be used for testing, but is limited to one robustness aspects (e.g., reward, state, action), while c-MARL model could be attacked from any aspect. To overcome the challenge, we propose MARLSafe, the first robustness testing framework for c-MARL algorithms. First, motivated by Markov Decision Process (MDP), MARLSafe consider the robustness of c-MARL algorithms comprehensively from three aspects, namely state robustness, action robustness and reward robustness. Any c-MARL algorithm must simultaneously satisfy these robustness aspects to be considered secure. Second, due to the scarceness of c-MARL attack, we propose c-MARL attacks as robustness testing algorithms from multiple aspects. Experiments on \\textit{SMAC} environment reveals that many state-of-the-art c-MARL algorithms are of low robustness in all aspect, pointing out the urgent need to test and enhance robustness of c-MARL algorithms.

The human-aware task planner needs to assign jobs to both robots and human workers so that they can work collaboratively to achieve better time efficiency. However, the complexity of the tasks and the stochastic nature of the human collaborators bring challenges to such task planning. To reduce the complexity of the planning problem, we utilize the hierarchical task model, which explicitly captures the sequential and parallel relationships of the task. We model human movements with the sigma-lognormal functions to account for human-induced uncertainties. A human action model adaptation scheme is applied during run-time, and it provides a measure for modeling the human-induced uncertainties. We propose a sampling-based method to estimate human job completion time uncertainties. Next, we propose a robust task planner, which formulates the planning problem as a robust optimization problem by considering the task structure and the uncertainties. We conduct simulations of a robot arm collaborating with a human worker in an electronics assembly setting. The results show that our proposed planner can reduce task completion time when human-induced uncertainties occur compared to the baseline planner. ",

Albeit great effort made in single source domain adaptation, a more generalized task with multiple source domains remains not being well explored, due to knowledge degradation during their combination. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach, namely target-relevant knowledge preservation (TRKP), to unsupervised multi-source DAOD. Specifically, TRKP adopts the teacher-student framework, where the multi-head teacher network is built to extract knowledge from labeled source domains and guide the student network to learn detectors in unlabeled target domain. The teacher network is further equipped with an adversarial multi-source disentanglement (AMSD) module to preserve source domain-specific knowledge and simultaneously perform cross-domain alignment. Besides, a holistic target-relevant mining (HTRM) scheme is developed to re-weight the source images according to the source-target relevance. By this means, the teacher network is enforced to capture target-relevant knowledge, thus benefiting decreasing domain shift when mentoring object detection in the target domain.

We propose a solution to these problems based on two ideas: (i) we use together a set of suitable augmentation and a consistency loss to guide the model to learn semantic representations that are invariant to the photometric and geometric shifts typical of the top-down perspective (Augmentation Invariance); (ii) we use a sampling method (Adaptive Sampling) that selects the training images based on a measure of pixel-wise distribution of classes and actual network confidence.

This paper proposes a completely data driven framework which requires minimum intervention of field experts and can be deployed in emergency cases with relative ease. Our approach involves YOLOv4 to detect the chromosomes and remove the debris in each image, followed by a classifier that differentiates between an analysable chromosome and a non-analysable one. Images are extracted from YOLOv4 based on the protocols described by WHO-BIODOSNET. The analysable chromosome is classified as Monocentric or Dicentric and an image is accepted for consideration of dose estimation based on the analysable chromosome count.

    "title": "Learning 3D Semantics from Pose-Noisy 2D Images with Hierarchical Full  Attention Network",
    "abstract": "We propose a novel framework to learn 3D point cloud semantics from 2D multi-view image observations containing pose error. On the one hand, directly learning from the massive, unstructured and unordered 3D point cloud is computationally and algorithmically more difficult than learning from compactly-organized and context-rich 2D RGB images. On the other hand, both LiDAR point cloud and RGB images are captured in standard automated-driving datasets. This motivates us to conduct a \"task transfer\" paradigm so that 3D semantic segmentation benefits from aggregating 2D semantic cues, albeit pose noises are contained in 2D image observations. Among all difficulties, pose noise and erroneous prediction from 2D semantic segmentation approaches are the main challenges for the task transfer. To alleviate the influence of those factor, we perceive each 3D point using multi-view images and for each single image a patch observation is associated. Moreover, the semantic labels of a block of neighboring 3D points are predicted simultaneously, enabling us to exploit the point structure prior to further improve the performance. A hierarchical full attention network~(HiFANet) is designed to sequentially aggregates patch, bag-of-frames and inter-point semantic cues, with hierarchical attention mechanism tailored for different level of semantic cues. Also, each preceding attention block largely reduces the feature size before feeding to the next attention block, making our framework slim. Experiment results on Semantic-KITTI show that the proposed framework outperforms existing 3D point cloud based methods significantly, it requires much less training data and exhibits tolerance to pose noise.

We frame walking as a set invariance problem enforceable via control barrier functions (CBFs) defined on the reduced-order dynamics quantifying the underactuated component of the robot: the zero dynamics. Our approach contains two learning modules: one for learning a policy that satisfies the CBF condition, and another for learning a residual dynamics model to refine imperfections of the nominal model. Importantly, learning only over the zero dynamics significantly reduces the dimensionality of the learning problem while using CBFs allows us to still make guarantees for the full-order system. The method is demonstrated experimentally on an underactuated bipedal robot, where we are able to show agile and dynamic locomotion, even with partially unknown dynamics. ",

    "abstract": "The concept of federated learning (FL) was first proposed by Google in 2016. Thereafter, FL has been widely studied for the feasibility of application in various fields due to its potential to make full use of data without compromising the privacy. However, limited by the capacity of wireless data transmission, the employment of federated learning on mobile devices has been making slow progress in practical. The development and commercialization of the 5th generation (5G) mobile networks has shed some light on this. In this paper, we analyze the challenges of existing federated learning schemes for mobile devices and propose a novel cross-device federated learning framework, which utilizes the anonymous communication technology and ring signature to protect the privacy of participants while reducing the computation overhead of mobile devices participating in FL. In addition, our scheme implements a contribution-based incentive mechanism to encourage mobile users to participate in FL. We also give a case study of autonomous driving. Finally, we present the performance evaluation of the proposed scheme and discuss some open issues in federated learning. ",

    "abstract": "Massive false rumors emerging along with breaking news or trending topics severely hinder the truth. Existing rumor detection approaches achieve promising performance on the yesterday`s news, since there is enough corpus collected from the same domain for model training. However, they are poor at detecting rumors about unforeseen events especially those propagated in different languages due to the lack of training data and prior knowledge (i.e., low-resource regimes). In this paper, we propose an adversarial contrastive learning framework to detect rumors by adapting the features learned from well-resourced rumor data to that of the low-resourced. Our model explicitly overcomes the restriction of domain and/or language usage via language alignment and a novel supervised contrastive training paradigm. Moreover, we develop an adversarial augmentation mechanism to further enhance the robustness of low-resource rumor representation. Extensive experiments conducted on two low-resource datasets collected from real-world microblog platforms demonstrate that our framework achieves much better performance than state-of-the-art methods and exhibits a superior capacity for detecting rumors at early stages.

    "abstract": "Given a multivariate big time series, can we detect anomalies as soon as they occur? Many existing works detect anomalies by learning how much a time series deviates away from what it should be in the reconstruction framework. However, most models have to cut the big time series into small pieces empirically since optimization algorithms cannot afford such a long series. The question is raised: do such cuts pollute the inherent semantic segments, like incorrect punctuation in sentences? Therefore, we propose a reconstruction-based anomaly detection method, MissGAN, iteratively learning to decode and encode naturally smooth time series in coarse segments, and finding out a finer segment from low-dimensional representations based on HMM. As a result, learning from multi-scale segments, MissGAN can reconstruct a meaningful and robust time series, with the help of adversarial regularization and extra conditional states. MissGAN does not need labels or only needs labels of normal instances, making it widely applicable. Experiments on industrial datasets of real water network sensors show our MissGAN outperforms the baselines with scalability. Besides, we use a case study on the CMU Motion dataset to demonstrate that our model can well distinguish unexpected gestures from a given conditional motion. ",

To further improve the performance of the end-to-end speaker diarization for real speech recordings, recently works have been proposed which integrate unsupervised clustering algorithms with the end-to-end neural diarization models. However, these methods have a number of drawbacks: 1) The unsupervised clustering algorithms cannot leverage the supervision from the available datasets; 2) The K-means-based unsupervised algorithms that are explored often suffer from the constraint violation problem; 3) There is unavoidable mismatch between the supervised training and the unsupervised inference. In this paper, a robust generic neural clustering approach is proposed that can be integrated with any chunk-level predictor to accomplish a fully supervised end-to-end speaker diarization model. Also, by leveraging the sequence modelling ability of a recurrent neural network, the proposed neural clustering approach can dynamically estimate the number of speakers during inference. Experimental show that when integrating an attractor-based chunk-level predictor, the proposed neural clustering approach can yield better Diarization Error Rate (DER) than the constrained K-means-based clustering approaches under the mismatched conditions.

The proposed distributed neural precoding network, called DNet, is committed to achieving two objectives. First, the DNet realizes channel state information (CSI) compression with a distributed architecture of neural networks, which enables practical deployment on multiple users. Specifically, this neural network is composed of multiple independent sub-networks with the same structure and parameters, which reduces both the number of training parameters and network complexity. Secondly, DNet learns the calculation of hybrid precoding from reconstructed CSI from limited feedback. Different from existing black-box neural network design, the DNet is specifically designed according to the data form of the matrix calculation of hybrid precoding. Simulation results show that the proposed DNet significantly improves the performance up to nearly 50% compared to traditional limited feedback precoding methods under the tests with various CSI compression ratios.

During training a query-video bi-encoder model using online search logs, we identify a modality bias phenomenon that the video encoder almost entirely relies on text matching, neglecting other modalities of the videos such as vision, audio. This modality imbalanceresults from a) modality gap: the relevance between a query and a video text is much easier to learn as the query is also a piece of text, with the same modality as the video text; b) data bias: most training samples can be solved solely by text matching. Here we share our practices to improve the first retrieval stage including our solution for the modality imbalance issue. We propose MBVR (short for Modality Balanced Video Retrieval) with two key components: manually generated modality-shuffled (MS) samples and a dynamic margin (DM) based on visual relevance. They can encourage the video encoder to pay balanced attentions to each modality. Through extensive experiments on a real world dataset, we show empirically that our method is both effective and efficient in solving modality bias problem. We have also deployed our MBVR in a large video platform and observed statistically significant boost over a highly optimized baseline in an A/B test and manual GSB evaluations. ",

The first scheme is a straightforward application of conventional perfect RLNC studied in wireless broadcast, so it involves no additional process at the relay. Its performance serves as an upper bound among all perfect RLNC schemes. The other scheme allows sufficiently large buffer and unconstrained linear coding at the relay. It attains the optimal performance and serves as a lower bound among all RLNC schemes. For both schemes, closed-form formulae to characterize the expected completion delay at a single receiver as well as for the whole system are derived. Numerical results are also demonstrated to justify the theoretical characterizations, and compare the two new schemes with the existing one. ",

    "abstract": "Network-aware cascade size prediction aims to predict the final reposted number of user-generated information via modeling the propagation process in social networks. Estimating the user's reposting probability by social influence, namely state activation plays an important role in the information diffusion process. Therefore, Graph Neural Networks (GNN), which can simulate the information interaction between nodes, has been proved as an effective scheme to handle this prediction task. However, existing studies including GNN-based models usually neglect a vital factor of user's preference which influences the state activation deeply. To that end, we propose a novel framework to promote cascade size prediction by enhancing the user preference modeling according to three stages, i.e., preference topics generation, preference shift modeling, and social influence activation. Our end-to-end method makes the user activating process of information diffusion more adaptive and accurate. Extensive experiments on two large-scale real-world datasets have clearly demonstrated the effectiveness of our proposed model compared to state-of-the-art baselines. ",

    "abstract": "With the rapid growth of software, using third-party libraries (TPLs) has become increasingly popular. The prosperity of the library usage has provided the software engineers with handful of methods to facilitate and boost the program development. Unfortunately, it also poses great challenges as it becomes much more difficult to manage the large volume of libraries. Researches and studies have been proposed to detect and understand the TPLs in the software. However, most existing approaches rely on syntactic features, which are not robust when these features are changed or deliberately hidden by the adversarial parties. Moreover, these approaches typically model each of the imported libraries as a whole, therefore, cannot be applied to scenarios where the host software only partially uses the library code segments. To detect both fully and partially imported TPLs at the semantic level, we propose ModX, a framework that leverages novel program modularization techniques to decompose the program into finegrained functionality-based modules. By extracting both syntactic and semantic features, it measures the distance between modules to detect similar library module reuse in the program. Experimental results show that ModX outperforms other modularization tools by distinguishing more coherent program modules with 353% higher module quality scores and beats other TPL detection tools with on average 17% better in precision and 8% better in recall.

    "abstract": "Recently, retrieval models based on dense representations are dominant in passage retrieval tasks, due to their outstanding ability in terms of capturing semantics of input text compared to the traditional sparse vector space models. A common practice of dense retrieval models is to exploit a dual-encoder architecture to represent a query and a passage independently. Though efficient, such a structure loses interaction between the query-passage pair, resulting in inferior accuracy. To enhance the performance of dense retrieval models without loss of efficiency, we propose a GNN-encoder model in which query (passage) information is fused into passage (query) representations via graph neural networks that are constructed by queries and their top retrieved passages. By this means, we maintain a dual-encoder structure, and retain some interaction information between query-passage pairs in their representations, which enables us to achieve both efficiency and efficacy in passage retrieval. Evaluation results indicate that our method significantly outperforms the existing models on MSMARCO, Natural Questions and TriviaQA datasets, and achieves the new state-of-the-art on these datasets.

    "abstract": "Despite the recent progress, the existing multi-view unsupervised feature selection methods mostly suffer from two limitations. First, they generally utilize either cluster structure or similarity structure to guide the feature selection, neglecting the possibility of a joint formulation with mutual benefits. Second, they often learn the similarity structure by either global structure learning or local structure learning, lacking the capability of graph learning with both global and local structural awareness. In light of this, this paper presents a joint multi-view unsupervised feature selection and graph learning (JMVFG) approach. Particularly, we formulate the multi-view feature selection with orthogonal decomposition, where each target matrix is decomposed into a view-specific basis matrix and a view-consistent cluster indicator. Cross-space locality preservation is incorporated to bridge the cluster structure learning in the projected space and the similarity learning (i.e., graph learning) in the original space. Further, a unified objective function is presented to enable the simultaneous learning of the cluster structure, the global and local similarity structures, and the multi-view consistency and inconsistency, upon which an alternating optimization algorithm is developed with theoretically proved convergence. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our approach for both multi-view feature selection and graph learning tasks. ",

In particular, we show that if one can efficiently compute approximate distances in a parallel or a distributed setting, one can also efficiently compute low-diameter decompositions. This consequently implies solutions to many fundamental distance based problems using a polylogarithmic number of approximate distance computations. Our low-diameter decomposition generalizes and extends the line of work starting from [Rozho\\v{n}, Ghaffari STOC 2020] to weighted graphs in a very model-independent manner. Moreover, our clustering results have additional useful properties, including strong-diameter guarantees, separation properties, restricting cluster centers to specified terminals, and more. Applications include: -- The first near-linear work and polylogarithmic depth randomized and deterministic parallel algorithm for low-stretch spanning trees (LSST) with polylogarithmic stretch. Previously, the best parallel LSST algorithm required $m \\cdot n^{o(1)}$ work and $n^{o(1)}$ depth and was inherently randomized. No deterministic LSST algorithm with truly sub-quadratic work and sub-linear depth was known. -- The first near-linear work and polylogarithmic depth deterministic algorithm for computing an $\\ell_1$-embedding into polylogarithmic dimensional space with polylogarithmic distortion. The best prior deterministic algorithms for $\\ell_1$-embeddings either require large polynomial work or are inherently sequential.

The use of nonlinear manifolds for ROMs has gained traction in recent years, showing increased performance for certain nonlinear problems over linear methods. Deep learning has been popular to this end through the use of autoencoders for providing a nonlinear trial manifold for the solution space. In this work, we present a non-intrusive ROM framework for steady-state parameterized partial differential equations (PDEs) that uses convolutional autoencoders (CAEs) to provide a nonlinear solution manifold and is augmented by Gaussian process regression (GPR) to approximate the expansion coefficients of the reduced model. When applied to a numerical example involving the steady incompressible Navier-Stokes equations solving a lid-driven cavity problem, it is shown that the proposed ROM offers greater performance in prediction of full-order states when compared to a popular method employing POD and GPR over a number of ROM dimensions.

    "abstract": "Momentum methods, including heavy-ball~(HB) and Nesterov's accelerated gradient~(NAG), are widely used in training neural networks for their fast convergence. However, there is a lack of theoretical guarantees for their convergence and acceleration since the optimization landscape of the neural network is non-convex. Nowadays, some works make progress towards understanding the convergence of momentum methods in an over-parameterized regime, where the number of the parameters exceeds that of the training instances. Nonetheless, current results mainly focus on the two-layer neural network, which are far from explaining the remarkable success of the momentum methods in training deep neural networks. Motivated by this, we investigate the convergence of NAG with constant learning rate and momentum parameter in training two architectures of deep linear networks: deep fully-connected linear neural networks and deep linear ResNets. Based on the over-parameterization regime, we first analyze the residual dynamics induced by the training trajectory of NAG for a deep fully-connected linear neural network under the random Gaussian initialization. Our results show that NAG can converge to the global minimum at a $(1 - \\mathcal{O}(1/\\sqrt{\\kappa}))^t$ rate, where $t$ is the iteration number and $\\kappa > 1$ is a constant depending on the condition number of the feature matrix. Compared to the $(1 - \\mathcal{O}(1/{\\kappa}))^t$ rate of GD, NAG achieves an acceleration over GD. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first theoretical guarantee for the convergence of NAG to the global minimum in training deep neural networks. Furthermore, we extend our analysis to deep linear ResNets and derive a similar convergence result. ",

    "abstract": "With the recent increase in intelligent CCTVs for visual surveillance, a new image degradation that integrates resolution conversion and synthetic rain models is required. For example, in heavy rain, face images captured by CCTV from a distance have significant deterioration in both visibility and resolution. Unlike traditional image degradation models (IDM), such as rain removal and superresolution, this study addresses a new IDM referred to as a scale-aware heavy rain model and proposes a method for restoring high-resolution face images (HR-FIs) from low-resolution heavy rain face images (LRHR-FI). To this end, a 2-stage network is presented. The first stage generates low-resolution face images (LR-FIs), from which heavy rain has been removed from the LRHR-FIs to improve visibility. To realize this, an interpretable IDM-based network is constructed to predict physical parameters, such as rain streaks, transmission maps, and atmospheric light. In addition, the image reconstruction loss is evaluated to enhance the estimates of the physical parameters. For the second stage, which aims to reconstruct the HR-FIs from the LR-FIs outputted in the first stage, facial component guided adversarial learning (FCGAL) is applied to boost facial structure expressions. To focus on informative facial features and reinforce the authenticity of facial components, such as the eyes and nose, a face-parsing-guided generator and facial local discriminators are designed for FCGAL. The experimental results verify that the proposed approach based on physical-based network design and FCGAL can remove heavy rain and increase the resolution and visibility simultaneously. Moreover, the proposed heavy-rain face image restoration outperforms state-of-the-art models of heavy rain removal, image-to-image translation, and superresolution. ",

This paper presents a backward reachability approach for safety verification of neural feedback loops (NFLs), i.e., closed-loop systems with NN control policies. While recent works have focused on forward reachability as a strategy for safety certification of NFLs, backward reachability offers advantages over the forward strategy, particularly in obstacle avoidance scenarios. Prior works have developed techniques for backward reachability analysis for systems without NNs, but the presence of NNs in the feedback loop presents a unique set of problems due to the nonlinearities in their activation functions and because NN models are generally not invertible. To overcome these challenges, we use existing forward NN analysis tools to find affine bounds on the control inputs and solve a series of linear programs (LPs) to efficiently find an approximation of the backprojection (BP) set, i.e., the set of states for which the NN control policy will drive the system to a given target set. We present an algorithm to iteratively find BP set estimates over a given time horizon and demonstrate the ability to reduce conservativeness in the BP set estimates by up to 88% with low additional computational cost. We use numerical results from a double integrator model to verify the efficacy of these algorithms and demonstrate the ability to certify safety for a linearized ground robot model in a collision avoidance scenario where forward reachability fails.

Existing approaches for video summarization regard the task as a frame-wise keyframe selection problem and generally construct the frame-wise representation by combining the long-range temporal dependency with the unimodal or bimodal information. However, the optimal video summaries need to reflect the most valuable keyframe with its own information, and one with semantic power of the whole content. Thus, it is critical to construct a more powerful and robust frame-wise representation and predict the frame-level importance score in a fair and comprehensive manner. To tackle the above issues, we propose a multimodal hierarchical shot-aware convolutional network, denoted as MHSCNet, to enhance the frame-wise representation via combining the comprehensive available multimodal information. Specifically, we design a hierarchical ShotConv network to incorporate the adaptive shot-aware frame-level representation by considering the short-range and long-range temporal dependency. Based on the learned shot-aware representations, MHSCNet can predict the frame-level importance score in the local and global view of the video.

The state-of-the-art pre-trained models such as CodeBERT require the availability of large-scale code corpora.

In this paper, we propose Zecoler, a zero-shot learning approach for code representations. Zecoler is built upon a pre-trained programming language model. In order to elicit knowledge from the pre-trained models efficiently, Zecoler casts the downstream tasks to the same form of pre-training tasks by inserting trainable prompts into the original input. Then, it employs the prompt learning technique which optimizes the pre-trained model by merely adjusting the original input. This enables the representation model to efficiently fit the scarce task-oriented data while reusing pre-trained knowledge. We evaluate Zecoler in three code intelligent tasks in two program languages that have no training samples, namely, Solidity and Go, with model trained in corpora of common languages such as Java.

However, existing methods meet large performance drops under realistic weather, such as rain and fog, since they do not take the domain shift between the training data and multiple test environments into consideration. To minor this domain gap, we propose a Multiple-environment Self-adaptive Network (MuSe-Net) to dynamically adjust the domain shift caused by environmental changing. In particular, MuSe-Net employs a two-branch neural network containing one multiple-environment style extraction network and one self-adaptive feature extraction network. As the name implies, the multiple-environment style extraction network is to extract the environment-related style information, while the self-adaptive feature extraction network utilizes an adaptive modulation module to dynamically minimize the environment-related style gap. Extensive experiments on two widely-used benchmarks, i.e., University-1652 and CVUSA, demonstrate that the proposed MuSe-Net achieves a competitive result for geo-localization in multiple environments. Furthermore, we observe that the proposed method also shows great potential to the unseen extreme weather, such as mixing the fog, rain and snow. ",

However, a subspace is often sufficient for accurate representation in practical applications, and redundant features can be invalid or even harmful.

This paper proposes a new NMF method by introducing adaptive weights to identify key features in the original space so that only a subspace involves generating the new representation. Two strategies are proposed to achieve this: the fuzzier weighted technique and entropy regularized weighted technique, both of which result in an iterative solution with a simple form. Experimental results on several real-world datasets demonstrated that the proposed methods can generate a more accurate feature representation than existing methods.

Our approach, named CenterNet, detects each object as a triplet keypoints (top-left and bottom-right corners and the center keypoint). We firstly group the corners by some designed cues and further confirm the objects by the center keypoints. The corner keypoints equip the approach with the ability to detect objects of various scales and shapes and the center keypoint avoids the confusion brought by a large number of false-positive proposals. Our approach is a kind of anchor-free detector because it does not need to define explicit anchor boxes. We adapt our approach to the backbones with different structures, i.e., the 'hourglass' like networks and the the 'pyramid' like networks, which detect objects on a single-resolution feature map and multi-resolution feature maps, respectively.

    "abstract": "Code-switching occurs when more than one language is mixed in a given sentence or a conversation. This phenomenon is more prominent on social media platforms and its adoption is increasing over time. Therefore code-mixed NLP has been extensively studied in the literature. As pre-trained transformer-based architectures are gaining popularity, we observe that real code-mixing data are scarce to pre-train large language models. We present L3Cube-HingCorpus, the first large-scale real Hindi-English code mixed data in a Roman script. It consists of 52.93M sentences and 1.04B tokens, scraped from Twitter. We further present HingBERT, HingMBERT, HingRoBERTa, and HingGPT. The BERT models have been pre-trained on codemixed HingCorpus using masked language modelling objectives. We show the effectiveness of these BERT models on the subsequent downstream tasks like code-mixed sentiment analysis, POS tagging, NER, and LID from the GLUECoS benchmark. The HingGPT is a GPT2 based generative transformer model capable of generating full tweets. We also release L3Cube-HingLID Corpus, the largest code-mixed Hindi-English language identification(LID) dataset and HingBERT-LID, a production-quality LID model to facilitate capturing of more code-mixed data using the process outlined in this work.

    "abstract": "Machine learning (ML) inference is a real-time workload that must comply with strict Service Level Objectives (SLOs), including latency and accuracy targets. Unfortunately, ensuring that SLOs are not violated in inference-serving systems is challenging due to inherent model accuracy-latency tradeoffs, SLO diversity across and within application domains, evolution of SLOs over time, unpredictable query patterns, and co-location interference. In this paper, we observe that neural networks exhibit high degrees of per-input activation sparsity during inference. . Thus, we propose SLO-Aware Neural Networks which dynamically drop out nodes per-inference query, thereby tuning the amount of computation performed, according to specified SLO optimization targets and machine utilization. SLO-Aware Neural Networks achieve average speedups of $1.3-56.7\\times$ with little to no accuracy loss (less than 0.3%). When accuracy constrained, SLO-Aware Neural Networks are able to serve a range of accuracy targets at low latency with the same trained model. When latency constrained, SLO-Aware Neural Networks can proactively alleviate latency degradation from co-location interference while maintaining high accuracy to meet latency constraints. ",

Recently, transition-based KGE methods have achieved promising performance, where the single relation vector learns to translate head entity to tail entity. However, this scoring pattern is not suitable for complex scenarios where the same entity pair has different relations. Previous models usually focus on the improvement of entity representation for 1-to-N, N-to-1 and N-to-N relations, but ignore the single relation vector. In this paper, we propose a novel transition-based method, TranS, for knowledge graph embedding. The single relation vector in traditional scoring patterns is replaced with synthetic relation representation, which can solve these issues effectively and efficiently.

In comparison, for forecasting tasks on continuous space such as temperature prediction on the earth's surface, the \\textit{spatially-inductive} property allows the model to generalize to any point in the spatial domain, demonstrating models' ability to learn the underlying mechanisms or physics laws of the systems, rather than simply fit the signals. Besides, in temporal domains, \\textit{irregularly-sampled} time series, e.g. data with missing values, urge models to be temporally-continuous. Motivated by the two issues, we propose a spatio-temporal framework based on neural operators for PDEs, which learn the underlying mechanisms governing the dynamics of spatially-continuous physical quantities. Experiments show our model's improved performance on forecasting spatially-continuous physic quantities, and its superior generalization to unseen spatial points and ability to handle temporally-irregular data.

Chief among them, the configuration model constrains random networks by their degree distribution and is foundational to many areas of network science. However, these representations are often selected based on intuition or mathematical and computational simplicity rather than on statistical evidence. To evaluate the quality of a network representation we need to consider both the amount of information required by a random network model as well as the probability of recovering the original data when using the model as a generative process. To this end, we calculate the approximate size of network ensembles generated by the popular configuration model and its generalizations that include degree-correlations and centrality layers based on the onion decomposition. We then apply minimum description length as a model selection criterion and also introduce the Network Onion Divergence: model selection and network comparison over a nested family of configuration models with differing level of structural details. Using over 100 empirical sets of network data, we find that a simple Layered Configuration Model offers the most compact representation of the majority of real networks. We hope that our results will continue to motivate the development of intricate random network models that help capture network structure beyond the simple degree distribution. ",

The performance of existing deep supervised CD methods is attributed to the large amounts of annotated data used to train the networks. However, annotating large amounts of remote sensing images is labor-intensive and expensive, particularly with bi-temporal images, as it requires pixel-wise comparisons by a human expert. On the other hand, we often have access to unlimited unlabeled multi-temporal RS imagery thanks to ever-increasing earth observation programs. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective way to leverage the information from unlabeled bi-temporal images to improve the performance of CD approaches. More specifically, we propose a semi-supervised CD model in which we formulate an unsupervised CD loss in addition to the supervised Cross-Entropy (CE) loss by constraining the output change probability map of a given unlabeled bi-temporal image pair to be consistent under the small random perturbations applied on the deep feature difference map that is obtained by subtracting their latent feature representations. Experiments conducted on two publicly available CD datasets show that the proposed semi-supervised CD method can reach closer to the performance of supervised CD even with access to as little as 10% of the annotated training data.

    "abstract": "An ideal learned representation should display transferability and robustness. Supervised contrastive learning (SupCon) is a promising method for training accurate models, but produces representations that do not capture these properties due to class collapse -- when all points in a class map to the same representation. Recent work suggests that \"spreading out\" these representations improves them, but the precise mechanism is poorly understood. We argue that creating spread alone is insufficient for better representations, since spread is invariant to permutations within classes. Instead, both the correct degree of spread and a mechanism for breaking this invariance are necessary. We first prove that adding a weighted class-conditional InfoNCE loss to SupCon controls the degree of spread. Next, we study three mechanisms to break permutation invariance: using a constrained encoder, adding a class-conditional autoencoder, and using data augmentation. We show that the latter two encourage clustering of latent subclasses under more realistic conditions than the former. Using these insights, we show that adding a properly-weighted class-conditional InfoNCE loss and a class-conditional autoencoder to SupCon achieves 11.1 points of lift on coarse-to-fine transfer across 5 standard datasets and 4.7 points on worst-group robustness on 3 datasets, setting state-of-the-art on CelebA by 11.5 points.

In this work, we present $\\Upsilon$-Net, an architecture that combines the frequency domain features with the image domain to improve the segmentation performance of OCT images. The results of this work demonstrate that the introduction of two branches, one for spectral and one for spatial domain features, brings a very significant improvement in fluid segmentation performance and allows outperformance as compared to the well-known U-Net model. Our improvement was 13% on the fluid segmentation dice score and 1.9% on the average dice score.

However, the interpretation of multi-modal EEG signals is challenging, as they suffer from poor signal-to-noise-ratio, are highly subject-dependent, and are bound to the equipment and experimental setup used, (i.e. domain). This leads to machine learning models often suffer from poor generalization ability, where they perform significantly worse on real-world data than on the exploited training data. Recent research heavily focuses on cross-subject and cross-session transfer learning frameworks to reduce domain calibration efforts for EEG signals. We argue that multi-source learning via learning domain-invariant representations from multiple data-sources is a viable alternative, as the available data from different EEG data-source domains (e.g., subjects, sessions, experimental setups) grow massively. We propose an adversarial inference approach to learn data-source invariant representations in this context, enabling multi-source learning for EEG-based brain-computer interfaces. We unify EEG recordings from different source domains (i.e., emotion recognition datasets SEED, SEED-IV, DEAP, DREAMER), and demonstrate the feasibility of our invariant representation learning approach in suppressing data-source-relevant information leakage by 35% while still achieving stable EEG-based emotion classification performance.

The proposed method is robust against additive noise and outliers. In particular, sample points are allowed to be perturbed away from the manifold. Traditional TDA tools, like those based on the distance filtration, often struggle to distinguish small features from noise, because of their short persistence. An alternative filtration, called Robust Density-Aware Distance (RDAD) filtration, is proposed to prolong the persistence of small holes surrounded by high-density regions. This is achieved by weighting the distance function by the density in the sense of Bell et al. Distance-to-measure is incorporated to enhance stability and mitigate noise due to the density estimation. The utility of the proposed filtration in identifying small holes, as well as its robustness against noise, are illustrated through an analytical example and extensive numerical experiments. Basic mathematical properties of the proposed filtration are proven. ",

In this paper, we introduce a practical approach to improve the predictions of a pre-trained model through Few-Shot Learning (FSL). After training and validating a model, a small number of false inference images are collected to retrain the model using \\textbf{\\textit{Image Triplets}} - a false positive or false negative, a true positive, and a true negative. The retrained FSL model produces considerable gains in performance with only a few epochs and few images. In addition, FSL opens rapid retraining opportunities for human-in-the-loop systems, where a radiologist can relabel false inferences, and the model can be quickly retrained. We compare our retrained model performance with existing FSL approaches in medical imaging that train and evaluate models at once. ",

    "title": "LRH-Net: A Multi-Level Knowledge Distillation Approach for Low-Resource  Heart Network",
    "abstract": "An electrocardiogram (ECG) monitors the electrical activity generated by the heart and is used to detect fatal cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). Conventionally, to capture the precise electrical activity, clinical experts use multiple-lead ECGs (typically 12 leads). But in recent times, large-size deep learning models have been used to detect these diseases. However, such models require heavy compute resources like huge memory and long inference time. To alleviate these shortcomings, we propose a low-parameter model, named Low Resource Heart-Network (LRH-Net), which uses fewer leads to detect ECG anomalies in a resource-constrained environment. A multi-level knowledge distillation process is used on top of that to get better generalization performance on our proposed model. The multi-level knowledge distillation process distills the knowledge to LRH-Net trained on a reduced number of leads from higher parameter (teacher) models trained on multiple leads to reduce the performance gap. The proposed model is evaluated on the PhysioNet-2020 challenge dataset with constrained input. The parameters of the LRH-Net are 106x less than our teacher model for detecting CVDs. The performance of the LRH-Net was scaled up to 3.2% and the inference time scaled down by 75% compared to the teacher model. In contrast to the compute- and parameter-intensive deep learning techniques, the proposed methodology uses a subset of ECG leads using the low resource LRH-Net, making it eminently suitable for deployment on edge devices.

    "abstract": "Carotid arteries vulnerable plaques are a crucial factor in the screening of atherosclerosis by ultrasound technique. However, the plaques are contaminated by various noises such as artifact, speckle noise, and manual segmentation may be time-consuming. This paper proposes an automatic convolutional neural network (CNN) method for plaque segmentation in carotid ultrasound images using a small dataset. First, a parallel network with three independent scale decoders is utilized as our base segmentation network, pyramid dilation convolutions are used to enlarge receptive fields in the three segmentation sub-networks. Subsequently, the three decoders are merged to be rectified in channels by SENet. Thirdly, in test stage, the initially segmented plaque is refined by the max contour morphology post-processing to obtain the final plaque. Moreover, three loss function Dice loss, SSIM loss and cross-entropy loss are compared to segment plaques. Test results show that the proposed method with dice loss function yields a Dice value of 0.820, an IoU of 0.701, Acc of 0.969, and modified Hausdorff distance (MHD) of 1.43 for 30 vulnerable cases of plaques, it outperforms some of the conventional CNN-based methods on these metrics. Additionally, we apply an ablation experiment to show the validity of each proposed module. Our study provides some reference for similar researches and may be useful in actual applications for plaque segmentation of ultrasound carotid arteries. ",

    "abstract": "We study the decentralized consensus and stochastic optimization problems with compressed communications over static directed graphs. We propose an iterative gradient-based algorithm that compresses messages according to a desired compression ratio. The proposed method provably reduces the communication overhead on the network at every communication round. Contrary to existing literature, we allow for arbitrary compression ratios in the communicated messages. We show a linear convergence rate for the proposed method on the consensus problem. Moreover, we provide explicit convergence rates for decentralized stochastic optimization problems on smooth functions that are either (i) strongly convex, (ii) convex, or (iii) non-convex. Finally, we provide numerical experiments to illustrate convergence under arbitrary compression ratios and the communication efficiency of our algorithm. ",

    "title": "Fast and Memory-Efficient Network Towards Efficient Image  Super-Resolution",
    "abstract": "Runtime and memory consumption are two important aspects for efficient image super-resolution (EISR) models to be deployed on resource-constrained devices. Recent advances in EISR exploit distillation and aggregation strategies with plenty of channel split and concatenation operations to make full use of limited hierarchical features. In contrast, sequential network operations avoid frequently accessing preceding states and extra nodes, and thus are beneficial to reducing the memory consumption and runtime overhead. Following this idea, we design our lightweight network backbone by mainly stacking multiple highly optimized convolution and activation layers and decreasing the usage of feature fusion. We propose a novel sequential attention branch, where every pixel is assigned an important factor according to local and global contexts, to enhance high-frequency details. In addition, we tailor the residual block for EISR and propose an enhanced residual block (ERB) to further accelerate the network inference. Finally, combining all the above techniques, we construct a fast and memory-efficient network (FMEN) and its small version FMEN-S, which runs 33% faster and reduces 74% memory consumption compared with the state-of-the-art EISR model: E-RFDN, the champion in AIM 2020 efficient super-resolution challenge. Besides, FMEN-S achieves the lowest memory consumption and the second shortest runtime in NTIRE 2022 challenge on efficient super-resolution. Code is available at https://github.com/NJU-Jet/FMEN. ",
