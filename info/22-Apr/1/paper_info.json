    "abstract": "Like many other tasks involving neural networks, Speech Recognition models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. However recent research has pointed out differences between attacks and defenses on ASR models compared to image models. Improving the robustness of ASR models requires a paradigm shift from evaluating attacks on one or a few models to a systemic approach in evaluation. We lay the ground for such research by evaluating on various architectures a representative set of adversarial attacks: targeted and untargeted, optimization and speech processing-based, white-box, black-box and targeted attacks. Our results show that the relative strengths of different attack algorithms vary considerably when changing the model architecture, and that the results of some attacks are not to be blindly trusted. They also indicate that training choices such as self-supervised pretraining can significantly impact robustness by enabling transferable perturbations. We release our source code as a package that should help future research in evaluating their attacks and defenses. ",

    "abstract": "Home absence detection is an emerging field on smart home installations. Identifying whether or not the residents of the house are present, is important in numerous scenarios. Possible scenarios include but are not limited to: elderly people living alone, people suffering from dementia, home quarantine. The majority of published papers focus on either pressure / door sensors or cameras in order to detect outing events. Although the aforementioned approaches provide solid results, they are intrusive and require modifications for sensor placement. In our work, appliance electrical use is investigated as a means for detecting the presence or absence of residents. The energy use is the result of power disaggregation, a non intrusive / non invasive sensing method. Since a dataset providing energy data and ground truth for home absence is not available, artificial outing events were introduced on the UK-DALE dataset, a well known dataset for Non Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM). Several machine learning algorithms were evaluated using the generated dataset. Benchmark results have shown that home absence detection using appliance power consumption is feasible. ",

In this paper, we propose a physics-informed deep-learning framework for the discovery of constitutive model parameterizations given full-field displacement data and global force-displacement data. Contrary to the majority of recent literature in this field, we work with the weak form of the governing equations rather than the strong form to impose physical constraints upon the neural network predictions. The approach presented in this paper is computationally efficient, suitable for irregular geometric domains, and readily ingests displacement data without the need for interpolation onto a computational grid. A selection of canonical hyperelastic materials models suitable for different material classes is considered including the Neo-Hookean, Gent, and Blatz-Ko constitutive models as exemplars for general hyperelastic behavior, polymer behavior with lock-up, and compressible foam behavior respectively. We demonstrate that physics informed machine learning is an enabling technology and may shift the paradigm of how full-field experimental data is utilized to calibrate constitutive models under finite deformations.

Models such as neural radiance fields (NeRF), which uses relatively small neural networks, can represent high-quality scenes and achieve state-of-the-art results for novel view synthesis. Training these types of networks, however, is still computationally very expensive. We present depth distribution neural radiance field (DDNeRF), a new method that significantly increases sampling efficiency along rays during training while achieving superior results for a given sampling budget. DDNeRF achieves this by learning a more accurate representation of the density distribution along rays. More specifically, we train a coarse model to predict the internal distribution of the transparency of an input volume in addition to the volume's total density. This finer distribution then guides the sampling procedure of the fine model. This method allows us to use fewer samples during training while reducing computational resources. ",

Most existing approaches follow the contrastive learning pipeline to construct positive and negative pairs by sampling different clips. However, this formulation tends to bias to static background and have difficulty establishing global temporal structures. The major reason is that the positive pairs, i.e., different clips sampled from the same video, have limited temporal receptive field, and usually share similar background but differ in motions. To address these problems, we propose a framework to jointly utilize local clips and global videos to learn from detailed region-level correspondence as well as general long-term temporal relations. Based on a set of controllable augmentations, we achieve accurate appearance and motion pattern alignment through soft spatio-temporal region contrast. Our formulation is able to avoid the low-level redundancy shortcut by mutual information minimization to improve the generalization. We also introduce local-global temporal order dependency to further bridge the gap between clip-level and video-level representations for robust temporal modeling. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework is superior on three video benchmarks in action recognition and video retrieval, capturing more accurate temporal dynamics. ",

    "abstract": "As a neurophysiological response to threat or adverse conditions, stress can affect cognition, emotion and behaviour with potentially detrimental effects on health in the case of sustained exposure. Since the affective content of speech is inherently modulated by an individual's physical and mental state, a substantial body of research has been devoted to the study of paralinguistic correlates of stress-inducing task load. Historically, voice stress analysis (VSA) has been conducted using conventional digital signal processing (DSP) techniques. Despite the development of modern methods based on deep neural networks (DNNs), accurately detecting stress in speech remains difficult due to the wide variety of stressors and considerable variability in the individual stress perception. To that end, we introduce a set of five datasets for task load detection in speech. The voice recordings were collected as either cognitive or physical stress was induced in the cohort of volunteers, with a cumulative number of more than a hundred speakers. We used the datasets to design and evaluate a novel self-supervised audio representation that leverages the effectiveness of handcrafted features (DSP-based) and the complexity of data-driven DNN representations. Notably, the proposed approach outperformed both extensive handcrafted feature sets and novel DNN-based audio representation learning approaches. ",

To be more consistent with the back-end segmentation and clustering, we propose a new CNN-based speaker modeling scheme, which takes into account the heterogeneity of the speakers in each training segment and batch. We randomly and synthetically augment the training data into a set of segments, each of which contains more than one speaker and some overlapping parts. A soft label is imposed on each segment based on its speaker occupation ratio, and the standard cross entropy loss is implemented in model training. In this way, the speaker model should have the ability to generate a geometrically meaningful embedding for each multi-speaker segment. Experimental results show that our system is superior to the baseline system using x-vectors in two speaker diarization tasks. In the CALLHOME task trained on the NIST SRE and Switchboard datasets, our system achieves a relative reduction of 12.93% in DER. In Track 2 of CHiME-6, our system provides 13.24%, 12.60%, and 5.65% relative reductions in DER, JER, and WER, respectively. ",

Specifically, in the restriction phase of R&R, the probabilistic constraint is transformed into the deterministic form by using the Bernsteintype inequality. In the relaxation phase of R&R, the non-convex optimization problem is reformulated into a convex semidefinite program (SDP) by using semidefinite relaxation (SDR) and firstorder Taylor expansion methods. To the best of our knowledge, we first consider the impact of the distribution of the positioning error on the channel state information (CSI), which further influences the data rate.

    "abstract": "Motivated by recent works in the communication and psychology literature, we model and study the role social identity -- a person's sense of belonging to a group -- plays in human information consumption. A hallmark of Social Identity Theory (SIT) is the notion of 'status', i.e., an individual's desire to enhance their and their 'in-group's' utility relative to that of an 'out-group'. In the context of belief formation, this comes off as a desire to believe positive news about the in-group and negative news about the out-group, which has been empirically shown to support belief in misinformation and false news. We model this phenomenon as a Stackelberg game being played over an information channel between a news-source (sender) and news-consumer (receiver), with the receiver incorporating the 'status' associated with social identity in their utility, in addition to accuracy. We characterize the strategy that must be employed by the sender to ensure that its message is trusted by receivers of all identities while maximizing their overall quality of information. We show that, as a rule, this optimal quality of information at equilibrium decreases when a receiver's sense of identity increases. We further demonstrate how extensions of our model can be used to quantitatively estimate the level of importance given to identity in a population. ",

    "abstract": "Ranking systems have an unprecedented influence on how and what information people access, and their impact on our society is being analyzed from different perspectives, such as users' discrimination. A notable example is represented by reputation-based ranking systems, a class of systems that rely on users' reputation to generate a non-personalized item-ranking, proved to be biased against certain demographic classes. To safeguard that a given sensitive user's attribute does not systematically affect the reputation of that user, prior work has operationalized a reputation independence constraint on this class of systems. In this paper, we uncover that guaranteeing reputation independence for a single sensitive attribute is not enough. When mitigating biases based on one sensitive attribute (e.g., gender), the final ranking might still be biased against certain demographic groups formed based on another attribute (e.g., age). Hence, we propose a novel approach to introduce reputation independence for multiple sensitive attributes simultaneously. We then analyze the extent to which our approach impacts on discrimination and other important properties of the ranking system, such as its quality and robustness against attacks. Experiments on two real-world datasets show that our approach leads to less biased rankings with respect to multiple users' sensitive attributes, without affecting the system's quality and robustness.

Motivated by this observation, building on recent work on oracle-based algorithms, we design a statistically optimal and computationally efficient algorithm using heterogeneous treatment effect estimation oracles. Our results provide the first universal reduction of contextual bandits to a general-purpose heterogeneous treatment effect estimation method. We show that our approach is more robust to model misspecification than reward estimation methods based on squared error regression oracles.

Large domain discrepancy makes HFR a difficult problem. Recent methods attempting to fill the gap via synthesis have achieved promising results, but their performance is still limited by the scarcity of paired training data. In practice, large-scale heterogeneous face data are often inaccessible due to the high cost of acquisition and annotation process as well as privacy regulations. In this paper, we propose a new face hallucination paradigm for HFR, which not only enables data-efficient synthesis but also allows to scale up model training without breaking any privacy policy. Unlike existing methods that learn face synthesis entirely from scratch, our approach is particularly designed to take advantage of rich and diverse facial priors from visible domain for more faithful hallucination. On the other hand, large-scale training is enabled by introducing a new federated learning scheme to allow institution-wise collaborations while avoiding explicit data sharing. Extensive experiments demonstrate the advantages of our approach in tackling HFR under current data limitations. In a unified framework, our method yields the state-of-the-art hallucination results on multiple HFR datasets. ",

Previous methods employ either explicit priors to constrain the problem or implicit constraints as formulated by their losses (deep learning). These methods can be negatively influenced by strong illumination conditions causing shading-reflectance leakages. Therefore, in this paper, an end-to-end edge-driven hybrid CNN approach is proposed for intrinsic image decomposition. Edges correspond to illumination invariant gradients. To handle hard negative illumination transitions, a hierarchical approach is taken including global and local refinement layers. We make use of attention layers to further strengthen the learning process. An extensive ablation study and large scale experiments are conducted showing that it is beneficial for edge-driven hybrid IID networks to make use of illumination invariant descriptors and that separating global and local cues helps in improving the performance of the network. Finally, it is shown that the proposed method obtains state of the art performance and is able to generalise well to real world images.

    "abstract": "This paper is concerned with cyberattack detection in discrete-time, leader-following, nonlinear, multi-agent systems subject to unknown but bounded (UBB) system noises. The Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy model is employed to approximate the nonlinear systems over the true value of the state. A distributed cyberattack detection method, based on a new fuzzy set-membership filtering method, which consists of two steps, namely a prediction step and a measurement update step, is developed for each agent to identify two types of cyberattacks at the time of their occurrence. The attacks are replay attacks and false data injection attacks affecting the leader-following consensus. We calculate an estimation ellipsoid set by updating the prediction ellipsoid set with the current sensor measurement data. Two criteria are provided to detect cyberattacks based on the intersection between the ellipsoid sets. If there is no intersection between the prediction set and the estimation set of an agent at the current time instant, a cyberattack on its sensors is declared. Control signal or communication signal data of an agent are under a cyberattack if its prediction set has no intersection with the estimation set updated at the previous time instant. Recursive algorithms for solving the consensus protocol and calculating the two ellipsoid sets for detecting attacks are proposed. Simulation results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. ",

    "abstract": "In recent years, Jupyter notebooks have grown in popularity in several domains of software engineering, such as data science, machine learning, and computer science education. Their popularity has to do with their rich features for presenting and visualizing data, however, recent studies show that notebooks also share a lot of drawbacks: high number of code clones, low reproducibility, etc. In this work, we carry out a comparison between Python code written in Jupyter Notebooks and in traditional Python scripts. We compare the code from two perspectives: structural and stylistic. In the first part of the analysis, we report the difference in the number of lines, the usage of functions, as well as various complexity metrics. In the second part, we show the difference in the number of stylistic issues and provide an extensive overview of the 15 most frequent stylistic issues in the studied mediums. Overall, we demonstrate that notebooks are characterized by the lower code complexity, however, their code could be perceived as more entangled than in the scripts. As for the style, notebooks tend to have 1.4 times more stylistic issues, but at the same time, some of them are caused by specific coding practices in notebooks and should be considered as false positives. With this research, we want to pave the way to studying specific problems of notebooks that should be addressed by the development of notebook-specific tools, and provide various insights that can be useful in this regard.

The STGCN layer performs the feature extraction task for the policy function and the value function of the reinforcement learning architecture, and then we utilize the proximal policy optimization (PPO) to search the action spaces for an optimum policy function and to approximate an optimum value function. We further utilize the low-pass property of voltage graph signal to introduce an GCN architecture for the the policy whose input is a decimated state vector, i.e. a partial observation. Case studies on the unbalanced 123-bus systems validate the excellent performance of the proposed method in mitigating instabilities and maintaining nodal voltage profiles within a desirable range.

In contrast, millions of people communicate on social media in Bengali. The few existing works that have been carried out need improvements in both accuracy and interpretability. This article proposed encoder decoder based machine learning model, a popular tool in NLP, to classify user's Bengali comments on Facebook pages. A dataset of 7,425 Bengali comments, consisting of seven distinct categories of hate speeches, was used to train and evaluate our model. For extracting and encoding local features from the comments, 1D convolutional layers were used. Finally, the attention mechanism, LSTM, and GRU based decoders have been used for predicting hate speech categories. Among the three encoder decoder algorithms, the attention-based decoder obtained the best accuracy (77%). ",

However, existing deep learning-based methods largely omit the specific characteristics of pavement images, such as high image resolution and low distress area ratio, and are not end-to-end trainable. In this paper, we present a series of simple yet effective end-to-end deep learning approaches named Weakly Supervised Patch Label Inference Networks (WSPLIN) for efficiently addressing these tasks under various application settings. To fully exploit the resolution and scale information, WSPLIN first divides the pavement image under different scales into patches with different collection strategies and then employs a Patch Label Inference Network (PLIN) to infer the labels of these patches. Notably, we design a patch label sparsity constraint based on the prior knowledge of distress distribution, and leverage the Comprehensive Decision Network (CDN) to guide the training of PLIN in a weakly supervised way. Therefore, the patch labels produced by PLIN provide interpretable intermediate information, such as the rough location and the type of distress. We evaluate our method on a large-scale bituminous pavement distress dataset named CQU-BPDD. Extensive results demonstrate the superiority of our method over baselines in both performance and efficiency. ",

    "abstract": "Learning generic joint representations for video and text by a supervised method requires a prohibitively substantial amount of manually annotated video datasets. As a practical alternative, a large-scale but uncurated and narrated video dataset, HowTo100M, has recently been introduced. But it is still challenging to learn joint embeddings of video and text in a self-supervised manner, due to its ambiguity and non-sequential alignment. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-modal self-supervised framework Video-Text Temporally Weak Alignment-based Contrastive Learning (VT-TWINS) to capture significant information from noisy and weakly correlated data using a variant of Dynamic Time Warping (DTW). We observe that the standard DTW inherently cannot handle weakly correlated data and only considers the globally optimal alignment path. To address these problems, we develop a differentiable DTW which also reflects local information with weak temporal alignment. Moreover, our proposed model applies a contrastive learning scheme to learn feature representations on weakly correlated data. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that VT-TWINS attains significant improvements in multi-modal representation learning and outperforms various challenging downstream tasks.

In this study, we utilized high-resolution aggregated location-based disaster related data to construct temporal human mobility networks. Using the constructed temporal network models, we examined characteristics such as motif distribution, motif persistence and temporal stability, and motif attributes to reveal latent sub-structural mechanisms related to the resilience of human mobility networks during disaster-induced perturbations. The results show that urban flood impacts persists in human mobility networks at the sub-structure level for several weeks. The impact extent and recovery duration is heterogeneous across different network types. Also, perturbation impacts persist at the sub-structure level while global topological network properties might indicate the network has recovered. The findings highlight the importance of examining the microstructures and their dynamic processes and attributes in understanding the resilience of temporal human mobility networks (and other temporal networks), it is essential to examine the microstructures and their perturbation impacts and recovery. The findings can also provide disaster managers, public officials, and transportation planners with insights to better evaluate impacts and to monitor recovery in affected communities based on the patterns of impact and recovery in human mobility networks at both sub-structure and global-network levels.

In this work, we introduce a group-equivariant convolutional network for symmetry detection, dubbed EquiSym, which leverages equivariant feature maps with respect to a dihedral group of reflection and rotation. The proposed network is built end-to-end with dihedrally-equivariant layers and trained to output a spatial map for reflection axes or rotation centers. We also present a new dataset, DENse and DIverse symmetry (DENDI), which mitigates limitations of existing benchmarks for reflection and rotation symmetry detection.

Several entities on the Internet do follow this principle. For instance, in this work, we show that many popular web servers on the Internet are generous as they wait for a substantial time period to receive the remaining portion of an incomplete web request. Unfortunately, this behavior also makes them vulnerable to a class of cyber attacks, commonly known as Slow Rate DoS attacks. HTTP/2, the recent version of HTTP, is recently found vulnerable to these attacks. However, the impact of Slow HTTP/2 DoS attacks on real web servers on the Internet has not been studied yet. Also, to the best of our knowledge, there is no defense scheme known to detect Slow Rate DoS attacks against HTTP/2 in real-time. To bridge these gaps, we first test the behavior of HTTP/2 supporting web servers on the Internet against Slow HTTP/2 DoS attacks. Subsequently, we propose a scheme to detect these attacks in real-time. We show that the proposed detection scheme can detect attacks in real-time with high accuracy and marginal computational overhead. ",

To reduce effects of the meta-overfitting, we considered meta-RL with curriculum-based task sampling. Our method is Robust Meta Reinforcement Learning with Guided Task Sampling (RMRL-GTS), which is an effective method that restricts task sampling based on scores and epochs.

However, the number of events collected for a single enterprise can easily run into hundreds of thousands per day, much more than what analysts can investigate under a given budget constraint (time). In this work, we look into the problem of prioritizing suspicious events or anomalies to analysts for further investigation. We develop SIERRA, a system that processes event logs from multiple and diverse middleboxes to detect and rank anomalous activities. SIERRA takes an unsupervised approach and therefore has no dependence on ground truth data. Different from other works, SIERRA defines contexts, that help it to provide visual explanations of highly-ranked anomalous points to analysts, despite employing unsupervised models. We evaluate SIERRA using months of logs from multiple security middleboxes of an enterprise network. The evaluations demonstrate the capability of SIERRA to detect top anomalies in a network while outperforming naive application of existing anomaly detection algorithms as well as a state-of-the-art SIEM-based anomaly detection solution.

It is shown that whether an alarm has been triggered or not, in addition to the current state is sufficient for specifying the optimal decision at each time step. Augmentation of the information to the state space induces an equivalent convex optimization problem, which is tractable using standard solvers. ",

    "abstract": "Rate Splitting Multiple Access (RSMA) has recently emerged as a promising technique to enhance the transmission rate for multiple access networks. Unlike conventional multiple access schemes, RSMA requires splitting and transmitting messages at different rates. The joint optimization of the power allocation and rate control at the transmitter is challenging given the uncertainty and dynamics of the environment. Furthermore, securing transmissions in RSMA networks is a crucial problem because the messages transmitted can be easily exposed to adversaries. This work first proposes a stochastic optimization framework that allows the transmitter to adaptively adjust its power and transmission rates allocated to users, and thereby maximizing the sum-rate and fairness of the system under the presence of an adversary. We then develop a highly effective learning algorithm that can help the transmitter to find the optimal policy without requiring complete information about the environment in advance. Extensive simulations show that our proposed scheme can achieve positive covert transmission rates in the finite blocklength regime and non-saturating rates at high SNR values. More significantly, our achievable covert rate can be increased at high SNR values (i.e., 20 dB to 40 dB), compared with saturating rates of a conventional multiple access scheme. ",

    "abstract": "Recently, there has been an increasing concern about the privacy issue raised by using personally identifiable information in machine learning. However, previous portrait matting methods were all based on identifiable portrait images. To fill the gap, we present P3M-10k in this paper, which is the first large-scale anonymized benchmark for Privacy-Preserving Portrait Matting (P3M). P3M-10k consists of 10,000 high-resolution face-blurred portrait images along with high-quality alpha mattes. We systematically evaluate both trimap-free and trimap-based matting methods on P3M-10k and find that existing matting methods show different generalization abilities under the privacy preserving training setting, i.e., training only on face-blurred images while testing on arbitrary images. Based on the gained insights, we propose a unified matting model named P3M-Net consisting of three carefully designed integration modules that can perform privacy-insensitive semantic perception and detail-reserved matting simultaneously. We further design multiple variants of P3M-Net with different CNN and transformer backbones and identify the difference in their generalization abilities. To further mitigate this issue, we devise a simple yet effective Copy and Paste strategy (P3M-CP) that can borrow facial information from public celebrity images without privacy concerns and direct the network to reacquire the face context at both data and feature levels. P3M-CP only brings a few additional computations during training, while enabling the matting model to process both face-blurred and normal images without extra effort during inference. Extensive experiments on P3M-10k demonstrate the superiority of P3M-Net over state-of-the-art methods and the effectiveness of P3M-CP in improving the generalization ability of P3M-Net, implying a great significance of P3M for future research and real-world applications.

Inspired by the capability of attention mechanism in capturing long term contextual information and learning alignments in ASR and TTS, we propose a neural network based end-to-end forced aligner called NeuFA, in which a novel bidirectional attention mechanism plays an essential role. NeuFA integrates the alignment learning of both ASR and TTS tasks in a unified framework by learning bidirectional alignment information from a shared attention matrix in the proposed bidirectional attention mechanism. Alignments are extracted from the learnt attention weights and optimized by the ASR, TTS and FA tasks in a multi-task learning manner. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model, with mean absolute error on test set drops from 25.8 ms to 23.7 ms at word level, and from 17.0 ms to 15.7 ms at phoneme level compared with state-of-the-art HMM based model.

    "abstract": "After the 2017 TuSimple Lane Detection Challenge, its dataset and evaluation based on accuracy and F1 score have become the de facto standard to measure the performance of lane detection methods. While they have played a major role in improving the performance of lane detection methods, the validity of this evaluation method in downstream tasks has not been adequately researched. In this study, we design 2 new driving-oriented metrics for lane detection: End-to-End Lateral Deviation metric (E2E-LD) is directly formulated based on the requirements of autonomous driving, a core downstream task of lane detection; Per-frame Simulated Lateral Deviation metric (PSLD) is a lightweight surrogate metric of E2E-LD. To evaluate the validity of the metrics, we conduct a large-scale empirical study with 4 major types of lane detection approaches on the TuSimple dataset and our newly constructed dataset Comma2k19-LD. Our results show that the conventional metrics have strongly negative correlations ($\\leq$-0.55) with E2E-LD, meaning that some recent improvements purely targeting the conventional metrics may not have led to meaningful improvements in autonomous driving, but rather may actually have made it worse by overfitting to the conventional metrics. As autonomous driving is a security/safety-critical system, the underestimation of robustness hinders the sound development of practical lane detection models. We hope that our study will help the community achieve more downstream task-aware evaluations for lane detection. ",

In this article, we propose a Kamada-Kawai-based algorithm called W-KK-MS for boundary node detection problems, which is capable of aligning node positions while achieving high sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy in producing a visual drawing from the input network topology. The algorithm put forward in this article selects and assigns weights to top-k nodes in each iteration to speed up the updating process of nodes. We also propose a novel approach to detect and unfold stacked regions in CNCAH networks. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithms can achieve fast convergence on boundary node detection in CNCAH networks and are able to successfully unfold stacked regions. The design and implementation of a prototype system called ELnet for analyzing CNCAH networks is also described in this article. The ELnet system is capable of generating synthetic networks for testing, integrating with force-directed algorithms, and visualizing and analyzing algorithms' outcomes. ",

The layout quality is largely influenced by execution time and methods' input parameters especially for large complex graphs. The snapshots of visualization generated from these algorithms are useful in presenting the current view or a past state of an information on timeslices. Therefore, researchers often need to make a trade-off between the quality of visualization and the selection of appropriate force-directed algorithms. In this paper, we evaluate the quality of snapshots generated from 7 force-directed algorithms in terms of number of edge crossing and the standard deviations of edge length. Our experimental results showed that KK, FA2 and DH algorithms cannot produce satisfactory visualizations for large graphs within the time limit. KK-MS-DS algorithm can process large and planar graphs but it does not perform well for graphs with low average degrees. KK-MS algorithm produces better visualizations for sparse and non-clustered graphs than KK-MS-DS algorithm. ",

Attackers are unfailingly finding innovative ways to bypass detection mechanisms, whichencouraged the adoption of artificial intelligence. However, most research summarizes the general features of AI and induces many false positives, as the behavior of ransomware constantly differs to bypass detection. Focusing on the key indicating features of ransomware becomes vital as this guides the investigator to the inner workings and main function of ransomware itself. By utilizing access privileges in process memory, the main function of the ransomware can be detected more easily and accurately. Furthermore, new signatures and fingerprints of ransomware families can be identified to classify novel ransomware attacks correctly. The current research used the process memory access privileges of the different memory regions of the behavior of an executable to quickly determine its intent before serious harm can occur. To achieve this aim, several well-known machine learning algorithms were explored with an accuracy range of 81.38 to 96.28 percents. The study thus confirms the feasibility of utilizing process memory as a detection mechanism for ransomware. ",

Mutual information can be used as a measure of the quality of internal representations in deep learning models, and the information plane may provide insights into whether the model exploits the available information in the data. The information plane has previously been explored for fully connected neural networks and convolutional architectures. We present an architecture-agnostic method for tracking a network's internal representations during training, which are then used to create the mutual information plane.

However, while the architectures themselves are extremely promising, the phenomena they have been applied to to date are but a small part of what makes conversation engaging. In this paper we survey these neural architectures and what they have been applied to. On the basis of the social science literature, we then describe what we believe to be the most fundamental and definitional feature of conversation, which is its co-construction over time by two or more interlocutors. We discuss how neural architectures of the sort surveyed could profitably be applied to these more fundamental aspects of conversation, and what this buys us in terms of a better analysis of conversation and even, in the longer term, a better way of generating conversation for a conversational system.

    "abstract": "Optical flow estimation aims to find the 2D motion field by identifying corresponding pixels between two images. Despite the tremendous progress of deep learning-based optical flow methods, it remains a challenge to accurately estimate large displacements with motion blur. This is mainly because the correlation volume, the basis of pixel matching, is computed as the dot product of the convolutional features of the two images. The locality of convolutional features makes the computed correlations susceptible to various noises. On large displacements with motion blur, noisy correlations could cause severe errors in the estimated flow. To overcome this challenge, we propose a new architecture \"CRoss-Attentional Flow Transformer\" (CRAFT), aiming to revitalize the correlation volume computation. In CRAFT, a Semantic Smoothing Transformer layer transforms the features of one frame, making them more global and semantically stable. In addition, the dot-product correlations are replaced with transformer Cross-Frame Attention. This layer filters out feature noises through the Query and Key projections, and computes more accurate correlations. On Sintel (Final) and KITTI (foreground) benchmarks, CRAFT has achieved new state-of-the-art performance. Moreover, to test the robustness of different models on large motions, we designed an image shifting attack that shifts input images to generate large artificial motions. Under this attack, CRAFT performs much more robustly than two representative methods, RAFT and GMA. The code of CRAFT is is available at https://github.com/askerlee/craft. ",

Based on pixel-level feature maps from the backbone network, we first develop the omni-scale gated fusion module to aggregate discriminative representations of instances by scale-aware convolutions, leading to robust multi-scale object detection. Meanwhile, the multi-granularity discriminators are proposed to identify which domain different granularities of samples(i.e., pixels, instances, and categories) come from. Notably, we leverage not only the instance discriminability in different categories but also the category consistency between two domains. Extensive experiments are carried out on multiple domain adaptation scenarios, demonstrating the effectiveness of our framework over state-of-the-art algorithms on top of anchor-free FCOS and anchor-based Faster RCNN detectors with different backbones.

Yet, it is a challenging task because the ground-truth distribution is unknown and unobservable, while only one of its samples can be applied for supervising model learning, which is prone to bias. Most recent works focus on predicting diverse trajectories in order to cover all modes of the real distribution, but they may despise the precision and thus give too much credit to unrealistic predictions. To address the issue, we learn the distribution with symmetric cross-entropy using occupancy grid maps as an explicit and scene-compliant approximation to the ground-truth distribution, which can effectively penalize unlikely predictions. In specific, we present an inverse reinforcement learning based multi-modal trajectory distribution forecasting framework that learns to plan by an approximate value iteration network in an end-to-end manner. Besides, based on the predicted distribution, we generate a small set of representative trajectories through a differentiable Transformer-based network, whose attention mechanism helps to model the relations of trajectories.

The objective of this work is to calculate the risk of re-identification arising from a malicious attack to an anonymised dataset, as described below. Methods: We first present an analytical means of estimating the probability of re-identification of a single patient in a k-anonymised dataset of Electronic Health Record (EHR) data. Second, we generalize this solution to obtain the probability of multiple patients being re-identified. We provide synthetic validation via Monte Carlo simulations to illustrate the accuracy of the estimates obtained. Results: The proposed analytical framework for risk estimation provides re-identification probabilities that are in agreement with those provided by simulation in a number of scenarios. Our work is limited by conservative assumptions which inflate the re-identification probability. Discussion: Our estimates show that the re-identification probability increases with the proportion of the dataset maliciously obtained and that it has an inverse relationship with the equivalence class size. Our recursive approach extends the applicability domain to the general case of a multi-patient re-identification attack in an arbitrary k-anonymisation scheme. Conclusion: We prescribe a systematic way to parametrize the k-anonymisation process based on a pre-determined re-identification probability. We observed that the benefits of a reduced re-identification risk that come with increasing k-size may not be worth the reduction in data granularity when one is considering benchmarking the re-identification probability on the size of the portion of the dataset maliciously obtained by the adversary.

In this paper, we propose a span-based Mandarin prosodic structure prediction model to obtain an optimal prosodic structure tree, which can be converted to corresponding prosodic label sequence. Instead of the prerequisite for word segmentation, rich linguistic features are provided by Chinese character-level BERT and sent to encoder with self-attention architecture. On top of this, span representation and label scoring are used to describe all possible prosodic structure trees, of which each tree has its corresponding score. To find the optimal tree with the highest score for a given sentence, a bottom-up CKY-style algorithm is further used. The proposed method can predict prosodic labels of different levels at the same time and accomplish the process directly from Chinese characters in an end-to-end manner. Experiment results on two real-world datasets demonstrate the excellent performance of our span-based method over all sequence-to-sequence baseline approaches. ",

However, such predetermined features are fundamentally limited, because they do not allow to exploit the full potential of a data-driven approach through learning hidden representations. For this reason, several end-to-end methods have been proposed. However, such models are harder to train and require a large number of high-quality recordings with transcriptions. Here, we propose WavThruVec - a two-stage architecture that resolves the bottleneck by using high-dimensional Wav2Vec 2.0 embeddings as intermediate speech representation. Since these hidden activations provide high-level linguistic features, they are more robust to noise. That allows us to utilize annotated speech datasets of a lower quality to train the first-stage module. At the same time, the second-stage component can be trained on large-scale untranscribed audio corpora, as Wav2Vec 2.0 embeddings are time-aligned and speaker-independent. This results in an increased generalization capability to out-of-vocabulary words, as well as to a better generalization to unseen speakers. We show that the proposed model not only matches the quality of state-of-the-art neural models, but also presents useful properties enabling tasks like voice conversion or zero-shot synthesis. ",

This paper makes the first attempt to conduct a comprehensive study on the robustness of deep learning-based rain removal methods against adversarial attacks. Our study shows that, when the image/video is highly degraded, rain removal methods are more vulnerable to the adversarial attacks as small distortions/perturbations become less noticeable or detectable. In this paper, we first present a comprehensive empirical evaluation of various methods at different levels of attacks and with various losses/targets to generate the perturbations from the perspective of human perception and machine analysis tasks. A systematic evaluation of key modules in existing methods is performed in terms of their robustness against adversarial attacks. From the insights of our analysis, we construct a more robust deraining method by integrating these effective modules. Finally, we examine various types of adversarial attacks that are specific to deraining problems and their effects on both human and machine vision tasks, including 1) rain region attacks, adding perturbations only in the rain regions to make the perturbations in the attacked rain images less visible; 2) object-sensitive attacks, adding perturbations only in regions near the given objects.

One way to perform such an aiding uses matching of geophysical measurements, such as gravimetry, gravity gradiometry or magnetometry, with a known geo-referenced map. Although simple in concept, this map matching procedure is challenging: the measurements themselves are noisy; their associated spatial location is uncertain; and the measurements may match multiple points within the map (i.e. non-unique solution). In this paper, we propose a probabilistic multiple hypotheses tracker to solve the map matching problem and allow robust inertial navigation aiding. Our approach addresses the problem both locally, via probabilistic data association, and temporally by incorporating the underlying platform kinematic constraints into the tracker. The map matching output is then integrated into the navigation system using an unscented Kalman filter. Additionally, we present a statistical measure of local map information density -- the map feature variability -- and use it to weight the output covariance of the proposed algorithm. The effectiveness and robustness of the proposed algorithm are demonstrated using a navigation scenario involving gravitational map matching. ",

The previous autoencoders have the problem that they cannot define well what is the features of the input data, and we need to restrict the middle layer of the autoencoder artificially.

In our scenario, the database consists of gnomonic views generated from panoramic images (e.g. Google Street View) and query images are collected with a standard field-of-view camera at a different time. To improve localization, we check the semantic similarity between query and database images, which is not trivial since the position and viewpoint of the cameras do not exactly match. To learn similarity, we propose training a CNN in a self-supervised fashion with contrastive learning on a dataset of semantically segmented images. With experiments we showed that this semantic similarity estimation approach works better than measuring the similarity at pixel-level. Finally, we used the semantic similarity scores to verify the retrievals obtained by a state-of-the-art visual localization method and observed that contrastive learning-based pose verification increases top-1 recall value to 0.90 which corresponds to a 2% improvement.

    "abstract": "While self-supervised speech representation learning (SSL) models serve a variety of downstream tasks, these models have been observed to overfit to the domain from which the unlabelled data originates. To alleviate this issue, we propose PADA (Pruning Assisted Domain Adaptation) and zero out redundant weights from models pre-trained on large amounts of out-of-domain (OOD) data. Intuitively, this helps to make space for the target-domain ASR finetuning. The redundant weights can be identified through various pruning strategies which have been discussed in detail as a part of this work. Specifically, we investigate the effect of the recently discovered Task-Agnostic and Task-Aware pruning on PADA and propose a new pruning paradigm based on the latter, which we call Cross-Domain Task-Aware Pruning (CD-TAW). CD-TAW obtains the initial pruning mask from a well fine-tuned OOD model, which makes it starkly different from the rest of the pruning strategies discussed in the paper. Our proposed CD-TAW methodology achieves up to 20.6% relative WER improvement over our baseline when fine-tuned on a 2-hour subset of Switchboard data without language model (LM) decoding. Furthermore, we conduct a detailed analysis to highlight the key design choices of our proposed method. ",

In this paper, as part of the Interspeech Gram Vaani ASR challenge, we try to study the effect of domain, language, dataset size, and other aspects of our upstream pre-training SSL data on the final performance low-resource downstream ASR task. We also build on the continued pre-training paradigm to study the effect of prior knowledge possessed by models trained using SSL. Extensive experiments and studies reveal that the performance of ASR systems is susceptible to the data used for SSL pre-training. Their performance improves with an increase in similarity and volume of pre-training data.

Whereas algebraic dynamic data structures supporting edge updates and reachability/distance queries have been known for quite a long time, they do not, in general, allow reporting the underlying paths within the same time bounds, especially against an adaptive adversary. In this paper we develop the first known fully dynamic reachability data structures working against an adaptive adversary and supporting edge updates and path queries for two natural variants: (1) point-to-point path reporting, and (2) single-source reachability tree reporting. For point-to-point queries in DAGs, we achieve $O(n^{1.529})$ worst-case update and query bounds, whereas for tree reporting in DAGs, the worst-case bounds are $O(n^{1.765})$. More importantly, we show how to lift these algorithms to work on general graphs at the cost of increasing the bounds to $n^{1+5/6+o(1)}$ and making the update times amortized. On the way to accomplishing that, we obtain two interesting subresults. We give subquadratic fully dynamic algorithms for topological order (in a DAG), and strongly connected components. To the best of our knowledge, such algorithms have not been described before. Additionally, we provide deterministic incremental data structures for reachability and shortest paths that handle edge insertions and report the respective paths within subquadratic worst-case time bounds. For reachability and $(1+\\epsilon)$-approximate shortest paths in weighted digraphs, these bounds match the best known dynamic matrix inverse-based randomized bounds for fully dynamic reachability [v.d.Brand, Nanongkai and Saranurak, FOCS'19]. For exact shortest paths in unweighted graphs, the obtained bounds in the incremental setting polynomially improve upon the respective best known randomized update/distance query bounds in the fully dynamic setting.

Moreover, the samplers in detectors lead to shifted training label distributions, while the tremendous proportion of background to foreground samples severely harms foreground classification. To mitigate these issues, in this paper, we propose Logit Normalization (LogN), a simple technique to self-calibrate the classified logits of detectors in a similar way to batch normalization. In general, our LogN is training- and tuning-free (i.e. require no extra training and tuning process), model- and label distribution-agnostic (i.e. generalization to different kinds of detectors and datasets), and also plug-and-play (i.e. direct application without any bells and whistles). Extensive experiments on the LVIS dataset demonstrate superior performance of LogN to state-of-the-art methods with various detectors and backbones. We also provide in-depth studies on different aspects of our LogN. Further experiments on ImageNet-LT reveal its competitiveness and generalizability. Our LogN can serve as a strong baseline for long-tail object detection and is expected to inspire future research in this field.

We derive a closed-form expression of the optimal solution to the approximate problem using a nontrivial Riccati equation.

In this way, with negligible extra computing budget, we enable the algorithm to access the temporal cues by querying and comparing the two candidate features. Beyond this, we also simplify the velocity learning task by removing the factors of ego-motion and time, which equips BEVDet4D with robust generalization performance and reduces the velocity error by 52.8%. This makes vision-based methods, for the first time, become comparable with those relied on LiDAR or radar in this aspect.

    "abstract": "Schizophrenia is a severe mental health condition that requires a long and complicated diagnostic process. However, early diagnosis is vital to control symptoms. Deep learning has recently become a popular way to analyse and interpret medical data. Past attempts to use deep learning for schizophrenia diagnosis from brain-imaging data have shown promise but suffer from a large training-application gap - it is difficult to apply lab research to the real world. We propose to reduce this training-application gap by focusing on readily accessible data. We collect a data set of psychiatric observations of patients based on DSM-5 criteria. Because similar data is already recorded in all mental health clinics that diagnose schizophrenia using DSM-5, our method could be easily integrated into current processes as a tool to assist clinicians, whilst abiding by formal diagnostic criteria. To facilitate real-world usage of our system, we show that it is interpretable and robust. Understanding how a machine learning tool reaches its diagnosis is essential to allow clinicians to trust that diagnosis. To interpret the framework, we fuse two complementary attention mechanisms, 'squeeze and excitation' and 'self-attention', to determine global attribute importance and attribute interactivity, respectively. The model uses these importance scores to make decisions. This allows clinicians to understand how a diagnosis was reached, improving trust in the model. Because machine learning models often struggle to generalise to data from different sources, we perform experiments with augmented test data to evaluate the model's applicability to the real world. We find that our model is more robust to perturbations, and should therefore perform better in a clinical setting. It achieves 98% accuracy with 10-fold cross-validation. ",

    "abstract": "This paper investigates the problem of synthesizing sensor deception attackers against privacy in the context of supervisory control of discrete-event systems (DES). We consider a DES plant controlled by a supervisor, which is subject to sensor deception attacks. Specifically, we consider an active attacker that can tamper with the observations received by the supervisor by, e.g., hacking on the communication channel between the sensors and the supervisor. The privacy requirement of the supervisory control system is to maintain initial-state opacity, i.e., it does not want to reveal the fact that it was initiated from a secret state during its operation. On the other hand, the attacker aims to deceive the supervisor, by tampering with its observations, such that initial-state opacity is violated due to incorrect control actions. In this work, we investigate from the attacker's point of view by presenting an effective approach for synthesizing sensor attack strategies threatening the privacy of the system. To this end, we propose the All Attack Structure (AAS) that records state estimates for both the supervisor and the attacker. This structure serves as a basis for synthesizing a sensor attack strategy. We also discuss how to simplify the synthesis complexity by leveraging the structural property of the initial-state privacy requirement. A running academic example is provided to illustrate the synthesis procedure. ",

In the imposed game, each vehicle minimizes a weighted sum of its egoistic objective and a cooperative objective. The SVO angles are used to quantify preferences of the vehicles toward the egoistic and cooperative objectives which lead to an appropriate design of weighting factors in a multi-objective optimal control problem. We prove that by solving the proposed optimal control problem, a Nash equilibrium can be obtained. To estimate the SVO angle of the HDV, we develop a receding horizon estimation based on maximum entropy inverse reinforcement learning.

As a result, the cooking domain is a popular use-case to demonstrate decision-support (AI) capabilities in service of benefits like precision health with tools ranging from information retrieval interfaces to task-oriented chatbots. An AI here should understand concepts in the food domain (e.g., recipes, ingredients), be tolerant to failures encountered while cooking (e.g., browning of butter), handle allergy-based substitutions, and work with multiple data modalities (e.g. text and images). However, the recipes today are handled as textual documents which makes it difficult for machines to read, reason and handle ambiguity. This demands a need for better representation of the recipes, overcoming the ambiguity and sparseness that exists in the current textual documents. In this paper, we discuss the construction of a machine-understandable rich recipe representation (R3), in the form of plans, from the recipes available in natural language. R3 is infused with additional knowledge such as information about allergens and images of ingredients, possible failures and tips for each atomic cooking step. To show the benefits of R3, we also present TREAT, a tool for recipe retrieval which uses R3 to perform multi-modal reasoning on the recipe's content (plan objects - ingredients and cooking tools), food preparation process (plan actions and time), and media type (image, text). R3 leads to improved retrieval efficiency and new capabilities that were hither-to not possible in textual representation. ",

    "abstract": "Research related to automatically detecting Alzheimer's disease (AD) is important, given the high prevalence of AD and the high cost of traditional methods. Since AD significantly affects the acoustics of spontaneous speech, speech processing and machine learning (ML) provide promising techniques for reliably detecting AD. However, speech audio may be affected by different types of background noise and it is important to understand how the noise influences the accuracy of ML models detecting AD from speech. In this paper, we study the effect of fifteen types of noise from five different categories on the performance of four ML models trained with three types of acoustic representations. We perform a thorough analysis showing how ML models and acoustic features are affected by different types of acoustic noise. We show that acoustic noise is not necessarily harmful - certain types of noise are beneficial for AD detection models and help increasing accuracy by up to 4.8\\%. We provide recommendations on how to utilize acoustic noise in order to achieve the best performance results with the ML models deployed in real world. ",

We develop a new numerical method for solving elliptic-type PDEs by adapting the Q-learning algorithm in reinforcement learning. Our \"Q-PDE\" algorithm is mesh-free and therefore has the potential to overcome the curse of dimensionality. Using a neural tangent kernel (NTK) approach, we prove that the neural network approximator for the PDE solution, trained with the Q-PDE algorithm, converges to the trajectory of an infinite-dimensional ordinary differential equation (ODE) as the number of hidden units $\\rightarrow \\infty$. For monotone PDE (i.e. those given by monotone operators, which may be nonlinear), despite the lack of a spectral gap in the NTK, we then prove that the limit neural network, which satisfies the infinite-dimensional ODE, converges in $L^2$ to the PDE solution as the training time $\\rightarrow \\infty$. More generally, we can prove that any fixed point of the wide-network limit for the Q-PDE algorithm is a solution of the PDE (not necessarily under the monotone condition). The numerical performance of the Q-PDE algorithm is studied for several elliptic PDEs. ",

    "abstract": "The best performing learning algorithms devised for event cameras work by first converting events into dense representations that are then processed using standard CNNs. However, these steps discard both the sparsity and high temporal resolution of events, leading to high computational burden and latency. For this reason, recent works have adopted Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), which process events as \"static\" spatio-temporal graphs, which are inherently \"sparse\". We take this trend one step further by introducing Asynchronous, Event-based Graph Neural Networks (AEGNNs), a novel event-processing paradigm that generalizes standard GNNs to process events as \"evolving\" spatio-temporal graphs. AEGNNs follow efficient update rules that restrict recomputation of network activations only to the nodes affected by each new event, thereby significantly reducing both computation and latency for event-by-event processing. AEGNNs are easily trained on synchronous inputs and can be converted to efficient, \"asynchronous\" networks at test time. We thoroughly validate our method on object classification and detection tasks, where we show an up to a 200-fold reduction in computational complexity (FLOPs), with similar or even better performance than state-of-the-art asynchronous methods. This reduction in computation directly translates to an 8-fold reduction in computational latency when compared to standard GNNs, which opens the door to low-latency event-based processing. ",

In this work, we propose a simple yet effective loss function for robust facial age estimation via distribution learning, i.e., adaptive mean-residue loss, in which, the mean loss penalizes the difference between the estimated age distribution's mean and the ground-truth age, whereas the residue loss penalizes the entropy of age probability out of dynamic top-K in the distribution.

However, current neural network approaches designed for hypergraphs are mostly shallow, thus limiting their ability to extract information from high-order neighbors. In this paper, we show both theoretically and empirically, that the performance of hypergraph neural networks does not improve as the number of layers increases, which is known as the over-smoothing problem. To tackle this issue, we develop a new deep hypergraph convolutional network called Deep-HGCN, which can maintain the heterogeneity of node representation in deep layers. Specifically, we prove that a $k$-layer Deep-HGCN simulates a polynomial filter of order $k$ with arbitrary coefficients, which can relieve the problem of over-smoothing.

To this end, we introduce a novel family of graph implicit functions with equivariant layers that facilitates modeling fine local details and guaranteed robustness to various groups of geometric transformations, through local $k$-NN graph embeddings with sparse point set observations at multiple resolutions. Our method improves over the existing rotation-equivariant implicit function from 0.69 to 0.89 (IoU) on the ShapeNet reconstruction task.

    "abstract": "Self-supervised learning (SSL) methods aim to learn view-invariant representations by maximizing the similarity between the features extracted from different crops of the same image regardless of cropping size and content. In essence, this strategy ignores the fact that two crops may truly contain different image information, e.g., background and small objects, and thus tends to restrain the diversity of the learned representations. %To this end, the existing strategies typically employ loss functions that enforces the networks to discard part of valuable information, e.g. background and small objects, and sacrifices the diversity of representation. In this work, we address this issue by introducing a new self-supervised learning strategy, LoGo, that explicitly reasons about {\\bf Lo}cal and {\\bf G}l{\\bf o}bal crops. To achieve view invariance, LoGo encourages similarity between global crops from the same image, as well as between a global and a local crop. However, to correctly encode the fact that the content of smaller crops may differ entirely, LoGo promotes two local crops to have dissimilar representations, while being close to global crops. Our LoGo strategy can easily be applied to existing SSL methods. Our extensive experiments on a variety of datasets and using different self-supervised learning frameworks validate its superiority over existing approaches. Noticeably, we achieve better results than supervised models on transfer learning when using only $1/10$ of the data. ",

In contrast with the state-of-the-art methods, the new objects on which our method is applied can be very different from the training objects. As a result, we are the first to show generalization without retraining on the LINEMOD and Occlusion-LINEMOD datasets. Our analysis of the failure modes of previous template-based approaches further confirms the benefits of local features for template matching.

This leads to our proposed framework, termed Implicit Detection or ImpDet, which leverages implicit field learning for 3D object detection. Our ImpDet assigns specific values to points in different local 3D spaces, thereby high-quality boundaries can be generated by classifying points inside or outside the boundary. To solve the problem of sparsity on the object surface, we further present a simple yet efficient virtual sampling strategy to not only fill the empty region, but also learn rich semantic features to help refine the boundaries. Extensive experimental results on KITTI and Waymo benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of unifying implicit fields into object detection. ",

On the other hand, Neural Light Field (NeLF) presents a more straightforward representation over NeRF in novel view synthesis -- the rendering of a pixel amounts to one single forward pass without ray-marching. In this work, we present a deep residual MLP network (88 layers) to effectively learn the light field. We show the key to successfully learning such a deep NeLF network is to have sufficient data, for which we transfer the knowledge from a pre-trained NeRF model via data distillation. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world scenes show the merits of our method over other counterpart algorithms. On the synthetic scenes, we achieve 26-35x FLOPs reduction (per camera ray) and 28-31x runtime speedup, meanwhile delivering significantly better (1.4-2.8 dB average PSNR improvement) rendering quality than NeRF without any customized implementation tricks.

One challenge of such end-to-end solutions is the scarcity of human-annotated phonemes on natural L2 speech. In this work, we leverage unlabeled L2 speech via a pseudo-labeling (PL) procedure and extend the fine-tuning approach based on pre-trained self-supervised learning (SSL) models. Specifically, we use Wav2vec 2.0 as our SSL model, and fine-tune it using original labeled L2 speech samples plus the created pseudo-labeled L2 speech samples. Our pseudo labels are dynamic and are produced by an ensemble of the online model on-the-fly, which ensures that our model is robust to pseudo label noise. We show that fine-tuning with pseudo labels gains a 5.35% phoneme error rate reduction and 2.48% MDD F1 score improvement over a labeled-samples-only fine-tuning baseline. The proposed PL method is also shown to outperform conventional offline PL methods. Compared to the state-of-the-art MDD systems, our MDD solution achieves a more accurate and consistent phonetic error diagnosis.

    "abstract": "We consider the problem of estimating piecewise regular functions in an online setting, i.e., the data arrive sequentially and at any round our task is to predict the value of the true function at the next revealed point using the available data from past predictions. We propose a suitably modified version of a recently developed online learning algorithm called the sleeping experts aggregation algorithm. We show that this estimator satisfies oracle risk bounds simultaneously for all local regions of the domain. As concrete instantiations of the expert aggregation algorithm proposed here, we study an online mean aggregation and an online linear regression aggregation algorithm where experts correspond to the set of dyadic subrectangles of the domain. The resulting algorithms are near linear time computable in the sample size. We specifically focus on the performance of these online algorithms in the context of estimating piecewise polynomial and bounded variation function classes in the fixed design setup. The simultaneous oracle risk bounds we obtain for these estimators in this context provide new and improved (in certain aspects) guarantees even in the batch setting and are not available for the state of the art batch learning estimators.

    "abstract": "Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide. Lung cancer screening (LCS) using annual low-dose computed tomography (CT) scanning has been proven to significantly reduce lung cancer mortality by detecting cancerous lung nodules at an earlier stage. Improving risk stratification of malignancy risk in lung nodules can be enhanced using machine/deep learning algorithms. However most existing algorithms: a) have primarily assessed single time-point CT data alone thereby failing to utilize the inherent advantages contained within longitudinal imaging datasets; b) have not integrated into computer models pertinent clinical data that might inform risk prediction; c) have not assessed algorithm performance on the spectrum of nodules that are most challenging for radiologists to interpret and where assistance from analytic tools would be most beneficial. Here we show the performance of our time-series deep learning model (DeepCAD-NLM-L) which integrates multi-model information across three longitudinal data domains: nodule-specific, lung-specific, and clinical demographic data. We compared our time-series deep learning model to a) radiologist performance on CTs from the National Lung Screening Trial enriched with the most challenging nodules for diagnosis; b) a nodule management algorithm from a North London LCS study (SUMMIT). Our model demonstrated comparable and complementary performance to radiologists when interpreting challenging lung nodules and showed improved performance (AUC=88\\%) against models utilizing single time-point data only. The results emphasise the importance of time-series, multi-modal analysis when interpreting malignancy risk in LCS. ",

    "abstract": "In this work we study robust one- and two-stage problems with discrete uncertainty sets which are known to be hard to solve even if the underlying deterministic problem is easy. Popular solution methods iteratively generate scenario constraints and possibly second-stage variables. This way, by solving a sequence of smaller problems, it is often possible to avoid the complexity of considering all scenarios simultaneously. A key ingredient for the performance of the iterative methods is a good selection of start scenarios. In this paper we propose a data-driven heuristic to seed the iterative solution method with a set of starting scenarios that provide a strong lower bound early in the process, and result in considerably smaller overall solution times compared to other benchmark methods. Our heuristic learns the relevance of a scenario by extracting information from training data based on a combined similarity measure between robust problem instances and single scenarios. Our experiments show that predicting even a small number of good start scenarios by our method can considerably reduce the computation time of the iterative methods. ",

We identify issues related to the difficulty of training such generative models under a purely supervised regime with very few examples, as well as issues regarding the evaluation protocols of existing works. We also find that in this regime, classification accuracy is highly sensitive to how the classes of the dataset are randomly split.

Good voice conversion quality is obtained by exploring better alignment modules or expressive mapping functions. In this study, we investigate zero-shot VC from a novel perspective of self-supervised disentangled speech representation learning. Specifically, we achieve the disentanglement by balancing the information flow between global speaker representation and time-varying content representation in a sequential variational autoencoder (VAE). A zero-shot voice conversion is performed by feeding an arbitrary speaker embedding and content embeddings to the VAE decoder. Besides that, an on-the-fly data augmentation training strategy is applied to make the learned representation noise invariant. On TIMIT and VCTK datasets, we achieve state-of-the-art performance on both objective evaluation, i.e., speaker verification (SV) on speaker embedding and content embedding, and subjective evaluation, i.e., voice naturalness and similarity, and remains to be robust even with noisy source/target utterances.

To date, much of the results on their performance on practical problems are heuristic in nature. In particular, the convergence rate for the training of quantum neural networks is not fully understood. Here, we analyze the dynamics of gradient descent for the training error of a class of variational quantum machine learning models. We define wide quantum neural networks as parameterized quantum circuits in the limit of a large number of qubits and variational parameters. We then find a simple analytic formula that captures the average behavior of their loss function and discuss the consequences of our findings. For example, for random quantum circuits, we predict and characterize an exponential decay of the residual training error as a function of the parameters of the system. We finally validate our analytic results with numerical experiments. ",

It occurs in diverse languages and is prevalent in American English, where it is used not only to mark phrase finality, but also sociolinguistic factors and affect. Due to its irregular periodicity, creaky voice challenges automatic speech processing and recognition systems, particularly for languages where creak is frequently used. This paper proposes a deep learning model to detect creaky voice in fluent speech. The model is composed of an encoder and a classifier trained together. The encoder takes the raw waveform and learns a representation using a convolutional neural network. The classifier is implemented as a multi-headed fully-connected network trained to detect creaky voice, voicing, and pitch, where the last two are used to refine creak prediction. The model is trained and tested on speech of American English speakers, annotated for creak by trained phoneticians. We evaluated the performance of our system using two encoders: one is tailored for the task, and the other is based on a state-of-the-art unsupervised representation. Results suggest our best-performing system has improved recall and F1 scores compared to previous methods on unseen data. ",
