    "abstract": "In time-sensitive networks, bounds on worst-case delays are typically obtained by using network calculus and assuming that flows are constrained by bit-level arrival curves. However, in IEEE TSN or IETF DetNet, source flows are constrained on the number of packets rather than bits. A common approach to obtain a delay bound is to derive a bit-level arrival curve from a packet-level arrival curve. However, such a method is not tight: we show that better bounds can be obtained by directly exploiting the arrival curves expressed at the packet level. Our analysis method also obtains better bounds when flows are constrained with g-regulation, such as the recently proposed Length-Rate Quotient rule. It can also be used to generalize some recently proposed network-calculus delay-bounds for a service curve element with known transmission rate. ",

    "abstract": "For computer vision systems to operate in dynamic situations, they need to be able to represent and reason about object permanence. We introduce a framework for learning to estimate 4D visual representations from monocular RGB-D, which is able to persist objects, even once they become obstructed by occlusions. Unlike traditional video representations, we encode point clouds into a continuous representation, which permits the model to attend across the spatiotemporal context to resolve occlusions. On two large video datasets that we release along with this paper, our experiments show that the representation is able to successfully reveal occlusions for several tasks, without any architectural changes. Visualizations show that the attention mechanism automatically learns to follow occluded objects. Since our approach can be trained end-to-end and is easily adaptable, we believe it will be useful for handling occlusions in many video understanding tasks.

    "abstract": "Full-precision deep learning models are typically too large or costly to deploy on edge devices. To accommodate to the limited hardware resources, models are adapted to the edge using various edge-adaptation techniques, such as quantization and pruning. While such techniques may have a negligible impact on top-line accuracy, the adapted models exhibit subtle differences in output compared to the original model from which they are derived. In this paper, we introduce a new evasive attack, DIVA, that exploits these differences in edge adaptation, by adding adversarial noise to input data that maximizes the output difference between the original and adapted model. Such an attack is particularly dangerous, because the malicious input will trick the adapted model running on the edge, but will be virtually undetectable by the original model, which typically serves as the authoritative model version, used for validation, debugging and retraining. We compare DIVA to a state-of-the-art attack, PGD, and show that DIVA is only 1.7-3.6% worse on attacking the adapted model but 1.9-4.2 times more likely not to be detected by the the original model under a whitebox and semi-blackbox setting, compared to PGD.

Our backoff scheme addresses the common challenges of random exponential backoff such as scalability and robustness to changing wide area latency. We extensively evaluate Baxos to illustrate its performance and robustness against two liveness and performance downgrade attacks using an implementation running on Amazon EC2 in a wide area network and a combination of a micro benchmark and YCSB-A workload on Redis. Our results show that Baxos offers more robustness to liveness and performance downgrade attacks than leader-based consensus protocols. Baxos outperforms Multi-Paxos and Raft up to 185% in throughput under liveness and performance downgrade attacks under worst case contention scenarios where each replica proposes requests concurrently while only incurring a 7% reduction on the maximum throughput in the synchronous attack-free scenario.

In this work, we audit multiple commercial sentiment detection APIs for the gender bias in two actor news headlines settings and report on the level of bias observed.

However, existing architectures can only handle data with regular structures, e.g., images or videos, but fail to generalize to graph-structured data beyond Euclidean space, e.g., social networks or document co-citation networks. Here, we propose an all-optical graph representation learning architecture, termed diffractive graph neural network (DGNN), based on the integrated diffractive photonic computing units (DPUs) to address this limitation. Specifically, DGNN optically encodes node attributes into strip optical waveguides, which are transformed by DPUs and aggregated by on-chip optical couplers to extract their feature representations. Each DPU comprises successive passive layers of metalines to modulate the electromagnetic optical field via diffraction, where the metaline structures are learnable parameters shared across graph nodes. DGNN captures complex dependencies among the node neighborhoods and eliminates the nonlinear transition functions during the light-speed optical message passing over graph structures. We demonstrate the use of DGNN extracted features for node and graph-level classification tasks with benchmark databases and achieve superior performance. Our work opens up a new direction for designing application-specific integrated photonic circuits for high-efficiency processing of large-scale graph data structures using deep learning. ",

However, the location information may have some errors such as GPS errors. In any case, some uncertainty, and localization error is unavoidable in most settings. Applying these distorted locations for clustering will increase the error of beam management. Meanwhile, the traffic demand may change dynamically in the wireless environment. Therefore, a scheme that can handle both the uncertainty of localization and dynamic radio resource allocation is needed. In this paper, we propose a UK-means-based clustering and deep reinforcement learning-based resource allocation algorithm (UK-DRL) for radio resource allocation and beam management in 5G mmWave networks. We first apply UK-means as the clustering algorithm to mitigate the localization uncertainty, then deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is adopted to dynamically allocate radio resources. Finally, we compare the UK-DRL with K-means-based clustering and DRL-based resource allocation algorithm (K-DRL), the simulations show that our proposed UK-DRL-based method achieves 150% higher throughput and 61.5% lower delay compared with K-DRL when traffic load is 4Mbps.

Uncertainty and diversity regarding attack methods make this task challenging. However, the existing works have the limitation of only considering local features or the weak feature mapping of multi-features. To address these limitations, we present a novel model for automotive intrusion detection by spatial-temporal correlation features of in-vehicle communication traffic (STC-IDS). Specifically, the proposed model exploits an encoding-detection architecture. In the encoder part, spatial and temporal relations are encoded simultaneously. To strengthen the relationship between features, the attention-based convolution network still captures spatial and channel features to increase the receptive field, while attention-LSTM build important relationships from previous time series or crucial bytes. The encoded information is then passed to the detector for generating forceful spatial-temporal attention features and enabling anomaly classification. In particular, single-frame and multi-frame models are constructed to present different advantages respectively. Under automatic hyper-parameter selection based on Bayesian optimization, the model is trained to attain the best performance. Extensive empirical studies based on a real-world vehicle attack dataset demonstrate that STC-IDS has outperformed baseline methods and cables fewer false-positive rates while maintaining efficiency.

Our prediction performance achieves state-of-the-art research on both datasets.

    "abstract": "Explainability is crucial for probing graph neural networks (GNNs), answering questions like \"Why the GNN model makes a certain prediction?\". Feature attribution is a prevalent technique of highlighting the explanatory subgraph in the input graph, which plausibly leads the GNN model to make its prediction. Various attribution methods exploit gradient-like or attention scores as the attributions of edges, then select the salient edges with top attribution scores as the explanation. However, most of these works make an untenable assumption - the selected edges are linearly independent - thus leaving the dependencies among edges largely unexplored, especially their coalition effect. We demonstrate unambiguous drawbacks of this assumption - making the explanatory subgraph unfaithful and verbose. To address this challenge, we propose a reinforcement learning agent, Reinforced Causal Explainer (RC-Explainer). It frames the explanation task as a sequential decision process - an explanatory subgraph is successively constructed by adding a salient edge to connect the previously selected subgraph. Technically, its policy network predicts the action of edge addition, and gets a reward that quantifies the action's causal effect on the prediction. Such reward accounts for the dependency of the newly-added edge and the previously-added edges, thus reflecting whether they collaborate together and form a coalition to pursue better explanations. As such, RC-Explainer is able to generate faithful and concise explanations, and has a better generalization power to unseen graphs. When explaining different GNNs on three graph classification datasets, RC-Explainer achieves better or comparable performance to SOTA approaches w.r.t. predictive accuracy and contrastivity, and safely passes sanity checks and visual inspections.

To solve a given task, a network requires a certain set of abilities reflected in its structure. The required abilities depend on each task. There is so far no systematic study of the real capacities of the proposed neural structures. The question of what each structure can and cannot achieve is only partially answered by its performance on common benchmarks. Indeed, natural data contain complex unknown statistical cues. It is therefore impossible to know what cues a given neural structure is taking advantage of in such data. In this work, we sketch a methodology to measure the effect of each structure on a network's ability, by designing ad hoc synthetic datasets. Each dataset is tailored to assess a given ability and is reduced to its simplest form: each input contains exactly the amount of information needed to solve the task. We illustrate our methodology by building three datasets to evaluate each of the three following network properties: a) the ability to link local cues to distant inferences, b) the translation covariance and c) the ability to group pixels with the same characteristics and share information among them. Using a first simplified depth estimation dataset, we pinpoint a serious nonlocal deficit of the U-Net. We then evaluate how to resolve this limitation by embedding its structure with nonlocal layers, which allow computing complex features with long-range dependencies. Using a second dataset, we compare different positional encoding methods and use the results to further improve the U-Net on the depth estimation task. The third introduced dataset serves to demonstrate the need for self-attention-like mechanisms for resolving more realistic depth estimation tasks. ",

In this paper, we achieve uncertain label correction of facial expressions using auxiliary action unit (AU) graphs, called ULC-AG. Specifically, a weighted regularization module is introduced to highlight valid samples and suppress category imbalance in every batch. Based on the latent dependency between emotions and AUs, an auxiliary branch using graph convolutional layers is added to extract the semantic information from graph topologies. Finally, a re-labeling strategy corrects the ambiguous annotations by comparing their feature similarities with semantic templates. Experiments show that our ULC-AG achieves 89.31% and 61.57% accuracy on RAF-DB and AffectNet datasets, respectively, outperforming the baseline and state-of-the-art methods. ",

    "abstract": "Session-based Recommendation (SBR) refers to the task of predicting the next item based on short-term user behaviors within an anonymous session. However, session embedding learned by a non-linear encoder is usually not in the same representation space as item embeddings, resulting in the inconsistent prediction issue while recommending items. To address this issue, we propose a simple and effective framework named CORE, which can unify the representation space for both the encoding and decoding processes. Firstly, we design a representation-consistent encoder that takes the linear combination of input item embeddings as session embedding, guaranteeing that sessions and items are in the same representation space. Besides, we propose a robust distance measuring method to prevent overfitting of embeddings in the consistent representation space. Extensive experiments conducted on five public real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method. The code is available at: https://github.com/RUCAIBox/CORE. ",

    "abstract": "Semantic segmentation is important in medical image analysis. Inspired by the strong ability of traditional image analysis techniques in capturing shape priors and inter-subject similarity, many deep learning (DL) models have been recently proposed to exploit such prior information and achieved robust performance. However, these two types of important prior information are usually studied separately in existing models. In this paper, we propose a novel DL model to model both type of priors within a single framework. Specifically, we introduce an extra encoder into the classic encoder-decoder structure to form a Siamese structure for the encoders, where one of them takes a target image as input (the image-encoder), and the other concatenates a template image and its foreground regions as input (the template-encoder). The template-encoder encodes the shape priors and appearance characteristics of each foreground class in the template image. A cosine similarity based attention module is proposed to fuse the information from both encoders, to utilize both types of prior information encoded by the template-encoder and model the inter-subject similarity for each foreground class. Extensive experiments on two public datasets demonstrate that our proposed method can produce superior performance to competing methods. ",

    "abstract": "Modern recommender systems operate in a fully server-based fashion. To cater to millions of users, the frequent model maintaining and the high-speed processing for concurrent user requests are required, which comes at the cost of a huge carbon footprint. Meanwhile, users need to upload their behavior data even including the immediate environmental context to the server, raising the public concern about privacy. On-device recommender systems circumvent these two issues with cost-conscious settings and local inference. However, due to the limited memory and computing resources, on-device recommender systems are confronted with two fundamental challenges: (1) how to reduce the size of regular models to fit edge devices? (2) how to retain the original capacity? Previous research mostly adopts tensor decomposition techniques to compress the regular recommendation model with limited compression ratio so as to avoid drastic performance degradation. In this paper, we explore ultra-compact models for next-item recommendation, by loosing the constraint of dimensionality consistency in tensor decomposition. Meanwhile, to compensate for the capacity loss caused by compression, we develop a self-supervised knowledge distillation framework which enables the compressed model (student) to distill the essential information lying in the raw data, and improves the long-tail item recommendation through an embedding-recombination strategy with the original model (teacher). The extensive experiments on two benchmarks demonstrate that, with 30x model size reduction, the compressed model almost comes with no accuracy loss, and even outperforms its uncompressed counterpart in most cases.

Since many networks have severe degree heterogeneity, the ordinary spectral clustering (OSC) approach to community detection may perform unsatisfactorily. SCORE alleviates the effect of degree heterogeneity by introducing a new normalization idea in the spectral domain and makes OSC more effective. SCORE is easy to use and computationally fast. It adapts easily to new directions and sees an increasing interest in practice. In this paper, we review the basics of SCORE, the adaption of SCORE to network mixed membership estimation and topic modeling, and the application of SCORE in real data, including two datasets on the publications of statisticians. We also review the theoretical 'ideology' underlying SCORE. We show that in the spectral domain, SCORE converts a simplicial cone to a simplex, and provides a simple and direct link between the simplex and network memberships.

As a first illustration, we analyze a selection of string quartets by Haydn, Mozart and Beethoven and discuss possible implications of our results in terms of different approaches by these composers to stylistic exploration and variety. We observe that Haydn is stylistically the most conservative, followed by Mozart, while Beethoven is the most innovative, expanding and modifying the string quartet as a musical form. Finally we also compare the variability of different genres, namely minuets, allegros, prestos and adagios, by a given composer and conclude that the minuet is the most stable form of the string quartet movements.

However, some DNNs, such as convolutional neural networks (CNN), cannot extract enough information or take too long to obtain enough features from the inputs under specific circumstances of reinforcement learning. For example, the input data of Google Research Football, a reinforcement learning environment which trains agents to play football, is the small map of players' locations. The information is contained not only in the coordinates of players, but also in the relationships between different players. CNNs can neither extract enough information nor take too long to train. To address this issue, this paper proposes a deep q-learning network (DQN) with a graph neural network (GNN) as its model. The GNN transforms the input data into a graph which better represents the football players' locations so that it extracts more information of the interactions between different players. With two GNNs to approximate its local and target value functions, this DQN allows players to learn from their experience by using value functions to see the prospective value of each intended action. The proposed model demonstrated the power of GNN in the football game by outperforming other DRL models with significantly fewer steps. ",

To this end, we investigate a computer vision task setting with incomplete visual input data.

While insufficient visual input intuitively leads to performance drop, we propose to supplement the missing visions via the natural language dialog interactions to better accomplish the task objective. We design a model-agnostic Supplementary Interactive Dialog (SI-Dial) framework that can be jointly learned with most existing models, endowing the current AI systems with the ability of question-answer interactions in natural language. We demonstrate the feasibility of such a task setting with missing visual input and the effectiveness of our proposed dialog module as the supplementary information source through extensive experiments and analysis, by achieving promising performance improvement over multiple baselines.

Then for a new input, the set of CPOD basis functions associated with the predicted label is used to reduce the corresponding model.

GNN is the state-of-the-art method that can detect suspicious reviewers by exploiting the topologies of the graph connecting reviewers, reviews, and target products. However, the discrepancy in the detection accuracy over different groups of reviewers causes discriminative treatment of different reviewers of the websites, leading to less engagement and trustworthiness of such websites. The complex dependencies over the review graph introduce difficulties in teasing out subgroups of reviewers that are hidden within larger groups and are treated unfairly. There is no previous study that defines and discovers the subtle subgroups to improve equitable treatment of reviewers. This paper addresses the challenges of defining, discovering, and utilizing subgroup memberships for fair spam detection. We first define a subgroup membership that can lead to discrepant accuracy in the subgroups. Since the subgroup membership is usually not observable while also important to guide the GNN detector to balance the treatment, we design a model that jointly infers the hidden subgroup memberships and exploits the membership for calibrating the target GNN's detection accuracy across subgroups. Comprehensive results on two large Yelp review datasets demonstrate that the proposed model can be trained to treat the subgroups more fairly. ",

Mesh movement methods aim to improve the accuracy of the numerical solution by increasing mesh resolution where the solution is not well-resolved, whilst reducing unnecessary resolution elsewhere. However, mesh movement methods, such as the Monge-Ampere method, require the solution of auxiliary equations, which can be extremely expensive especially when the mesh is adapted frequently. In this paper, we propose to our best knowledge the first learning-based end-to-end mesh movement framework for PDE solvers. Key requirements of learning-based mesh movement methods are alleviating mesh tangling, boundary consistency, and generalization to mesh with different resolutions. To achieve these goals, we introduce the neural spline model and the graph attention network (GAT) into our models respectively. While the Neural-Spline based model provides more flexibility for large deformation, the GAT based model can handle domains with more complicated shapes and is better at performing delicate local deformation. We validate our methods on stationary and time-dependent, linear and non-linear equations, as well as regularly and irregularly shaped domains. Compared to the traditional Monge-Ampere method, our approach can greatly accelerate the mesh adaptation process, whilst achieving comparable numerical error reduction. ",

Using co-authorship networks we constructed, we discover a multi-layer community tree and produce a Sankey diagram to visualize the author migrations in different sub-areas. We also propose several new metrics for research diversity of individual authors. We find that \"Bayes\", \"Biostatistics\", and \"Nonparametric\" are three primary areas in statistics. We also identify 15 sub-areas, each of which can be viewed as a weighted average of the primary areas, and identify several underlying reasons for the formation of co-authorship communities.

EPiDA can support efficient and continuous data generation for effective classifier training. Extensive experiments show that EPiDA outperforms existing SOTA methods in most cases, though not using any agent networks or pre-trained generation networks, and it works well with various DA algorithms and classification models.

We use ROS for experiment. The method proposed in this paper is suitable for mobile platforms with high real-time request. Innovation of our method is using information fusion to compensate the problem of insufficient frame rate of output image, and improve the robustness of target detection and depth estimation under monocular vision.Object Detection is based on YOLO-v5. We have simplified the network structure of its DarkNet53 and realized a prediction speed up to 0.01s. Depth Estimation is based on the VNL Depth Estimation, which considers multiple geometric constraints in 3D global space. It calculates the loss function by calculating the deviation of the virtual normal vector VN and the label, which can obtain deeper depth information. We use PnP fusion algorithm to solve the problem of insufficient frame rate of depth map output. It solves the motion estimation depth from three-dimensional target to two-dimensional point based on corner feature matching, which is faster than VNL calculation. We interpolate VNL output and PnP output to achieve information fusion. Experiments show that this can effectively eliminate the jitter of depth information and improve robustness. At the control end, this method combines the results of target detection and depth estimation to calculate the target position, and uses a pure tracking control algorithm to track it. ",

    "title": "Optimizing Task Placement and Online Scheduling for Distributed GNN  Training Acceleration",
    "abstract": "Training Graph Neural Networks (GNN) on large graphs is resource-intensive and time-consuming, mainly due to the large graph data that cannot be fit into the memory of a single machine, but have to be fetched from distributed graph storage and processed on the go. Unlike distributed deep neural network (DNN) training, the bottleneck in distributed GNN training lies largely in large graph data transmission for constructing mini-batches of training samples. Existing solutions often advocate data-computation colocation, and do not work well with limited resources where the colocation is infeasible. The potentials of strategical task placement and optimal scheduling of data transmission and task execution have not been well explored. This paper designs an efficient algorithm framework for task placement and execution scheduling of distributed GNN training, to better resource utilization, improve execution pipelining, and expediting training completion. Our framework consists of two modules: (i) an online scheduling algorithm that schedules the execution of training tasks, and the data transmission plan; and (ii) an exploratory task placement scheme that decides the placement of each training task. We conduct thorough theoretical analysis, testbed experiments and simulation studies, and observe up to 67% training speed-up with our algorithm as compared to representative baselines. ",

    "abstract": "Over 300 million people worldwide are affected by various retinal diseases. By noninvasive Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) scans, a number of abnormal structural changes in the retina, namely retinal lesions, can be identified. Automated lesion localization in OCT is thus important for detecting retinal diseases at their early stage. To conquer the lack of manual annotation for deep supervised learning, this paper presents a first study on utilizing semi-supervised object detection (SSOD) for lesion localization in OCT images. To that end, we develop a taxonomy to provide a unified and structured viewpoint of the current SSOD methods, and consequently identify key modules in these methods. To evaluate the influence of these modules in the new task, we build OCT-SS, a new dataset consisting of over 1k expert-labeled OCT B-scan images and over 13k unlabeled B-scans. Extensive experiments on OCT-SS identify Unbiased Teacher (UnT) as the best current SSOD method for lesion localization. Moreover, we improve over this strong baseline, with mAP increased from 49.34 to 50.86. ",

    "abstract": "Many currently available universal approximation theorems affirm that deep feedforward networks defined using any suitable activation function can approximate any integrable function locally in $L^1$-norm. Though different approximation rates are available for deep neural networks defined using other classes of activation functions, there is little explanation for the empirically confirmed advantage that ReLU networks exhibit over their classical (e.g. sigmoidal) counterparts. Our main result demonstrates that deep networks with piecewise linear activation (e.g. ReLU or PReLU) are fundamentally more expressive than deep feedforward networks with analytic (e.g. sigmoid, Swish, GeLU, or Softplus). More specifically, we construct a strict refinement of the topology on the space $L^1_{\\operatorname{loc}}(\\mathbb{R}^d,\\mathbb{R}^D)$ of locally Lebesgue-integrable functions, in which the set of deep ReLU networks with (bilinear) pooling $\\operatorname{NN}^{\\operatorname{ReLU} + \\operatorname{Pool}}$ is dense (i.e. universal) but the set of deep feedforward networks defined using any combination of analytic activation functions with (or without) pooling layers $\\operatorname{NN}^{\\omega+\\operatorname{Pool}}$ is not dense (i.e. not universal). Our main result is further explained by \\textit{quantitatively} demonstrating that this \"separation phenomenon\" between the networks in $\\operatorname{NN}^{\\operatorname{ReLU}+\\operatorname{Pool}}$ and those in $\\operatorname{NN}^{\\omega+\\operatorname{Pool}}$ by showing that the networks in $\\operatorname{NN}^{\\operatorname{ReLU}}$ are capable of approximate any compactly supported Lipschitz function while \\textit{simultaneously} approximating its essential support; whereas, the networks in $\\operatorname{NN}^{\\omega+\\operatorname{pool}}$ cannot.

Feature identification is one of the most critical and popular processes performed by software engineers during software maintenance activity. However, a meaningful name must be assigned to the Identified Feature Implementation Block (IFIB) to complete the feature identification process. The feature naming process remains a challenging task, where the majority of existing approaches manually assign the name of the IFIB. In this paper, the approach called FeatureClouds was proposed, which can be exploited by software developers to name the IFIBs from software code. FeatureClouds approach incorporates word clouds visualization technique to name Feature Blocks (FBs) by using the most frequent words across these blocks. FeatureClouds had evaluated by assessing its added benefit to the current approaches in the literature, where limited tool support was supplied to software developers to distinguish feature names of the IFIBs. For validity, FeatureClouds had applied to draw shapes and ArgoUML software. The findings showed that the proposed approach achieved promising results according to well-known metrics in terms of Precision and Recall. ",

Although abandoning parser information has improved the applicability of PF methods, the ability of detail synthesizing has also been sacrificed. As a result, the distraction from original cloth may persistin synthesized images, especially in complicated postures and high resolution applications. To address the aforementioned issue, we propose a novel PF method named Regional Mask Guided Network(RMGN). More specifically, a regional mask is proposed to explicitly fuse the features of target clothes and reference persons so that the persisted distraction can be eliminated. A posture awareness loss and a multi-level feature extractor are further proposed to handle the complicated postures and synthesize high resolution images. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed RMGN outperforms both state-of-the-art PB and PF methods.Ablation studies further verify the effectiveness ofmodules in RMGN. ",

    "abstract": "Detecting refactorings in commit history is essential to improve the comprehension of code changes in code reviews and to provide valuable information for empirical studies on software evolution. Several techniques have been proposed to detect refactorings accurately at the granularity level of a single commit. However, refactorings may be performed over multiple commits because of code complexity or other real development problems, which is why attempting to detect refactorings at single-commit granularity is insufficient. We observe that some refactorings can be detected only at coarser granularity, that is, changes spread across multiple commits. Herein, this type of refactoring is referred to as coarse-grained refactoring (CGR). We compared the refactorings detected on different granularities of commits from 19 open-source repositories. The results show that CGRs are common, and their frequency increases as the granularity becomes coarser. In addition, we found that Move-related refactorings tended to be the most frequent CGRs. We also analyzed the causes of CGR and suggested that CGRs will be valuable in refactoring research. ",

    "abstract": "Learning representation from unlabeled time series data is a challenging problem. Most existing self-supervised and unsupervised approaches in the time-series domain do not capture low and high-frequency features at the same time. Further, some of these methods employ large scale models like transformers or rely on computationally expensive techniques such as contrastive learning. To tackle these problems, we propose a non-contrastive self-supervised learning approach efficiently captures low and high-frequency time-varying features in a cost-effective manner. Our method takes raw time series data as input and creates two different augmented views for two branches of the model, by randomly sampling the augmentations from same family. Following the terminology of BYOL, the two branches are called online and target network which allows bootstrapping of the latent representation. In contrast to BYOL, where a backbone encoder is followed by multilayer perceptron (MLP) heads, the proposed model contains additional temporal convolutional network (TCN) heads. As the augmented views are passed through large kernel convolution blocks of the encoder, the subsequent combination of MLP and TCN enables an effective representation of low as well as high-frequency time-varying features due to the varying receptive fields. The two modules (MLP and TCN) act in a complementary manner. We train an online network where each module learns to predict the outcome of the respective module of target network branch. To demonstrate the robustness of our model we performed extensive experiments and ablation studies on five real-world time-series datasets. Our method achieved state-of-art performance on all five real-world datasets. ",

We introduce a generic formulation of the attack that can be used with various speech representations and threat models. The attacker uses adversarial optimization to maximize raw similarity of speaker embeddings between a seed speech sample and a proxy population. The resulting master voice successfully matches a non-trivial fraction of people in an unknown population. Adversarial waveforms obtained with our approach can match on average 69% of females and 38% of males enrolled in the target system at a strict decision threshold calibrated to yield false alarm rate of 1%. By using the attack with a black-box voice cloning system, we obtain master voices that are effective in the most challenging conditions and transferable between speaker encoders. We also show that, combined with multiple attempts, this attack opens even more to serious issues on the security of these systems. ",

    "abstract": "The need for reducing manufacturing defect escape in today's safety-critical applications requires increased fault coverage. However, generating a test set using commercial automatic test pattern generation (ATPG) tools that lead to zero-defect escape is still an open problem. It is challenging to detect all stuck-at faults to reach 100% fault coverage. In parallel, the hardware security community has been actively involved in developing solutions for logic locking to prevent IP piracy. Locks (e.g., XOR gates) are inserted in different locations of the netlist so that an adversary cannot determine the secret key. Unfortunately, the Boolean satisfiability (SAT) based attack, introduced in [1], can break different logic locking schemes in minutes. In this paper, we propose a novel test pattern generation approach using the powerful SAT attack on logic locking. A stuck-at fault is modeled as a locked gate with a secret key. Our modeling of stuck-at faults preserves the property of fault activation and propagation. We show that the input pattern that determines the key is a test for the stuck-at fault. We propose two different approaches for test pattern generation. First, a single stuck-at fault is targeted, and a corresponding locked circuit with one key bit is created. This approach generates one test pattern per fault. Second, we consider a group of faults and convert the circuit to its locked version with multiple key bits. The inputs obtained from the SAT tool are the test set for detecting this group of faults. Our approach is able to find test patterns for hard-to-detect faults that were previously failed in commercial ATPG tools. The proposed test pattern generation approach can efficiently detect redundant faults present in a circuit. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach on ITC'99 benchmarks. The results show that we can achieve a perfect fault coverage reaching 100%. ",

Though, it usually holds in a very small neighborhood of the minimum, and cannot explain many phenomena observed during the optimization process. In this work, we study the structure of neural network loss functions and its implication on optimization in a region beyond the reach of good quadratic approximation. Numerically, we observe that neural network loss functions possesses a multiscale structure, manifested in two ways: (1) in a neighborhood of minima, the loss mixes a continuum of scales and grows subquadratically, and (2) in a larger region, the loss shows several separate scales clearly. Using the subquadratic growth, we are able to explain the Edge of Stability phenomenon[4] observed for gradient descent (GD) method. Using the separate scales, we explain the working mechanism of learning rate decay by simple examples. Finally, we study the origin of the multiscale structure and propose that the non-uniformity of training data is one of its cause. By constructing a two-layer neural network problem we show that training data with different magnitudes give rise to different scales of the loss function, producing subquadratic growth or multiple separate scales.

To unveil the effectiveness of GCNs for recommendation, we first analyze them in a spectral perspective and discover two important findings: (1) only a small portion of spectral graph features that emphasize the neighborhood smoothness and difference contribute to the recommendation accuracy, whereas most graph information can be considered as noise that even reduces the performance, and (2) repetition of the neighborhood aggregation emphasizes smoothed features and filters out noise information in an ineffective way. Based on the two findings above, we propose a new GCN learning scheme for recommendation by replacing neihgborhood aggregation with a simple yet effective Graph Denoising Encoder (GDE), which acts as a band pass filter to capture important graph features. We show that our proposed method alleviates the over-smoothing and is comparable to an indefinite-layer GCN that can take any-hop neighborhood into consideration. Finally, we dynamically adjust the gradients over the negative samples to expedite model training without introducing additional complexity. Extensive experiments on five real-world datasets show that our proposed method not only outperforms state-of-the-arts but also achieves 12x speedup over LightGCN. ",

Rarely chosen communication actions were marginally beneficial. Here we propose a MARL system in which agents can help collaborators perform better while risking low individual performance. We conduct our study in the context of resource distribution for wildfire management. Communicating environmental features and partially observable fire occurrence help the agent collective to pre-emptively distribute resources. Furthermore, we introduce a procedural training environment accommodating auto-curricula and open-endedness towards better generalizability.

    "abstract": "Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has produced great achievements since it was proposed, including the possibility of processing raw vision input data. However, training an agent to perform tasks based on image feedback remains a challenge. It requires the processing of large amounts of data from high-dimensional observation spaces, frame by frame, and the agent's actions are computed according to deep neural network policies, end-to-end. Image pre-processing is an effective way of reducing these high dimensional spaces, eliminating unnecessary information present in the scene, supporting the extraction of features and their representations in the agent's neural network. Modern video-games are examples of this type of challenge for DRL algorithms because of their visual complexity. In this paper, we propose a low-dimensional observation filter that allows a deep Q-network agent to successfully play in a visually complex and modern video-game, called Neon Drive. ",

    "abstract": "Future networks are expected to support various ultra-reliable low-latency communications via wireless links. To avoid the loss of packets and keep the low latency, sliding network coding (SNC) is an emerging technology by generating redundant packets that are the linear combination of the original data packets from the current block and some previous blocks. However, how to take the advantage of re-transmission for SNC is still an open problem since higher reliability could be achieved at the expense of large latency caused by round-trip time (RTT). To deal with this issue, in this paper, we consider the idea of adjusting the transmission phase and the number of the redundant packets for SNC with re-transmission. Specifically, If RTT is large, most of the redundant packets are sent at the first transmission, otherwise, re-transmission will be used. We first derive a concise and tight lower bound of the block error probability of SNC without re-transmission. Then, based on the bound, the theoretical expressions of the proposed re-transmission schemes are derived regarding the block error probability, the average code length, and the average packet latency. Results show that the proposed SNC with re-transmission improves block error probability and keeps the low latency. ",

Our approach uses a multi-task learning architecture, which jointly trains a classifier for relation extraction, and a sequence model that labels words in the context of the relation that explain the decisions of the relation classifier. We also convert the model outputs to rules to bring global explanations to this approach. This sequence model is trained using a hybrid strategy: supervised, when supervision from pre-existing patterns is available, and semi-supervised otherwise. In the latter situation, we treat the sequence model's labels as latent variables, and learn the best assignment that maximizes the performance of the relation classifier. We evaluate the proposed approach on the two datasets and show that the sequence model provides labels that serve as accurate explanations for the relation classifier's decisions, and, importantly, that the joint training generally improves the performance of the relation classifier. We also evaluate the performance of the generated rules and show that the new rules are great add-on to the manual rules and bring the rule-based system much closer to the neural models. ",

The risk of using untrusted third-Party Intellectual Property (3PIP) is the possibility for adversaries to insert malicious modifications known as Hardware Trojans (HTs). These HTs can compromise the integrity, deteriorate the performance, and deny the functionality of the intended design. Various HT detection methods have been proposed in the literature; however, many fall short due to their reliance on a golden reference circuit, a limited detection scope, the need for manual code review, or the inability to scale with large modern designs. We propose a novel golden reference-free HT detection method for both Register Transfer Level (RTL) and gate-level netlists by leveraging Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to learn the behavior of the circuit through a Data Flow Graph (DFG) representation of the hardware design. We evaluate our model on a custom dataset by expanding the Trusthub HT benchmarks \\cite{trusthub1}. The results demonstrate that our approach detects unknown HTs with 97% recall (true positive rate) very fast in 21.1ms for RTL and 84% recall in 13.42s for Gate-Level Netlist. ",

Our SwinFuse includes three parts: the global feature extraction, fusion layer and feature reconstruction. In particular, we build a fully attentional feature encoding backbone to model the long-range dependency, which is a pure transformer network and has a stronger representation ability compared with the convolutional neural networks. Moreover, we design a novel feature fusion strategy based on $L_{1}$-norm for sequence matrices, and measure the corresponding activity levels from row and column vector dimensions, which can well retain competitive infrared brightness and distinct visible details. Finally, we testify our SwinFuse with nine state-of-the-art traditional and deep learning methods on three different datasets through subjective observations and objective comparisons, and the experimental results manifest that the proposed SwinFuse obtains surprising fusion performance with strong generalization ability and competitive computational efficiency.

To restore accuracy after pruning, fine-tuning is usually applied to pruned networks. However, too few remaining parameters in pruned networks inevitably bring a great challenge to fine-tuning to restore accuracy. To address this challenge, we propose a novel method that first linearly over-parameterizes the compact layers in pruned networks to enlarge the number of fine-tuning parameters and then re-parameterizes them to the original layers after fine-tuning. Specifically, we equivalently expand the convolution/linear layer with several consecutive convolution/linear layers that do not alter the current output feature maps. Furthermore, we utilize similarity-preserving knowledge distillation that encourages the over-parameterized block to learn the immediate data-to-data similarities of the corresponding dense layer to maintain its feature learning ability. The proposed method is comprehensively evaluated on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet which significantly outperforms the vanilla fine-tuning strategy, especially for large pruning ratio. ",

While these models do not explicitly incorporate program semantics (i.e., execution results) during training, they are able to generate correct solutions for many problems. However, choosing a single correct program from among a generated set for each problem remains challenging. In this work, we introduce execution result--based minimum Bayes risk decoding (MBR-EXEC) for program selection and show that it improves the few-shot performance of pretrained code models on natural-language-to-code tasks. We select output programs from a generated candidate set by marginalizing over program implementations that share the same semantics. Because exact equivalence is intractable, we execute each program on a small number of test inputs to approximate semantic equivalence. Across datasets, execution or simulated execution significantly outperforms the methods that do not involve program semantics. We find that MBR-EXEC consistently improves over all execution-unaware selection methods, suggesting it as an effective approach for natural language to code translation. ",

Although state-of-the-art methods improve the performance of SISR on several datasets, direct application of these networks for practical use is still an issue due to heavy computational load. For this purpose, recently, researchers have focused on more efficient and high-performing network structures. Information multi-distilling network (IMDN) is one of the highly efficient SISR networks with high performance and low computational load. IMDN achieves this efficiency with various mechanisms such as Intermediate Information Collection (IIC), working in a global setting, Progressive Refinement Module (PRM), and Contrast Aware Channel Attention (CCA), employed in a local setting. These mechanisms, however, do not equally contribute to the efficiency and performance of IMDN. In this work, we propose the Global Progressive Refinement Module (GPRM) as a less parameter-demanding alternative to the IIC module for feature aggregation. To further decrease the number of parameters and floating point operations persecond (FLOPS), we also propose Grouped Information Distilling Blocks (GIDB). Using the proposed structures, we design an efficient SISR network called IMDeception. Experiments reveal that the proposed network performs on par with state-of-the-art models despite having a limited number of parameters and FLOPS. Furthermore, using grouped convolutions as a building block of GIDB increases room for further optimization during deployment. To show its potential, the proposed model was deployed on NVIDIA Jetson Xavier AGX and it has been shown that it can run in real-time on this edge device ",

In particular, an elegant formulation for the corresponding structural theorems involves the strong product of a path and of a bounded treewidth graph, and allows to lift combinatorial results for bounded treewidth graphs to graph classes for which the product structure holds, such as to planar graphs [Dujmovi\\'c et al., J. ACM, 67(4), 22:1-38, 2020]. In this paper, we join the search for extensions of this powerful tool beyond planarity by considering the h-framed graphs, a graph class that includes 1-planar, optimal 2-planar, and k-map graphs (for appropriate values of h). We establish a graph product structure theorem for h-framed graphs stating that the graphs in this class are subgraphs of the strong product of a path, of a planar graph of treewidth at most 3, and of a clique of size $3\\lfloor h/2 \\rfloor +\\lfloor h/3 \\rfloor -1$. This allows us to improve over the previous structural theorems for 1-planar and k-map graphs. Our results constitute significant progress over the previous bounds on the queue number, non-repetitive chromatic number, and p-centered chromatic number of these graph classes, e.g., we lower the currently best upper bound on the queue number of 1-planar graphs and k-map graphs from 495 to 81 and from 32225k(k-3) to 61k, respectively. We also employ the product structure machinery to improve the current upper bounds of twin-width of planar and 1-planar graphs from 183 to 37, and from O(1) to 80, respectively.

    "abstract": "In recent years, rumors have had a devastating impact on society, making rumor detection a significant challenge. However, the studies on rumor detection ignore the intense emotions of images in the rumor content. This paper verifies that the image emotion improves the rumor detection efficiency. A Multimodal Dual Emotion feature in rumor detection, which consists of visual and textual emotions, is proposed. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study which uses visual emotion in rumor detection. The experiments on real datasets verify that the proposed features outperform the state-of-the-art sentiment features, and can be extended in rumor detectors while improving their performance. ",

    "abstract": "Invariance to diverse types of image corruption, such as noise, blurring, or colour shifts, is essential to establish robust models in computer vision. Data augmentation has been the major approach in improving the robustness against common corruptions. However, the samples produced by popular augmentation strategies deviate significantly from the underlying data manifold. As a result, performance is skewed toward certain types of corruption. To address this issue, we propose a multi-source vicinal transfer augmentation (VITA) method for generating diverse on-manifold samples. The proposed VITA consists of two complementary parts: tangent transfer and integration of multi-source vicinal samples. The tangent transfer creates initial augmented samples for improving corruption robustness. The integration employs a generative model to characterize the underlying manifold built by vicinal samples, facilitating the generation of on-manifold samples. Our proposed VITA significantly outperforms the current state-of-the-art augmentation methods, demonstrated in extensive experiments on corruption benchmarks. ",

To comprehensively sort out the research status of rumor detection from multiple perspectives, this paper analyzes the highly focused work from three perspectives: Feature Selection, Model Structure, and Research Methods. From the perspective of feature selection, we divide methods into content feature, social feature, and propagation structure feature of the rumors.

Besides, this work summarizes 30 works into 7 rumor detection methods such as propagation trees, adversarial learning, cross-domain methods, multi-task learning, unsupervised and semi-supervised methods, based knowledge graph, and other methods for the first time.

However, the performance of pre-processing speech tasks like segmentation and diarization can drop considerably on in-the-wild clinical data, specifically when the target dataset comprises of atypical speech. In this paper we study the performance of a pre-trained speech model on a dataset comprising of child-clinician conversations in Danish with respect to the classification threshold. Since we do not have access to sufficient labelled data, we propose few-instance threshold adaptation, wherein we employ the first minutes of the speech conversation to obtain the optimum classification threshold. Through our work in this paper, we learned that the model with default classification threshold performs worse on children from the patient group. Furthermore, the error rates of the model is directly correlated to the severity of diagnosis in the patients. Lastly, our study on few-instance adaptation shows that three-minutes of clinician-child conversation is sufficient to obtain the optimum classification threshold. ",

This challenging task typically requires knowledge about past motion, the environment and likely destination areas. In this context, multi-modality is a fundamental aspect and its effective modeling can be beneficial to any architecture. Inferring accurate trajectories is nevertheless challenging, due to the inherently uncertain nature of the future. To overcome these difficulties, recent models use different inputs and propose to model human intentions using complex fusion mechanisms. In this respect, we propose a lightweight attention-based recurrent backbone that acts solely on past observed positions. Although this backbone already provides promising results, we demonstrate that its prediction accuracy can be improved considerably when combined with a scene-aware goal-estimation module. To this end, we employ a common goal module, based on a U-Net architecture, which additionally extracts semantic information to predict scene-compliant destinations. We conduct extensive experiments on publicly-available datasets (i.e. SDD, inD, ETH/UCY) and show that our approach performs on par with state-of-the-art techniques while reducing model complexity.

    "abstract": "In order to fully exploit the advantages of massive multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO), it is critical for the transmitter to accurately acquire the channel state information (CSI). Deep learning (DL)-based methods have been proposed for CSI compression and feedback to the transmitter. Although most existing DL-based methods consider the CSI matrix as an image, structural features of the CSI image are rarely exploited in neural network design. As such, we propose a model of self-information that dynamically measures the amount of information contained in each patch of a CSI image from the perspective of structural features. Then, by applying the self-information model, we propose a model-and-data-driven network for CSI compression and feedback, namely IdasNet. The IdasNet includes the design of a module of self-information deletion and selection (IDAS), an encoder of informative feature compression (IFC), and a decoder of informative feature recovery (IFR). In particular, the model-driven module of IDAS pre-compresses the CSI image by removing informative redundancy in terms of the self-information. The encoder of IFC then conducts feature compression to the pre-compressed CSI image and generates a feature codeword which contains two components, i.e., codeword values and position indices of the codeword values. Subsequently, the IFR decoder decouples the codeword values as well as position indices to recover the CSI image. Experimental results verify that the proposed IdasNet noticeably outperforms existing DL-based networks under various compression ratios while it has the number of network parameters reduced by orders-of-magnitude compared with various existing methods.

    "title": "Graph-DETR3D: Rethinking Overlapping Regions for Multi-View 3D Object  Detection",
    "abstract": "3D object detection from multiple image views is a fundamental and challenging task for visual scene understanding. Due to its low cost and high efficiency, multi-view 3D object detection has demonstrated promising application prospects. However, accurately detecting objects through perspective views in the 3D space is extremely difficult due to the lack of depth information. Recently, DETR3D introduces a novel 3D-2D query paradigm in aggregating multi-view images for 3D object detection and achieves state-of-the-art performance. In this paper, with intensive pilot experiments, we quantify the objects located at different regions and find that the \"truncated instances\" (i.e., at the border regions of each image) are the main bottleneck hindering the performance of DETR3D. Although it merges multiple features from two adjacent views in the overlapping regions, DETR3D still suffers from insufficient feature aggregation, thus missing the chance to fully boost the detection performance. In an effort to tackle the problem, we propose Graph-DETR3D to automatically aggregate multi-view imagery information through graph structure learning (GSL). It constructs a dynamic 3D graph between each object query and 2D feature maps to enhance the object representations, especially at the border regions. Besides, Graph-DETR3D benefits from a novel depth-invariant multi-scale training strategy, which maintains the visual depth consistency by simultaneously scaling the image size and the object depth. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our Graph-DETR3D. Notably, our best model achieves 49.5 NDS on the nuScenes test leaderboard, achieving new state-of-the-art in comparison with various published image-view 3D object detectors. ",

To improve the richness, collecting long-term behaviors becomes a typical approach in academy and industry but at the cost of increasing online storage and latency. Recently, researchers have proposed several approaches to shorten long-term behavior sequence and then model user interests. These approaches reduce online cost efficiently but do not well handle the noisy information in long-term user behavior, which may deteriorate the performance of CTR prediction significantly. To obtain better cost/performance trade-off, we propose a novel Adversarial Filtering Model (ADFM) to model long-term user behavior. ADFM uses a hierarchical aggregation representation to compress raw behavior sequence and then learns to remove useless behavior information with an adversarial filtering mechanism. The selected user behaviors are fed into interest extraction module for CTR prediction. Experimental results on public datasets and industrial dataset demonstrate that our method achieves significant improvements over state-of-the-art models. ",

Such operational support for ineffective ads has been less explored than that for effective ads. After pre-analyzing 1,000,000 real-world ad creatives, we found that there are two types of discontinuation: short-term (i.e., cut-out) and long-term (i.e., wear-out). In this paper, we propose a practical prediction framework for the discontinuation of ad creatives with a hazard function-based loss function inspired by survival analysis. Our framework predicts the discontinuations with a multi-modal deep neural network that takes as input the ad creative (e.g., text, categorical, image, numerical features). To improve the prediction performance for the two different types of discontinuations and for the ad creatives that contribute to sales, we introduce two new techniques: (1) a two-term estimation technique with multi-task learning and (2) a click-through rate-weighting technique for the loss function. We evaluated our framework using the large-scale ad creative dataset, including 10 billion scale impressions. In terms of the concordance index (short: 0.896, long: 0.939, and overall: 0.792), our framework achieved significantly better performance than the conventional method (0.531). Additionally, we confirmed that our framework (i) demonstrated the same degree of discontinuation effect as manual operations for short-term cases, and (ii) accurately predicted the ad discontinuation order, which is important for long-running ad creatives for long-term cases.

However, drastic performance degradation remains an unwell-studied challenge for practical cross-domain deployment as the lack of labels on the target domain. In this paper, we first comprehensively investigate the significant underlying factor of the domain gap in Mono3D, where the critical observation is a depth-shift issue caused by the geometric misalignment of domains. Then, we propose STMono3D, a new self-teaching framework for unsupervised domain adaptation on Mono3D. To mitigate the depth-shift, we introduce the geometry-aligned multi-scale training strategy to disentangle the camera parameters and guarantee the geometry consistency of domains. Based on this, we develop a teacher-student paradigm to generate adaptive pseudo labels on the target domain. Benefiting from the end-to-end framework that provides richer information of the pseudo labels, we propose the quality-aware supervision strategy to take instance-level pseudo confidences into account and improve the effectiveness of the target-domain training process. Moreover, the positive focusing training strategy and dynamic threshold are proposed to handle tremendous FN and FP pseudo samples. STMono3D achieves remarkable performance on all evaluated datasets and even surpasses fully supervised results on the KITTI 3D object detection dataset. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to explore effective UDA methods for Mono3D. ",

Typically RCA investigation leverages data-sources like application error logs or service call traces.

This is generally termed as Problem Review Board (PRB) Data which constitute a core component of IT Incident Management. However, owing to the raw unstructured nature of PRBs, such root cause knowledge is not directly reusable by manual or automated pipelines for RCA of new incidents. This motivates us to leverage this widely-available data-source to build an Incident Causation Analysis (ICA) engine, using SoTA neural NLP techniques to extract targeted information and construct a structured Causal Knowledge Graph from PRB documents. ICA forms the backbone of a simple-yet-effective Retrieval based RCA for new incidents, through an Information Retrieval system to search and rank past incidents and detect likely root causes from them, given the incident symptom. In this work, we present ICA and the downstream Incident Search and Retrieval based RCA pipeline, built at Salesforce, over 2K documented cloud service incident investigations collected over a few years.

    "abstract": "It is promising to solve linear inverse problems by unfolding iterative algorithms (e.g., iterative shrinkage thresholding algorithm (ISTA)) as deep neural networks (DNNs) with learnable parameters. However, existing ISTA-based unfolded algorithms restrict the network architectures for iterative updates with the partial weight coupling structure to guarantee convergence. In this paper, we propose hybrid ISTA to unfold ISTA with both pre-computed and learned parameters by incorporating free-form DNNs (i.e., DNNs with arbitrary feasible and reasonable network architectures), while ensuring theoretical convergence. We first develop HCISTA to improve the efficiency and flexibility of classical ISTA (with pre-computed parameters) without compromising the convergence rate in theory. Furthermore, the DNN-based hybrid algorithm is generalized to popular variants of learned ISTA, dubbed HLISTA, to enable a free architecture of learned parameters with a guarantee of linear convergence. To our best knowledge, this paper is the first to provide a convergence-provable framework that enables free-form DNNs in ISTA-based unfolded algorithms. This framework is general to endow arbitrary DNNs for solving linear inverse problems with convergence guarantees. Extensive experiments demonstrate that hybrid ISTA can reduce the reconstruction error with an improved convergence rate in the tasks of sparse recovery and compressive sensing. ",

    "abstract": "Civilian-GNSS is vulnerable to signal spoofing attacks, and countermeasures based on cryptographic authentication are being proposed to protect against these attacks. Both Galileo and GPS are currently testing broadcast authentication techniques based on the delayed key disclosure to validate the integrity of navigation messages. These authentication mechanisms have proven secure against record now and replay later attacks, as navigation messages become invalid after keys are released. This work analyzes the security guarantees of cryptographically protected GNSS signals and shows the possibility of spoofing a receiver to an arbitrary location without breaking any cryptographic operation. In contrast to prior work, we demonstrate the ability of an attacker to receive signals close to the victim receiver and generate spoofing signals for a different target location without modifying the navigation message contents. Our strategy exploits the essential common reception and transmission time method used to estimate pseudorange in GNSS receivers, thereby rendering any cryptographic authentication useless. We evaluate our attack on a commercial receiver (ublox M9N) and a software-defined GNSS receiver (GNSS-SDR) using a combination of open-source tools, commercial GNSS signal generators, and software-defined radio hardware platforms. Our results show that it is possible to spoof a victim receiver to locations around 4000 km away from the true location without requiring any high-speed communication networks or modifying the message contents. Through this work, we further highlight the fundamental limitations in securing a broadcast signaling-based localization system even if all communications are cryptographically protected. ",

RVNs with widespread self-organized vessels and opportunistic connections reveal advantages of ubiquity, resilience, low cost and cross-domain transmission.

Here we propose a new hypernetwork approach to grow artificial neural networks based on neural cellular automata (NCA). Inspired by self-organising systems and information-theoretic approaches to developmental biology, we show that our HyperNCA method can grow neural networks capable of solving common reinforcement learning tasks. Finally, we explore how the same approach can be used to build developmental metamorphosis networks capable of transforming their weights to solve variations of the initial RL task. ",

Current ConvQA systems operate over homogeneous sources of information: either a knowledge base (KB), or a text corpus, or a collection of tables. This paper addresses the novel issue of jointly tapping into all of these together, this way boosting answer coverage and confidence. We present CONVINSE, an end-to-end pipeline for ConvQA over heterogeneous sources, operating in three stages: i) learning an explicit structured representation of an incoming question and its conversational context, ii) harnessing this frame-like representation to uniformly capture relevant evidences from KB, text, and tables, and iii) running a fusion-in-decoder model to generate the answer. We construct and release the first benchmark, ConvMix, for ConvQA over heterogeneous sources, comprising 3000 real-user conversations with 16000 questions, along with entity annotations, completed question utterances, and question paraphrases. Experiments demonstrate the viability and advantages of our method, compared to state-of-the-art baselines. ",

Anchor-free methods have made remarkable progress which mainly formulate TAD into two tasks: classification and localization using two separate branches. This paper reveals the temporal misalignment between the two tasks hindering further progress. To address this, we propose a new method that gives insights into moment and region perspectives simultaneously to align the two tasks by acquiring reliable proposal quality. For the moment perspective, Boundary Evaluate Module (BEM) is designed which focuses on local appearance and motion evolvement to estimate boundary quality and adopts a multi-scale manner to deal with varied action durations. For the region perspective, we introduce Region Evaluate Module (REM) which uses a new and efficient sampling method for proposal feature representation containing more contextual information compared with point feature to refine category score and proposal boundary. The proposed Boundary Evaluate Module and Region Evaluate Module (BREM) are generic, and they can be easily integrated with other anchor-free TAD methods to achieve superior performance. In our experiments, BREM is combined with two different frameworks and improves the performance on THUMOS14 by 3.6$\\%$ and 1.0$\\%$ respectively, reaching a new state-of-the-art (63.6$\\%$ average $m$AP). Meanwhile, a competitive result of 36.2\\% average $m$AP is achieved on ActivityNet-1.3 with the consistent improvement of BREM. ",

A portfolio is a set of counter-measures, or controls, against vulnerabilities adopted for a computer system, while an attack graph is a type of a threat scenario model. In an attack graph, nodes are privilege states of the attacker, edges are vulnerabilities escalating privileges, and controls reduce the probabilities of some vulnerabilities being exploited. The tool builds on an optimisation algorithm published by Khouzani et al. (2019), enabling a user to quickly create, edit, and incrementally improve models, analyse results for given portfolios and display the best solutions for all possible budgets in the form of a Pareto frontier. A case study was performed utilising a system graph and suspected attack paths prepared by industrial security engineers based on an industrial source with which they work. The goal of the case study is to model a supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) industrial system which, due to having the potential to harm people, necessitates strong protection while not allowing the use of typical penetration tools like vulnerability scanners. Results are analysed to show how a cyber-security analyst would use CySecTool to store cyber-security intelligence and draw further conclusions. ",

There is a discrepancy between existing annotation guidelines of event causality and conventional causality corpora that focus more on linguistics. Many guidelines restrict themselves to include only explicit relations or clause-based arguments. Therefore, we propose an annotation schema for event causality that addresses these concerns. We annotated 3,559 event sentences from protest event news with labels on whether it contains causal relations or not. Our corpus is known as the Causal News Corpus (CNC). A neural network built upon a state-of-the-art pre-trained language model performed well with 81.20% F1 score on test set, and 83.46% in 5-folds cross-validation. CNC is transferable across two external corpora: CausalTimeBank (CTB) and Penn Discourse Treebank (PDTB). Leveraging each of these external datasets for training, we achieved up to approximately 64% F1 on the CNC test set without additional fine-tuning. CNC also served as an effective training and pre-training dataset for the two external corpora. Lastly, we demonstrate the difficulty of our task to the layman in a crowd-sourced annotation exercise.

It can assist doctors in making informed medication decisions for patients according to electronic medical records (EMRs). However, medication prediction is a challenging data mining task due to the complex relations between medical codes. Most existing studies usually focus on mining the temporal relations between medical codes while neglecting the valuable spatial relations between heterogeneous or homogeneous medical codes, and the inherent relations between homogeneous medical codes from hierarchical ontology graph, which further limits the prediction performance. Therefore, to address these limitations, this paper proposes \\textbf{KnowAugNet}, a multi-sourced medical knowledge augmented medication prediction network which can fully capture the diverse relations between medical codes via multi-level graph contrastive learning framework. Specifically, KnowAugNet first leverages the graph contrastive learning using graph attention network as the encoder to capture the implicit relations between homogeneous medical codes from the medical ontology graph and obtains the knowledge augmented medical codes embedding vectors. Then, it utilizes the graph contrastive learning using a weighted graph convolutional network as the encoder to capture the correlative relations between homogeneous or heterogeneous medical codes from the constructed medical prior relation graph and obtains the relation augmented medical codes embedding vectors. Finally, the augmented medical codes embedding vectors and the supervised medical codes embedding vectors are retrieved and input to the sequential learning network to capture the temporal relations of medical codes and predict medications for patients.

However, acquiring human motion datasets is highly time-consuming, challenging, and expensive. Hence, human motion synthesis is a crucial research problem within deep learning and computer vision. We present a novel method for controllable human motion synthesis by applying attention-based probabilistic deep adversarial models with end-to-end training. We show that we can generate synthetic human motion over both short- and long-time horizons through the use of adversarial attention. Furthermore, we show that we can improve the classification performance of deep learning models in cases where there is inadequate real data, by supplementing existing datasets with synthetic motions.

To this end, we propose SyntaSpeech, a syntax-aware and light-weight NAR-TTS model, which integrates tree-structured syntactic information into the prosody modeling modules in PortaSpeech \\cite{ren2021portaspeech}. Specifically, 1) We build a syntactic graph based on the dependency tree of the input sentence, then process the text encoding with a syntactic graph encoder to extract the syntactic information. 2) We incorporate the extracted syntactic encoding with PortaSpeech to improve the prosody prediction. 3) We introduce a multi-length discriminator to replace the flow-based post-net in PortaSpeech, which simplifies the training pipeline and improves the inference speed, while keeping the naturalness of the generated audio. Experiments on three datasets not only show that the tree-structured syntactic information grants SyntaSpeech the ability to synthesize better audio with expressive prosody, but also demonstrate the generalization ability of SyntaSpeech to adapt to multiple languages and multi-speaker text-to-speech. Ablation studies demonstrate the necessity of each component in SyntaSpeech. Source code and audio samples are available at https://syntaspeech.github.io ",

Previous work processes 3D data using either voxel-based or point-based neural networks, but both types of 3D models are not hardware-efficient due to the large memory footprint and random memory access. In this paper, we study 3D deep learning from the efficiency perspective. We first systematically analyze the bottlenecks of previous 3D methods. We then combine the best from point-based and voxel-based models together and propose a novel hardware-efficient 3D primitive, Point-Voxel Convolution (PVConv). We further enhance this primitive with the sparse convolution to make it more effective in processing large (outdoor) scenes. Based on our designed 3D primitive, we introduce 3D Neural Architecture Search (3D-NAS) to explore the best 3D network architecture given a resource constraint. We evaluate our proposed method on six representative benchmark datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance with 1.8-23.7x measured speedup.

The large variation of geometry and appearance, caused by articulated body poses, shapes and clothing types, are the key bottlenecks of this task. To overcome these challenges, we present a simple yet powerful framework, named Generalizable Neural Performer (GNR), that learns a generalizable and robust neural body representation over various geometry and appearance. Specifically, we compress the light fields for novel view human rendering as conditional implicit neural radiance fields from both geometry and appearance aspects. We first introduce an Implicit Geometric Body Embedding strategy to enhance the robustness based on both parametric 3D human body model and multi-view images hints. We further propose a Screen-Space Occlusion-Aware Appearance Blending technique to preserve the high-quality appearance, through interpolating source view appearance to the radiance fields with a relax but approximate geometric guidance. To evaluate our method, we present our ongoing effort of constructing a dataset with remarkable complexity and diversity. The dataset GeneBody-1.0, includes over 360M frames of 370 subjects under multi-view cameras capturing, performing a large variety of pose actions, along with diverse body shapes, clothing, accessories and hairdos. Experiments on GeneBody-1.0 and ZJU-Mocap show better robustness of our methods than recent state-of-the-art generalizable methods among all cross-dataset, unseen subjects and unseen poses settings.

Representation learning is essential for effective reinforcement learning (RL) from high-dimensional inputs. Unsupervised representation learning approaches based on reconstruction, prediction or contrastive learning have shown substantial learning efficiency gains. Yet, they have mostly been evaluated in clean laboratory or simulated settings. In contrast, real environments are visually complex and contain substantial amounts of clutter and distractors. Unsupervised representations will learn to model such distractors, potentially impairing the agent's learning efficiency. In contrast, an alternative class of approaches, which we call task-induced representation learning, leverages task information such as rewards or demonstrations from prior tasks to focus on task-relevant parts of the scene and ignore distractors. We investigate the effectiveness of unsupervised and task-induced representation learning approaches on four visually complex environments, from Distracting DMControl to the CARLA driving simulator. For both, RL and imitation learning, we find that representation learning generally improves sample efficiency on unseen tasks even in visually complex scenes and that task-induced representations can double learning efficiency compared to unsupervised alternatives.

    "abstract": "MOS (Mean Opinion Score) is a subjective method used for the evaluation of a system's quality. Telecommunications (for voice and video), and speech synthesis systems (for generated speech) are a few of the many applications of the method. While MOS tests are widely accepted, they are time-consuming and costly since human input is required. In addition, since the systems and subjects of the tests differ, the results are not really comparable. On the other hand, a large number of previous tests allow us to train machine learning models that are capable of predicting MOS value. By automatically predicting MOS values, both the aforementioned issues can be resolved. The present work introduces data-, training- and post-training specific improvements to a previous self-supervised learning-based MOS prediction model. We used a wav2vec 2.0 model pre-trained on LibriSpeech, extended with LSTM and non-linear dense layers. We introduced transfer learning, target data preprocessing a two- and three-phase training method with different batch formulations, dropout accumulation (for larger batch sizes) and quantization of the predictions. The methods are evaluated using the shared synthetic speech dataset of the first Voice MOS challenge. ",

    "abstract": "Recently, supervised speech separation has made great progress. However, limited by the nature of supervised training, most existing separation methods require ground-truth sources and are trained on synthetic datasets. This ground-truth reliance is problematic, because the ground-truth signals are usually unavailable in real conditions. Moreover, in many industry scenarios, the real acoustic characteristics deviate far from the ones in simulated datasets. Therefore, the performance usually degrades significantly when applying the supervised speech separation models to real applications. To address these problems, in this study, we propose a novel separation consistency training, termed SCT, to exploit the real-world unlabeled mixtures for improving cross-domain unsupervised speech separation in an iterative manner, by leveraging upon the complementary information obtained from heterogeneous (structurally distinct but behaviorally complementary) models. SCT follows a framework using two heterogeneous neural networks (HNNs) to produce high confidence pseudo labels of unlabeled real speech mixtures. These labels are then updated, and used to refine the HNNs to produce more reliable consistent separation results for real mixture pseudo-labeling. To maximally utilize the large complementary information between different separation networks, a cross-knowledge adaptation is further proposed. Together with simulated dataset, those real mixtures with high confidence pseudo labels are then used to update the HNN separation models iteratively. In addition, we find that combing the heterogeneous separation outputs by a simple linear fusion can further slightly improve the final system performance. ",

The AZ-test is versatile, allowing the underlying graph to be dynamic, changing in topology and set of nodes, and weighted, thus accounting for connections of different strength, as is the case in many application scenarios like transportation networks and sensor grids. The asymptotic distribution -- as the number of graph edges or temporal observations increases -- is known, and does not assume identically distributed data. We validate the practical value of the test on both synthetic and real-world problems, and show how the test can be employed to assess the quality of spatio-temporal forecasting models by analyzing the prediction residuals appended to the graphs stream.

To deal with both problems simultaneously, we propose a novel end-to-end Probabilistic Under-sampling and Explicable Reconstruction neTwork, dubbed PUERT, to jointly optimize the sampling pattern and the reconstruction network. Instead of learning a deterministic mask, the proposed sampling subnet explores an optimal probabilistic sub-sampling pattern, which describes independent Bernoulli random variables at each possible sampling point, thus retaining robustness and stochastics for a more reliable CS reconstruction. A dynamic gradient estimation strategy is further introduced to gradually approximate the binarization function in backward propagation, which efficiently preserves the gradient information and further improves the reconstruction quality. Moreover, in our reconstruction subnet, we adopt a model-based network design scheme with high efficiency and interpretability, which is shown to assist in further exploitation for the sampling subnet. Extensive experiments on two widely used MRI datasets demonstrate that our proposed PUERT not only achieves state-of-the-art results in terms of both quantitative metrics and visual quality but also yields a sub-sampling pattern and a reconstruction model that are both customized to training data.

Simulated datasets play an essential role in the training of EEND, but as yet there has been insufficient investigation into an optimal simulation method. We thus propose a method to simulate natural conversational speech. In contrast to conventional methods, which simply combine the speech of multiple speakers, our method takes turn-taking into account. We define four types of speaker transition and sequentially arrange them to simulate natural conversations. The dataset simulated using our method was found to be statistically similar to the real dataset in terms of the silence and overlap ratios. The experimental results on two-speaker diarization using the CALLHOME and CSJ datasets showed that the simulated dataset contributes to improving the performance of EEND. ",

    "abstract": "Several deep learning algorithms have been developed to predict survival of cancer patients using whole slide images (WSIs).However, identification of image phenotypes within the WSIs that are relevant to patient survival and disease progression is difficult for both clinicians, and deep learning algorithms. Most deep learning based Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) algorithms for survival prediction use either top instances (e.g., maxpooling) or top/bottom instances (e.g., MesoNet) to identify image phenotypes. In this study, we hypothesize that wholistic information of the distribution of the patch scores within a WSI can predict the cancer survival better. We developed a distribution based multiple-instance survival learning algorithm (DeepDisMISL) to validate this hypothesis. We designed and executed experiments using two large international colorectal cancer WSIs datasets - MCO CRC and TCGA COAD-READ. Our results suggest that the more information about the distribution of the patch scores for a WSI, the better is the prediction performance. Including multiple neighborhood instances around each selected distribution location (e.g., percentiles) could further improve the prediction. DeepDisMISL demonstrated superior predictive ability compared to other recently published, state-of-the-art algorithms. Furthermore, our algorithm is interpretable and could assist in understanding the relationship between cancer morphological phenotypes and patients cancer survival risk. ",

Recently, methods based on graph convolutional networks (GCN) have received growing attention for unsupervised clustering, as these methods exploit the connectivity patterns between nodes to improve learning performance. In this work, we present a GCN-based approach for semi-supervised learning. Given a pre-trained embedding extractor, a graph convolutional network is trained on the labeled data and clusters unlabeled data with \"pseudo-labels\". We present a self-correcting training mechanism that iteratively runs the cluster-train-correct process on pseudo-labels.

Specifically, the computational techniques for those programs typically place restrictive assumptions on the constraint functions and the size of the Wasserstein ambiguity sets is often set using costly cross-validation (CV) procedures or conservative measure concentration bounds. In contrast, we propose a practical DRCCP algorithm using kernel maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) ambiguity sets, which we term MMD-DRCCP, to treat general nonlinear constraints without using ad-hoc reformulation techniques. MMD-DRCCP can handle general nonlinear and non-convex constraints with a proven finite-sample constraint satisfaction guarantee of a dimension-independent $\\mathcal{O}(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{N}})$ rate, achievable by a practical algorithm. We further propose an efficient bootstrap scheme for constructing sharp MMD ambiguity sets in practice without resorting to CV.

    "abstract": "An extreme event is a sudden and violent change in the state of a nonlinear system. In fluid dynamics, extreme events can have adverse effects on the system's optimal design and operability, which calls for accurate methods for their prediction and control. In this paper, we propose a data-driven methodology for the prediction and control of extreme events in a chaotic shear flow. The approach is based on echo state networks, which are a type of reservoir computing that learn temporal correlations within a time-dependent dataset. The objective is five-fold. First, we exploit ad-hoc metrics from binary classification to analyse (i) how many of the extreme events predicted by the network actually occur in the test set (precision), and (ii) how many extreme events are missed by the network (recall). We apply a principled strategy for optimal hyperparameter selection, which is key to the networks' performance. Second, we focus on the time-accurate prediction of extreme events. We show that echo state networks are able to predict extreme events well beyond the predictability time, i.e., up to more than five Lyapunov times. Third, we focus on the long-term prediction of extreme events from a statistical point of view. By training the networks with datasets that contain non-converged statistics, we show that the networks are able to learn and extrapolate the flow's long-term statistics. In other words, the networks are able to extrapolate in time from relatively short time series. Fourth, we design a simple and effective control strategy to prevent extreme events from occurring. The control strategy decreases the occurrence of extreme events up to one order of magnitude with respect to the uncontrolled system. Finally, we analyse the robustness of the results for a range of Reynolds numbers. We show that the networks perform well across a wide range of regimes. ",

Countries must structure vaccination programs in accordance with their populations' susceptibility to infection, optimizing vaccination efforts by delivering vaccines progressively enough to protect the majority of the population. We present a feasibility study proposal for maintaining optimal continuous vaccination by assessing the susceptible population, the decline of vaccine efficacy in the population, and advising booster dosage deployment to maintain the population's protective efficacy through the use of a predictive model.

    "abstract": "Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) have become the top one cause of death; three-quarters of these deaths occur in lower-income communities. Electrocardiography (ECG), an electrical measurement capturing the cardiac activities, is a gold-standard to diagnose CVDs. However, ECG is infeasible for continuous cardiac monitoring due to its requirement for user participation. Meanwhile, photoplethysmography (PPG) is easy to collect, but the limited accuracy constrains its clinical usage. In this research, a novel Transformer-based architecture, Performer, is invented to reconstruct ECG from PPG and to create a novel digital biomarker, PPG along with its reconstructed ECG, as multiple modalities for CVD detection. This architecture, for the first time, performs Transformer sequence to sequence translation on biomedical waveforms, while also utilizing the advantages of the easily accessible PPG and the well-studied base of ECG. Shifted Patch-based Attention (SPA) is created to maximize the signal features by fetching the various sequence lengths as hierarchical stages into the training while also capturing cross-patch connections through the shifted patch mechanism. This architecture generates a state-of-the-art performance of 0.29 RMSE for reconstructing ECG from PPG, achieving an average of 95.9% diagnosis for CVDs on the MIMIC III dataset and 75.9% for diabetes on the PPG-BP dataset. Performer, along with its novel digital biomarker, offers a low-cost and non-invasive solution for continuous cardiac monitoring, only requiring the easily extractable PPG data to reconstruct the not-as-accessible ECG data.

    "title": "Exoplanet Cartography using Convolutional Neural Networks",
    "abstract": "In the near-future, dedicated telescopes observe Earth-like exoplanets in reflected light, allowing their characterization. Because of the huge distances, every exoplanet will be a single pixel, but temporal variations in its spectral flux hold information about the planet's surface and atmosphere. We test convolutional neural networks for retrieving a planet's rotation axis, surface and cloud map from simulated single-pixel flux and polarization observations. We investigate the assumption that the planets reflect Lambertian in the retrieval while their actual reflection is bidirectional, and of including polarization in retrievals. We simulate observations along a planet's orbit using a radiative transfer algorithm that includes polarization and bidirectional reflection by vegetation, desert, oceans, water clouds, and Rayleigh scattering in 6 spectral bands from 400 to 800 nm, at various photon noise levels. The surface-types and cloud patterns of the facets covering a model planet are based on probability distributions. Our networks are trained with simulated observations of millions of planets before retrieving maps of test planets. The neural networks can constrain rotation axes with a mean squared error (MSE) as small as 0.0097, depending on the orbital inclination. On a bidirectionally reflecting planet, 92% of ocean and 85% of vegetation, desert, and cloud facets are correctly retrieved, in the absence of noise. With realistic noise, it should still be possible to retrieve the main map features with a dedicated telescope. Except for face-on orbits, a network trained with Lambertian reflecting planets, yields significant retrieval errors when given observations of bidirectionally reflecting planets, in particular, brightness artefacts around a planet's pole. Including polarization improves retrieving the rotation axis and the accuracy of the retrieval of ocean and cloud facets. ",
