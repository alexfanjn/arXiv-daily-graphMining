    "abstract": "Our environment is filled with rich and dynamic acoustic information. When we walk into a cathedral, the reverberations as much as appearance inform us of the sanctuary's wide open space. Similarly, as an object moves around us, we expect the sound emitted to also exhibit this movement. While recent advances in learned implicit functions have led to increasingly higher quality representations of the visual world, there have not been commensurate advances in learning spatial auditory representations. To address this gap, we introduce Neural Acoustic Fields (NAFs), an implicit representation that captures how sounds propagate in a physical scene. By modeling acoustic propagation in a scene as a linear time-invariant system, NAFs learn to continuously map all emitter and listener location pairs to a neural impulse response function that can then be applied to arbitrary sounds. We demonstrate that the continuous nature of NAFs enables us to render spatial acoustics for a listener at an arbitrary location, and can predict sound propagation at novel locations. We further show that the representation learned by NAFs can help improve visual learning with sparse views. Finally, we show that a representation informative of scene structure emerges during the learning of NAFs. ",

    "abstract": "Chemical Mass Casualty Incidents (MCI) place a heavy burden on hospital staff and resources. Machine Learning (ML) tools can provide efficient decision support to caregivers. However, ML models require large volumes of data for the most accurate results, which is typically not feasible in the chaotic nature of a chemical MCI. This study examines the application of four statistical dimension reduction techniques: Random Selection, Covariance/Variance, Pearson's Linear Correlation, and Principle Component Analysis to reduce a dataset of 311 hazardous chemicals and 79 related signs and symptoms (SSx). An Artificial Neural Network pipeline was developed to create comparative models. Results show that the number of signs and symptoms needed to determine a chemical culprit can be reduced to nearly 40 SSx without losing significant model accuracy. Evidence also suggests that the application of dimension reduction methods can improve ANN model performance accuracy. ",

The ability to relight captured scenes to unseen lighting conditions, in a controllable manner, presents an opportunity to augment datasets with a richer variety of lighting conditions, similar to what would be encountered in the real-world. This paper presents a novel image-based relighting pipeline, SIMBAR, that can work with a single image as input. To the best of our knowledge, there is no prior work on scene relighting leveraging explicit geometric representations from a single image. We present qualitative comparisons with prior multi-view scene relighting baselines. To further validate and effectively quantify the benefit of leveraging SIMBAR for data augmentation for automated driving vision tasks, object detection and tracking experiments are conducted with a state-of-the-art method, a Multiple Object Tracking Accuracy (MOTA) of 93.3% is achieved with CenterTrack on SIMBAR-augmented KITTI - an impressive 9.0% relative improvement over the baseline MOTA of 85.6% with CenterTrack on original KITTI, both models trained from scratch and tested on Virtual KITTI.

    "abstract": "Wind power prediction, especially for turbines, is vital for the operation, controllability, and economy of electricity companies. Hybrid methodologies combining advanced data science with weather forecasting have been incrementally applied to the predictions. Nevertheless, individually modeling massive turbines from scratch and downscaling weather forecasts to turbine size are neither easy nor economical. Aiming at it, this paper proposes a novel framework with mathematical underpinnings for turbine power prediction. This framework is the first time to incorporate knowledge distillation into energy forecasting, enabling accurate and economical constructions of turbine models by learning knowledge from the well-established park model. Besides, park-scale weather forecasts non-explicitly are mapped to turbines by transfer learning of predicted power errors, achieving model correction for better performance. The proposed framework is deployed on five turbines featuring various terrains in an Arctic wind park, the results are evaluated against the competitors of ablation investigation. The major findings reveal that the proposed framework, developed on favorable knowledge distillation and transfer learning parameters tuning, yields performance boosts from 3.3 % to 23.9 % over its competitors. This advantage also exists in terms of wind energy physics and computing efficiency, which are verified by the prediction quality rate and calculation time. ",

These approaches are insufficient when handling outlier cases, for example when trying to detect the face of a neonate infant whose face composition and expressions are relatively different than that of the adult. It is furthermore difficult when applied to detect faces in a complicated setting such as the Neonate Intensive Care Unit. By training a state-of-the-art face detection model, You-Only-Look-Once, on a proprietary dataset containing labelled neonate faces in a clinical setting, this work achieves near real time neonate face detection. Our preliminary findings show an accuracy of 68.7%, compared to the off the shelf solution which detected neonate faces with an accuracy of 7.37%. Although further experiments are needed to validate our model, our results are promising and prove the feasibility of detecting neonatal faces in challenging real-world settings. The robust and real-time detection of neonatal faces would benefit wide range of automated systems (e.g., pain recognition and surveillance) who currently suffer from the time and effort due to the necessity of manual annotations.

NOVA-C will deliver six payloads to the lunar surface with various scientific and engineering objectives, ushering in a new era of commercial space exploration and utilization. However, to safely accomplish the mission, the NOVA-C lander must ensure its landing site is free of hazards larger than 30 cm and the slope of local terrain at touchdown is less than 10 degrees off vertical. To accomplish this, NOVA-C utilizes Intuitive Machines' precision navigation system, coupled with machine vision algorithms for scene reduction and landing site characterization. A unique aspect to the NOVA-C approach is the real-time nature of the hazard detection and avoidance algorithms--which are performed 400 meters above and down range of the intended landing site and completed within 15 seconds. In this paper, we review the theoretical foundations for the hazard detection and avoidance algorithms, describe the practical challenges of implementation on the NOVA-C flight computer, and present test and analysis results.

As our ability to record large neural and behavioral data increases, there is growing interest in modeling neural dynamics during adaptive behaviors to probe neural representations. In particular, neural latent embeddings can reveal underlying correlates of behavior, yet, we lack non-linear techniques that can explicitly and flexibly leverage joint behavior and neural data. Here, we fill this gap with a novel method, CEBRA, that jointly uses behavioral and neural data in a hypothesis- or discovery-driven manner to produce consistent, high-performance latent spaces. We validate its accuracy and demonstrate our tool's utility for both calcium and electrophysiology datasets, across sensory and motor tasks, and in simple or complex behaviors across species. It allows for single and multi-session datasets to be leveraged for hypothesis testing or can be used label-free. Lastly, we show that CEBRA can be used for the mapping of space, uncovering complex kinematic features, and rapid, high-accuracy decoding of natural movies from visual cortex. ",

The paper presents early insights from an ongoing participatory AI design study in which young women build directly explainable models for detecting risk associated with discovered social opportunities, and articulate what AI should do once risk has been detected.

We want to extend the role of AI in these apps to keep users safe while they interact with strangers across online and offline modalities. To do this, we are using participatory design methods to empower women and LGBTQIA+ individuals to envision future human-AI interactions that prioritize their safety during social matching app-use. In one study, stakeholders identifying as LGBTQIA+ or women are redesigning dating apps to mediate exchange of sexual consent and therefore mitigate sexual violence.

    "abstract": "Nowadays, we are witnessing an increasing effort to improve the performance and trustworthiness of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), with the aim to enable their adoption in safety critical systems such as self-driving cars. Multiple testing techniques are proposed to generate test cases that can expose inconsistencies in the behavior of DNN models. These techniques assume implicitly that the training program is bug-free and appropriately configured. However, satisfying this assumption for a novel problem requires significant engineering work to prepare the data, design the DNN, implement the training program, and tune the hyperparameters in order to produce the model for which current automated test data generators search for corner-case behaviors. All these model training steps can be error-prone. Therefore, it is crucial to detect and correct errors throughout all the engineering steps of DNN-based software systems and not only on the resulting DNN model. In this paper, we gather a catalog of training issues and based on their symptoms and their effects on the behavior of the training program, we propose practical verification routines to detect the aforementioned issues, automatically, by continuously validating that some important properties of the learning dynamics hold during the training. Then, we design, TheDeepChecker, an end-to-end property-based debugging approach for DNN training programs. We assess the effectiveness of TheDeepChecker on synthetic and real-world buggy DL programs and compare it with Amazon SageMaker Debugger (SMD). Results show that TheDeepChecker's on-execution validation of DNN-based program's properties succeeds in revealing several coding bugs and system misconfigurations, early on and at a low cost. Moreover, TheDeepChecker outperforms the SMD's offline rules verification on training logs in terms of detection accuracy and DL bugs coverage. ",

    "abstract": "In this article, we consider a multi-agent path planning problem in a partially impeded environment. The impeded environment is represented by a graph with select road segments (edges) in disrepair impeding vehicular movement in the road network. A convoy wishes to travel from a starting location to a destination while minimizing some accumulated cost. The convoy may traverse an impeded edge for an additional cost (associated with repairing the edge) than if it were unimpeded. A second vehicle, referred to as a service vehicle, is simultaneously deployed with the convoy. The service vehicle assists the convoy by repairing an edge, reducing the cost for the convoy to traverse that edge. The convoy is permitted to wait at any vertex to allow the service vehicle to complete repairing an edge. The service vehicle is permitted to terminate its path at any vertex. The goal is then to find a pair of paths so the convoy reaches its destination while minimizing the total time (cost) the two vehicles are active, including any time the convoy waits. We refer to this problem as the Assisted Shortest Path Problem (ASPP). We present a generalized permanent labeling algorithm to find an optimal solution for the ASPP. We also introduce additional modifications to the labeling algorithm to significantly improve the computation time and refer to the modified labeling algorithm as $GPLA^*$. Computational results are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of $GPLA^*$ in solving the ASPP. We then give concluding remarks and briefly discuss potential variants of the ASPP for future work. ",

    "abstract": "Previous work has shown that dense retrievers are not robust to out-of-domain and outlier queries, i.e. their effectiveness on these queries is much poorer than what expected. In this paper, we consider a specific instance of such queries: queries that contain typos. We show that a small character level perturbation in queries (as caused by typos) highly impacts the effectiveness of dense retrievers. We then demonstrate that the root cause of this resides in the input tokenization strategy employed by BERT. In BERT, tokenization is performed using the BERT's WordPiece tokenizer and we show that a token with a typo will significantly change the token distributions obtained after tokenization. This distribution change translates to changes in the input embeddings passed to the BERT-based query encoder of dense retrievers. We then turn our attention to devising dense retriever methods that are robust to such typo queries, while still being as performant as previous methods on queries without typos. For this, we use CharacterBERT as the backbone encoder and an efficient yet effective training method, called Self-Teaching (ST), that distills knowledge from queries without typos into the queries with typos. Experimental results show that CharacterBERT in combination with ST achieves significantly higher effectiveness on queries with typos compared to previous methods. Along with these results and the open-sourced implementation of the methods, we also provide a new passage retrieval dataset consisting of real-world queries with typos and associated relevance assessments on the MS MARCO corpus, thus supporting the research community in the investigation of effective and robust dense retrievers.

Numerical experiments demonstrate that the path development consistently and significantly outperforms, in terms of accuracy and dimensionality, signature features on several empirical datasets.

Robotic process automation (RPA) uses software robots to perform some tasks usually executed by humans. It is usually difficult to determine what processes and steps to automate, especially with RPA. Process mining is seen as one way to address such difficulty. This paper aims to assess the applicability of process mining algorithms in accelerating and improving the implementation of RPA, along with the challenges encountered throughout project lifecycles. Methodology: A systematic literature review was conducted to examine the approaches where process mining techniques were used to understand the as-is processes that can be automated with software robots. Eight databases were used to identify papers on this topic. Findings: A total of 19 papers, all published since 2018, were selected from 158 unique candidate papers and then analyzed. There is an increase in the number of publications in this domain. Originality: The literature currently lacks a systematic review that covers the intersection of process mining and robotic process automation. The literature mainly focuses on the methods to record the events that occur at the level of user interactions with the application, and on the preprocessing methods that are needed to discover routines with the steps that can be automated. Several challenges are faced with preprocessing such event logs, and many lifecycle steps of automation project are weakly supported by existing approaches. ",

    "abstract": "Monocular 3D object detection is an essential task in autonomous driving. However, most current methods consider each 3D object in the scene as an independent training sample, while ignoring their inherent geometric relations, thus inevitably resulting in a lack of leveraging spatial constraints. In this paper, we propose a novel method that takes all the objects into consideration and explores their mutual relationships to help better estimate the 3D boxes. Moreover, since 2D detection is more reliable currently, we also investigate how to use the detected 2D boxes as guidance to globally constrain the optimization of the corresponding predicted 3D boxes. To this end, a differentiable loss function, termed as Homography Loss, is proposed to achieve the goal, which exploits both 2D and 3D information, aiming at balancing the positional relationships between different objects by global constraints, so as to obtain more accurately predicted 3D boxes. Thanks to the concise design, our loss function is universal and can be plugged into any mature monocular 3D detector, while significantly boosting the performance over their baseline. Experiments demonstrate that our method yields the best performance (Nov. 2021) compared with the other state-of-the-arts by a large margin on KITTI 3D datasets. ",

Unfortunately, accuracy of mathematical models is very difficult to achieve. During the past few decades computational intelligence techniques such as artificial neural networks have been very successful when an accurate mathematical model is not available. Therefore, in this paper, an artificial neural network controller is proposed for heading and position control system. For simulation purposes, a mathematical model with four effective thrusters have been chosen to test the performance of the proposed controller. The final closed loop system has been analyzed and tested through simulation studies. The results are very encouraging. ",

    "title": "Do learned representations respect causal relationships?",
    "abstract": "Data often has many semantic attributes that are causally associated with each other. But do attribute-specific learned representations of data also respect the same causal relations? We answer this question in three steps. First, we introduce NCINet, an approach for observational causal discovery from high-dimensional data. It is trained purely on synthetically generated representations and can be applied to real representations, and is specifically designed to mitigate the domain gap between the two. Second, we apply NCINet to identify the causal relations between image representations of different pairs of attributes with known and unknown causal relations between the labels. For this purpose, we consider image representations learned for predicting attributes on the 3D Shapes, CelebA, and the CASIA-WebFace datasets, which we annotate with multiple multi-class attributes. Third, we analyze the effect on the underlying causal relation between learned representations induced by various design choices in representation learning. Our experiments indicate that (1) NCINet significantly outperforms existing observational causal discovery approaches for estimating the causal relation between pairs of random samples, both in the presence and absence of an unobserved confounder, (2) under controlled scenarios, learned representations can indeed satisfy the underlying causal relations between their respective labels, and (3) the causal relations are positively correlated with the predictive capability of the representations.

    "abstract": "Given a graph $G=(V,E)$, the problem of \\gb{} is to find a sequence of nodes from $V$, called burning sequence, in order to burn the whole graph. This is a discrete-step process, in each step an unburned vertex is selected as an agent to spread fire to its neighbors by marking it as a burnt node. A node that is burnt spreads the fire to its neighbors at the next consecutive step. The goal is to find the burning sequence of minimum length. The \\gb{} problem is NP-Hard for general graphs and even for binary trees. A few approximation results are known, including a $3$-approximation algorithm for general graphs and a $2$- approximation algorithm for trees. In this paper, we propose an approximation algorithm for trees that produces a burning sequence of length at most $\\lfloor 1.75b(T) \\rfloor + 1$, where $b(T)$ is length of the optimal burning sequence, also called the burning number of the tree $T$.

    "abstract": "When deploying pre-trained neural network models in real-world applications, model consumers often encounter resource-constraint platforms such as mobile and smart devices. They typically use the pruning technique to reduce the size and complexity of the model, generating a lighter one with less resource consumption. Nonetheless, most existing pruning methods are proposed with a premise that the model after being pruned has a chance to be fine-tuned or even retrained based on the original training data. This may be unrealistic in practice, as the data controllers are often reluctant to provide their model consumers with the original data. In this work, we study the neural network pruning in the \\emph{data-free} context, aiming to yield lightweight models that are not only accurate in prediction but also robust against undesired inputs in open-world deployments. Considering the absence of the fine-tuning and retraining that can fix the mis-pruned units, we replace the traditional aggressive one-shot strategy with a conservative one that treats the pruning as a progressive process. We propose a pruning method based on stochastic optimization that uses robustness-related metrics to guide the pruning process. Our method is implemented as a Python package named \\textsc{Paoding} and evaluated with a series of experiments on diverse neural network models. The experimental results show that it significantly outperforms existing one-shot data-free pruning approaches in terms of robustness preservation and accuracy. ",

    "abstract": "Unbiased learning to rank has been proposed to alleviate the biases in the search ranking, making it possible to train ranking models with user interaction data. In real applications, search engines are designed to display only the most relevant k documents from the retrieved candidate set. The rest candidates are discarded. As a consequence, position bias and sample selection bias usually occur simultaneously. Existing unbiased learning to rank approaches either focus on one type of bias (e.g., position bias) or mitigate the position bias and sample selection bias with separate components, overlooking their associations. In this study, we first analyze the mechanisms and associations of position bias and sample selection bias from the viewpoint of a causal graph. Based on the analysis, we propose Causal Likelihood Decomposition (CLD), a unified approach to simultaneously mitigating these two biases in top-k learning to rank. By decomposing the log-likelihood of the biased data as an unbiased term that only related to relevance, plus other terms related to biases, CLD successfully detaches the relevance from position bias and sample selection bias. An unbiased ranking model can be obtained from the unbiased term, via maximizing the whole likelihood. An extension to the pairwise neural ranking is also developed. Advantages of CLD include theoretical soundness and a unified framework for pointwise and pairwise unbiased top-k learning to rank. Extensive experimental results verified that CLD, including its pairwise neural extension, outperformed the baselines by mitigating both the position bias and the sample selection bias. Empirical studies also showed that CLD is robust to the variation of bias severity and the click noise. ",

In this paper, we present online convolutional re-parameterization (OREPA), a two-stage pipeline, aiming to reduce the huge training overhead by squeezing the complex training-time block into a single convolution. To achieve this goal, we introduce a linear scaling layer for better optimizing the online blocks. Assisted with the reduced training cost, we also explore some more effective re-param components. Compared with the state-of-the-art re-param models, OREPA is able to save the training-time memory cost by about 70% and accelerate the training speed by around 2x. Meanwhile, equipped with OREPA, the models outperform previous methods on ImageNet by up to +0.6%.We also conduct experiments on object detection and semantic segmentation and show consistent improvements on the downstream tasks.

However, existing methods still suffer from excessive memory footprint and computation overhead. In this paper, we propose a progressive pixel synthesis network towards efficient image generation, coined as PixelFolder. Specifically, PixelFolder formulates image generation as a progressive pixel regression problem and synthesizes images by a multi-stage paradigm, which can greatly reduce the overhead caused by large tensor transformations. In addition, we introduce novel pixel folding operations to further improve model efficiency while maintaining pixel-wise prior knowledge for end-to-end regression. With these innovative designs, we greatly reduce the expenditure of pixel synthesis, e.g., reducing 90% computation and 57% parameters compared to the latest pixel synthesis method called CIPS. To validate our approach, we conduct extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets, namely FFHQ and LSUN Church. The experimental results show that with much less expenditure, PixelFolder obtains new state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on two benchmark datasets, i.e., 3.77 FID and 2.45 FID on FFHQ and LSUN Church, respectively. Meanwhile, PixelFolder is also more efficient than the SOTA methods like StyleGAN2, reducing about 74% computation and 36% parameters, respectively. These results greatly validate the effectiveness of the proposed PixelFolder. ",

    "abstract": "Rotated object detection in aerial images is a meaningful yet challenging task as objects are densely arranged and have arbitrary orientations. The eight-parameter (coordinates of box vectors) methods in rotated object detection usually use ln-norm losses (L1 loss, L2 loss, and smooth L1 loss) as loss functions. As ln-norm losses are mainly based on non-scale-invariant Minkowski distance, using ln-norm losses will lead to inconsistency with the detection metric rotational Intersection-over-Union (IoU) and training instability. To address the problems, we use Mahalanobis distance to calculate loss between the predicted and the target box vertices' vectors, proposing a new loss function called Mahalanobis Distance Loss (MDL) for eight-parameter rotated object detection. As Mahalanobis distance is scale-invariant, MDL is more consistent with detection metric than ln-norm losses and more stable during training. To alleviate the problem of boundary discontinuity like all other eight-parameter methods, we further take the minimum loss value to make MDL continuous at boundary cases. We achieve state-of-art performance on DOTA-v1.0 with the proposed method MDL. Furthermore, with the comparative experiment of smooth L1 loss under the same condi-tion, we find that MDL performs better in rotated object detection. ",

    "abstract": "With the rapid development of cloud manufacturing, industrial production with edge computing as the core architecture has been greatly developed. However, edge devices often suffer from abnormalities and failures in industrial production. Therefore, detecting these abnormal situations timely and accurately is crucial for cloud manufacturing. As such, a straightforward solution is that the edge device uploads the data to the cloud for anomaly detection. However, Industry 4.0 puts forward higher requirements for data privacy and security so that it is unrealistic to upload data from edge devices directly to the cloud. Considering the above-mentioned severe challenges, this paper customizes a weakly-supervised edge computing anomaly detection framework, i.e., Federated Learning-based Transformer framework (\\textit{FedAnomaly}), to deal with the anomaly detection problem in cloud manufacturing. Specifically, we introduce federated learning (FL) framework that allows edge devices to train an anomaly detection model in collaboration with the cloud without compromising privacy. To boost the privacy performance of the framework, we add differential privacy noise to the uploaded features. To further improve the ability of edge devices to extract abnormal features, we use the Transformer to extract the feature representation of abnormal data. In this context, we design a novel collaborative learning protocol to promote efficient collaboration between FL and Transformer. Furthermore, extensive case studies on four benchmark data sets verify the effectiveness of the proposed framework. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time integrating FL and Transformer to deal with anomaly detection problems in cloud manufacturing. ",

As calculating Lipschitz constants is NP-hard, techniques for estimating Lipschitz constants must navigate the trade-off between scalability and accuracy. In this work, we significantly push the scalability frontier of a semidefinite programming technique known as LipSDP while achieving zero accuracy loss. We first show that LipSDP has chordal sparsity, which allows us to derive a chordally sparse formulation that we call Chordal-LipSDP. The key benefit is that the main computational bottleneck of LipSDP, a large semidefinite constraint, is now decomposed into an equivalent collection of smaller ones: allowing Chordal-LipSDP to outperform LipSDP particularly as the network depth grows. Moreover, our formulation uses a tunable sparsity parameter that enables one to gain tighter estimates without incurring a significant computational cost. We illustrate the scalability of our approach through extensive numerical experiments. ",

This is challenging because the robot needs to break down the instruction sentences into subgoals and execute them in the correct order. On the ALFRED benchmark, the performance of state-of-the-art methods is still far lower than that of humans. This is partially because existing methods sometimes fail to infer subgoals that are not explicitly specified in the instruction sentences.

This creates difficulties in optimizing the embedding space as the distance between images is rather small. To solve this issue, we present the first mix-up self-supervised learning framework for contrast-agnostic applications.

    "abstract": "Despite the rapid development of Neural Radiance Field (NeRF), the necessity of dense covers largely prohibits its wider applications. While several recent works have attempted to address this issue, they either operate with sparse views (yet still, a few of them) or on simple objects/scenes. In this work, we consider a more ambitious task: training neural radiance field, over realistically complex visual scenes, by \"looking only once\", i.e., using only a single view. To attain this goal, we present a Single View NeRF (SinNeRF) framework consisting of thoughtfully designed semantic and geometry regularizations. Specifically, SinNeRF constructs a semi-supervised learning process, where we introduce and propagate geometry pseudo labels and semantic pseudo labels to guide the progressive training process. Extensive experiments are conducted on complex scene benchmarks, including NeRF synthetic dataset, Local Light Field Fusion dataset, and DTU dataset. We show that even without pre-training on multi-view datasets, SinNeRF can yield photo-realistic novel-view synthesis results. Under the single image setting, SinNeRF significantly outperforms the current state-of-the-art NeRF baselines in all cases. Project page: https://vita-group.github.io/SinNeRF/ ",

Without this ability, it can be difficult to both understand what the model knows as well as to make meaningful corrections. To address these challenges, we introduce AutoProtoNet, which builds interpretability into Prototypical Networks by training an embedding space suitable for reconstructing inputs, while remaining convenient for few-shot learning. We demonstrate how points in this embedding space can be visualized and used to understand class representations. We also devise a prototype refinement method, which allows a human to debug inadequate classification parameters. We use this debugging technique on a custom classification task and find that it leads to accuracy improvements on a validation set consisting of in-the-wild images. We advocate for interpretability in meta-learning approaches and show that there are interactive ways for a human to enhance meta-learning algorithms. ",

In off-policy evaluation (OPE), there may exist unobserved variables that both impact the dynamics and are used by the unknown behavior policy.

We develop worst-case bounds to assess sensitivity to these unobserved confounders in finite horizons when confounders are drawn iid each period. We demonstrate that a model-based approach with robust MDPs gives sharper lower bounds by exploiting domain knowledge about the dynamics.

    "abstract": "With the wide applications of deep neural network models in various computer vision tasks, more and more works study the model vulnerability to adversarial examples. For data-free black box attack scenario, existing methods are inspired by the knowledge distillation, and thus usually train a substitute model to learn knowledge from the target model using generated data as input. However, the substitute model always has a static network structure, which limits the attack ability for various target models and tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel dynamic substitute training attack method to encourage substitute model to learn better and faster from the target model. Specifically, a dynamic substitute structure learning strategy is proposed to adaptively generate optimal substitute model structure via a dynamic gate according to different target models and tasks. Moreover, we introduce a task-driven graph-based structure information learning constrain to improve the quality of generated training data, and facilitate the substitute model learning structural relationships from the target model multiple outputs. Extensive experiments have been conducted to verify the efficacy of the proposed attack method, which can achieve better performance compared with the state-of-the-art competitors on several datasets.

    "abstract": "Most computer vision systems assume distortion-free images as inputs. The widely used rolling-shutter (RS) image sensors, however, suffer from geometric distortion when the camera and object undergo motion during capture. Extensive researches have been conducted on correcting RS distortions. However, most of the existing work relies heavily on the prior assumptions of scenes or motions. Besides, the motion estimation steps are either oversimplified or computationally inefficient due to the heavy flow warping, limiting their applicability. In this paper, we investigate using rolling shutter with a global reset feature (RSGR) to restore clean global shutter (GS) videos. This feature enables us to turn the rectification problem into a deblur-like one, getting rid of inaccurate and costly explicit motion estimation. First, we build an optic system that captures paired RSGR/GS videos. Second, we develop a novel algorithm incorporating spatial and temporal designs to correct the spatial-varying RSGR distortion. Third, we demonstrate that existing image-to-image translation algorithms can recover clean GS videos from distorted RSGR inputs, yet our algorithm achieves the best performance with the specific designs. Our rendered results are not only visually appealing but also beneficial to downstream tasks. Compared to the state-of-the-art RS solution, our RSGR solution is superior in both effectiveness and efficiency. Considering it is easy to realize without changing the hardware, we believe our RSGR solution can potentially replace the RS solution in taking distortion-free videos with low noise and low budget.

    "abstract": "Web phishing remains a serious cyber threat responsible for most data breaches. Machine Learning (ML)-based anti-phishing detectors are seen as an effective countermeasure, and are increasingly adopted by web-browsers and software products. However, with an average of 10K phishing links reported per hour to platforms such as PhishTank and VirusTotal (VT), the deficiencies of such ML-based solutions are laid bare. We first explore how phishing sites bypass ML-based detection with a deep dive into 13K phishing pages targeting major brands such as Facebook. Results show successful evasion is caused by: (1) use of benign services to obscure phishing URLs; (2) high similarity between the HTML structures of phishing and benign pages; (3) hiding the ultimate phishing content within Javascript and running such scripts only on the client; (4) looking beyond typical credentials and credit cards for new content such as IDs and documents; (5) hiding phishing content until after human interaction. We attribute the root cause to the dependency of ML-based models on the vertical feature space (webpage content). These solutions rely only on what phishers present within the page itself. Thus, we propose Anti-SubtlePhish, a more resilient model based on logistic regression. The key augmentation is the inclusion of a horizontal feature space, which examines correlation variables between the final render of suspicious pages against what trusted services have recorded (e.g., PageRank). To defeat (1) and (2), we correlate information between WHOIS, PageRank, and page analytics. To combat (3), (4) and (5), we correlate features after rendering the page. Experiments with 100K phishing/benign sites show promising accuracy (98.8%). We also obtained 100% accuracy against 0-day phishing pages that were manually crafted, comparing well to the 0% recorded by VT vendors over the first four days. ",

Previous researches usually use a speaker encoder to extract a global fixed speaker embedding from reference speech, and several attempts have tried variable-length speaker embedding. However, they neglect to transfer the personal pronunciation characteristics related to phoneme content, leading to poor speaker similarity in terms of detailed speaking styles and pronunciation habits. To improve the ability of the speaker encoder to model personal pronunciation characteristics, we propose content-dependent fine-grained speaker embedding for zero-shot speaker adaptation. The corresponding local content embeddings and speaker embeddings are extracted from a reference speech, respectively. Instead of modeling the temporal relations, a reference attention module is introduced to model the content relevance between the reference speech and the input text, and to generate the fine-grained speaker embedding for each phoneme encoder output. The experimental results show that our proposed method can improve speaker similarity of synthesized speeches, especially for unseen speakers. ",

The other is the problems caused by Equirectangular Projection Format (ERP), commonly used for 360{\\deg} images, that are coordinate and distortion. There is only one method existing that uses cube map projection to produce six perspective images and apply self-supervised learning using motion pictures for perspective depth prediction to deal with these problems. Different from the existing method, we directly use the ERP format. We propose a framework of direct use of ERP with coordinate conversion of correspondences and distortion-aware upsampling module to deal with the ERP related problems and extend a self-supervised learning method for open environments. For the experiments, we firstly built a dataset for the evaluation, and quantitatively evaluate the depth prediction in outdoor scenes. We show that it outperforms the state-of-the-art technique ",

These biases may impair a model's generalizability, rendering it ineffective for OD in novel and unseen datasets.

This work focuses on understanding these datasets better by identifying such \"good-weather\" bias. Methods to mitigate such bias which allows the OD models to perform better and improve the robustness are also demonstrated. A simple yet effective OD framework for studying bias mitigation is proposed. Using this framework, the performance on popular datasets is analyzed and a significant difference in model performance is observed. Additionally, a knowledge transfer technique and a synthetic image corruption technique are proposed to mitigate the identified bias. Finally, using the DAWN dataset, the findings are validated on the OD task, demonstrating the effectiveness of our techniques in mitigating real-world \"good-weather\" bias.

In this paper, we propose a VRKG4Rec model (Virtual Relational Knowledge Graphs for Recommendation), which explicitly distinguish the influence of different relations for item representation learning. We first construct virtual relational graphs (VRKGs) by an unsupervised learning scheme. We also design a local weighted smoothing (LWS) mechanism for encoding nodes, which iteratively updates a node embedding only depending on the embedding of its own and its neighbors, but involve no additional training parameters. We also employ the LWS mechanism on a user-item bipartite graph for user representation learning, which utilizes encodings of items with relational knowledge to help training representations of users.

One major variant of such attacks is poisoning attacks which can indirectly manipulate an ML model. It has been observed over the years that the majority of proposed effective defense models are only effective when an attacker is not aware of them being employed. In this paper, we show that the attack-agnostic De-Pois defense is hardly an exception to that rule. In fact, we demonstrate its vulnerability to the simplest White-Box and Black-Box attacks by an attacker that knows the structure of the De-Pois defense model. In essence, the De-Pois defense relies on a critic model that can be used to detect poisoned data before passing it to the target model. In our work, we break this poison-protection layer by replicating the critic model and then performing a composed gradient-sign attack on both the critic and target models simultaneously -- allowing us to bypass the critic firewall to poison the target model.

Our experiments demonstrate that adversarially-trained segmentation networks are more robust and indeed exhibit perceptually-aligned gradients which help in producing plausible image inpaintings. We seek to place additional weight behind the hypothesis that adversarially robust models exhibit gradients that are more perceptually-aligned with human vision.

This poses a significant barrier to accounting for privacy risk and utility under logistical constraints imposed on data curators, especially those working with official statistics. In this paper, we propose a privacy definition which accommodates PPD and prove it maintains similar properties to standard DP. We derive optimal transport-based mechanisms for releasing PPD that satisfy our definition and algorithms for valid statistical inference using PPD, demonstrating their improved performance over post-processing methods. Finally, we apply these methods to a case study on US Census and CDC PPD to investigate private COVID-19 infection rates.

Despite growing research on analysis of lifestyle patterns in cities, little is known about the characteristics of people's lifestyles patterns at urban scale. This limitation is primarily due to challenges in characterizing lifestyle patterns when human movement data is aggregated to protect the privacy of users. In this study, we model cities based on aggregated human visitation data to construct a network of places. We then examine the subgraph signatures in the networks of places to map and characterize lifestyle patterns at city scale. Location-based data from Harris County, Dallas County, New York County, and Broward County in the United States were examined to reveal lifestyle signatures in cities. For the motif analysis, two-node, three-node, and four-node motifs without location attributes were extracted from human visitation networks. Second, homogenized nodes in motifs were encoded with location categories from NAICS codes. Multiple statistical measures, including network metrics and motif properties, were quantified to characterize lifestyle signatures. The results show that: people's lifestyles in urban environments can be well depicted and quantified based on distribution and attributes of motifs in networks of places; motifs in networks of places show stability in quantity and distance as well as periodicity on weekends and weekdays indicating the stability of lifestyle patterns in cities; human visitation networks and lifestyle patterns show similarities across different metropolitan areas implying the universality of lifestyle signatures across cities. The findings provide deeper insights into urban lifestyles signatures in urban studies and provide important insights for data-informed urban planning and management. ",

The voiced slope, spectral flux, and their convex combinations were investigated for the generation of higher competence in female speech. We have employed a feature quantization approach in the traditional end-to-end tacotron based speech synthesis model. The listening tests have shown that the convex combination of acoustic features displays higher Mean Opinion Scores of warmth and competence when compared to that of individual features. ",

    "abstract": "Grasp detection of novel objects in unstructured environments is a key capability in robotic manipulation. For 2D grasp detection problems where grasps are assumed to lie in the plane, it is common to design a fully convolutional neural network that predicts grasps over an entire image in one step. However, this is not possible for grasp pose detection where grasp poses are assumed to exist in SE(3). In this case, it is common to approach the problem in two steps: grasp candidate generation and candidate classification. Since grasp candidate classification is typically expensive, the problem becomes one of efficiently identifying high quality candidate grasps. This paper proposes a new grasp candidate generation method that significantly outperforms major 3D grasp detection baselines. Supplementary material is available at https://atenpas.github.io/psn/.

    "abstract": "Implementations of the exponential mechanism in differential privacy often require sampling from intractable distributions. When approximate procedures like Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) are used, the end result incurs costs to both privacy and accuracy. Existing work has examined these effects asymptotically, but implementable finite sample results are needed in practice so that users can specify privacy budgets in advance and implement samplers with exact privacy guarantees. In this paper, we use tools from ergodic theory and perfect simulation to design exact finite runtime sampling algorithms for the exponential mechanism by introducing an intermediate modified target distribution using artificial atoms. We propose an additional modification of this sampling algorithm that maintains its $\\epsilon$-DP guarantee and has improved runtime at the cost of some utility. We then compare these methods in scenarios where we can explicitly calculate a $\\delta$ cost (as in $(\\epsilon, \\delta)$-DP) incurred when using standard MCMC techniques. Much as there is a well known trade-off between privacy and utility, we demonstrate that there is also a trade-off between privacy guarantees and runtime. ",

    "abstract": "Despite the rapid advancement of navigation algorithms, mobile robots often produce anomalous behaviors that can lead to navigation failures. The ability to detect such anomalous behaviors is a key component in modern robots to achieve high-levels of autonomy. Reactive anomaly detection methods identify anomalous task executions based on the current robot state and thus lack the ability to alert the robot before an actual failure occurs. Such an alert delay is undesirable due to the potential damage to both the robot and the surrounding objects. We propose a proactive anomaly detection network (PAAD) for robot navigation in unstructured and uncertain environments. PAAD predicts the probability of future failure based on the planned motions from the predictive controller and the current observation from the perception module. Multi-sensor signals are fused effectively to provide robust anomaly detection in the presence of sensor occlusion as seen in field environments. Our experiments on field robot data demonstrates superior failure identification performance than previous methods, and that our model can capture anomalous behaviors in real-time while maintaining a low false detection rate in cluttered fields.

    "abstract": "With the development of autonomous vehicle technology, the controller area network (CAN) bus has become the de facto standard for an in-vehicle communication system because of its simplicity and efficiency. However, without any encryption and authentication mechanisms, the in-vehicle network using the CAN protocol is susceptible to a wide range of attacks. Many studies, which are mostly based on machine learning, have proposed installing an intrusion detection system (IDS) for anomaly detection in the CAN bus system. Although machine learning methods have many advantages for IDS, previous models usually require a large amount of labeled data, which results in high time and labor costs. To handle this problem, we propose a novel semi-supervised learning-based convolutional adversarial autoencoder model in this paper. The proposed model combines two popular deep learning models: autoencoder and generative adversarial networks. First, the model is trained with unlabeled data to learn the manifolds of normal and attack patterns. Then, only a small number of labeled samples are used in supervised training. The proposed model can detect various kinds of message injection attacks, such as DoS, fuzzy, and spoofing, as well as unknown attacks. The experimental results show that the proposed model achieves the highest F1 score of 0.99 and a low error rate of 0.1\\% with limited labeled data compared to other supervised methods. In addition, we show that the model can meet the real-time requirement by analyzing the model complexity in terms of the number of trainable parameters and inference time. This study successfully reduced the number of model parameters by five times and the inference time by eight times, compared to a state-of-the-art model. ",

However, due to the high dimensionality of their input data and network weights, FNOs have so far only been applied to two-dimensional or small three-dimensional problems. To remove this limited problem-size barrier, we propose a model-parallel version of FNOs based on domain-decomposition of both the input data and network weights. We demonstrate that our model-parallel FNO is able to predict time-varying PDE solutions of over 3.2 billions variables on Summit using up to 768 GPUs and show an example of training a distributed FNO on the Azure cloud for simulating multiphase CO$_2$ dynamics in the Earth's subsurface.

For the task of zero-shot learning, visual attributes have been shown to play an important role, while in the few-shot regime, the effect of attributes is under-explored. To better transfer attribute-based knowledge from seen to unseen classes, we argue that an image representation with integrated attribute localization ability would be beneficial for any-shot, i.e. zero-shot and few-shot, image classification tasks. To this end, we propose a novel representation learning framework that jointly learns discriminative global and local features using only class-level attributes. While a visual-semantic embedding layer learns global features, local features are learned through an attribute prototype network that simultaneously regresses and decorrelates attributes from intermediate features. Furthermore, we introduce a zoom-in module that localizes and crops the informative regions to encourage the network to learn informative features explicitly. We show that our locality augmented image representations achieve a new state-of-the-art on challenging benchmarks, i.e. CUB, AWA2, and SUN. As an additional benefit, our model points to the visual evidence of the attributes in an image, confirming the improved attribute localization ability of our image representation. The attribute localization is evaluated quantitatively with ground truth part annotations, qualitatively with visualizations, and through well-designed user studies. ",

This observation is supported by the analyses concerning the characteristics of the target data domain, face. Based on our observation, we propose to employ ResNet with a highly reduced channel, which surprisingly allows high efficiency compared to other mobile-friendly networks (e.g., MobileNet-V1,-V2,-V3). From the extensive experiments, we show that the proposed backbone can replace that of the state-of-the-art face detector with a faster inference speed.

Recent work has shown significant progress with dynamic scenes by exploring shared canonical neural radiance fields.

To tackle this problem, we introduce a novel method to integrate observations across frames and encode the appearance at each individual frame by utilizing the human pose that models the body shape and point clouds which cover partial part of the human as the input. Specifically, our method simultaneously learns a shared set of latent codes anchored to the human pose among frames, and learns an appearance-dependent code anchored to incomplete point clouds generated by monocular RGB-D at each frame. A human pose-based code models the shape of the performer whereas a point cloud based code predicts details and reasons about missing structures at the unseen poses. To further recover non-visible regions in query frames, we utilize a temporal transformer to integrate features of points in query frames and tracked body points from automatically-selected key frames. Experiments on various sequences of humans in motion show that our method significantly outperforms existing works under unseen poses and novel views given monocular RGB-D videos as input. ",

To alleviate it, we study ternarization, a balance between efficiency and accuracy that quantizes both weights and activations into ternary values. In previous ternarized neural networks, a hard threshold {\\Delta} is introduced to determine quantization intervals. Although the selection of {\\Delta} greatly affects the training results, previous works estimate {\\Delta} via an approximation or treat it as a hyper-parameter, which is suboptimal. In this paper, we present the Soft Threshold Ternary Networks (STTN), which enables the model to automatically determine quantization intervals instead of depending on a hard threshold. Concretely, we replace the original ternary kernel with the addition of two binary kernels at training time, where ternary values are determined by the combination of two corresponding binary values. At inference time, we add up the two binary kernels to obtain a single ternary kernel. Our method dramatically outperforms current state-of-the-arts, lowering the performance gap between full-precision networks and extreme low bit networks. Experiments on ImageNet with ResNet-18 (Top-1 66.2%) achieves new state-of-the-art. Update: In this version, we further fine-tune the experimental hyperparameters and training procedure.

Recently, a new Transformer module, applying on batch dimension rather than spatial/channel dimension, i.e., BatchFormer [18], has been introduced to explore sample relationships for overcoming data scarcity challenges. However, it only works with image-level representations for classification. In this paper, we devise a more general batch Transformer module, BatchFormerV2, which further enables exploring sample relationships for dense representation learning. Specifically, when applying the proposed module, it employs a two-stream pipeline during training, i.e., either with or without a BatchFormerV2 module, where the batchformer stream can be removed for testing. Therefore, the proposed method is a plug-and-play module and can be easily integrated into different vision Transformers without any extra inference cost. Without bells and whistles, we show the effectiveness of the proposed method for a variety of popular visual recognition tasks, including image classification and two important dense prediction tasks: object detection and panoptic segmentation. Particularly, BatchFormerV2 consistently improves current DETR-based detection methods (e.g., DETR, Deformable-DETR, Conditional DETR, and SMCA) by over 1.3%. Code will be made publicly available. ",

The proposed DSTD-GC decomposes dynamic spatiotemporal graph modeling into a combination of Dynamic Spatial Graph Convolution (DS-GC) and Dynamic Temporal Graph Convolution (DT-GC). As human motions are subject to common constraints like body connections and present dynamic motion patterns from different samples, we present Constrained Dynamic Correlation Modeling strategy to represent the spatial/temporal graph as a shared spatial/temporal correlation and a function to extract temporal-specific /spatial-specific adjustments for each sample. The modeling strategy represents the spatiotemporal graph with 28.6\\% parameters of the state-of-the-art static decomposition representation while also explicitly models sample-specific spatiotemporal correlation variances.

On the other hand,recent self-supervised learning paradigm aims to train GNNs by solving pretext tasks that do not require any labeled nodes, and it has shown to even outperform GNNs trained with few labeled nodes. However, a major drawback of self-supervised methods is that they fall short of learning class discriminative node representations since no labeled information is utilized during training. To this end, we propose a novel semi-supervised method for graphs, GraFN, that leverages few labeled nodes to ensure nodes that belong to the same class to be grouped together, thereby achieving the best of both worlds of semi-supervised and self-supervised methods. Specifically, GraFN randomly samples support nodes from labeled nodes and anchor nodes from the entire graph.

    "title": "PRADA: Practical Black-Box Adversarial Attacks against Neural Ranking  Models",
    "abstract": "Neural ranking models (NRMs) have shown remarkable success in recent years, especially with pre-trained language models. However, deep neural models are notorious for their vulnerability to adversarial examples. Adversarial attacks may become a new type of web spamming technique given our increased reliance on neural information retrieval models. Therefore, it is important to study potential adversarial attacks to identify vulnerabilities of NRMs before they are deployed. In this paper, we introduce the Adversarial Document Ranking Attack (ADRA) task against NRMs, which aims to promote a target document in rankings by adding adversarial perturbations to its text. We focus on the decision-based black-box attack setting, where the attackers have no access to the model parameters and gradients, but can only acquire the rank positions of the partial retrieved list by querying the target model. This attack setting is realistic in real-world search engines. We propose a novel Pseudo Relevance-based ADversarial ranking Attack method (PRADA) that learns a surrogate model based on Pseudo Relevance Feedback (PRF) to generate gradients for finding the adversarial perturbations. Experiments on two web search benchmark datasets show that PRADA can outperform existing attack strategies and successfully fool the NRM with small indiscernible perturbations of text. ",

    "abstract": "Spatial perception problems are the fundamental building blocks of robotics and computer vision. However, in many real-world situations, they inevitably suffer from the issue of outliers, which hinders traditional solvers from making correct estimates. In this paper, we present a novel, general-purpose robust estimator IMOT (Iterative Multi-layered Otsu's Thresholding) using standard non-minimal solvers to rapidly reject outliers for spatial perception problems. First, we propose a new outlier-robust iterative optimizing framework where in each iteration all the measurement data are separated into two groups according to the residual errors and only the group with lower residual errors can be preserved for estimation in the next iteration. Second, we introduce and employ the well-known Otsu's method (from image processing) to conduct thresholding on the residual errors so as to obtain the best separation (grouping) statistically which maximizes the between-class variance. Third, to enhance robustness, we design a multi-layered Otsu's thresholding approach in combination with our framework to sift out the true inliers from outliers that might even occupy the majority of measurements. We test our robust estimator IMOT on 5 different spatial perception problems including: rotation averaging, rotation search, point cloud registration, category-level registration, and SLAM. Experiments show that IMOT is robust against 70%--90% of outliers and can typically converge in only 3--10 iterations, being 3--125 times faster than existing robust estimators: GNC and ADAPT. Moreover, IMOT is able to return robust results even without noise bound information. ",

This Part II proposes a novel method for BN reliability modeling and analysis to apply the compression idea to the complex multistate dependent system. In this Part II, the dependent nodes and their parent nodes are equivalent to a block, based on which the multistate joint probability inference algorithm is proposed to calculate the joint probability distribution of a block's all nodes. Then, based on the proposed multistate compression algorithm of Part I, the dependent multistate inference algorithm is proposed for the complex multistate dependent system. The use and accuracy of the proposed algorithms are demonstrated in case 1.

To minimize the workload, we limit the human moderated data to the point where the accuracy gains saturate and further human effort does not lead to substantial improvements. A series of benchmarking experiments based on three different datasets and three state-of-the-art classifiers show that our framework can improve the classification F1-scores by 5.1 to 11.2% (up to approx.~98 to 99%), while reducing the moderation load up to 73.3% compared to a random moderation.

    "abstract": "The Facial Action Coding System (FACS) encodes the action units (AUs) in facial images, which has attracted extensive research attention due to its wide use in facial expression analysis. Many methods that perform well on automatic facial action unit (AU) detection primarily focus on modeling various types of AU relations between corresponding local muscle areas, or simply mining global attention-aware facial features, however, neglect the dynamic interactions among local-global features. We argue that encoding AU features just from one perspective may not capture the rich contextual information between regional and global face features, as well as the detailed variability across AUs, because of the diversity in expression and individual characteristics. In this paper, we propose a novel Multi-level Graph Relational Reasoning Network (termed MGRR-Net) for facial AU detection. Each layer of MGRR-Net performs a multi-level (i.e., region-level, pixel-wise and channel-wise level) feature learning. While the region-level feature learning from local face patches features via graph neural network can encode the correlation across different AUs, the pixel-wise and channel-wise feature learning via graph attention network can enhance the discrimination ability of AU features from global face features. The fused features from the three levels lead to improved AU discriminative ability. Extensive experiments on DISFA and BP4D AU datasets show that the proposed approach achieves superior performance than the state-of-the-art methods. ",

Their cause can threaten other groups and individuals who do not share the same views or have specific differences.

We therefore adapt various GNN architectures including Graph Convolutional Networks, Signed Graph Convolutional Networks and Graph Isomorphic Networks to facilitate the efficient encoding of real-valued edge costs. Moreover, we employ a reformulation of the multicut ILP constraints to a polynomial program as loss function that allows to learn feasible multicut solutions in a scalable way. Thus, we provide the first approach towards end-to-end trainable multicuts. Our findings support that GNN approaches can produce good solutions in practice while providing lower computation times and largely improved scalability compared to LP solvers and optimized heuristics, especially when considering large instances.

Our results hold even if the following restrictions are all added simultaneously. $\\bullet$ There are exactly two output neurons. $\\bullet$ There are exactly two input neurons. $\\bullet$ The data has only 13 different labels. $\\bullet$ The number of hidden neurons is a constant fraction of the number of data points. $\\bullet$ The target training error is zero. $\\bullet$ The ReLU activation function is used.

This shockingly small sample size (~10) allows for only limited scientific insight into the problem. In this work, we aim to address this deficiency. We propose to generate synthetic graphs, and study the behaviour of graph learning algorithms in a controlled scenario. We develop a fully-featured synthetic graph generator that allows deep inspection of different models. We argue that synthetic graph generations allows for thorough investigation of algorithms and provides more insights than overfitting on three citation datasets.

This pruning setup is particularly important for cross-lingual models that implicitly learn alignment between language representations during pretraining, which if distorted via pruning, not only leads to poorer performance on language data used for retraining but also on zero-shot languages that are evaluated. In this work, we show that there is a clear performance discrepancy in magnitude-based pruning when comparing standard supervised learning to the zero-shot setting. From this finding, we propose two weight regularizers that aim to maximize the alignment between units of pruned and unpruned networks to mitigate alignment distortion in pruned cross-lingual models and perform well for both non zero-shot and zero-shot settings. We provide experimental results on cross-lingual tasks for the zero-shot setting using XLM-RoBERTa$_{\\mathrm{Base}}$, where we also find that pruning has varying degrees of representational degradation depending on the language corresponding to the zero-shot test set.

These models are pre-trained on unlabeled audio data and then used in speech processing downstream tasks such as automatic speech recognition (ASR) or speech translation (ST). Since these models are now used in research and industrial systems alike, it becomes necessary to understand the impact caused by some features such as gender distribution within pre-training data. Using French as our investigation language, we train and compare gender-specific wav2vec 2.0 models against models containing different degrees of gender balance in their pre-training data. The comparison is performed by applying these models to two speech-to-text downstream tasks: ASR and ST. Our results show that the type of downstream integration matters. We observe lower overall performance using gender-specific pre-training before fine-tuning an end-to-end ASR system. However, when self-supervised models are used as feature extractors, the overall ASR and ST results follow more complex patterns, in which the balanced pre-trained model is not necessarily the best option. Lastly, our crude 'fairness' metric, the relative performance difference measured between female and male test sets, does not display a strong variation from balanced to gender-specific pre-trained wav2vec 2.0 models.

We show that this works well for the region proposal network, but that wrong, yet overly confident teacher predictions prevent student models from effective learning of the classification head. Our analysis provides a foundation that allows us to propose improvements for existing techniques by detecting incorrect teacher predictions, based on current ground-truth labels, and by employing an adaptive Huber loss as opposed to the mean squared error for the distillation loss in the classification heads. We evidence that our strategy works not only in a class incremental setting, but also in domain incremental settings, which constitute a realistic context, likely to be the setting of representative real-world problems.

    "title": "An Inverse Optimal Control Approach for Trajectory Prediction of  Autonomous Race Cars",
    "abstract": "This paper proposes an optimization-based approach to predict trajectories of autonomous race cars. We assume that the observed trajectory is the result of an optimization problem that trades off path progress against acceleration and jerk smoothness, and which is restricted by constraints. The algorithm predicts a trajectory by solving a parameterized nonlinear program (NLP) which contains path progress and smoothness in cost terms. By observing the actual motion of a vehicle, the parameters of prediction are updated by means of solving an inverse optimal control problem that contains the parameters of the predicting NLP as optimization variables. The algorithm therefore learns to predict the observed vehicle trajectory in a least-squares relation to measurement data and to the presumed structure of the predicting NLP. This work contributes with an algorithm that allows for accurate and interpretable predictions with sparse data. The algorithm is implemented on embedded hardware in an autonomous real-world race car that is competing in the challenge Roborace and analyzed with respect to recorded data. ",

    "abstract": "Federated Recommendation (FR) has received considerable popularity and attention in the past few years. In FR, for each user, its feature vector and interaction data are kept locally on its own client thus are private to others. Without the access to above information, most existing poisoning attacks against recommender systems or federated learning lose validity. Benifiting from this characteristic, FR is commonly considered fairly secured. However, we argue that there is still possible and necessary security improvement could be made in FR. To prove our opinion, in this paper we present FedRecAttack, a model poisoning attack to FR aiming to raise the exposure ratio of target items. In most recommendation scenarios, apart from private user-item interactions (e.g., clicks, watches and purchases), some interactions are public (e.g., likes, follows and comments). Motivated by this point, in FedRecAttack we make use of the public interactions to approximate users' feature vectors, thereby attacker can generate poisoned gradients accordingly and control malicious users to upload the poisoned gradients in a well-designed way. To evaluate the effectiveness and side effects of FedRecAttack, we conduct extensive experiments on three real-world datasets of different sizes from two completely different scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed FedRecAttack achieves the state-of-the-art effectiveness while its side effects are negligible. Moreover, even with small proportion (3%) of malicious users and small proportion (1%) of public interactions, FedRecAttack remains highly effective, which reveals that FR is more vulnerable to attack than people commonly considered.

    "abstract": "Memristor-based crossbar arrays represent a promising emerging memory technology to replace conventional memories by offering a high density and enabling computing-in-memory (CIM) paradigms. While analog computing provides the best performance, non-idealities and ADC/DAC conversion limit memristor-based CIM. Logic-in-Memory (LIM) presents another flavor of CIM, in which the memristors are used in a binary manner to implement logic gates. Since binary neural networks (BNNs) use binary logic gates as the dominant operation, they can benefit from the massively parallel execution of binary operations and better resilience to variations of the memristors. Although conventional neural networks have been thoroughly investigated, the impact of faults on memristor-based BNNs remains unclear. Therefore, we analyze the impact of faults on logic gates in memristor-based crossbar arrays for BNNs. We propose a simulation framework that simulates different traditional faults to examine the accuracy loss of BNNs on memristive crossbar arrays. In addition, we compare different logic families based on the robustness and feasibility to accelerate AI applications. ",

    "abstract": "Recently, multiple synthetic and real-world datasets have been built to facilitate the training of deep single image reflection removal (SIRR) models. Meanwhile, diverse testing sets are also provided with different types of reflection and scenes. However, the non-negligible domain gaps between training and testing sets make it difficult to learn deep models generalizing well to testing images. The diversity of reflections and scenes further makes it a mission impossible to learn a single model being effective to all testing sets and real-world reflections. In this paper, we tackle these issues by learning SIRR models from a domain generalization perspective. Particularly, for each source set, a specific SIRR model is trained to serve as a domain expert of relevant reflection types. For a given reflection-contaminated image, we present a reflection type-aware weighting (RTAW) module to predict expert-wise weights. RTAW can then be incorporated with adaptive network combination (AdaNEC) for handling different reflection types and scenes, i.e., generalizing to unknown domains. Two representative AdaNEC methods, i.e., output fusion (OF) and network interpolation (NI), are provided by considering both adaptation levels and efficiency. For images from one source set, we train RTAW to only predict expert-wise weights of other domain experts for improving generalization ability, while the weights of all experts are predicted and employed during testing. An in-domain expert (IDE) loss is presented for training RTAW. Extensive experiments show the appealing performance gain of our AdaNEC on different state-of-the-art SIRR networks.

    "abstract": "In argumentative discourse, persuasion is often achieved by refuting or attacking others arguments. Attacking is not always straightforward and often comprise complex rhetorical moves such that arguers might agree with a logic of an argument while attacking another logic. Moreover, arguer might neither deny nor agree with any logics of an argument, instead ignore them and attack the main stance of the argument by providing new logics and presupposing that the new logics have more value or importance than the logics present in the attacked argument. However, no existing studies in the computational argumentation capture such complex rhetorical moves in attacks or the presuppositions or value judgements in them. In order to address this gap, we introduce LPAttack, a novel annotation scheme that captures the common modes and complex rhetorical moves in attacks along with the implicit presuppositions and value judgements in them. Our annotation study shows moderate inter-annotator agreement, indicating that human annotation for the proposed scheme is feasible.

Uncovering such relationships allows us to identify the true working of a phenomenon and, most importantly, articulate a model that may enable us to further explore the phenomenon on hand and/or allow us to predict it accurately. Fundamentally, such models are likely to be derived via a causal approach (as opposed to an observational or empirical mean). In this approach, causal discovery is required to create a causal model, which can then be applied to infer the influence of interventions, and answer any hypothetical questions (i.e., in the form of What ifs? Etc.) that we might have. This paper builds a case for causal discovery and causal inference and contrasts that against traditional machine learning approaches; all from a civil and structural engineering perspective. More specifically, this paper outlines the key principles of causality and the most commonly used algorithms and packages for causal discovery and causal inference. Finally, this paper also presents a series of examples and case studies of how causal concepts can be adopted for our domain. ",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we study stateless and stateful physics-based anomaly detection scenarios via distributed estimation over sensor networks. In the stateful case, the detector keeps track of the sensor residuals (i.e., the difference of estimated and true outputs) and reports an alarm if certain statistics of the recorded residuals deviate over a predefined threshold, e.g., \\chi^2 (Chi-square) detector. Instead, only instantaneous deviation of the residuals raises the alarm in the stateless case without considering the history of the sensor outputs and estimation data. Given (approximate) false-alarm rate for both cases, we propose a probabilistic threshold design based on the noise statistics. We show by simulation that increasing the window length in the stateful case may not necessarily reduce the false-alarm rate. On the other hand, it adds unwanted delay to raise the alarm. The distributed aspect of the proposed detection algorithm enables local isolation of the faulty sensors with possible recovery solutions by adding redundant observationally-equivalent sensors. We, then, offer a mechanism to design Q-redundant distributed observers, robust to failure (or removal) of up to Q sensors over the network. ",

    "abstract": "Deep neural networks have empowered accurate device-free human activity recognition, which has wide applications. Deep models can extract robust features from various sensors and generalize well even in challenging situations such as data-insufficient cases. However, these systems could be vulnerable to input perturbations, i.e. adversarial attacks. We empirically demonstrate that both black-box Gaussian attacks and modern adversarial white-box attacks can render their accuracies to plummet. In this paper, we firstly point out that such phenomenon can bring severe safety hazards to device-free sensing systems, and then propose a novel learning framework, RobustSense, to defend common attacks. RobustSense aims to achieve consistent predictions regardless of whether there exists an attack on its input or not, alleviating the negative effect of distribution perturbation caused by adversarial attacks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed method can significantly enhance the model robustness of existing deep models, overcoming possible attacks. The results validate that our method works well on wireless human activity recognition and person identification systems. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to investigate adversarial attacks and further develop a novel defense framework for wireless human activity recognition in mobile computing research.

    "abstract": "Deep models are highly susceptible to adversarial attacks. Such attacks are carefully crafted imperceptible noises that can fool the network and can cause severe consequences when deployed. To encounter them, the model requires training data for adversarial training or explicit regularization-based techniques. However, privacy has become an important concern, restricting access to only trained models but not the training data (e.g. biometric data). Also, data curation is expensive and companies may have proprietary rights over it. To handle such situations, we propose a completely novel problem of 'test-time adversarial defense in absence of training data and even their statistics'. We solve it in two stages: a) detection and b) correction of adversarial samples. Our adversarial sample detection framework is initially trained on arbitrary data and is subsequently adapted to the unlabelled test data through unsupervised domain adaptation. We further correct the predictions on detected adversarial samples by transforming them in Fourier domain and obtaining their low frequency component at our proposed suitable radius for model prediction. We demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed technique via extensive experiments against several adversarial attacks and for different model architectures and datasets. For a non-robust Resnet-18 model pre-trained on CIFAR-10, our detection method correctly identifies 91.42% adversaries. Also, we significantly improve the adversarial accuracy from 0% to 37.37% with a minimal drop of 0.02% in clean accuracy on state-of-the-art 'Auto Attack' without having to retrain the model. ",

Motivated by the empirical success of deep neural network (DNN) compressors on large, real-world data, we investigate methods to estimate the rate-distortion function on such data, which would allow comparison of DNN compressors with optimality. While one could use the empirical distribution of the data and apply the Blahut-Arimoto algorithm, this approach presents several computational challenges and inaccuracies when the datasets are large and high-dimensional, such as the case of modern image datasets. Instead, we re-formulate the rate-distortion objective, and solve the resulting functional optimization problem using neural networks. We apply the resulting rate-distortion estimator, called NERD, on popular image datasets, and provide evidence that NERD can accurately estimate the rate-distortion function. Using our estimate, we show that the rate-distortion achievable by DNN compressors are within several bits of the rate-distortion function for real-world datasets. Additionally, NERD provides access to the rate-distortion achieving channel, as well as samples from its output marginal. Therefore, using recent results in reverse channel coding, we describe how NERD can be used to construct an operational one-shot lossy compression scheme with guarantees on the achievable rate and distortion. Experimental results demonstrate competitive performance with DNN compressors. ",

Automatic code summarization is a prized target of software engineering research, due to the high value summaries have to programmers and the simultaneously high cost of writing and maintaining documentation by hand. Current work is almost all based on machine models trained via big data input. Large datasets of examples of code and summaries of that code are used to train an e.g. encoder-decoder neural model. Then the output predictions of the model are evaluated against a set of reference summaries. The input is code not seen by the model, and the prediction is compared to a reference. The means by which a prediction is compared to a reference is essentially word overlap, calculated via a metric such as BLEU or ROUGE. The problem with using word overlap is that not all words in a sentence have the same importance, and many words have synonyms. The result is that calculated similarity may not match the perceived similarity by human readers. In this paper, we conduct an experiment to measure the degree to which various word overlap metrics correlate to human-rated similarity of predicted and reference summaries. We evaluate alternatives based on current work in semantic similarity metrics and propose recommendations for evaluation of source code summarization. ",

The key challenge is that shared behavior between friends could be equally explained by influence or by two other confounding factors: 1) latent traits that caused people to both become friends and engage in the behavior, and 2) latent preferences for the behavior. This paper addresses the challenges of estimating social influence with three contributions. First, we formalize social influence as a causal effect, one which requires inferences about hypothetical interventions. Second, we develop Poisson Influence Factorization (PIF), a method for estimating social influence from observational data. PIF fits probabilistic factor models to networks and behavior data to infer variables that serve as substitutes for the confounding latent traits. Third, we develop assumptions under which PIF recovers estimates of social influence. We empirically study PIF with semi-synthetic and real data from Last.fm, and conduct a sensitivity analysis. We find that PIF estimates social influence most accurately compared to related methods and remains robust under some violations of its assumptions. ",

    "title": "Do Deep Neural Networks Contribute to Multivariate Time Series Anomaly  Detection?",
    "abstract": "Anomaly detection in time series is a complex task that has been widely studied. In recent years, the ability of unsupervised anomaly detection algorithms has received much attention. This trend has led researchers to compare only learning-based methods in their articles, abandoning some more conventional approaches. As a result, the community in this field has been encouraged to propose increasingly complex learning-based models mainly based on deep neural networks. To our knowledge, there are no comparative studies between conventional, machine learning-based and, deep neural network methods for the detection of anomalies in multivariate time series. In this work, we study the anomaly detection performance of sixteen conventional, machine learning-based and, deep neural network approaches on five real-world open datasets. By analyzing and comparing the performance of each of the sixteen methods, we show that no family of methods outperforms the others. Therefore, we encourage the community to reincorporate the three categories of methods in the anomaly detection in multivariate time series benchmarks. ",

    "abstract": "Over-parameterization is one of the inherent characteristics of modern deep neural networks, which can often be overcome by leveraging regularization methods, such as Dropout. Usually, these methods are applied globally and all the input cases are treated equally. However, given the natural variation of the input space for real-world tasks such as image recognition and natural language understanding, it is unlikely that a fixed regularization pattern will have the same effectiveness for all the input cases. In this work, we demonstrate a method in which the selection of neurons in deep neural networks evolves, adapting to the difficulty of prediction. We propose the Adaptive Neural Selection (ANS) framework, which evolves to weigh neurons in a layer to form network variants that are suitable to handle different input cases. Experimental results show that the proposed method can significantly improve the performance of commonly-used neural network architectures on standard image recognition benchmarks. Ablation studies also validate the effectiveness and contribution of each component in the proposed framework. ",

    "abstract": "The early detection of drowsiness has become vital to ensure the correct and safe development of several industries' tasks. Due to the transient mental state of a human subject between alertness and drowsiness, automated drowsiness detection is a complex problem to tackle. The electroencephalography signals allow us to record variations in an individual's brain's electrical potential, where each of them gives specific information about a subject's mental state. However, due to this type of signal's nature, its acquisition, in general, is complex, so it is hard to have a large volume of data to apply techniques of Deep Learning for processing and classification optimally. Nevertheless, Capsule Neural Networks are a brand-new Deep Learning algorithm proposed for work with reduced amounts of data. It is a robust algorithm to handle the data's hierarchical relationships, which is an essential characteristic for work with biomedical signals. Therefore, this paper presents a Deep Learning-based method for drowsiness detection with CapsNet by using a concatenation of spectrogram images of the electroencephalography signals channels. The proposed CapsNet model is compared with a Convolutional Neural Network, which is outperformed by the proposed model, which obtains an average accuracy of 86,44% and 87,57% of sensitivity against an average accuracy of 75,86% and 79,47% sensitivity for the CNN, showing that CapsNet is more suitable for this kind of datasets and tasks.

The current study explores the usefulness of using Wav2Vec self-supervised speech representations as features for training an ASR system for dysarthric speech. Dysarthric speech recognition is particularly difficult as several aspects of speech such as articulation, prosody and phonation can be impaired. Specifically, we train an acoustic model with features extracted from Wav2Vec, Hubert, and the cross-lingual XLSR model. Results suggest that speech representations pretrained on large unlabelled data can improve word error rate (WER) performance. In particular, features from the multilingual model led to lower WERs than filterbanks (Fbank) or models trained on a single language. Improvements were observed in English speakers with cerebral palsy caused dysarthria (UASpeech corpus), Spanish speakers with Parkinsonian dysarthria (PC-GITA corpus) and Italian speakers with paralysis-based dysarthria (EasyCall corpus). Compared to using Fbank features, XLSR-based features reduced WERs by 6.8%, 22.0%, and 7.0% for the UASpeech, PC-GITA, and EasyCall corpus, respectively. ",

    "abstract": "Synthesis of ergodic, stationary visual patterns is widely applicable in texturing, shape modeling, and digital content creation. The wide applicability of this technique thus requires the pattern synthesis approaches to be scalable, diverse, and authentic. In this paper, we propose an exemplar-based visual pattern synthesis framework that aims to model the inner statistics of visual patterns and generate new, versatile patterns that meet the aforementioned requirements. To this end, we propose an implicit network based on generative adversarial network (GAN) and periodic encoding, thus calling our network the Implicit Periodic Field Network (IPFN). The design of IPFN ensures scalability: the implicit formulation directly maps the input coordinates to features, which enables synthesis of arbitrary size and is computationally efficient for 3D shape synthesis. Learning with a periodic encoding scheme encourages diversity: the network is constrained to model the inner statistics of the exemplar based on spatial latent codes in a periodic field. Coupled with continuously designed GAN training procedures, IPFN is shown to synthesize tileable patterns with smooth transitions and local variations. Last but not least, thanks to both the adversarial training technique and the encoded Fourier features, IPFN learns high-frequency functions that produce authentic, high-quality results. To validate our approach, we present novel experimental results on various applications in 2D texture synthesis and 3D shape synthesis. ",

Equal error rate increases from 1.52% to 46.24% on the LibriSpeech test set and from 3.75% to 45.84% on speakers from the VCTK corpus which signifies degraded performance on speaker verification.

In this paper, a different view of malware analysis is considered and the risk level of each sample feature is computed, and based on that the risk level of that sample is calculated. In this way, a criterion is introduced that is used together with accuracy and FPR criteria for malware analysis in IoT environment.

    "abstract": "The recent pandemic emergency raised many challenges regarding the countermeasures aimed at containing the virus spread, and constraining the minimum distance between people resulted in one of the most effective strategies. Thus, the implementation of autonomous systems capable of monitoring the so-called social distance gained much interest. In this paper, we aim to address this task leveraging a single RGB frame without additional depth sensors. In contrast to existing single-image alternatives failing when ground localization is not available, we rely on single image depth estimation to perceive the 3D structure of the observed scene and estimate the distance between people. During the setup phase, a straightforward calibration procedure, leveraging a scale-aware SLAM algorithm available even on consumer smartphones, allows us to address the scale ambiguity affecting single image depth estimation. We validate our approach through indoor and outdoor images employing a calibrated LiDAR + RGB camera asset. Experimental results highlight that our proposal enables sufficiently reliable estimation of the inter-personal distance to monitor social distancing effectively. This fact confirms that despite its intrinsic ambiguity, if appropriately driven single image depth estimation can be a viable alternative to other depth perception techniques, more expensive and not always feasible in practical applications. Our evaluation also highlights that our framework can run reasonably fast and comparably to competitors, even on pure CPU systems. Moreover, its practical deployment on low-power systems is around the corner. ",

Instead of predicting action labels or pixels, we directly predict the hand motion trajectory and the future contact points on the next active object (i.e., interaction hotspots). This relatively low-dimensional representation provides a concrete description of future interactions. To tackle this task, we first provide an automatic way to collect trajectory and hotspots labels on large-scale data. We then use this data to train an Object-Centric Transformer (OCT) model for prediction. Our model performs hand and object interaction reasoning via the self-attention mechanism in Transformers. OCT also provides a probabilistic framework to sample the future trajectory and hotspots to handle uncertainty in prediction. We perform experiments on the Epic-Kitchens-55, Epic-Kitchens-100, and EGTEA Gaze+ datasets, and show that OCT significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches by a large margin.

Prior work on LN detection has been limited to specific anatomical regions of the body (pelvis, rectum) in single MR slices. Therefore, the development of a universal approach to detect LN in full T2 MRI volumes is highly desirable. Methods: In this study, a Computer Aided Detection (CAD) pipeline to universally identify abdominal LN in volumetric T2 MRI using neural networks is proposed. First, we trained various neural network models for detecting LN: Faster RCNN with and without Hard Negative Example Mining (HNEM), FCOS, FoveaBox, VFNet, and Detection Transformer (DETR). Next, we show that the state-of-the-art (SOTA) VFNet model with Adaptive Training Sample Selection (ATSS) outperforms Faster RCNN with HNEM. Finally, we ensembled models that surpassed a 45% mAP threshold. We found that the VFNet model and one-stage model ensemble can be interchangeably used in the CAD pipeline. Results: Experiments on 122 test T2 MRI volumes revealed that VFNet achieved a 51.1% mAP and 78.7% recall at 4 false positives (FP) per volume, while the one-stage model ensemble achieved a mAP of 52.3% and sensitivity of 78.7% at 4FP. Conclusion: Our contribution is a CAD pipeline that detects LN in T2 MRI volumes, resulting in a sensitivity improvement of $\\sim$14 points over the current SOTA method for LN detection (sensitivity of 78.7% at 4 FP vs. 64.6% at 5 FP per volume).

    "abstract": "The mainstream neural text-to-speech(TTS) pipeline is a cascade system, including an acoustic model(AM) that predicts acoustic feature from the input transcript and a vocoder that generates waveform according to the given acoustic feature. However, the acoustic feature in current TTS systems is typically mel-spectrogram, which is highly correlated along both time and frequency axes in a complicated way, leading to a great difficulty for the AM to predict. Although high-fidelity audio can be generated by recent neural vocoders from ground-truth(GT) mel-spectrogram, the gap between the GT and the predicted mel-spectrogram from AM degrades the performance of the entire TTS system. In this work, we propose VQTTS, consisting of an AM txt2vec and a vocoder vec2wav, which uses self-supervised vector-quantized(VQ) acoustic feature rather than mel-spectrogram. We redesign both the AM and the vocoder accordingly. In particular, txt2vec basically becomes a classification model instead of a traditional regression model while vec2wav uses an additional feature encoder before HifiGAN generator for smoothing the discontinuous quantized feature. Our experiments show that vec2wav achieves better reconstruction performance than HifiGAN when using self-supervised VQ acoustic feature. Moreover, our entire TTS system VQTTS achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of naturalness among all current publicly available TTS systems. ",

The analysis reveals that the popularities of competing memes in systems of finite size are indeterminate since the propagation process follows a saddle path, leading to symmetry breaking. It suggests that the virality of social memes may not be attributed to their intrinsic attractiveness but rather to randomness in network structure. ",

    "abstract": "The spatio-angular resolution of a light field (LF) display is a crucial factor for delivering adequate spatial image quality and eliciting an accommodation response. Previous studies have modelled retinal image formation with an LF display and evaluated whether accommodation would be evoked correctly. The models were mostly based on ray-tracing and a schematic eye model, which pose computational complexity and inaccurately represent the human eye population's behaviour. We propose an efficient wave-optics-based framework to model the human eye and a general LF display. With the model, we simulated the retinal point spread function (PSF) of a point rendered by an LF display at various depths to characterise the retinal image quality. Additionally, accommodation responses to rendered LF images were estimated by computing the visual Strehl ratio based on the optical transfer function (VSOTF) from the PSFs. We assumed an ideal LF display that had an infinite spatial resolution and was free from optical aberrations in the simulation. We tested images rendered at 0--4 dioptres of depths having angular resolutions of up to 4x4 viewpoints within a pupil. The simulation predicted small and constant accommodation errors, which contradict the findings of previous studies. An evaluation of the optical resolution of the rendered retinal image suggested a trade-off between the maximum resolution achievable and the depth range of a rendered image where in-focus resolution is kept high. The proposed framework can be used to evaluate the upper bound of the optical performance of an LF display for realistically aberrated eyes, which may help to find an optimal spatio-angular resolution required to render a high quality 3D scene.

EEND presents an attractive alternative to standard cascaded diarization systems since a single system is trained at once to deal with the whole diarization problem. Several EEND variants and approaches are being proposed, however, all these models require large amounts of annotated data for training but available annotated data are scarce. Thus, EEND works have used mostly simulated mixtures for training. However, simulated mixtures do not resemble real conversations in many aspects. In this work we present an alternative method for creating synthetic conversations that resemble real ones by using statistics about distributions of pauses and overlaps estimated on genuine conversations. Furthermore, we analyze the effect of the source of the statistics, different augmentations and amounts of data. We demonstrate that our approach performs substantially better than the original one, while reducing the dependence on the fine-tuning stage. Experiments are carried out on 2-speaker telephone conversations of Callhome and DIHARD 3.

A novel set-based method is proposed to compute both exact and over-approximated reachable sets for linear discrete-time systems with FNN controllers, and linear program-based sufficient conditions are presented to certify the safety of the neural feedback systems. Reachability analysis and safety verification for neural feedback systems with nonlinear models are also considered. The computational efficiency and accuracy of the proposed method are demonstrated by two numerical examples where a comparison with state-of-the-art methods is also provided. ",

Firstly, the definition of equitable partition of matrix-weighted signed multi-agent system is given, and the upper bound of controllable subspace and a necessary condition of controllability are obtained by combining the restriction conditions of the coefficient matrix and matrix weight for the case of fixed and switching topologies, respectively.The influence of different selection methods of coefficient matrices on the results is discussed. Secondly, for the case of heterogeneous systems, the upper bound of controllable subspace and the necessary condition of controllability are obtained when the dynamics of individuals in the same cell are the same. Thirdly, sufficient conditions for controllable and uncontrollable union graphs are obtained by taking advantage of the concept of switched systems and equitable partitions, respectively. Finally, necessary condition of observability is obtained in terms of the dual system and the constraints of the coefficient matrix, and the relationship between the observability and the controllability of the matrix-weighted signed multi-agent systems is discussed.

    "abstract": "Recent state-of-the-art speaker verification architectures adopt multi-scale processing and frequency-channel attention techniques. However, their full potential may not have been exploited because these techniques' receptive fields are fixed where most convolutional layers operate with specified kernel sizes such as 1, 3 or 5. We aim to further improve this line of research by introducing a selective kernel attention (SKA) mechanism. The SKA mechanism allows each convolutional layer to adaptively select the kernel size in a data-driven fashion based on an attention mechanism that exploits both frequency and channel domain using the previous layer's output. We propose three module variants using the SKA mechanism whereby two modules are applied in front of an ECAPA-TDNN model, and the other is combined with the Res2Net backbone block. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed model consistently outperforms the conventional counterpart on the three different evaluation protocols in terms of both equal error rate and minimum detection cost function. In addition, we present a detailed analysis that helps understand how the SKA module works. ",

Specifically, TMFNet consists of lesion detection network and lesion identification network. Among them, the former improves the feature extraction module and detection module based on the traditional Faster R-CNN network, and readjusts the parameters of the anchor in the region proposal network(RPN) module;the latter combines residual structure and feature pyramid structure are used to build a small intestinal lesion recognition network based on feature fusion, for reducing the false positive rate of the former and improve the overall accuracy.We used 22,335 WCE images in the experiment, with a total of 123,092 lesion regions used to train the detection framework of this paper. In the experiment, the detection framework is trained and tested on the real WCE image dataset provided by the hospital gastroenterology department. The sensitivity, false positive and accuracy of the final model on the RPM are 98.81$\\%$, 7.43$\\%$ and 92.57$\\%$, respectively.Meanwhile,the corresponding results on the lesion images were 98.75$\\%$, 5.62$\\%$ and 94.39$\\%$.

    "abstract": "The combinatorial refinement techniques have proven to be an efficient approach to isomorphism testing for particular classes of graphs. If the number of refinement rounds is small, this puts the corresponding isomorphism problem in a low-complexity class. We investigate the round complexity of the 2-dimensional Weisfeiler-Leman algorithm on circulant graphs, i.e. on Cayley graphs of the cyclic group $\\mathbb{Z}_n$, and prove that the number of rounds until stabilization is bounded by $\\mathcal{O}(d(n)\\log n)$, where $d(n)$ is the number of divisors of $n$. As a particular consequence, isomorphism can be tested in NC for connected circulant graphs of order $p^\\ell$ with $p$ an odd prime, $\\ell>3$ and vertex degree $\\Delta$ smaller than $p$. We also show that the color refinement method (also known as the 1-dimensional Weisfeiler-Leman algorithm) computes a canonical labeling for every non-trivial circulant graph with a prime number of vertices after individualization of two appropriately chosen vertices. Thus, the canonical labeling problem for this class of graphs has at most the same complexity as color refinement, which results in a time bound of $\\mathcal{O}(\\Delta n\\log n)$. Moreover, this provides a first example where a sophisticated approach to isomorphism testing put forward by Tinhofer has a real practical meaning. ",

Some famous examples include graph colouring, travelling salesman problem and subgraph isomorphism. Most of these problems are typically addressed by exact algorithms, approximate algorithms and heuristics. There are however some drawback for each of these methods. Recent studies have employed learning-based frameworks such as machine learning techniques in solving these problems, given that they are useful in discovering new patterns in structured data that can be represented using graphs. This research direction has successfully attracted a considerable amount of attention. In this survey, we provide a systematic review mainly on classic graph problems in which learning-based approaches have been proposed in addressing the problems. We discuss the overview of each framework, and provide analyses based on the design and performance of the framework. Some potential research questions are also suggested. Ultimately, this survey gives a clearer insight and can be used as a stepping stone to the research community in studying problems in this field. ",

For polynomially bounded non-linearities we give sharp estimates in powers of $1/n$ for the joint correlation functions of the network output and its derivatives. Moreover, we obtain exact layerwise recursions for these correlation functions and solve a number of special cases for classes of non-linearities including $\\mathrm{ReLU}$ and $\\tanh$. We find in both cases that the depth-to-width ratio $L/n$ plays the role of an effective network depth, controlling both the scale of fluctuations at individual neurons and the size of inter-neuron correlations. We use this to study a somewhat simplified version of the so-called exploding and vanishing gradient problem, proving that this particular variant occurs if and only if $L/n$ is large.

    "abstract": "The segmentation of diseases is a popular topic explored by researchers in the field of machine learning. Brain tumors are extremely dangerous and require the utmost precision to segment for a successful surgery. Patients with tumors usually take 4 MRI scans, T1, T1gd, T2, and FLAIR, which are then sent to radiologists to segment and analyze for possible future surgery. To create a second segmentation, it would be beneficial to both radiologists and patients in being more confident in their conclusions. We propose using a method performed by radiologists called image segmentation and applying it to machine learning models to prove a better segmentation. Using Mask R-CNN, its ResNet backbone being pre-trained on the RSNA pneumonia detection challenge dataset, we can train a model on the Brats2020 Brain Tumor dataset. Center for Biomedical Image Computing & Analytics provides MRI data on patients with and without brain tumors and the corresponding segmentations. We can see how well the method of image subtraction works by comparing it to models without image subtraction through DICE coefficient (F1 score), recall, and precision on the untouched test set. Our model performed with a DICE coefficient of 0.75 in comparison to 0.69 without image subtraction. To further emphasize the usefulness of image subtraction, we compare our final model to current state-of-the-art models to segment tumors from MRI scans. ",

We compare MCPM to Jones's work on theoretical grounds, and describe a task-specific variant designed for reconstructing the large-scale distribution of gas and dark matter in the Universe known as the Cosmic web. To analyze the new model, we first explore MCPM's self-patterning behavior, showing a wide range of continuous network-like morphologies -- called \"polyphorms\" -- that the model produces from geometrically intuitive parameters. Applying MCPM to both simulated and observational cosmological datasets, we then evaluate its ability to produce consistent 3D density maps of the Cosmic web. Finally, we examine other possible tasks where MCPM could be useful, along with several examples of fitting to domain-specific data as proofs of concept. ",

Although the architecture of RNN possesses inductive biases toward information over time, it is still challenging to learn the path-dependent material behavior as a function of the loading path considering the change from elastic to elastoplastic regimes. Our attempt is to develop a simple machine-learning-based model that can replicate elastoplastic behaviors considering material heterogeneity and anisotropy. The basic Long-Short Term Memory Unit (LSTM) is adopted for the modeling of plasticity in the two-dimensional space by enhancing the inductive bias toward the past information through manipulating input variables. Our results find that a single LSTM based model can capture the J2 plasticity responses under both monotonic and arbitrary loading paths provided the material heterogeneity. The proposed neural network architecture is then used to model elastoplastic responses of a two-dimensional transversely anisotropic material associated with computational homogenization (FE2). It is also found that a single LSTM model can be used to accurately and effectively capture the path-dependent responses of heterogeneous and anisotropic microstructures under arbitrary mechanical loading conditions.

    "abstract": "Deep learning has become the mainstream methodological choice for analyzing and interpreting whole-slide digital pathology images (WSIs). It is commonly assumed that tumor regions carry most predictive information. In this paper, we proposed an unsupervised clustering-based multiple-instance learning, and apply our method to develop deep-learning models for prediction of gene mutations using WSIs from three cancer types in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) studies (CRC, LUAD, and HNSCC). We showed that unsupervised clustering of image patches could help identify predictive patches, exclude patches lack of predictive information, and therefore improve prediction on gene mutations in all three different cancer types, compared with the WSI based method without selection of image patches and models based on only tumor regions. Additionally, our proposed algorithm outperformed two recently published baseline algorithms leveraging unsupervised clustering to assist model prediction. The unsupervised-clustering-based approach for mutation prediction allows identification of the spatial regions related to mutation of a specific gene via the resolved probability scores, highlighting the heterogeneity of a predicted genotype in the tumor microenvironment. Finally, our study also demonstrated that selection of tumor regions of WSIs is not always the best way to identify patches for prediction of gene mutations, and other tissue types in the tumor micro-environment may provide better prediction ability for gene mutations than tumor tissues.

In this paper, we propose a novel two-step nonparametric approach called Deep Feature Screening (DeepFS) that can overcome these problems and identify significant features with high precision for ultra high-dimensional, low-sample-size data. This approach first extracts a low-dimensional representation of input data and then applies feature screening based on multivariate rank distance correlation recently developed by Deb and Sen (2021). This approach combines the strengths of both deep neural networks and feature screening, and thereby has the following appealing features in addition to its ability of handling ultra high-dimensional data with small number of samples: (1) it is model free and distribution free; (2) it can be used for both supervised and unsupervised feature selection; and (3) it is capable of recovering the original input data.
