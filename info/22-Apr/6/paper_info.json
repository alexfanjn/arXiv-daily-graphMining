On the contrary, although some work have proved that Quadratic Deep Neuron Networks (QDNNs) show better non-linearity and learning capability than the first-order DNNs, their neuron design suffers certain drawbacks from theoretical performance to practical deployment. In this paper, we first proposed a new QDNN neuron architecture design, and further developed QuadraLib, a QDNN library to provide architecture optimization and design exploration for QDNNs. Extensive experiments show that our design has good performance regarding prediction accuracy and computation consumption on multiple learning tasks. ",

    "abstract": "Inspired by the complexity and diversity of biological neurons, a quadratic neuron is proposed to replace the inner product in the current neuron with a simplified quadratic function. Employing such a novel type of neurons offers a new perspective on developing deep learning. When analyzing quadratic neurons, we find that there exists a function such that a heterogeneous network can approximate it well with a polynomial number of neurons but a purely conventional or quadratic network needs an exponential number of neurons to achieve the same level of error. Encouraged by this inspiring theoretical result on heterogeneous networks, we directly integrate conventional and quadratic neurons in an autoencoder to make a new type of heterogeneous autoencoders. Anomaly detection experiments confirm that heterogeneous autoencoders perform competitively compared to other state-of-the-art models. ",

However, the existing model-free learning method can only achieve either activity detection or channel estimation, but not both. In this paper, we propose a novel model-free learning method based on generative adversarial network (GAN) to tackle the JADCE problem. We adopt the U-net architecture to build the generator rather than the standard GAN architecture, where a pre-estimated value that contains the activity information is adopted as input to the generator. By leveraging the properties of the pseudoinverse, the generator is refined by using an affine projection and a skip connection to ensure the output of the generator is consistent with the measurement. Moreover, we build a two-layer fully-connected neural network to design pilot matrix for reducing the impact of receiver noise. Simulation results show that the proposed method outperforms the existing methods in high SNR regimes, as both data consistency projection and pilot matrix optimization improve the learning ability.

Recently, researchers have applied pre-trained visual-linguistic models to perform the multimodal classification task, and some of these solutions have yielded promising results. However, what these visual-linguistic models learn for the hateful meme classification task remains unclear. For instance, it is unclear if these models are able to capture the derogatory or slurs references in multimodality (i.e., image and text) of the hateful memes. To fill this research gap, this paper propose three research questions to improve our understanding of these visual-linguistic models performing the hateful meme classification task. We found that the image modality contributes more to the hateful meme classification task, and the visual-linguistic models are able to perform visual-text slurs grounding to a certain extent. Our error analysis also shows that the visual-linguistic models have acquired biases, which resulted in false-positive predictions. ",

Matters are further complicated by singular integrals, which arise from the presence of a Green's function. To address these singular integrals, an approach was previously presented wherein both the solution and Green's function are manufactured. Because the arising equations are poorly conditioned, they are reformulated as a set of constraints for an optimization problem that selects the solution closest to the manufactured solution. In this paper, we demonstrate how, for such practically singular systems of equations, computing the truncation error by inserting the exact solution into the discretized equations cannot detect certain orders of coding errors. On the other hand, the discretization error from the optimal solution is a more sensitive metric. ",

We introduce a new approximate sampler for such point processes and a new randomized approximation algorithm for their partition functions $\\Xi_{\\mathbb V}(\\lambda, \\phi)$. Our algorithms have running time polynomial in the volume $\\nu(\\mathbb V)$ for all fugacities $\\lambda < \\text e/C_{\\phi}$, where $C_{\\phi}$ is the temperedness constant of $\\phi$. In contrast to previous results, our approach is not restricted to finite-range potentials. Our approach is based on mapping repulsive Gibbs point processes to hard-core models on a natural family of geometric random graphs. Previous discretizations based on hard-core models used deterministic graphs, which limited the results to hard-constraint potentials and box-shaped regions in Euclidean space. We overcome both limitations by randomization. Specifically, we define a distribution $\\zeta^{(n)}_{\\mathbb V, \\phi}$ on graphs of size $n$, such that the hard-core partition function of graphs from this distribution concentrates around $\\Xi_{\\mathbb V}(\\lambda, \\phi)$. We show this by deriving a corollary of the Efron-Stein inequality, which establishes concentration for a function $f$ of independent random inputs, given the output of $f$ only exhibits small relative changes when an input is altered. Our approximation algorithm follows from approximating the hard-core partition function of a random graph from $\\zeta^{(n)}_{\\mathbb V, \\phi}$. Further, we derive a sampling algorithm using an approximate sampler for the hard-core model on a random graph from $\\zeta^{(n)}_{\\mathbb V, \\phi}$ and prove that its density is close to the desired point process via R\\'enyi-M\\\"onch theorem.

    "abstract": "The limited dynamic range of commercial compact camera sensors results in an inaccurate representation of scenes with varying illumination conditions, adversely affecting image quality and subsequently limiting the performance of underlying image processing algorithms. Current state-of-the-art (SoTA) convolutional neural networks (CNN) are developed as post-processing techniques to independently recover under-/over-exposed images. However, when applied to images containing real-world degradations such as glare, high-beam, color bleeding with varying noise intensity, these algorithms amplify the degradations, further degrading image quality. We propose a lightweight two-stage image enhancement algorithm sequentially balancing illumination and noise removal using frequency priors for structural guidance to overcome these limitations. Furthermore, to ensure realistic image quality, we leverage the relationship between frequency and spatial domain properties of an image and propose a Fourier spectrum-based adversarial framework (AFNet) for consistent image enhancement under varying illumination conditions. While current formulations of image enhancement are envisioned as post-processing techniques, we examine if such an algorithm could be extended to integrate the functionality of the Image Signal Processing (ISP) pipeline within the camera sensor benefiting from RAW sensor data and lightweight CNN architecture. Based on quantitative and qualitative evaluations, we also examine the practicality and effects of image enhancement techniques on the performance of common perception tasks such as object detection and semantic segmentation in varying illumination conditions.

    "abstract": "Database fingerprinting has been widely used to discourage unauthorized redistribution of data by providing means to identify the source of data leakages. However, there is no fingerprinting scheme aiming at achieving liability guarantees when sharing genomic databases. Thus, we are motivated to fill in this gap by devising a vanilla fingerprinting scheme specifically for genomic databases. Moreover, since malicious genomic database recipients may compromise the embedded fingerprint by launching effective correlation attacks which leverage the intrinsic correlations among genomic data (e.g., Mendel's law and linkage disequilibrium), we also augment the vanilla scheme by developing mitigation techniques to achieve robust fingerprinting of genomic databases against correlation attacks. We first show that correlation attacks against fingerprinting schemes for genomic databases are very powerful. In particular, the correlation attacks can distort more than half of the fingerprint bits by causing a small utility loss (e.g.,database accuracy and consistency of SNP-phenotype associations measured via p-values). Next, we experimentally show that the correlation attacks can be effectively mitigated by our proposed mitigation techniques. We validate that the attacker can hardly compromise a large portion of the fingerprint bits even if it pays a higher cost in terms of degradation of the database utility. For example, with around 24% loss in accuracy and 20% loss in the consistency of SNP-phenotype associations, the attacker can only distort about 30% fingerprint bits, which is insufficient for it to avoid being accused. We also show that the proposed mitigation techniques also preserve the utility of the shared genomic databases. ",

Our framework, CMTR-BERT, combines multiple text representations, with the goal of circumventing sequential limits and related loss of information the underlying transformer architecture typically suffers from.

    "abstract": "Predicting pedestrian crossing intention is an indispensable aspect of deploying advanced driving systems (ADS) or advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS) to real life. State-of-the-art methods in predicting pedestrian crossing intention often rely on multiple streams of information as inputs, each of which requires massive computational resources and heavy network architectures to generate. However, such reliance limits the practical application of the systems. In this paper, driven the the real-world demands of pedestrian crossing intention prediction models with both high efficiency and accuracy, we introduce a network with only frames of pedestrians as the input. Every component in the introduced network is driven by the goal of light weight. Specifically, we reduce the multi-source input dependency and employ light neural networks that are tailored for mobile devices. These smaller neural networks can fit into computer memory and can be transmitted over a computer network more easily, thus making them more suitable for real-life deployment and real-time prediction. To compensate the removal of the multi-source input, we enhance the network effectiveness by adopting a multi-task learning training, named \"side task learning\", to include multiple auxiliary tasks to jointly learn the feature extractor for improved robustness. Each head handles a specific task that potentially shares knowledge with other heads. In the meantime, the feature extractor is shared across all tasks to ensure the sharing of basic knowledge across all layers. The light weight but high efficiency characteristics of our model endow it the potential of being deployed on vehicle-based systems. Experiments validate that our model consistently delivers outstanding performances. ",

    "title": "SHAIL: Safety-Aware Hierarchical Adversarial Imitation Learning for  Autonomous Driving in Urban Environments",
    "abstract": "Designing a safe and human-like decision-making system for an autonomous vehicle is a challenging task. Generative imitation learning is one possible approach for automating policy-building by leveraging both real-world and simulated decisions. Previous work that applies generative imitation learning to autonomous driving policies focuses on learning a low-level controller for simple settings. However, to scale to complex settings, many autonomous driving systems combine fixed, safe, optimization-based low-level controllers with high-level decision-making logic that selects the appropriate task and associated controller. In this paper, we attempt to bridge this gap in complexity by employing Safety-Aware Hierarchical Adversarial Imitation Learning (SHAIL), a method for learning a high-level policy that selects from a set of low-level controller instances in a way that imitates low-level driving data on-policy. We introduce an urban roundabout simulator that controls non-ego vehicles using real data from the Interaction dataset. We then show empirically that our approach can produce better behavior than previous approaches in driver imitation which have difficulty scaling to complex environments.

    "abstract": "PICNet pioneered the generation of multiple and diverse results for image completion task, but it required a careful balance between $\\mathcal{KL}$ loss (diversity) and reconstruction loss (quality), resulting in a limited diversity and quality . Separately, iGPT-based architecture has been employed to infer distributions in a discrete space derived from a pixel-level pre-clustered palette, which however cannot generate high-quality results directly. In this work, we present a novel framework for pluralistic image completion that can achieve both high quality and diversity at much faster inference speed. The core of our design lies in a simple yet effective code sharing mechanism that leads to a very compact yet expressive image representation in a discrete latent domain. The compactness and the richness of the representation further facilitate the subsequent deployment of a transformer to effectively learn how to composite and complete a masked image at the discrete code domain. Based on the global context well-captured by the transformer and the available visual regions, we are able to sample all tokens simultaneously, which is completely different from the prevailing autoregressive approach of iGPT-based works, and leads to more than 100$\\times$ faster inference speed. Experiments show that our framework is able to learn semantically-rich discrete codes efficiently and robustly, resulting in much better image reconstruction quality. Our diverse image completion framework significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art both quantitatively and qualitatively on multiple benchmark datasets. ",

This work explores a new intriguing direction: training a stylized implicit representation, using a generalized approach that can apply to various 2D and 3D scenarios. We conduct a pilot study on a variety of implicit functions, including 2D coordinate-based representation, neural radiance field, and signed distance function. Our solution is a Unified Implicit Neural Stylization framework, dubbed INS. In contrary to vanilla implicit representation, INS decouples the ordinary implicit function into a style implicit module and a content implicit module, in order to separately encode the representations from the style image and input scenes. An amalgamation module is then applied to aggregate these information and synthesize the stylized output. To regularize the geometry in 3D scenes, we propose a novel self-distillation geometry consistency loss which preserves the geometry fidelity of the stylized scenes. Comprehensive experiments are conducted on multiple task settings, including novel view synthesis of complex scenes, stylization for implicit surfaces, and fitting images using MLPs. We further demonstrate that the learned representation is continuous not only spatially but also style-wise, leading to effortlessly interpolating between different styles and generating images with new mixed styles.

In this work, we propose a prompting-based approach to generate labelled training data for intent classification with off-the-shelf language models (LMs) such as GPT-3. An advantage of this method is that no task-specific LM-fine-tuning for data generation is required; hence the method requires no hyper-parameter tuning and is applicable even when the available training data is very scarce. We evaluate the proposed method in a few-shot setting on four diverse intent classification tasks. We find that GPT-generated data significantly boosts the performance of intent classifiers when intents in consideration are sufficiently distinct from each other. In tasks with semantically close intents, we observe that the generated data is less helpful. Our analysis shows that this is because GPT often generates utterances that belong to a closely-related intent instead of the desired one. We present preliminary evidence that a prompting-based GPT classifier could be helpful in filtering the generated data to enhance its quality. ",

    "abstract": "Deepfakes and manipulated media are becoming a prominent threat due to the recent advances in realistic image and video synthesis techniques. There have been several attempts at combating Deepfakes using machine learning classifiers. However, such classifiers do not generalize well to black-box image synthesis techniques and have been shown to be vulnerable to adversarial examples. To address these challenges, we introduce a deep learning based semi-fragile watermarking technique that allows media authentication by verifying an invisible secret message embedded in the image pixels. Instead of identifying and detecting fake media using visual artifacts, we propose to proactively embed a semi-fragile watermark into a real image so that we can prove its authenticity when needed. Our watermarking framework is designed to be fragile to facial manipulations or tampering while being robust to benign image-processing operations such as image compression, scaling, saturation, contrast adjustments etc. This allows images shared over the internet to retain the verifiable watermark as long as face-swapping or any other Deepfake modification technique is not applied. We demonstrate that FaceSigns can embed a 128 bit secret as an imperceptible image watermark that can be recovered with a high bit recovery accuracy at several compression levels, while being non-recoverable when unseen Deepfake manipulations are applied. For a set of unseen benign and Deepfake manipulations studied in our work, FaceSigns can reliably detect manipulated content with an AUC score of 0.996 which is significantly higher than prior image watermarking and steganography techniques.

Compared with manual PT, intelligent PT has become a dominating mainstream due to less time-consuming and lower labor costs. Unfortunately, RL-based PT is still challenged in real exploitation scenarios because the agent's action space is usually high-dimensional discrete, thus leading to algorithm convergence difficulty. Besides, most PT methods still rely on the decisions of security experts. Addressing the challenges, for the first time, we introduce expert knowledge to guide the agent to make better decisions in RL-based PT and propose a Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning-based generic intelligent Penetration testing framework, denoted as GAIL-PT, to solve the problems of higher labor costs due to the involvement of security experts and high-dimensional discrete action space. Specifically, first, we manually collect the state-action pairs to construct an expert knowledge base when the pre-trained RL / DRL model executes successful penetration testings. Second, we input the expert knowledge and the state-action pairs generated online by the different RL / DRL models into the discriminator of GAIL for training. At last, we apply the output reward of the discriminator to guide the agent to perform the action with a higher penetration success rate to improve PT's performance. Extensive experiments conducted on the real target host and simulated network scenarios show that GAIL-PT achieves the SOTA penetration performance against DeepExploit in exploiting actual target Metasploitable2 and Q-learning in optimizing penetration path, not only in small-scale with or without honey-pot network environments but also in the large-scale virtual network environment.

To use the knowledge learned in the SOD dataset for VSOD efficiently, we introduce dynamic saliency to compensate for the lack of motion information of SOD during the locating process but retain the same fine segmenting process. Specifically, an algorithm for generating spatiotemporal location labels, which consists of generating high-saliency location labels and tracking salient objects in adjacent frames, is proposed. Based on these location labels, a two-stream locating network that introduces an optical flow branch for video salient object locating is presented. Although our method does not require labeled video at all, the experimental results on five public benchmarks of DAVIS, FBMS, ViSal, VOS, and DAVSOD demonstrate that our proposed method is competitive with fully supervised methods and outperforms the state-of-the-art weakly and unsupervised methods.

ELN enables semi-supervised learning to be robust against inaccurate pseudo labels by disregarding label noises during training and can be naturally integrated with self-training and contrastive learning.

    "title": "Transition Information Enhanced Disentangled Graph Neural Networks for  Session-based Recommendation",
    "abstract": "Session-based recommendation is a practical recommendation task that predicts the next item based on an anonymous behavior sequence, and its performance relies heavily on the transition information between items in the sequence. The SOTA methods in SBR employ GNN to model neighboring item transitions from global (i.e, other sessions) and local (i.e, current session) contexts. However, most existing methods treat neighbors from different sessions equally without considering that the neighbor items from different sessions may share similar features with the target item on different aspects and may have different contributions. In other words, they have not explored finer-granularity transition information between items in the global context, leading to sub-optimal performance. In this paper, we fill this gap by proposing a novel Transition Information Enhanced Disentangled Graph Neural Network (TIE-DGNN) model to capture finer-granular transition information between items and try to interpret the reason of the transition by modeling the various factors of the item. Specifically, we propose a position-aware global graph, which utilizes the relative position information to model the neighboring item transition. Then, we slice item embeddings into blocks, each of which represents a factor, and use disentangling module to separately learn the factor embeddings over the global graph. For local context, we train item embeddings by using attention mechanisms to capture transition information from the current session. To this end, our model considers two levels of transition information. Especially in global text, we not only consider finer-granularity transition information between items but also take user intents at factor-level into account to interpret the key reason for the transition. Extensive experiments on three datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method over the SOTA methods. ",

As a byproduct, we are able to compute in $3n$ rounds every function that is computable deterministically in such networks. If explicit termination is not required, the running time improves to $2n$ rounds, which we show to be optimal up to a small additive constant (this is also the first non-trivial lower bound for counting). As our main tool of investigation, we introduce a combinatorial structure called \"history tree\", which is of independent interest. This makes our paper completely self-contained, our proofs elegant and transparent, and our algorithms straightforward to implement. In recent years, considerable effort has been devoted to the design and analysis of counting algorithms for anonymous 1-interval-connected networks with a leader. A series of increasingly sophisticated works, mostly based on classical mass-distribution techniques, have recently led to a celebrated counting algorithm in $O({n^{4+ \\epsilon}} \\log^{3} (n))$ rounds (for $\\epsilon>0$), which was the state of the art prior to this paper.

    "abstract": "Traditional object detectors are ill-equipped for incremental learning. However, fine-tuning directly on a well-trained detection model with only new data will lead to catastrophic forgetting. Knowledge distillation is a flexible way to mitigate catastrophic forgetting. In Incremental Object Detection (IOD), previous work mainly focuses on distilling for the combination of features and responses. However, they under-explore the information that contains in responses. In this paper, we propose a response-based incremental distillation method, dubbed Elastic Response Distillation (ERD), which focuses on elastically learning responses from the classification head and the regression head. Firstly, our method transfers category knowledge while equipping student detector with the ability to retain localization information during incremental learning. In addition, we further evaluate the quality of all locations and provide valuable responses by the Elastic Response Selection (ERS) strategy. Finally, we elucidate that the knowledge from different responses should be assigned with different importance during incremental distillation. Extensive experiments conducted on MS COCO demonstrate our method achieves state-of-the-art result, which substantially narrows the performance gap towards full training. ",

Previous methods use a conditional network to extract a sound-discriminative embedding from the reference audio, and then use it to detect the target sound from the mixture audio. However, the network performs much differently when using different reference audios (e.g. performs poorly for noisy and short-duration reference audios), and tends to make wrong decisions for transient events (i.e. shorter than $1$ second). To overcome these problems, in this paper, we present a reference-aware and duration-robust network (RaDur) for TSD. More specifically, in order to make the network more aware of the reference information, we propose an embedding enhancement module to take into account the mixture audio while generating the embedding, and apply the attention pooling to enhance the features of target sound-related frames and weaken the features of noisy frames. In addition, a duration-robust focal loss is proposed to help model different-duration events. To evaluate our method, we build two TSD datasets based on UrbanSound and Audioset.

Several methods for detecting recycled FPGAs by analyzing the ring oscillator (RO) frequencies have been proposed; however, most assume the known fresh FPGAs (KFFs) as the training data in machine-learning-based classification. In this study, we propose a novel recycled FPGA detection method based on an unsupervised anomaly detection scheme when there are few or no KFFs available. As the RO frequencies in the neighboring logic blocks on an FPGA are similar because of systematic process variation, our method compares the RO frequencies and does not require KFFs. The proposed method efficiently identifies recycled FPGAs through outlier detection using direct density ratio estimation. Experiments using Xilinx Artix-7 FPGAs demonstrate that the proposed method successfully distinguishes recycled FPGAs from 35 fresh FPGAs. In contrast, a conventional recycled FPGA detection method results in certain misclassification. ",

The soft components combined with the platform's full actuation allow for a robust interaction, in the form of efficient multimodal locomotion. In this work, we present the dynamical model of the platform, derive a closed-loop control, and present simulation results fortifying the robustness of the platform under a jumping-flying maneuver.

To reduce the complexity of the speech generation process, several non-autoregressive TTS systems directly find a mapping relationship between text and waveforms. However, the generation quality of these system is unsatisfactory due to the difficulty in modeling the dynamic nature of prosodic information. In this paper, we propose an effective prosody predictor that successfully replicates the characteristics of prosodic features extracted from mel-spectrograms. Specifically, we introduce a generative model-based conditional discriminator to enable the estimated embeddings have highly informative prosodic features, which significantly enhances the expressiveness of generated speech. Since the estimated embeddings obtained by the proposed method are highly correlated with acoustic features, the time-alignment of input texts and intermediate features is greatly simplified, which results in faster convergence. Our proposed model outperforms several publicly available models based on various objective and subjective evaluation metrics, even using a relatively small number of parameters. ",

The current work has proposed an approach to design an energy-efficient EMG-based controller by considering a supervised learning framework using a kernelized SVM classifier for decoding the information of surface electromyography (sEMG) signals to infer the underlying muscle movements. In order to achieve the optimized performance of the EMG-based controller, our main strategy of classifier design is to reduce the false movements of the overall system (when the EMG-based controller is at the `Rest' position). To this end, unlike the traditional single training objective of soft margin kernelized SVM, we have formulated the training algorithm of the proposed supervised learning system as a general constrained multi-objective optimization problem. An elitist multi-objective evolutionary algorithm $-$ the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II) has been used for the tuning of SVM hyperparameters. We have presented the experimental results by performing the experiments on a dataset consisting of the sEMG signals collected from eleven subjects at five different upper limb positions. It is evident from the presented result that the proposed approach provides much more flexibility to the designer in selecting the parameters of the classifier to optimize the energy efficiency of the EMG-based controller.

The output computed by a classifier for each pattern constitutes an approximation of the output of some unknown function, mapping pattern data to their respective classes. The lack of knowledge of such a function along with the complexity of neural classifiers, especially when these are deep learning architectures, do not permit to obtain information on how specific predictions have been made. Hence, these powerful learning systems are considered as black boxes and in critical applications their use tends to be considered inappropriate. Gaining insight on such a black box operation constitutes a one way approach in interpreting operation of neural classifiers and assessing the validity of their decisions. In this paper we tackle this problem introducing a novel methodology for discovering which features are considered relevant by a trained neural classifier and how they affect the classifier's output, thus obtaining an explanation on its decision. Although, feature relevance has received much attention in the machine learning literature here we reconsider it in terms of nonlinear parameter estimation targeted by a set membership approach which is based on interval analysis.

More precisely, we focus on the issue of data exchange between an activity recognition system and a collaborative robotic system. We propose an activity recognition system with linked data using functional object-oriented network (FOON) to facilitate industrial use cases. Initially, we drafted a FOON for our use case. Afterwards, an action is estimated by using object and hand recognition systems coupled with a recurrent neural network, which refers to FOON objects and states. Finally, the detected action is shared via a context broker using an existing linked data model, thus enabling the robotic system to interpret the action and execute it afterwards. Our initial results show that FOON can be used for an industrial use case and that we can use existing linked data models in LfD applications. ",

    "abstract": "Acoustic scene classification (ASC) and sound event detection (SED) are fundamental tasks in environmental sound analysis, and many methods based on deep learning have been proposed. Considering that information on acoustic scenes and sound events helps SED and ASC mutually, some researchers have proposed a joint analysis of acoustic scenes and sound events by multitask learning (MTL). However, conventional works have not investigated in detail how acoustic scenes and sound events mutually benefit SED and ASC. We, therefore, investigate the impact of information on acoustic scenes and sound events on the performance of SED and ASC by using domain adversarial training based on a gradient reversal layer (GRL) or model training with fake labels. Experimental results obtained using the TUT Acoustic Scenes 2016/2017 and TUT Sound Events 2016/2017 show that pieces of information on acoustic scenes and sound events are effectively used to detect sound events and classify acoustic scenes, respectively. Moreover, upon comparing GRL- and fake-label-based methods with single-task-based ASC and SED methods, single-task-based methods are found to achieve better performance. This result implies that even when using single-task-based ASC and SED methods, information on acoustic scenes may be implicitly utilized for SED and vice versa. ",

    "abstract": "State-of-the-art neural (re)rankers are notoriously data hungry which - given the lack of large-scale training data in languages other than English - makes them rarely used in multilingual and cross-lingual retrieval settings. Current approaches therefore typically transfer rankers trained on English data to other languages and cross-lingual setups by means of multilingual encoders: they fine-tune all the parameters of a pretrained massively multilingual Transformer (MMT, e.g., multilingual BERT) on English relevance judgments and then deploy it in the target language. In this work, we show that two parameter-efficient approaches to cross-lingual transfer, namely Sparse Fine-Tuning Masks (SFTMs) and Adapters, allow for a more lightweight and more effective zero-shot transfer to multilingual and cross-lingual retrieval tasks. We first train language adapters (or SFTMs) via Masked Language Modelling and then train retrieval (i.e., reranking) adapters (SFTMs) on top while keeping all other parameters fixed. At inference, this modular design allows us to compose the ranker by applying the task adapter (or SFTM) trained with source language data together with the language adapter (or SFTM) of a target language. Besides improved transfer performance, these two approaches offer faster ranker training, with only a fraction of parameters being updated compared to full MMT fine-tuning. We benchmark our models on the CLEF-2003 benchmark, showing that our parameter-efficient methods outperform standard zero-shot transfer with full MMT fine-tuning, while enabling modularity and reducing training times. Further, we show on the example of Swahili and Somali that, for low(er)-resource languages, our parameter-efficient neural re-rankers can improve the ranking of the competitive machine translation-based ranker.

In this work we present YOLO-S, a simple, fast and efficient network for small target detection. The architecture exploits a small feature extractor based on Darknet20, as well as skip connection, via both bypass and concatenation, and reshape-passthrough layer to alleviate the vanishing gradient problem, promote feature reuse across network and combine low-level positional information with more meaningful high-level information. To verify the performances of YOLO-S, we build \"AIRES\", a novel dataset for cAr detectIon fRom hElicopter imageS acquired in Europe, and set up experiments on both AIRES and VEDAI datasets, benchmarking this architecture with four baseline detectors. Furthermore, in order to handle efficiently the issue of data insufficiency and domain gap when dealing with a transfer learning strategy, we introduce a transitional learning task over a combined dataset based on DOTAv2 and VEDAI and demonstrate that can enhance the overall accuracy with respect to more general features transferred from COCO data. YOLO-S is from 25% to 50% faster than YOLOv3 and only 15-25% slower than Tiny-YOLOv3, outperforming also YOLOv3 in terms of accuracy in a wide range of experiments. Further simulations performed on SARD dataset demonstrate also its applicability to different scenarios such as for search and rescue operations. Besides, YOLO-S has an 87% decrease of parameter size and almost one half FLOPs of YOLOv3, making practical the deployment for low-power industrial applications. ",

    "abstract": "On one hand, kinship is a universal human phenomenon that tends to align with biological relatedness, which might suggest evolutionary foundations. On the other hand, kinship has exceptional variation across the human populations, which points to cultural foundations. Furthermore, even if its foundation was biological, kinship is often too imprecise to track genetic relatedness efficiently, while inclusive fitness theory would suggest focusing only on the closest relatives, which is not the case in most human cultures. It was the parallel validity of these contradicting arguments that led to decades of fierce debate about the definition and measurement of the phenomenon. This paper offers a new approach to kinship. First, the model demonstrates that it is possible to generate kinship networks (a) derived from the kind of basic kin connections that our species shares with other apes, but (b) driven by network rather than biological logic beyond the immediate family. Second the model demonstrates that kinship as a network heuristic works efficiently only in high fertility societies, and gives way to similarity-based friendship with demographic transition. The results explain (i) why kinship labelling is unique to our species, (ii) why kinship is universal among human cultures, (iii) why kinship terminology systems are varied across cultures, (iv) why linguistic kin assignment is imprecise, and (v) why kinship is replaced by homophily when relatives are scarce. The model offers a unifying framework to the debate between social and evolutionary anthropology concerning the concept of human kinship. ",

Our graph encoder then learns a multi-scale representation by allowing each level to integrate the encoding from level(s) below with the graph at that level. We test the learned representation on different tasks, (i.) ligand binding affinity (regression), and (ii.) protein function prediction (classification). On the regression task, contrary to previous methods, our model performs consistently and reliably across different dataset splits, outperforming all baselines on most splits. On the classification task, it achieves a performance close to the top-performing model while using 10x fewer parameters. To improve the memory efficiency of our construction, we segment the multiplex protein surface manifold into molecular superpixels and substitute the surface with these superpixels at little to no performance loss.

    "abstract": "Collaborative filtering (CF) is widely used by personalized recommendation systems, which aims to predict the preference of users with historical user-item interactions. In recent years, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been utilized to build CF models and have shown promising performance. Recent state-of-the-art GNN-based CF approaches simply attribute their performance improvement to the high-order neighbor aggregation ability of GNNs. However, we observe that some powerful deep GNNs such as JKNet and DropEdge, can effectively exploit high-order neighbor information on other graph tasks but perform poorly on CF tasks, which conflicts with the explanation of these GNN-based CF research. Different from these research, we investigate the GNN-based CF from the perspective of Markov processes for distance learning with a unified framework named Markov Graph Diffusion Collaborative Filtering (MGDCF). We design a Markov Graph Diffusion Network (MGDN) as MGDCF's GNN encoder, which learns vertex representations by trading off two types of distances via a Markov process. We show the theoretical equivalence between MGDN's output and the optimal solution of a distance loss function, which can boost the optimization of CF models. MGDN can generalize state-of-the-art models such as LightGCN and APPNP, which are heterogeneous GNNs. In addition, MGDN can be extended to homogeneous GNNs with our sparsification technique. For optimizing MGDCF, we propose the InfoBPR loss function, which extends the widely used BPR loss to exploit multiple negative samples for better performance. We conduct experiments to perform detailed analysis on MGDCF. The source code is publicly available at https://github.com/hujunxianligong/MGDCF. ",

The frequency division strategy is designed, and the frequency pyramid network is developed to extract features from multiple frequency bands. With the frequency strategy, PFN achieves better visual accuracy than state-of-the-art methods in both indoor and outdoor scenes on Make3D, KITTI depth, and NYUv2 datasets. Additional experiments on the noisy NYUv2 dataset demonstrate that PFN is more reliable than existing deep-learning methods in high-noise scenes. ",

Fundamental to the success of our method is the design of a novel multi-agent policy network that can steer a vehicle given the state of the surrounding agents and the map information. The policy network is trained implicitly with ground-truth observation data using backpropagation through time and a differentiable dynamics model to roll out the trajectory forward in time.

In contrast to previous shape reconstruction methods that align the input to a regular grid, we operate directly on the irregular, unoriented point cloud. We leverage attention mechanisms in order to preserve the set structure (permutation equivariance and variable length) of the input. At the same time, attention layers enable local shape modelling, a crucial property for scalability to large scenes. In contrast to architectures that create a global signature for the shape, we operate on local tokens. Given an unoriented, sparse, noisy point cloud as input, we produce equivariant features for each point. These serve as keys and values for the subsequent equivariant cross-attention blocks that parametrize the occupancy field. By querying an arbitrary point in space, we predict its occupancy score. We show that our method outperforms previous SO(3)-equivariant methods, as well as non-equivariant methods trained on SO(3)-augmented datasets. More importantly, local modelling together with SE(3)-equivariance create an ideal setting for SE(3) scene reconstruction. We show that by training only on single objects and without any pre-segmentation, we can reconstruct a novel scene with single-object performance. ",

However, processing high-resolution inputs comes with high computation costs, and naive down-sampling of the input to reduce the computation costs quickly degrades the detection performance. In this paper, we propose SALISA, a novel non-uniform SALiency-based Input SAmpling technique for video object detection that allows for heavy down-sampling of unimportant background regions while preserving the fine-grained details of a high-resolution image. The resulting image is spatially smaller, leading to reduced computational costs while enabling a performance comparable to a high-resolution input. To achieve this, we propose a differentiable resampling module based on a thin plate spline spatial transformer network (TPS-STN). This module is regularized by a novel loss to provide an explicit supervision signal to learn to \"magnify\" salient regions. We report state-of-the-art results in the low compute regime on the ImageNet-VID and UA-DETRAC video object detection datasets. We demonstrate that on both datasets, the mAP of an EfficientDet-D1 (EfficientDet-D2) gets on par with EfficientDet-D2 (EfficientDet-D3) at a much lower computational cost.

    "abstract": "Accurately detecting Alzheimer's disease (AD) and predicting mini-mental state examination (MMSE) score are important tasks in elderly health by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Most of the previous methods on these two tasks are based on single-task learning and rarely consider the correlation between them. Since the MMSE score, which is an important basis for AD diagnosis, can also reflect the progress of cognitive impairment, some studies have begun to apply multi-task learning methods to these two tasks. However, how to exploit feature correlation remains a challenging problem for these methods. To comprehensively address this challenge, we propose a MRI-based multi-task decoupled learning method for AD detection and MMSE score prediction. First, a multi-task learning network is proposed to implement AD detection and MMSE score prediction, which exploits feature correlation by adding three multi-task interaction layers between the backbones of the two tasks. Each multi-task interaction layer contains two feature decoupling modules and one feature interaction module. Furthermore, to enhance the generalization between tasks of the features selected by the feature decoupling module, we propose the feature consistency loss constrained feature decoupling module. Finally, in order to exploit the specific distribution information of MMSE score in different groups, a distribution loss is proposed to further enhance the model performance. We evaluate our proposed method on multi-site datasets. Experimental results show that our proposed multi-task decoupled representation learning method achieves good performance, outperforming single-task learning and other existing state-of-the-art methods.

    "abstract": "Fast noninvasive probing of spatially varying decorrelating events, such as cerebral blood flow beneath the human skull, is an essential task in various scientific and clinical settings. One of the primary optical techniques used is diffuse correlation spectroscopy (DCS), whose classical implementation uses a single or few single-photon detectors, resulting in poor spatial localization accuracy and relatively low temporal resolution. Here, we propose a technique termed Classifying Rapid decorrelation Events via Parallelized single photon dEtection (CREPE)}, a new form of DCS that can probe and classify different decorrelating movements hidden underneath turbid volume with high sensitivity using parallelized speckle detection from a $32\\times32$ pixel SPAD array. We evaluate our setup by classifying different spatiotemporal-decorrelating patterns hidden beneath a 5mm tissue-like phantom made with rapidly decorrelating dynamic scattering media. Twelve multi-mode fibers are used to collect scattered light from different positions on the surface of the tissue phantom. To validate our setup, we generate perturbed decorrelation patterns by both a digital micromirror device (DMD) modulated at multi-kilo-hertz rates, as well as a vessel phantom containing flowing fluid. Along with a deep contrastive learning algorithm that outperforms classic unsupervised learning methods, we demonstrate our approach can accurately detect and classify different transient decorrelation events (happening in 0.1-0.4s) underneath turbid scattering media, without any data labeling. This has the potential to be applied to noninvasively monitor deep tissue motion patterns, for example identifying normal or abnormal cerebral blood flow events, at multi-Hertz rates within a compact and static detection probe.

It has, however, become increasingly clear that these models are susceptible to performance degradation due to spurious correlations and dataset shifts, which may lead to underperformance on underrepresented patient groups, among other problems. In this paper, we compare two classification schemes on the ADNI MRI dataset: a very simple logistic regression model that uses manually selected volumetric features as inputs, and a convolutional neural network trained on 3D MRI data. We assess the robustness of the trained models in the face of varying dataset splits, training set sex composition, and stage of disease. In contrast to earlier work on diagnosing lung diseases based on chest x-ray data, we do not find a strong dependence of model performance for male and female test subjects on the sex composition of the training dataset. Moreover, in our analysis, the low-dimensional model with manually selected features outperforms the 3D CNN, thus emphasizing the need for automatic robust feature extraction methods and the value of manual feature specification (based on prior knowledge) for robustness.

    "abstract": "Quantum computing promises to enhance machine learning and artificial intelligence. Different quantum algorithms have been proposed to improve a wide spectrum of machine learning tasks. Yet, recent theoretical works show that, similar to traditional classifiers based on deep classical neural networks, quantum classifiers would suffer from the vulnerability problem: adding tiny carefully-crafted perturbations to the legitimate original data samples would facilitate incorrect predictions at a notably high confidence level. This will pose serious problems for future quantum machine learning applications in safety and security-critical scenarios. Here, we report the first experimental demonstration of quantum adversarial learning with programmable superconducting qubits. We train quantum classifiers, which are built upon variational quantum circuits consisting of ten transmon qubits featuring average lifetimes of 150 $\\mu$s, and average fidelities of simultaneous single- and two-qubit gates above 99.94% and 99.4% respectively, with both real-life images (e.g., medical magnetic resonance imaging scans) and quantum data. We demonstrate that these well-trained classifiers (with testing accuracy up to 99%) can be practically deceived by small adversarial perturbations, whereas an adversarial training process would significantly enhance their robustness to such perturbations. Our results reveal experimentally a crucial vulnerability aspect of quantum learning systems under adversarial scenarios and demonstrate an effective defense strategy against adversarial attacks, which provide a valuable guide for quantum artificial intelligence applications with both near-term and future quantum devices.

    "abstract": "In the last few years, de novo molecular design using machine learning has made great technical progress but its practical deployment has not been as successful. This is mostly owing to the cost and technical difficulty of synthesizing such computationally designed molecules. To overcome such barriers, various methods for synthetic route design using deep neural networks have been studied intensively in recent years. However, little progress has been made in designing molecules and their synthetic routes simultaneously. Here, we formulate the problem of simultaneously designing molecules with the desired set of properties and their synthetic routes within the framework of Bayesian inference. The design variables consist of a set of reactants in a reaction network and its network topology. The design space is extremely large because it consists of all combinations of purchasable reactants, often in the order of millions or more. In addition, the designed reaction networks can adopt any topology beyond simple multistep linear reaction routes. To solve this hard combinatorial problem, we present a powerful sequential Monte Carlo algorithm that recursively designs a synthetic reaction network by sequentially building up single-step reactions. In a case study of designing drug-like molecules based on commercially available compounds, compared with heuristic combinatorial search methods, the proposed method shows overwhelming performance in terms of computational efficiency and coverage and novelty with respect to existing compounds.

For these purposes, 3D audio signals are often acquired through arrays of Ambisonics microphones, each comprising four capsules that decompose the sound field in spherical harmonics. In this paper, we propose a dual quaternion representation of the spatial sound field acquired through an array of two First Order Ambisonics (FOA) microphones. The audio signals are encapsulated in a dual quaternion that leverages quaternion algebra properties to exploit correlations among them. This augmented representation with 6 degrees of freedom (6DOF) involves a more accurate coverage of the sound field, resulting in a more precise sound localization and a more immersive audio experience. We evaluate our approach on a sound event localization and detection (SELD) benchmark. We show that our dual quaternion SELD model with temporal convolution blocks (DualQSELD-TCN) achieves better results with respect to real and quaternion-valued baselines thanks to our augmented representation of the sound field.

We revisit the formula from the Lagrangian perspective to provide a unified framework for understanding and implementing the nontrivial representation of the value function.

Chromatin accessibility changes not only directly affects drug-DNA interactions, but also promote or inhibit the expression of critical genes associated with drug resistance by affecting the DNA binding capacity of TFs and transcriptional regulators. However, Biological experimental techniques for measuring it are expensive and time consuming. In recent years, several kinds of computational methods have been proposed to identify accessible regions of the genome. Existing computational models mostly ignore the contextual information of bases in gene sequences. To address these issues, we proposed a new solution named SemanticCAP. It introduces a gene language model which models the context of gene sequences, thus being able to provide an effective representation of a certain site in gene sequences. Basically, we merge the features provided by the gene language model into our chromatin accessibility model. During the process, we designed some methods to make feature fusion smoother. Compared with other systems under public benchmarks, our model proved to have better performance. ",

The proposed scheme is built on harnessing the collective behavior of laser networks for storing a number of phase patterns as stable fixed points of the governing dynamical equations and retrieving such patterns through proper excitation conditions, thus exhibiting an associative memory property. The associative memory functionality is first discussed in the strong pumping regime of a network of passive dissipatively coupled lasers which simulate the classical XY model. It is discussed that despite the large storage capacity of the network, the large overlap between fixed-point patterns effectively limits pattern retrieval to only two images. Next, we show that this restriction can be uplifted by using nonreciprocal coupling between lasers and this allows for utilizing a large storage capacity. This work opens new possibilities for neural computation with coherent laser networks as novel analog processors. In addition, the underlying dynamical model discussed here suggests a novel energy-based recurrent neural network that handles continuous data as opposed to Hopfield networks and Boltzmann machines which are intrinsically binary systems.

Our key hypothesis is that along with the modelling of audio, incorporating discriminative information from other modalities can be highly beneficial for this task. Our proposed method, MADA, explicitly focuses on two modalities other than the audio itself, namely, the underlying emotions expressed in the abusive audio and the semantic information encapsulated in the corresponding textual form. Observations prove that MADA demonstrates gains over audio-only approaches on the ADIMA dataset. We test the proposed approach on 10 different languages and observe consistent gains in the range 0.6%-5.2% by leveraging multiple modalities. We also perform extensive ablation experiments for studying the contributions of every modality and observe the best results while leveraging all the modalities together. Additionally, we perform experiments to empirically confirm that there is a strong correlation between underlying emotions and abusive behaviour. ",

    "abstract": "Melanoma is a fatal skin cancer that is curable and has dramatically increasing survival rate when diagnosed at early stages. Learning-based methods hold significant promise for the detection of melanoma from dermoscopic images. However, since melanoma is a rare disease, existing databases of skin lesions predominantly contain highly imbalanced numbers of benign versus malignant samples. In turn, this imbalance introduces substantial bias in classification models due to the statistical dominance of the majority class. To address this issue, we introduce a deep clustering approach based on the latent-space embedding of dermoscopic images. Clustering is achieved using a novel center-oriented margin-free triplet loss (COM-Triplet) enforced on image embeddings from a convolutional neural network backbone. The proposed method aims to form maximally-separated cluster centers as opposed to minimizing classification error, so it is less sensitive to class imbalance. To avoid the need for labeled data, we further propose to implement COM-Triplet based on pseudo-labels generated by a Gaussian mixture model. Comprehensive experiments show that deep clustering with COM-Triplet loss outperforms clustering with triplet loss, and competing classifiers in both supervised and unsupervised settings. ",

In addition, the SDR estimator is equivariant by similarity transforms and has low computational complexity. More precisely, in the case of $n$ vectors of dimension $p$ -- at most $\\varepsilon n$ out of which are adversarially corrupted -- the SDR estimator has a squared error of order $\\big(\\frac{r_\\Sigma}{n} + \\varepsilon^2\\log(1/\\varepsilon)\\big){\\log p}$ and a running time of order $p^3 + n p^2$.

In this work, we investigate the impact of performing such multi-task learning on the adversarial robustness of ASR models in the speech domain. We conduct extensive MTL experimentation by combining semantically diverse tasks such as accent classification and ASR, and evaluate a wide range of adversarial settings. Our thorough analysis reveals that performing MTL with semantically diverse tasks consistently makes it harder for an adversarial attack to succeed. We also discuss in detail the serious pitfalls and their related remedies that have a significant impact on the robustness of MTL models. Our proposed MTL approach shows considerable absolute improvements in adversarially targeted WER ranging from 17.25 up to 59.90 compared to single-task learning baselines (attention decoder and CTC respectively). Ours is the first in-depth study that uncovers adversarial robustness gains from multi-task learning for ASR. ",
