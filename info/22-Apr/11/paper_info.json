A practical notation for sharing CTI is STIX. STIX offers facilities to create, visualise and share models; however, even a moderately simple project can be represented in STIX as a quite complex graph, suggesting to spread CTI across multiple simpler sub-projects. Our tool aims to enhance the STIX-based modelling task in contexts when such simplifications are infeasible. Examples can be the microgrid and, more in general, the smart grid. ",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a novel model training solution, denoted as Adaptive-Gravity, for enhancing the robustness of deep neural network classifiers against adversarial examples. We conceptualize the model parameters/features associated with each class as a mass characterized by its centroid location and the spread (standard deviation of the distance) of features around the centroid. We use the centroid associated with each cluster to derive an anti-gravity force that pushes the centroids of different classes away from one another during network training. Then we customized an objective function that aims to concentrate each class's features toward their corresponding new centroid, which has been obtained by anti-gravity force. This methodology results in a larger separation between different masses and reduces the spread of features around each centroid. As a result, the samples are pushed away from the space that adversarial examples could be mapped to, effectively increasing the degree of perturbation needed for making an adversarial example. We have implemented this training solution as an iterative method consisting of four steps at each iteration: 1) centroid extraction, 2) anti-gravity force calculation, 3) centroid relocation, and 4) gravity training. Gravity's efficiency is evaluated by measuring the corresponding fooling rates against various attack models, including FGSM, MIM, BIM, and PGD using LeNet and ResNet110 networks, benchmarked against MNIST and CIFAR10 classification problems. Test results show that Gravity not only functions as a powerful instrument to robustify a model against state-of-the-art adversarial attacks but also effectively improves the model training accuracy.

    "abstract": "A foundational result in origami mathematics is Kawasaki and Justin's simple, efficient characterization of flat foldability for unassigned single-vertex crease patterns (where each crease can fold mountain or valley) on flat material. This result was later generalized to cones of material, where the angles glued at the single vertex may not sum to $360^\\circ$. Here we generalize these results to when the material forms a complex (instead of a manifold), and thus the angles are glued at the single vertex in the structure of an arbitrary planar graph (instead of a cycle). Like the earlier characterizations, we require all creases to fold mountain or valley, not remain unfolded flat; otherwise, the problem is known to be NP-complete (weakly for flat material and strongly for complexes). Equivalently, we efficiently characterize which combinatorially embedded planar graphs with prescribed edge lengths can fold flat, when all angles must be mountain or valley (not unfolded flat). Our algorithm runs in $O(n \\log^3 n)$ time, improving on the previous best algorithm of $O(n^2 \\log n)$. ",

Salient object detection is one problem that is still open due to the difficulty of understanding the brain's inner workings. Progress on this research area follows the traditional path of hand-made designs using neuroscience knowledge. In recent years two different approaches based on genetic programming appear to enhance their technique. One follows the idea of combining previous hand-made methods through genetic programming and fuzzy logic. The other approach consists of improving the inner computational structures of basic hand-made models through artificial evolution. This research work proposes expanding the artificial dorsal stream using a recent proposal to solve salient object detection problems. This approach uses the benefits of the two main aspects of this research area: fixation prediction and detection of salient objects. We decided to apply the fusion of visual saliency and image segmentation algorithms as a template. The proposed methodology discovers several critical structures in the template through artificial evolution.

    "abstract": "Deep learning and big data algorithms have become widely used in industrial applications to optimize several tasks in many complex systems. Particularly, deep learning model for diagnosing and prognosing machinery health has leveraged predictive maintenance (PdM) to be more accurate and reliable in decision making, in this way avoiding unnecessary interventions, machinery accidents, and environment catastrophes. Recently, Transformer Neural Networks have gained notoriety and have been increasingly the favorite choice for Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. Thus, given their recent major achievements in NLP, this paper proposes the development of an automatic fault classifier model for predictive maintenance based on a modified version of the Transformer architecture, namely T4PdM, to identify multiple types of faults in rotating machinery. Experimental results are developed and presented for the MaFaulDa and CWRU databases. T4PdM was able to achieve an overall accuracy of 99.98% and 98% for both datasets, respectively. In addition, the performance of the proposed model is compared to other previously published works. It has demonstrated the superiority of the model in detecting and classifying faults in rotating industrial machinery. Therefore, the proposed Transformer-based model can improve the performance of machinery fault analysis and diagnostic processes and leverage companies to a new era of the Industry 4.0. In addition, this methodology can be adapted to any other task of time series classification. ",

    "abstract": "A recent emphasis of distributed learning research has been on federated learning (FL), in which model training is conducted by the data-collecting devices. Existing research on FL has mostly focused on a star topology learning architecture with synchronized (time-triggered) model training rounds, where the local models of the devices are periodically aggregated by a centralized coordinating node. However, in many settings, such a coordinating node may not exist, motivating efforts to fully decentralize FL. In this work, we propose a novel methodology for distributed model aggregations via asynchronous, event-triggered consensus iterations over the network graph topology. We consider heterogeneous communication event thresholds at each device that weigh the change in local model parameters against the available local resources in deciding the benefit of aggregations at each iteration. Through theoretical analysis, we demonstrate that our methodology achieves asymptotic convergence to the globally optimal learning model under standard assumptions in distributed learning and graph consensus literature, and without restrictive connectivity requirements on the underlying topology. Subsequent numerical results demonstrate that our methodology obtains substantial improvements in communication requirements compared with FL baselines. ",

To what extent are these robustness profiles accounted for by high-performing neural network systems? We bring together experiments in speech recognition under a single synthesis framework to evaluate state-of-the-art neural networks as stimulus-computable, optimized observers. In a series of experiments, we (1) clarify how influential speech manipulations in the literature relate to each other and to natural speech, (2) show the granularities at which machines exhibit out-of-distribution robustness, reproducing classical perceptual phenomena in humans, (3) identify the specific conditions where model predictions of human performance differ, and (4) demonstrate a crucial failure of all artificial systems to perceptually recover where humans do, suggesting a key specification for theory and model building.

Thus, our goal with this work is to propose a data-driven approach to infer efficient FT structures that achieve a complete representation of the failure mechanisms contained in the failure data set without human intervention.

Our results show that, for six case studies from the literature, our approach successfully achieved automatic, efficient, and consistent inference of the associated FT models.

While it is difficult to measure whether neural program synthesis methods have similar capabilities, what we can measure is whether they compositionally generalize, that is, whether a model that has been trained on the simpler subtasks is subsequently able to solve more complex tasks. In this paper, we focus on measuring the ability of learned program synthesizers to compositionally generalize. We first characterize several different axes along which program synthesis methods would be desired to generalize, e.g., length generalization, or the ability to combine known subroutines in new ways that do not occur in the training data. Based on this characterization, we introduce a benchmark suite of tasks to assess these abilities based on two popular existing datasets, SCAN and RobustFill. Finally, we make first attempts to improve the compositional generalization ability of Transformer models along these axes through novel attention mechanisms that draw inspiration from a human-like decomposition strategy. Empirically, we find our modified Transformer models generally perform better than natural baselines, but the tasks remain challenging. ",

    "abstract": "Objective: Global (inter-patient) ECG classification for arrhythmia detection over Electrocardiogram (ECG) signal is a challenging task for both humans and machines. The main reason is the significant variations of both normal and arrhythmic ECG patterns among patients. Automating this process with utmost accuracy is, therefore, highly desirable due to the advent of wearable ECG sensors. However, even with numerous deep learning approaches proposed recently, there is still a notable gap in the performance of global and patient-specific ECG classification performances. This study proposes a novel approach to narrow this gap and propose a real-time solution with shallow and compact 1D Self-Organized Operational Neural Networks (Self-ONNs). Methods: In this study, we propose a novel approach for inter-patient ECG classification using a compact 1D Self-ONN by exploiting morphological and timing information in heart cycles. We used 1D Self-ONN layers to automatically learn morphological representations from ECG data, enabling us to capture the shape of the ECG waveform around the R peaks. We further inject temporal features based on RR interval for timing characterization. The classification layers can thus benefit from both temporal and learned features for the final arrhythmia classification. Results: Using the MIT-BIH arrhythmia benchmark database, the proposed method achieves the highest classification performance ever achieved, i.e., 99.21% precision, 99.10% recall, and 99.15% F1-score for normal (N) segments; 82.19% precision, 82.50% recall, and 82.34% F1-score for the supra-ventricular ectopic beat (SVEBs); and finally, 94.41% precision, 96.10% recall, and 95.2% F1-score for the ventricular-ectopic beats (VEBs).

    "abstract": "The massive growth of network traffic data leads to a large volume of datasets. Labeling these datasets for identifying intrusion attacks is very laborious and error-prone. Furthermore, network traffic data have complex time-varying non-linear relationships. The existing state-of-the-art intrusion detection solutions use a combination of various supervised approaches along with fused features subsets based on correlations in traffic data. These solutions often require high computational cost, manual support in fine-tuning intrusion detection models, and labeling of data that limit real-time processing of network traffic. Unsupervised solutions do reduce computational complexities and manual support for labeling data but current unsupervised solutions do not consider spatio-temporal correlations in traffic data. To address this, we propose a unified Autoencoder based on combining multi-scale convolutional neural network and long short-term memory (MSCNN-LSTM-AE) for anomaly detection in network traffic. The model first employs Multiscale Convolutional Neural Network Autoencoder (MSCNN-AE) to analyze the spatial features of the dataset, and then latent space features learned from MSCNN-AE employs Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) based Autoencoder Network to process the temporal features. Our model further employs two Isolation Forest algorithms as error correction mechanisms to detect false positives and false negatives to improve detection accuracy. %Additionally, covariance matrices forms a Riemannian manifold that is naturally embedded with distance metrices that facilitates descriminative patterns for detecting malicious network traffic. We evaluated our model NSL-KDD, UNSW-NB15, and CICDDoS2019 dataset and showed our proposed method significantly outperforms the conventional unsupervised methods and other existing studies on the dataset.

To address these problems, we propose a novel and effective semantic representation and dependency learning (SRDL) framework to learn category-specific semantic representation for each category and capture semantic dependency among all categories.

Next, we propose a nearest neighbor search algorithm for realistic (non-ideal) scenarios with a limited number of satellites. The proposed algorithm can approach the global optimum solution under an ideal scenario through a finite number of iterations and a tiny range of searches.

It is a common practice to learn informative user and item representations by performing embedding propagation on a user-item bipartite graph, and then provide the users with personalized item suggestions based on the representations. Despite effectiveness, existing algorithms neglect precious interactive features between user-item pairs in the embedding process. When predicting a user's preference for different items, they still aggregate the user tree in the same way, without emphasizing target-related information in the user neighborhood. Such a uniform aggregation scheme easily leads to suboptimal user and item representations, limiting the model expressiveness to some extent. In this work, we address this problem by building bilateral interactive guidance between each user-item pair and proposing a new model named IA-GCN (short for InterActive GCN). Specifically, when learning the user representation from its neighborhood, we assign higher attention weights to those neighbors similar to the target item. Correspondingly, when learning the item representation, we pay more attention to those neighbors resembling the target user. This leads to interactive and interpretable features, effectively distilling target-specific information through each graph convolutional operation. Our model is built on top of LightGCN, a state-of-the-art GCN model for CF, and can be combined with various GCN-based CF architectures in an end-to-end fashion. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of IA-GCN. ",

    "title": "Reusing the Task-specific Classifier as a Discriminator:  Discriminator-free Adversarial Domain Adaptation",
    "abstract": "Adversarial learning has achieved remarkable performances for unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA). Existing adversarial UDA methods typically adopt an additional discriminator to play the min-max game with a feature extractor. However, most of these methods failed to effectively leverage the predicted discriminative information, and thus cause mode collapse for generator. In this work, we address this problem from a different perspective and design a simple yet effective adversarial paradigm in the form of a discriminator-free adversarial learning network (DALN), wherein the category classifier is reused as a discriminator, which achieves explicit domain alignment and category distinguishment through a unified objective, enabling the DALN to leverage the predicted discriminative information for sufficient feature alignment. Basically, we introduce a Nuclear-norm Wasserstein discrepancy (NWD) that has definite guidance meaning for performing discrimination. Such NWD can be coupled with the classifier to serve as a discriminator satisfying the K-Lipschitz constraint without the requirements of additional weight clipping or gradient penalty strategy. Without bells and whistles, DALN compares favorably against the existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on a variety of public datasets. Moreover, as a plug-and-play technique, NWD can be directly used as a generic regularizer to benefit existing UDA algorithms. Code is available at https://github.com/xiaoachen98/DALN. ",

    "abstract": "A traditional federated learning (FL) allows clients to collaboratively train a global model under the coordination of a central server, which sparks great interests in exploiting the private data distributed on clients. However, once the central server suffers from a single point of failure, it will lead to system crash. In addition, FL usually involves a large number of clients, which requires expensive communication costs. These challenges inspire a communication-efficient design of decentralized FL. In this paper, we propose an efficient and privacy-preserving global model training protocol in the context of FL in large-scale peer-to-peer networks, CFL. The proposed CFL protocol aggregates local contributions hierarchically by a cluster-based aggregation mode, as well as a leverged authenticated encryption scheme to ensure the security communication, whose key is distributed by a modified secure communication key establishment protocol. Theoretical analyses show that CFL guarantees the privacy of local model update parameters, as well as integrity and authenticity under the widespread internal semi-honest and external malicious threat models. In particular, the proposed key revocation based on public voting can effectively defense against external adversaries hijacking honest participants to ensure the confidentiality of the communication keys. Moreover, the modified secure communication key establishment protocol indeed achieves high network connectivity probability to ensure transmission security of the system. ",

In FL, UEs train local machine learning models and transmit them to an aggregator, where a global model is formed and then sent back to UEs. In wireless networks, local training and model transmission can be unsuccessful due to constrained computing resources, wireless channel impairments, bandwidth limitations, etc., which degrades FL performance in model accuracy and/or training time. Moreover, we need to quantify the benefits and cost of deploying edge intelligence, as model training and transmission consume certain amount of resources. Therefore, it is imperative to deeply understand the relationship between FL performance and multiple-dimensional resources. In this paper, we construct an analytical model to investigate the relationship between the FL model accuracy and consumed resources in FL empowered wireless edge networks. Based on the analytical model, we explicitly quantify the model accuracy, available computing resources and communication resources. Numerical results validate the effectiveness of our theoretical modeling and analysis, and demonstrate the trade-off between the communication and computing resources for achieving a certain model accuracy.

The abnormal battery-draining behavior of GPS makes it difficult for the developers to decide on battery optimization during the development phase directly. It will reduce the burden on developers if battery-saving strategies are considered early, and relevant battery-aware code is generated from the design phase artifacts. Therefore, we aim to develop tool support, eGEN, to specify and create native location-based mobile apps. eGEN consists of Domain-specific Modeling Language (DSML) and a code generator for location-sensing. It is developed using Xtext and Xtend as an Eclipse plug-in, and currently, it supports native Android apps. eGEN is evaluated through controlled experiments by instrumenting the generated code in five location-based open-source Android applications. The experimental results show 4.35 minutes of average GPS reduction per hour and 188 mA of average reduction in battery consumption while showing only 97 meters degrade in location accuracy over 3 kilometers of a cycling path. Hence, we believe that code generated by eGEN would help developers to balance between energy and accuracy requirements of location-based applications.

    "abstract": "Continuous Sign Language Recognition (CSLR) is a challenging research task due to the lack of accurate annotation on the temporal sequence of sign language data. The recent popular usage is a hybrid model based on \"CNN + RNN\" for CSLR. However, when extracting temporal features in these works, most of the methods using a fixed temporal receptive field and cannot extract the temporal features well for each sign language word. In order to obtain more accurate temporal features, this paper proposes a multi-scale temporal network (MSTNet). The network mainly consists of three parts. The Resnet and two fully connected (FC) layers constitute the frame-wise feature extraction part. The time-wise feature extraction part performs temporal feature learning by first extracting temporal receptive field features of different scales using the proposed multi-scale temporal block (MST-block) to improve the temporal modeling capability, and then further encoding the temporal features of different scales by the transformers module to obtain more accurate temporal features. Finally, the proposed multi-level Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) loss part is used for training to obtain recognition results. The multi-level CTC loss enables better learning and updating of the shallow network parameters in CNN, and the method has no parameter increase and can be flexibly embedded in other models. Experimental results on two publicly available datasets demonstrate that our method can effectively extract sign language features in an end-to-end manner without any prior knowledge, improving the accuracy of CSLR and reaching the state-of-the-art.

In this paper, we propose frequency augmentation (FreqAug), a spatio-temporal data augmentation method in the frequency domain for video representation learning. FreqAug stochastically removes undesirable information from the video by filtering out specific frequency components so that learned representation captures essential features of the video for various downstream tasks. Specifically, FreqAug pushes the model to focus more on dynamic features rather than static features in the video via dropping spatial or temporal low-frequency components. In other words, learning invariance between remaining frequency components results in high-frequency enhanced representation with less static bias. To verify the generality of the proposed method, we experiment with FreqAug on multiple self-supervised learning frameworks along with standard augmentations. Transferring the improved representation to five video action recognition and two temporal action localization downstream tasks shows consistent improvements over baselines. ",

In particular, it is known that the characteristics of actuators in leg robots have a considerable influence on the reality gap, and this is also noticeable in high reduction ratio gears. Therefore, we propose a new simulation model of high reduction ratio gears to reduce the reality gap. The instability of the bipedal locomotion causes the sim-to-real transfer to fail catastrophically, making system identification of the physical parameters of the simulation difficult. Thus, we also propose a system identification method that utilizes the failure experience. The realistic simulations obtained by these improvements allow the robot to perform compliant bipedal locomotion by reinforcement learning. The effectiveness of the method is verified using a actual biped robot, ROBOTIS-OP3, and the sim-to-real transferred policy archived to stabilize the robot under severe disturbances and walk on uneven terrain without force and torque sensors.

However, quantifying their safety and robustness properties has proven challenging due to the non-linearities of the activation functions inside the neural network. A key robustness indicator is certifying the stability properties of the feedback system and providing a region of attraction, which has been addressed in previous literature. However, these works only address linear systems or require one to abstract the plant non-linearities and bound them using slope and sector constraints. In this paper we use a Sum of Squares programming framework to compute the stability of non-linear systems with neural network controllers directly. Within this framework, we can propose higher order candidate Lyapunov functions with richer structures that are able to better capture the dynamics of the non-linear system and the nonlinearities in the neural network. We are also able to analyse these systems in continuous time, whereas other methods rely on discretising the system. These higher order Lyapunov functions are used in conjunction with higher order multipliers on the inequality and equality constraints that bound the neural network input-output properties. The volume of the region of attraction computed is increased compared to other methods, allowing for better safety guarantees on the stability of the system. We are also able to easily analyse non-linear polynomial systems, which is not possible to do with other methods. We are also able to conduct robustness analysis on the parameter uncertainty. We show the benefits of our method using numerical examples. ",

Within this setup, a centralized, trusted shuffler is responsible for shuffling by keeping the identities of data anonymous, which subsequently leads to stronger privacy guarantees for systems. However, introducing a centralized entity to the originally local privacy model loses some appeals of not having any centralized entity as in local differential privacy. Moreover, implementing a shuffler in a reliable way is not trivial due to known security issues and/or requirements of advanced hardware or secure computation technology. Motivated by these practical considerations, we rethink the shuffle model to relax the assumption of requiring a centralized, trusted shuffler. We introduce network shuffling, a decentralized mechanism where users exchange data in a random-walk fashion on a network/graph, as an alternative of achieving privacy amplification via anonymity. We analyze the threat model under such a setting, and propose distributed protocols of network shuffling that is straightforward to implement in practice. Furthermore, we show that the privacy amplification rate is similar to other privacy amplification techniques such as uniform shuffling. To our best knowledge, among the recently studied intermediate trust models that leverage privacy amplification techniques, our work is the first that is not relying on any centralized entity to achieve privacy amplification.

While a variety of methods have been proposed to robustify neural networks, these techniques often target models trained on ImageNet classification. At the same time, it is a common practice to use ImageNet pretrained backbones for downstream tasks such as object detection, semantic segmentation, and image classification from different domains. This raises a question: Can these robust image classifiers transfer robustness to downstream tasks? For object detection and semantic segmentation, we find that a vanilla Swin Transformer, a variant of Vision Transformer tailored for dense prediction tasks, transfers robustness better than Convolutional Neural Networks that are trained to be robust to the corrupted version of ImageNet. For CIFAR10 classification, we find that models that are robustified for ImageNet do not retain robustness when fully fine-tuned. These findings suggest that current robustification techniques tend to emphasize ImageNet evaluations. Moreover, network architecture is a strong source of robustness when we consider transfer learning. ",

Moreover, we investigate our models to understand the impact of different POMs and demographics on model performance through feature ablation studies. We also show that model performance is similar across different demographic subgroups (based on age and sex). To enable this work, we developed an end-to-end reusable pre-processing and machine learning framework which allows quicker experimentation over disparate MS datasets. ",

    "abstract": "Fashion is now among the largest industries worldwide, for it represents human history and helps tell the worlds story. As a result of the Fourth Industrial Revolution, the Internet has become an increasingly important source of fashion information. However, with a growing number of web pages and social data, it is nearly impossible for humans to manually catch up with the ongoing evolution and the continuously variable content in this domain. The proper management and exploitation of big data can pave the way for the substantial growth of the global economy as well as citizen satisfaction. Therefore, computer scientists have found it challenging to handle e-commerce fashion websites by using big data and machine learning technologies. This paper first proposes a scalable focused Web Crawler engine based on the distributed computing platforms to extract and process fashion data on e-commerce websites. The role of the proposed platform is then described in developing a disentangled feature extraction method by employing deep convolutional generative adversarial networks (DCGANs) for content-based image indexing and retrieval. Finally, the state-of-the-art solutions are compared, and the results of the proposed approach are analyzed on a standard dataset. For the real-life implementation of the proposed solution, a Web-based application is developed on Apache Storm, Kafka, Solr, and Milvus platforms to create a fashion search engine called SnapMode.

The complexity of today's open-source supply chains results in a significant attack surface, giving attackers numerous opportunities to reach the goal of injecting malicious code into open-source artifacts that is then downloaded and executed by victims. This work proposes a general taxonomy for attacks on open-source supply chains, independent of specific programming languages or ecosystems, and covering all supply chain stages from code contributions to package distribution. Taking the form of an attack tree, it covers 107 unique vectors, linked to 94 real-world incidents, and mapped to 33 mitigating safeguards. User surveys conducted with 17 domain experts and 134 software developers positively validated the correctness, comprehensiveness and comprehensibility of the taxonomy, as well as its suitability for various use-cases. Survey participants also assessed the utility and costs of the identified safeguards, and whether they are used. ",

    "abstract": "Markov Logic Networks (MLNs) define a probability distribution on relational structures over varying domain sizes. Many works have noticed that MLNs, like many other relational models, do not admit consistent marginal inference over varying domain sizes. Furthermore, MLNs learnt on a certain domain do not generalize to new domains of varied sizes. In recent works, connections have emerged between domain size dependence, lifted inference and learning from sub-sampled domains. The central idea to these works is the notion of projectivity. The probability distributions ascribed by projective models render the marginal probabilities of sub-structures independent of the domain cardinality. Hence, projective models admit efficient marginal inference, removing any dependence on the domain size. Furthermore, projective models potentially allow efficient and consistent parameter learning from sub-sampled domains. In this paper, we characterize the necessary and sufficient conditions for a two-variable MLN to be projective. We then isolate a special model in this class of MLNs, namely Relational Block Model (RBM). We show that, in terms of data likelihood maximization, RBM is the best possible projective MLN in the two-variable fragment. Finally, we show that RBMs also admit consistent parameter learning over sub-sampled domains. ",

The results show that the proposed features can be used for accurate vehicle detection and speed estimation, with an average error of 7.87 km/h. If we formulate speed estimation as a classification problem, with a 10 km/h discretization interval, the proposed method attains the average accuracy of 48.7% for correct class prediction and 91.0% when an offset of one class is allowed.

While behavioural tests capture human prior knowledge and insights, there has been little exploration on how to leverage them for model training and development. With this in mind, we explore behaviour-aware learning by examining several fine-tuning schemes using HateCheck, a suite of functional tests for hate speech detection systems. To address potential pitfalls of training on data originally intended for evaluation, we train and evaluate models on different configurations of HateCheck by holding out categories of test cases, which enables us to estimate performance on potentially overlooked system properties. The fine-tuning procedure led to improvements in the classification accuracy of held-out functionalities and identity groups, suggesting that models can potentially generalise to overlooked functionalities. However, performance on held-out functionality classes and i.i.d. hate speech detection data decreased, which indicates that generalisation occurs mostly across functionalities from the same class and that the procedure led to overfitting to the HateCheck data distribution.

Specifically, we firstly generate random walks on external knowledge graphs and infuse them with news text representations. We then construct a heterogeneous information network to jointly model news content as well as semantic, syntactic and entity cues in news articles. Finally, we adopt relational graph neural networks for graph-level representation learning and conduct political perspective detection.

    "abstract": "Mobility data is essential for cities and communities to identify areas for necessary improvement. Data collected by mobility providers already contains all the information necessary, but privacy of the individuals needs to be preserved. Differential privacy (DP) defines a mathematical property which guarantees that certain limits of privacy are preserved while sharing such data, but its functionality and privacy protection are difficult to explain to laypeople. In this paper, we adapt risk communication formats in conjunction with a model for the privacy risks of DP. The result are privacy notifications which explain the risk to an individual's privacy when using DP, rather than DP's functionality. We evaluate these novel privacy communication formats in a crowdsourced study. We find that they perform similarly to the best performing DP communications used currently in terms of objective understanding, but did not make our participants as confident in their understanding. We also discovered an influence, similar to the Dunning-Kruger effect, of the statistical numeracy on the effectiveness of some of our privacy communication formats and the DP communication format used currently. These results generate hypotheses in multiple directions, for example, toward the use of risk visualization to improve the understandability of our formats or toward adaptive user interfaces which tailor the risk communication to the characteristics of the reader.

    "abstract": "One intriguing property of adversarial attacks is their \"transferability\" -- an adversarial example crafted with respect to one deep neural network (DNN) model is often found effective against other DNNs as well. Intensive research has been conducted on this phenomenon under simplistic controlled conditions. Yet, thus far, there is still a lack of comprehensive understanding about transferability-based attacks (\"transfer attacks\") in real-world environments. To bridge this critical gap, we conduct the first large-scale systematic empirical study of transfer attacks against major cloud-based MLaaS platforms, taking the components of a real transfer attack into account. The study leads to a number of interesting findings which are inconsistent to the existing ones, including: (1) Simple surrogates do not necessarily improve real transfer attacks. (2) No dominant surrogate architecture is found in real transfer attacks. (3) It is the gap between posterior (output of the softmax layer) rather than the gap between logit (so-called $\\kappa$ value) that increases transferability. Moreover, by comparing with prior works, we demonstrate that transfer attacks possess many previously unknown properties in real-world environments, such as (1) Model similarity is not a well-defined concept. (2) $L_2$ norm of perturbation can generate high transferability without usage of gradient and is a more powerful source than $L_\\infty$ norm. We believe this work sheds light on the vulnerabilities of popular MLaaS platforms and points to a few promising research directions. ",

Despite the great synthesis quality, training GANs often confronts several issues, including non-convergence, mode collapse, and gradient vanishing. There exist several workarounds, for example, regularizing Lipschitz continuity and adopting Wasserstein distance. Although these methods can partially solve the problems, we argue that the problems are result from modeling the discriminator with deep neural networks. In this paper, we base on newly derived deep neural network theories called Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) and propose a new generative algorithm called generative adversarial NTK (GA-NTK). The GA-NTK models the discriminator as a Gaussian Process (GP). With the help of the NTK theories, the training dynamics of GA-NTK can be described with a closed-form formula. To synthesize data with the closed-form formula, the objectives can be simplified into a single-level adversarial optimization problem. We conduct extensive experiments on real-world datasets, and the results show that GA-NTK can generate images comparable to those by GANs but is much easier to train under various conditions. We also study the current limitations of GA-NTK and propose some workarounds to make GA-NTK more practical. ",

Utilizing this information to motion estimation is challenging due to unstable and phantom measurements, which result in a high rate of outliers. We introduce a credible and robust probabilistic approach to estimate the ego-motion based on these challenging radar measurements; intended to be used within a loosely-coupled sensor fusion framework.

    "abstract": "Video anomaly detection refers to the identification of events that deviate from the expected behavior. Due to the lack of anomalous samples in training, video anomaly detection becomes a very challenging task. Existing methods almost follow a reconstruction or future frame prediction mode. However, these methods ignore the consistency between appearance and motion information of samples, which limits their anomaly detection performance. Anomalies only occur in the moving foreground of surveillance videos, so the semantics expressed by video frame sequences and optical flow without background information in anomaly detection should be highly consistent and significant for anomaly detection. Based on this idea, we propose Appearance-Motion Semantics Representation Consistency (AMSRC), a framework that uses normal data's appearance and motion semantic representation consistency to handle anomaly detection. Firstly, we design a two-stream encoder to encode the appearance and motion information representations of normal samples and introduce constraints to further enhance the consistency of the feature semantics between appearance and motion information of normal samples so that abnormal samples with low consistency appearance and motion feature representation can be identified. Moreover, the lower consistency of appearance and motion features of anomalous samples can be used to generate predicted frames with larger reconstruction error, which makes anomalies easier to spot. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. ",

Detection of an ongoing attack that escapes standard protection such as firewall, anti-virus, and host/network intrusion detection has gained importance as such attacks eventually affect the physical dynamics of the system. Therefore, anomaly detection in physical dynamics proves an effective means to implement defense-in-depth. PASAD is one example of anomaly detection in the sensor/actuator data, representing such systems' physical dynamics. We present EPASAD, which improves the detection technique used in PASAD to detect these micro-stealthy attacks, as our experiments show that PASAD's spherical boundary-based detection fails to detect. Our method EPASAD overcomes this by using Ellipsoid boundaries, thereby tightening the boundaries in various dimensions, whereas a spherical boundary treats all dimensions equally. We validate EPASAD using the dataset produced by the TE-process simulator and the C-town datasets. The results show that EPASAD improves PASAD's average recall by 5.8% and 9.5% for the two datasets, respectively. ",

    "abstract": "How do masked language models (MLMs) such as BERT learn contextual representations? In this work, we analyze the learning dynamics of MLMs. We find that MLMs adopt sampled embeddings as anchors to estimate and inject contextual semantics to representations, which limits the efficiency and effectiveness of MLMs. To address these issues, we propose TACO, a simple yet effective representation learning approach to directly model global semantics. TACO extracts and aligns contextual semantics hidden in contextualized representations to encourage models to attend global semantics when generating contextualized representations. Experiments on the GLUE benchmark show that TACO achieves up to 5x speedup and up to 1.2 points average improvement over existing MLMs. The code is available at https://github.com/FUZHIYI/TACO. ",

    "abstract": "Over the last few years, deep learning has grown in popularity for speaker verification, identification, and diarization. Inarguably, a significant part of this success is due to the demonstrated effectiveness of their speaker representations. These, however, are heavily dependent on large amounts of annotated data and can be sensitive to new domains. This study proposes an entirely unsupervised deep-learning model for speaker diarization. Specifically, the study focuses on generating high-quality neural speaker representations without any annotated data, as well as on estimating secondary hyperparameters of the model without annotations. The speaker embeddings are represented by an encoder trained in a self-supervised fashion using pairs of adjacent segments assumed to be of the same speaker. The trained encoder model is then used to self-generate pseudo-labels to subsequently train a similarity score between different segments of the same call using probabilistic linear discriminant analysis (PLDA) and further to learn a clustering stopping threshold. We compared our model to state-of-the-art unsupervised as well as supervised baselines on the CallHome benchmarks. According to empirical results, our approach outperforms unsupervised methods when only two speakers are present in the call, and is only slightly worse than recent supervised models. ",

Multi-robot systems are particularly well suited to this application, as recent work has shown the effectiveness of these systems in related areas such as perimeter defense and surveillance. When designing a defender policy that guarantees the defense of a path, information about the adversary and the environment can be helpful and may reduce the number of resources required by the defender to achieve a sufficient level of security. In this work, we characterize the necessary and sufficient number of assets needed to guarantee the defense of a shortest path between two nodes in dDAB games when the defender can only detect assets within $k$-hops of a shortest path. By characterizing the relationship between sensing horizon and required resources, we show that increasing the sensing capability of the defender greatly reduces the number of defender assets needed to defend the path.

Low-resolution peripheral field provides coarse scene exploration to direct the eye to focus to a highly resolved fovea region for sharp imaging. Among 3D computer vision techniques, Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) is currently considered at the industrial level for robotic vision. LiDAR is an imaging technique that monitors pulses of light at optical frequencies to sense the space and to recover three-dimensional ranging information. Notwithstanding the efforts on LiDAR integration and optimization, commercially available devices have slow frame rate and low image resolution, notably limited by the performance of mechanical or slow solid-state deflection systems. Metasurfaces (MS) are versatile optical components that can distribute the optical power in desired regions of space. Here, we report on an advanced LiDAR technology that uses ultrafast low FoV deflectors cascaded with large area metasurfaces to achieve large FoV and simultaneous peripheral and central imaging zones. This technology achieves MHz frame rate for 2D imaging, and up to KHz for 3D imaging, with extremely large FoV (up to 150{\\deg}deg. on both vertical and horizontal scanning axes). The use of this disruptive LiDAR technology with advanced learning algorithms offers perspectives to improve further the perception capabilities and decision-making process of autonomous vehicles and robotic systems.

Deep learning models are used to minimize the number of polyps that goes unnoticed by the experts, and to accurately segment the detected polyps during these interventions. Although these models perform well on these tasks, they require too many parameters, which can pose a problem with real-time applications. To address this problem, we propose a novel segmentation model called PlutoNet which requires only 2,626,337 parameters while outperforming state-of-the-art models on multiple medical image segmentation tasks. We use EfficientNetB0 architecture as a backbone and propose the novel modified partial decoder, which is a combination of partial decoder and full scale connections, which further reduces the number of parameters required, as well as captures semantic details. We use asymmetric convolutions to handle varying polyp sizes. Finally, we weight each feature map to improve segmentation by using a squeeze and excitation block. In addition to polyp segmentation in colonoscopy, we tested our model on segmentation of nuclei and surgical instruments to demonstrate its generalizability to different medical image segmentation tasks. Our model outperformed the state-of-the-art models with a Dice score of %92.3 in CVC-ClinicDB dataset and %89.3 in EndoScene dataset, a Dice score of %91.93 on the 2018 Data Science Bowl Challenge dataset, and a Dice score of %94.8 on Kvasir-Instrument dataset.

The reconstruction process can be an ill-conditioned inverse problem, requiring regularization to obtain satisfactory reconstructions. Recently, deep learning has been adopted for tomographic reconstruction. Unlike iterative algorithms which require a distribution that is known a priori, deep reconstruction networks can learn a prior distribution through sampling the training distributions. In this work, we develop a Physics-assisted Generative Adversarial Network (PGAN), a two-step algorithm for tomographic reconstruction. In contrast to previous efforts, our PGAN utilizes maximum-likelihood estimates derived from the measurements to regularize the reconstruction with both known physics and the learned prior. Synthetic objects with spatial correlations are integrated circuits (IC) from a proposed model CircuitFaker. Compared with maximum-likelihood estimation, PGAN can reduce the photon requirement with limited projection angles to achieve a given error rate. We further attribute the improvement to the learned prior by reconstructing objects created without spatial correlations. The advantages of using a prior from deep learning in X-ray tomography may further enable low-photon nanoscale imaging. ",

However, deep learning models are data-driven methods, which often require a large amount of data as the training support. Data augmentation, as the strategy of expanding dataset, can improve the generalization of the deep learning models and thus improve the accuracy of the models to a certain extent. In this paper, for AMR of radio signals, we propose a data augmentation strategy based on mixing signals and consider four specific methods (Random Mixing, Maximum-Similarity-Mixing, $\\theta-$Similarity Mixing and n-times Random Mixing) to achieve data augmentation. Experiments show that our proposed method can improve the classification accuracy of deep learning based AMR models in the full public dataset RML2016.10a.

Although previous proof-of-concept studies have validated the effectiveness of Personal VAD, there are still several critical challenges to address before this model can be used in production: first, the quality must be satisfactory in both enrollment and enrollment-less scenarios; second, it should operate in a streaming fashion; and finally, the model size should be small enough to fit a limited latency and CPU/Memory budget. To meet the multi-faceted requirements, we propose a series of novel designs: 1) advanced speaker embedding modulation methods; 2) a new training paradigm to generalize to enrollment-less conditions; 3) architecture and runtime optimizations for latency and resource restrictions. Extensive experiments on a realistic speech recognition system demonstrated the state-of-the-art performance of our proposed method. ",

Building on our previous work that used representation learning to classify and detect adversarial attacks, we propose an improvement to it using AdvEst, a method to estimate adversarial perturbation. First, we prove our claim that training the representation learning network using adversarial perturbations as opposed to adversarial examples (consisting of the combination of clean signal and adversarial perturbation) is beneficial because it eliminates nuisance information. At inference time, we use a time-domain denoiser to estimate the adversarial perturbations from adversarial examples. Using our improved representation learning approach to obtain attack embeddings (signatures), we evaluate their performance for three applications: known attack classification, attack verification, and unknown attack detection. We show that common attacks in the literature (Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM), Projected Gradient Descent (PGD), Carlini-Wagner (CW) with different Lp threat models) can be classified with an accuracy of ~96%. We also detect unknown attacks with an equal error rate (EER) of ~9%, which is absolute improvement of ~12% from our previous work. ",

Fever, dry cough, and tiredness are the most typical COVID-19 symptoms. Aches, pains, and difficulty breathing are some of the other symptoms that patients may face. The majority of these symptoms are indicators of respiratory infections and lung abnormalities, which radiologists can identify. Chest x-rays of COVID-19 patients seem similar, with patchy and hazy lungs rather than clear and healthy lungs. On x-rays, however, pneumonia and other chronic lung disorders can resemble COVID-19. Trained radiologists must be able to distinguish between COVID-19 and an illness that is less contagious. Our AI algorithm seeks to give doctors a quantitative estimate of the risk of deterioration. So that patients at high risk of deterioration can be triaged and treated efficiently.

Our evaluation shows denoiser pre-processor (trained on offline adversarial examples) fails to defend against adaptive white-box attacks. However, adversarially fine-tuning the denoiser using a tandem model of denoiser and ASR offers more robustness. We evaluate two variants of this defense--one updating parameters of both models and the second keeping ASR frozen.

Experiments on an English database of Cerebral Palsy patients, using all available utterances per speaker, show high and significant correlation values (R = -0.9) with subjective intelligibility measures, while having only minimal deviation (+-0.01) across four different reference speaker pairs. We also demonstrate the robustness of the proposed method (R = -0.89 deviating +-0.02 over 1000 iterations) by considering a significantly smaller amount of utterances per speaker.

We construct a simple and computationally efficient map that achieves this task with high probability: we first apply a specific structured random matrix, which we call the double circulant matrix; using that matrix requires little storage and matrix-vector multiplication can be performed in near-linear time. We then binarize each vector by comparing each of its entries to a random threshold, selected uniformly at random from a well-chosen interval. We estimate the number of bits required for this encoding scheme in terms of two natural geometric complexity parameters of the set -- its Euclidean covering numbers and its localized Gaussian complexity. The estimate we derive turns out to be the best that one can hope for -- up to logarithmic terms. The key to the proof is a phenomenon of independent interest: we show that the double circulant matrix mimics the behavior of a Gaussian matrix in two important ways. First, it yields an almost isometric embedding of any subset of $\\ell_2^n$ into $\\ell_1^m$ and, second, it maps an arbitrary set in $\\mathbb{R}^n$ into a set of well-spread vectors. ",

We find that shortest paths in large real networks, such as the network of protein-protein interactions (PPI) and the Internet at the autonomous system (AS) level, are not random but are organized according to latent-geometric rules. If nodes of these networks are mapped to points in latent hyperbolic spaces, shortest paths in them align along geodesic curves connecting endpoint nodes. We find that this alignment is sufficiently strong to allow for the identification of shortest path nodes even in the case of substantially incomplete networks. We demonstrate the utility of latent-geometric path-finding in problems of cellular pathway reconstruction and communication security. ",

In this framework various data augmentation techniques are usually exploited to help enforce desired invariances within the learned representations, improving performance on various audio tasks thanks to more robust embeddings. Now, selecting the most relevant augmentations has proven crucial for better downstream performances. Thus, this work introduces a conditional independance-based method which allows for automatically selecting a suitable distribution on the choice of augmentations and their parametrization from a set of predefined ones, for contrastive self-supervised pre-training. This is performed with respect to a downstream task of interest, hence saving a costly hyper-parameter search. Experiments performed on two different downstream tasks validate the proposed approach showing better results than experimenting without augmentation or with baseline augmentations. We furthermore conduct a qualitative analysis of the automatically selected augmentations and their variation according to the considered final downstream dataset. ",
