    "abstract": "Since ancient times, what Chinese people have been pursuing is very simple, which is nothing more than \"to live and work happily, to eat and dress comfortable\". Today, more than 40 years after the reform and opening, people have basically solved the problem of food and clothing, and the urgent problem is housing. Nowadays, due to the storm of long-term rental apartment intermediary platforms such as eggshell, increasing the sense of insecurity of renters, as well as the urbanization in recent years and the scramble for people in major cities, this will make the future real estate market competition more intense. In order to better grasp the real estate price, let consumers buy a house reasonably, and provide a reference for the government to formulate policies, this paper summarizes the existing methods of house price prediction and proposes a house price prediction method based on mixed depth vision and text features.

In this work, we take a closer look at existing poisoning attacks and connect them with old and new algorithms for solving sequential Stackelberg games. By choosing an appropriate loss function for the attacker and optimizing with algorithms that exploit second-order information, we design poisoning attacks that are effective on neural networks. We present efficient implementations that exploit modern auto-differentiation packages and allow simultaneous and coordinated generation of tens of thousands of poisoned points, in contrast to existing methods that generate poisoned points one by one. We further perform extensive experiments that empirically explore the effect of data poisoning attacks on deep neural networks. ",

Moreover, modelling top-down attention is generally reduced to the integration of semantic features without incorporating the signal of a high-level visual tasks that have shown to partially guide human attention. We propose the Neural Visual Attention (NeVA) algorithm to generate visual scanpaths in a top-down manner. With our method, we explore the ability of neural networks on which we impose the biological constraints of foveated vision to generate human-like scanpaths. Thereby, the scanpaths are generated to maximize the performance with respect to the underlying visual task (i.e., classification or reconstruction). Extensive experiments show that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised human attention models in terms of similarity to human scanpaths. Additionally, the flexibility of the framework allows to quantitatively investigate the role of different tasks in the generated visual behaviours. Finally, we demonstrate the superiority of the approach in a novel experiment that investigates the utility of scanpaths in real-world applications, where imperfect viewing conditions are given. ",

In this paper, we consider risk-sensitive HCA that limits the risk of network constraint violations with a collection of scenarios of solar irradiance and nodal power demands, where risk is modeled via the conditional value at risk (CVaR) measure. First, we consider the question of maximizing aggregate installed solar capacities, subject to risk constraints and solve it as a second-order cone program (SOCP) with a standard conic relaxation of the feasible set with power flow equations. Second, we design an incremental algorithm to decide whether a configuration of solar installations has acceptable risk of constraint violations, modeled via CVaR. The algorithm circumvents explicit risk computation by incrementally constructing inner and outer polyhedral approximations of the set of acceptable solar installation configurations from prior such tests conducted. Our numerical examples study the impact of risk parameters, the number of scenarios and the scalability of our framework. ",

    "abstract": "Industrial Control Systems (ICSs) rely on insecure protocols and devices to monitor and operate critical infrastructure. Prior work has demonstrated that powerful attackers with detailed system knowledge can manipulate exchanged sensor data to deteriorate performance of the process, even leading to full shutdowns of plants. Identifying those attacks requires iterating over all possible sensor values, and running detailed system simulation or analysis to identify optimal attacks. That setup allows adversaries to identify attacks that are most impactful when applied on the system for the first time, before the system operators become aware of the manipulations. In this work, we investigate if constrained attackers without detailed system knowledge and simulators can identify comparable attacks. In particular, the attacker only requires abstract knowledge on general information flow in the plant, instead of precise algorithms, operating parameters, process models, or simulators. We propose an approach that allows single-shot attacks, i.e., near-optimal attacks that are reliably shutting down a system on the first try. The approach is applied and validated on two use cases, and demonstrated to achieve comparable results to prior work, which relied on detailed system information and simulations. ",

We show that nontrivial algorithms are still possible. We first give a randomized algorithm for the $L_1$-heavy hitters problem that outperforms the optimal deterministic Misra-Gries algorithm on long streams. If the white-box adversary is computationally bounded, we use cryptographic techniques to reduce the memory of our $L_1$-heavy hitters algorithm even further and to design a number of additional algorithms for graph, string, and linear algebra problems. The existence of such algorithms is surprising, as the streaming algorithm does not even have a secret key in this model, i.e., its state is entirely known to the adversary. One algorithm we design is for estimating the number of distinct elements in a stream with insertions and deletions achieving a multiplicative approximation and sublinear space; such an algorithm is impossible for deterministic algorithms. We also give a general technique that translates any two-player deterministic communication lower bound to a lower bound for {\\it randomized} algorithms robust to a white-box adversary. In particular, our results show that for all $p\\ge 0$, there exists a constant $C_p>1$ such that any $C_p$-approximation algorithm for $F_p$ moment estimation in insertion-only streams with a white-box adversary requires $\\Omega(n)$ space for a universe of size $n$. Similarly, there is a constant $C>1$ such that any $C$-approximation algorithm in an insertion-only stream for matrix rank requires $\\Omega(n)$ space with a white-box adversary. Our algorithmic results based on cryptography thus show a separation between computationally bounded and unbounded adversaries. (Abstract shortened to meet arXiv limits.) ",

    "abstract": "Silicon-photonic neural networks (SPNNs) have emerged as promising successors to electronic artificial intelligence (AI) accelerators by offering orders of magnitude lower latency and higher energy efficiency. Nevertheless, the underlying silicon photonic devices in SPNNs are sensitive to inevitable fabrication-process variations (FPVs) stemming from optical lithography imperfections. Consequently, the inferencing accuracy in an SPNN can be highly impacted by FPVs -- e.g., can drop to below 10% -- the impact of which is yet to be fully studied. In this paper, we, for the first time, model and explore the impact of FPVs in the waveguide width and silicon-on-insulator (SOI) thickness in coherent SPNNs that use Mach-Zehnder Interferometers (MZIs). Leveraging such models, we propose a novel variation-aware, design-time optimization solution to improve MZI tolerance to different FPVs in SPNNs. Simulation results for two example SPNNs of different scales under realistic and correlated FPVs indicate that the optimized MZIs can improve the inferencing accuracy by up to 93.95% for the MNIST handwritten digit dataset -- considered as an example in this paper -- which corresponds to a <0.5% accuracy loss compared to the variation-free case. The proposed one-time optimization method imposes low area overhead, and hence is applicable even to resource-constrained designs ",

Our analysis shows that gender representations consist of several prominent components that are shared across languages, alongside language-specific components.

However, machine learning (ML) models often suffer from low performance in predicting unexpected data and are vulnerable to accidental or malicious perturbations. Although robustness testing of deep learning models has been extensively explored in applications such as image classification and speech recognition, less attention has been paid to ML-driven safety monitoring in CPS. This paper presents the preliminary results on evaluating the robustness of ML-based anomaly detection methods in safety-critical CPS against two types of accidental and malicious input perturbations, generated using a Gaussian-based noise model and the Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM). We test the hypothesis of whether integrating the domain knowledge (e.g., on unsafe system behavior) with the ML models can improve the robustness of anomaly detection without sacrificing accuracy and transparency. Experimental results with two case studies of Artificial Pancreas Systems (APS) for diabetes management show that ML-based safety monitors trained with domain knowledge can reduce on average up to 54.2% of robustness error and keep the average F1 scores high while improving transparency.

We integrate the standard ResLogit model into COnsistent RAnk Logits (CORAL) framework, classified as a binary classification algorithm, to develop a fully interpretable deep learning-based ordinal regression model. As the formulation of the Ordinal-ResLogit model enjoys the Residual Neural Networks concept, our proposed model addresses the main constraint of machine learning algorithms, known as black-box. Moreover, the Ordinal-ResLogit model, as a binary classification framework for ordinal data, guarantees consistency among binary classifiers. We showed that the resulting formulation is able to capture underlying unobserved heterogeneity from the data as well as being an interpretable deep learning-based model. Formulations for market share, substitution patterns, and elasticities are derived. We compare the performance of the Ordinal-ResLogit model with an Ordered Logit Model using a stated preference (SP) dataset on pedestrian wait time and a revealed preference (RP) dataset on travel distance. Our results show that Ordinal-ResLogit outperforms the traditional ordinal regression model for both datasets. Furthermore, the results obtained from the Ordinal-ResLogit RP model show that travel attributes such as driving and transit cost have significant effects on choosing the location of non-mandatory trips. In terms of the Ordinal-ResLogit SP model, our results highlight that the road-related variables and traffic condition are contributing factors in the prediction of pedestrian waiting time such that the mixed traffic condition significantly increases the probability of choosing longer waiting times.

Focusing on this problem, we propose a novel interventional multi-instance learning (IMIL) framework to achieve deconfounded instance-level prediction.

This paper presents a medical conversational question answering (CQA) system based on the multi-modal knowledge graph, namely \"LingYi\", which is designed as a pipeline framework to maintain high flexibility. Our system utilizes automated medical procedures including medical triage, consultation, image-text drug recommendation and record. To conduct knowledge-grounded dialogues with patients, we first construct a Chinese Medical Multi-Modal Knowledge Graph (CM3KG) and collect a large-scale Chinese Medical CQA (CMCQA) dataset. Compared with the other existing medical question-answering systems, our system adopts several state-of-the-art technologies including medical entity disambiguation and medical dialogue generation, which is more friendly to provide medical services to patients. In addition, we have open-sourced our codes which contain back-end models and front-end web pages at https://github.com/WENGSYX/LingYi. The datasets including CM3KG at https://github.com/WENGSYX/CM3KG and CMCQA at https://github.com/WENGSYX/CMCQA are also released to further promote future research. ",

    "abstract": "Self-supervised learning in speech involves training a speech representation network on a large-scale unannotated speech corpus, and then applying the learned representations to downstream tasks. Since the majority of the downstream tasks of SSL learning in speech largely focus on the content information in speech, the most desirable speech representations should be able to disentangle unwanted variations, such as speaker variations, from the content. However, disentangling speakers is very challenging, because removing the speaker information could easily result in a loss of content as well, and the damage of the latter usually far outweighs the benefit of the former. In this paper, we propose a new SSL method that can achieve speaker disentanglement without severe loss of content. Our approach is adapted from the HuBERT framework, and incorporates disentangling mechanisms to regularize both the teacher labels and the learned representations. We evaluate the benefit of speaker disentanglement on a set of content-related downstream tasks, and observe a consistent and notable performance advantage of our speaker-disentangled representations.

    "title": "Estimating probabilistic dynamic origin-destination demands using  multi-day traffic data on computational graphs",
    "abstract": "System-level decision making in transportation needs to understand day-to-day variation of network flows, which calls for accurate modeling and estimation of probabilistic dynamic travel demand on networks. Most existing studies estimate deterministic dynamic origin-destination (OD) demand, while the day-to-day variation of demand and flow is overlooked. Estimating probabilistic distributions of dynamic OD demand is challenging due to the complexity of the spatio-temporal networks and the computational intensity of the high-dimensional problems. With the availability of massive traffic data and the emergence of advanced computational methods, this paper develops a data-driven framework that solves the probabilistic dynamic origin-destination demand estimation (PDODE) problem using multi-day data. Different statistical distances (e.g., lp-norm, Wasserstein distance, KL divergence, Bhattacharyya distance) are used and compared to measure the gap between the estimated and the observed traffic conditions, and it is found that 2-Wasserstein distance achieves a balanced accuracy in estimating both mean and standard deviation. The proposed framework is cast into the computational graph and a reparametrization trick is developed to estimate the mean and standard deviation of the probabilistic dynamic OD demand simultaneously. We demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed PDODE framework on both small and real-world networks. In particular, it is demonstrated that the proposed PDODE framework can mitigate the overfitting issues by considering the demand variation. Overall, the developed PDODE framework provides a practical tool for public agencies to understand the sources of demand stochasticity, evaluate day-to-day variation of network flow, and make reliable decisions for intelligent transportation systems.

    "abstract": "Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) is the main instrument utilized for the detection of oil slicks on the ocean surface. In SAR images, some areas affected by ocean phenomena, such as rain cells, upwellings, and internal waves, or discharge from oil spills appear as dark spots on images. Dark spot detection is the first step in the detection of oil spills, which then become oil slick candidates. The accuracy of dark spot segmentation ultimately affects the accuracy of oil slick identification. Although some advanced deep learning methods that use pixels as processing units perform well in remote sensing image semantic segmentation, detecting some dark spots with weak boundaries from noisy SAR images remains a huge challenge. We propose a dark spot detection method based on superpixels deeper graph convolutional networks (SGDCN) in this paper, which takes the superpixels as the processing units and extracts features for each superpixel. The features calculated from superpixel regions are more robust than those from fixed pixel neighborhoods. To reduce the difficulty of learning tasks, we discard irrelevant features and obtain an optimal subset of features. After superpixel segmentation, the images are transformed into graphs with superpixels as nodes, which are fed into the deeper graph convolutional neural network for node classification. This graph neural network uses a differentiable aggregation function to aggregate the features of nodes and neighbors to form more advanced features. It is the first time using it for dark spot detection. To validate our method, we mark all dark spots on six SAR images covering the Baltic Sea and construct a dark spots detection dataset, which has been made publicly available (https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/12UavrntkDSPrItISQ8iGefXn2gIZHxJ6?usp=sharing). The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed SGDCN is robust and effective. ",

    "abstract": "One fundamental problem in temporal graph analysis is to count the occurrences of small connected subgraph patterns (i.e., motifs), which benefits a broad range of real-world applications, such as anomaly detection, structure prediction, and network representation learning. However, existing works focused on exacting temporal motif are not scalable to large-scale temporal graph data, due to their heavy computational costs or inherent inadequacy of parallelism. In this work, we propose a scalable parallel framework for exactly counting temporal motifs in large-scale temporal graphs. We first categorize the temporal motifs based on their distinct properties, and then design customized algorithms that offer efficient strategies to exactly count the motif instances of each category. Moreover, our compact data structures, namely triple and quadruple counters, enable our algorithms to directly identify the temporal motif instances of each category, according to edge information and the relationship between edges, therefore significantly improving the counting efficiency. Based on the proposed counting algorithms, we design a hierarchical parallel framework that features both inter- and intra-node parallel strategies, and fully leverages the multi-threading capacity of modern CPU to concurrently count all temporal motifs. Extensive experiments on sixteen real-world temporal graph datasets demonstrate the superiority and capability of our proposed framework for temporal motif counting, achieving up to 538* speedup compared to the state-of-the-art methods.

    "abstract": "Non-autoregressive (NAR) generation, which is first proposed in neural machine translation (NMT) to speed up inference, has attracted much attention in both machine learning and natural language processing communities. While NAR generation can significantly accelerate inference speed for machine translation, the speedup comes at the cost of sacrificed translation accuracy compared to its counterpart, auto-regressive (AR) generation. In recent years, many new models and algorithms have been designed/proposed to bridge the accuracy gap between NAR generation and AR generation. In this paper, we conduct a systematic survey with comparisons and discussions of various non-autoregressive translation (NAT) models from different aspects. Specifically, we categorize the efforts of NAT into several groups, including data manipulation, modeling methods, training criterion, decoding algorithms, and the benefit from pre-trained models. Furthermore, we briefly review other applications of NAR models beyond machine translation, such as dialogue generation, text summarization, grammar error correction, semantic parsing, speech synthesis, and automatic speech recognition. In addition, we also discuss potential directions for future exploration, including releasing the dependency of KD, dynamic length prediction, pre-training for NAR, and wider applications, etc. We hope this survey can help researchers capture the latest progress in NAR generation, inspire the design of advanced NAR models and algorithms, and enable industry practitioners to choose appropriate solutions for their applications.

Similar to traditional decision-making programs, neural networks can have defects that need to be repaired. The defects may cause unsafe behaviors, raise security concerns or unjust societal impacts. In this work, we address the problem of repairing a neural network for desirable properties such as fairness and the absence of backdoor. The goal is to construct a neural network that satisfies the property by (minimally) adjusting the given neural network's parameters (i.e., weights). Specifically, we propose CARE (\\textbf{CA}usality-based \\textbf{RE}pair), a causality-based neural network repair technique that 1) performs causality-based fault localization to identify the `guilty' neurons and 2) optimizes the parameters of the identified neurons to reduce the misbehavior. We have empirically evaluated CARE on various tasks such as backdoor removal, neural network repair for fairness and safety properties. Our experiment results show that CARE is able to repair all neural networks efficiently and effectively. For fairness repair tasks, CARE successfully improves fairness by $61.91\\%$ on average. For backdoor removal tasks, CARE reduces the attack success rate from over $98\\%$ to less than $1\\%$. For safety property repair tasks, CARE reduces the property violation rate to less than $1\\%$. Results also show that thanks to the causality-based fault localization, CARE's repair focuses on the misbehavior and preserves the accuracy of the neural networks. ",

Existing HOI transformers either adopt a single decoder for triplet prediction, or utilize two parallel decoders to detect individual objects and interactions separately, and compose triplets by a matching process. In contrast, we decouple the triplet prediction into human-object pair detection and interaction classification. Our main motivation is that detecting the human-object instances and classifying interactions accurately needs to learn representations that focus on different regions. To this end, we present Disentangled Transformer, where both encoder and decoder are disentangled to facilitate learning of two sub-tasks. To associate the predictions of disentangled decoders, we first generate a unified representation for HOI triplets with a base decoder, and then utilize it as input feature of each disentangled decoder. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms prior work on two public HOI benchmarks by a sizeable margin. Code will be available. ",

We present a rigorous theoretical understanding of the effects of graph convolutions in multi-layer networks. We study these effects through the node classification problem of a non-linearly separable Gaussian mixture model coupled with a stochastic block model. First, we show that a single graph convolution expands the regime of the distance between the means where multi-layer networks can classify the data by a factor of at least $1/\\sqrt[4]{\\mathbb{E}{\\rm deg}}$, where $\\mathbb{E}{\\rm deg}$ denotes the expected degree of a node. Second, we show that with a slightly stronger graph density, two graph convolutions improve this factor to at least $1/\\sqrt[4]{n}$, where $n$ is the number of nodes in the graph. Finally, we provide both theoretical and empirical insights into the performance of graph convolutions placed in different combinations among the layers of a network, concluding that the performance is mutually similar for all combinations of the placement.

The strategy is based on requiring residential customers to limit their demand for a certain amount of time in exchange for economic benefits. The main novelty of the method consists of combining a thorough representation of the network physics with advanced constraints that ensure the comfort of residential users, in a scalable manner that suits real systems. The mitigation strategy is presented from a DSO perspective, and takes the form of contracts between users and system operator. The focus on user comfort aims to make the contracts appealing, encouraging users to voluntarily enroll in the proposed mitigation scheme. The presented solution is implemented as a mixed-integer multi-period optimal power flow problem which relies on a linearized three-phase power flow formulation. Calculations on 100 real-life distribution feeders are performed, to analyze the congestion-relieving potential of several possible system operator-user contracts. From a planning perspective, the results can help the system operator define contractual terms that make a specific congestion mitigation scheme effective and viable. From an operational perspective, the same calculations can be used to optimally schedule power reduction on a day-ahead basis. ",

Most research considers learning representations from single images, ignoring any potential interactions between them. However, due to the high intra-identity variations, ignoring such interactions typically leads to outlier features. To tackle this issue, we propose a Neighbor Transformer Network, or NFormer, which explicitly models interactions across all input images, thus suppressing outlier features and leading to more robust representations overall. As modelling interactions between enormous amount of images is a massive task with lots of distractors, NFormer introduces two novel modules, the Landmark Agent Attention, and the Reciprocal Neighbor Softmax. Specifically, the Landmark Agent Attention efficiently models the relation map between images by a low-rank factorization with a few landmarks in feature space. Moreover, the Reciprocal Neighbor Softmax achieves sparse attention to relevant -- rather than all -- neighbors only, which alleviates interference of irrelevant representations and further relieves the computational burden. In experiments on four large-scale datasets, NFormer achieves a new state-of-the-art. The code is released at \\url{https://github.com/haochenheheda/NFormer}. ",

Since these measurements are often gathered once and then used repeatedly, the number of collected samples will have a significant impact on the reliability of algorithm comparisons. We show that care should be taken when making decisions based on limited data. Particularly, we show that the number of runs used in many benchmarking studies, e.g., the default value of 15 suggested by the COCO environment, can be insufficient to reliably rank algorithms on well-known numerical optimization benchmarks. Additionally, methods for automated algorithm configuration are sensitive to insufficient sample sizes. This may result in the configurator choosing a `lucky' but poor-performing configuration despite exploring better ones. We show that relying on mean performance values, as many configurators do, can require a large number of runs to provide accurate comparisons between the considered configurations. Common statistical tests can greatly improve the situation in most cases but not always. We show examples of performance losses of more than 20%, even when using statistical races to dynamically adjust the number of runs, as done by irace. Our results underline the importance of appropriately considering the statistical distribution of performance values. ",

If self-supervised learning can be distinguished into two subcategories, generative and contrastive, then most existing studies show that sentence representation learning may more benefit from the contrastive methods but not the generative methods. However, contrastive learning cannot be well compatible with the common token-level generative self-supervised learning, and does not guarantee good performance on downstream semantic retrieval tasks. Thus, to alleviate such obvious inconveniences, we instead propose a novel generative self-supervised learning objective based on phrase reconstruction. Empirical studies show that our generative learning may yield powerful enough sentence representation and achieve performance in Sentence Textual Similarity (STS) tasks on par with contrastive learning. Further, in terms of unsupervised setting, our generative method outperforms previous state-of-the-art SimCSE on the benchmark of downstream semantic retrieval tasks. ",

We create the first Chinese dataset containing 3,103 posts about complaints from Weibo, a popular Chinese social media platform. These posts are then annotated with complaints intensity scores using Best-Worst Scaling (BWS) method. We show that complaints intensity can be accurately estimated by computational models with the best mean square error achieving 0.11. Furthermore, we conduct a comprehensive linguistic analysis around complaints, including the connections between complaints and sentiment, and a cross-lingual comparison for complaints expressions used by Chinese and English speakers. We finally show that our complaints intensity scores can be incorporated for better estimating the popularity of posts on social media. ",

    "abstract": "The variational autoencoder (VAE) is a popular deep latent variable model used to analyse high-dimensional datasets by learning a low-dimensional latent representation of the data. It simultaneously learns a generative model and an inference network to perform approximate posterior inference. Recently proposed extensions to VAEs that can handle temporal and longitudinal data have applications in healthcare, behavioural modelling, and predictive maintenance. However, these extensions do not account for heterogeneous data (i.e., data comprising of continuous and discrete attributes), which is common in many real-life applications. In this work, we propose the heterogeneous longitudinal VAE (HL-VAE) that extends the existing temporal and longitudinal VAEs to heterogeneous data. HL-VAE provides efficient inference for high-dimensional datasets and includes likelihood models for continuous, count, categorical, and ordinal data while accounting for missing observations. We demonstrate our model's efficacy through simulated as well as clinical datasets, and show that our proposed model achieves competitive performance in missing value imputation and predictive accuracy.

We present an empirical investigation into the extent of the personal information encoded into pre-trained representations by a range of popular models, and we show a positive correlation between the complexity of a model, the amount of data used in pre-training, and data leakage. In this paper, we present the first wide coverage evaluation and comparison of some of the most popular privacy-preserving algorithms, on a large, multi-lingual dataset on sentiment analysis annotated with demographic information (location, age and gender). The results show since larger and more complex models are more prone to leaking private information, use of privacy-preserving methods is highly desirable. We also find that highly privacy-preserving technologies like differential privacy (DP) can have serious model utility effects, which can be ameliorated using hybrid or metric-DP techniques. ",

To defend AEs, adversarial training (AT) is believed to be the most effective method while due to the intensive computation, AT is limited to be applied in most applications. In this paper, to resolve the problem, we design a generic and efficient AT improvement scheme, namely case-aware adversarial training (CAT). Specifically, the intuition stems from the fact that a very limited part of informative samples can contribute to most of model performance. Alternatively, if only the most informative AEs are used in AT, we can lower the computation complexity of AT significantly as maintaining the defense effect. To achieve this, CAT achieves two breakthroughs. First, a method to estimate the information degree of adversarial examples is proposed for AE filtering. Second, to further enrich the information that the NN can obtain from AEs, CAT involves a weight estimation and class-level balancing based sampling strategy to increase the diversity of AT at each iteration. Extensive experiments show that CAT is faster than vanilla AT by up to 3x while achieving competitive defense effect. ",

The existing works unrealistically assume the users to exchange energy with any of the users and at every such opportunity. However, due to the users' mobility, the inter-node meetings in such opportunistic mobile networks vary, and P2P energy exchange in such scenarios remains uncertain. Additionally, the social interests and interactions of the users influence their mobility as well as the energy exchange between them. The existing P2P-WPT methods did not consider the joint problem for energy exchange due to user's inevitable mobility, and the influence of sociality on the latter. As a result of computing with imprecise information, the energy balance achieved by these works at a slower rate as well as impaired by energy loss for the crowd. Motivated by this problem scenario, in this work, we present a wireless crowd charging method, namely MoSaBa, which leverages mobility prediction and social information for improved energy balancing. MoSaBa incorporates two dimensions of social information, namely social context and social relationships, as additional features for predicting contact opportunities. In this method, we explore the different pairs of peers such that the energy balancing is achieved at a faster rate as well as the energy balance quality improves in terms of maintaining low energy loss for the crowd. We justify the peer selection method in MoSaBa by detailed performance evaluation. Compared to the existing state-of-the-art, the proposed method achieves better performance trade-offs between energy-efficiency, energy balance quality and convergence time. ",

In this paper, we formulate the RL problem with safety constraints as a non-zero-sum game. While deployed with maximum entropy RL, this formulation leads to a safe adversarially guided soft actor-critic framework, called SAAC. In SAAC, the adversary aims to break the safety constraint while the RL agent aims to maximize the constrained value function given the adversary's policy. The safety constraint on the agent's value function manifests only as a repulsion term between the agent's and the adversary's policies. Unlike previous approaches, SAAC can address different safety criteria such as safe exploration, mean-variance risk sensitivity, and CVaR-like coherent risk sensitivity. We illustrate the design of the adversary for these constraints. Then, in each of these variations, we show the agent differentiates itself from the adversary's unsafe actions in addition to learning to solve the task. Finally, for challenging continuous control tasks, we demonstrate that SAAC achieves faster convergence, better efficiency, and fewer failures to satisfy the safety constraints than risk-averse distributional RL and risk-neutral soft actor-critic algorithms.

To reduce the gap, we propose a large-scale human motion dataset that delivers high-quality body pose sequences, scene scans, as well as ego-centric views with eye gaze that serves as a surrogate for inferring human intent. By employing inertial sensors for motion capture, our data collection is not tied to specific scenes, which further boosts the motion dynamics observed from our subjects. We perform an extensive study of the benefits of leveraging eye gaze for ego-centric human motion prediction with various state-of-the-art architectures. Moreover, to realize the full potential of gaze, we propose a novel network architecture that enables bidirectional communication between the gaze and motion branches. Our network achieves the top performance in human motion prediction on the proposed dataset, thanks to the intent information from the gaze and the denoised gaze feature modulated by the motion.

Nonetheless, the computations performed by most existent SNNs are strictly tied to the combinatorial structure of the complex. Leveraging the success of attention mechanisms in structured domains, we propose Simplicial Attention Networks (SAT), a new type of simplicial network that dynamically weighs the interactions between neighbouring simplicies and can readily adapt to novel structures. Additionally, we propose a signed attention mechanism that makes SAT orientation equivariant, a desirable property for models operating on (co)chain complexes.

On the one hand, the motion-aware attention weights are learned from the spatial states to help aggregate the temporal states in the temporal domain. On the other hand, the appearance-aware attention weights are learned from the temporal states to help aggregate the spatial states in the spatial domain. In this way, the temporal information and the spatial information can be greatly aware of each other in both domains, during which, the spatiotemporal receptive field can also be greatly broadened for more reliable spatiotemporal modeling. Experiments are not only conducted on traditional video prediction tasks but also other tasks beyond video prediction, including the early action recognition and object detection tasks.

    "abstract": "Most action recognition models treat human activities as unitary events. However, human activities often follow a certain hierarchy. In fact, many human activities are compositional. Also, these actions are mostly human-object interactions. In this paper we propose to recognize human action by leveraging the set of interactions that define an action. In this work, we present an end-to-end network: THORN, that can leverage important human-object and object-object interactions to predict actions. This model is built on top of a 3D backbone network. The key components of our model are: 1) An object representation filter for modeling object. 2) An object relation reasoning module to capture object relations. 3) A classification layer to predict the action labels. To show the robustness of THORN, we evaluate it on EPIC-Kitchen55 and EGTEA Gaze+, two of the largest and most challenging first-person and human-object interaction datasets. THORN achieves state-of-the-art performance on both datasets. ",

    "title": "Generalizing to the Future: Mitigating Entity Bias in Fake News  Detection",
    "abstract": "The wide dissemination of fake news is increasingly threatening both individuals and society. Fake news detection aims to train a model on the past news and detect fake news of the future. Though great efforts have been made, existing fake news detection methods overlooked the unintended entity bias in the real-world data, which seriously influences models' generalization ability to future data. For example, 97\\% of news pieces in 2010-2017 containing the entity `Donald Trump' are real in our data, but the percentage falls down to merely 33\\% in 2018. This would lead the model trained on the former set to hardly generalize to the latter, as it tends to predict news pieces about `Donald Trump' as real for lower training loss. In this paper, we propose an entity debiasing framework (\\textbf{ENDEF}) which generalizes fake news detection models to the future data by mitigating entity bias from a cause-effect perspective. Based on the causal graph among entities, news contents, and news veracity, we separately model the contribution of each cause (entities and contents) during training. In the inference stage, we remove the direct effect of the entities to mitigate entity bias. Extensive offline experiments on the English and Chinese datasets demonstrate that the proposed framework can largely improve the performance of base fake news detectors, and online tests verify its superiority in practice. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to explicitly improve the generalization ability of fake news detection models to the future data.

    "abstract": "In this research paper, we study the capability of artificial neural network models to emulate storm surge based on the storm track/size/intensity history, leveraging a database of synthetic storm simulations. Traditionally, Computational Fluid Dynamics solvers are employed to numerically solve the storm surge governing equations that are Partial Differential Equations and are generally very costly to simulate. This study presents a neural network model that can predict storm surge, informed by a database of synthetic storm simulations. This model can serve as a fast and affordable emulator for the very expensive CFD solvers. The neural network model is trained with the storm track parameters used to drive the CFD solvers, and the output of the model is the time-series evolution of the predicted storm surge across multiple nodes within the spatial domain of interest. Once the model is trained, it can be deployed for further predictions based on new storm track inputs. The developed neural network model is a time-series model, a Long short-term memory, a variation of Recurrent Neural Network, which is enriched with Convolutional Neural Networks. The convolutional neural network is employed to capture the correlation of data spatially. Therefore, the temporal and spatial correlations of data are captured by the combination of the mentioned models, the ConvLSTM model. As the problem is a sequence to sequence time-series problem, an encoder-decoder ConvLSTM model is designed. Some other techniques in the process of model training are also employed to enrich the model performance. The results show the proposed convolutional recurrent neural network outperforms the Gaussian Process implementation for the examined synthetic storm database. ",

While the variety of attacks increases, these architectures should become more robust against attacks. They have been proven to be very sensitive to small but well constructed perturbations in the input. Botnet detection requires extremely low false-positive rates (FPR), which are not commonly attainable in contemporary deep learning. Attackers try to increase the FPRs by making poisoned samples. The majority of recent research has focused on the use of model loss functions to build adversarial examples and robust models. In this paper, two LSTM-based classification algorithms for botnet classification with an accuracy higher than 98\\% are presented. Then, the adversarial attack is proposed, which reduces the accuracy to about30\\%. Then, by examining the methods for computing the uncertainty, the defense method is proposed to increase the accuracy to about 70\\%. By using the deep ensemble and stochastic weight averaging quantification methods it has been investigated the uncertainty of the accuracy in the proposed methods. ",

Regarding missing link inference of diverse networks, we revisit the link prediction techniques and identify the importance of both the structural and attribute information. However, the available techniques either heavily count on the network topology which is spurious in practice or cannot integrate graph topology and features properly. To bridge the gap, we propose a bicomponent structural and attribute learning framework (BSAL) that is designed to adaptively leverage information from topology and feature spaces. Specifically, BSAL constructs a semantic topology via the node attributes and then gets the embeddings regarding the semantic view, which provides a flexible and easy-to-implement solution to adaptively incorporate the information carried by the node attributes. Then the semantic embedding together with topology embedding is fused together using an attention mechanism for the final prediction. Extensive experiments show the superior performance of our proposal and it significantly outperforms baselines on diverse research benchmarks. ",

In the face detection system bias due to the dataset is majorly seen. Sometimes models learn only features that are over-represented in data and ignore rare features from data which results in being biased toward those over-represented features. In real life, these biased systems are dangerous to society. The proposed approach uses generative models which are best suited for learning underlying features(latent variables) from the dataset and by using these learned features models try to reduce the threats which are there due to bias in the system.

In addition to model architectures, we explore techniques of data augmentation including Easy Data Augmentation (EDA) and back translation, to create more meaningful variance among the small out-of-domain training data, therefore boosting the performance and robustness of our models. In this paper, we show that our combination of best architecture and data augmentation techniques achieves a 53.477 F1 score in the out-of-domain evaluation, which is a 9.52% performance gain over the baseline.

Although researchers have been studying multiple ways to generate code comments automatically, previous work mainly considers representing a code token in its entirety semantics form only (e.g., a language model is used to learn the semantics of a code token), and additional code properties such as the tree structure of a code are included as an auxiliary input to the model. There are two limitations: 1) Learning the code token in its entirety form may not be able to capture information succinctly in source code, and 2) The code token does not contain additional syntactic information, inherently important in programming languages. In this paper, we present LAnguage Model and Named Entity Recognition (LAMNER), a code comment generator capable of encoding code constructs effectively and capturing the structural property of a code token. A character-level language model is used to learn the semantic representation to encode a code token. For the structural property of a token, a Named Entity Recognition model is trained to learn the different types of code tokens. These representations are then fed into an encoder-decoder architecture to generate code comments. We evaluate the generated comments from LAMNER and other baselines on a popular Java dataset with four commonly used metrics. Our results show that LAMNER is effective and improves over the best baseline model in BLEU-1, BLEU-2, BLEU-3, BLEU-4, ROUGE-L, METEOR, and CIDEr by 14.34%, 18.98%, 21.55%, 23.00%, 10.52%, 1.44%, and 25.86%, respectively.

Current functional magnetic resonance (fMRI) analysis highly relies on prior knowledge of specific patterns in either spatial (e.g., resting-state network) or temporal (e.g., task stimulus) domain. In addition, most approaches aim to find group-wise common functional networks, individual-specific functional networks have been rarely studied. In this work, we propose a novel Twin-Transformers framework to simultaneously infer common and individual functional networks in both spatial and temporal space, in a self-supervised manner. The first transformer takes space-divided information as input and generates spatial features, while the second transformer takes time-related information as input and outputs temporal features. The spatial and temporal features are further separated into common and individual ones via interactions (weights sharing) and constraints between the two transformers. We applied our TwinTransformers to Human Connectome Project (HCP) motor task-fMRI dataset and identified multiple common brain networks, including both task-related and resting-state networks (e.g., default mode network). Interestingly, we also successfully recovered a set of individual-specific networks that are not related to task stimulus and only exist at the individual level. ",

    "abstract": "Machine learning is increasingly used to discover diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers from high-dimensional molecular data. However, a variety of factors related to experimental design may affect the ability to learn generalizable and clinically applicable diagnostics. Here, we argue that a causal perspective improves the identification of these challenges, and formalizes their relation to the robustness and generalization of machine learning-based diagnostics. To make for a concrete discussion, we focus on a specific, recently established high-dimensional biomarker - adaptive immune receptor repertoires (AIRRs). We discuss how the main biological and experimental factors of the AIRR domain may influence the learned biomarkers and provide easily adjustable simulations of such effects. In conclusion, we find that causal modeling improves machine learning-based biomarker robustness by identifying stable relations between variables and by guiding the adjustment of the relations and variables that vary between populations.

    "abstract": "This paper focuses on three critical problems on protein classification. Firstly, Carbohydrate-active enzyme (CAZyme) classification can help people to understand the properties of enzymes. However, one CAZyme may belong to several classes. This leads to Multi-label CAZyme classification. Secondly, to capture information from the secondary structure of protein, protein classification is modeled as graph classification problem. Thirdly, compound-protein interactions prediction employs graph learning for compound with sequential embedding for protein. This can be seen as classification task for compound-protein pairs. This paper proposes three models for protein classification. Firstly, this paper proposes a Multi-label CAZyme classification model using CNN-LSTM with Attention mechanism. Secondly, this paper proposes a variational graph autoencoder based subspace learning model for protein graph classification. Thirdly, this paper proposes graph isomorphism networks (GIN) and Attention-based CNN-LSTM for compound-protein interactions prediction, as well as comparing GIN with graph convolution networks (GCN) and graph attention networks (GAT) in this task. The proposed models are effective for protein classification. Source code and data are available at https://github.com/zshicode/GNN-AttCL-protein. Besides, this repository collects and collates the benchmark datasets with respect to above problems, including CAZyme classification, enzyme protein graph classification, compound-protein interactions prediction, drug-target affinities prediction and drug-drug interactions prediction. Hence, the usage for evaluation by benchmark datasets can be more conveniently. ",

    "abstract": "The approximate uniform sampling of graph realizations with a given degree sequence is an everyday task in several social science, computer science, engineering etc. projects. One approach is using Markov chains. The best available current result about the well-studied switch Markov chain is that it is rapidly mixing on P-stable degree sequences (see DOI:10.1016/j.ejc.2021.103421). The switch Markov chain does not change any degree sequence. However, there are cases where degree intervals are specified rather than a single degree sequence. (A natural scenario where this problem arises is in hypothesis testing on social networks that are only partially observed.) Rechner, Strowick, and M\\\"uller-Hannemann introduced in 2018 the notion of degree interval Markov chain which uses three (separately well-studied) local operations (switch, hinge-flip and toggle), and employing on degree sequence realizations where any two sequences under scrutiny have very small coordinate-wise distance. Recently Amanatidis and Kleer published a beautiful paper (arXiv:2110.09068), showing that the degree interval Markov chain is rapidly mixing if the sequences are coming from a system of very thin intervals which are centered not far from a regular degree sequence. In this paper we extend substantially their result, showing that the degree interval Markov chain is rapidly mixing if the intervals are centred at P-stable degree sequences. ",

In this paper, with the guidance of extensive simulations, we take a broader view and investigate the problems of Quality of Service (QoS) and provisioning in the context of quantum networks, which are very different from their counterparts in classical data networks due to some of their fundamental properties. Our work leads the way towards a new class of studies that will allow the research community to better understand the challenges of quantum networks and their potential commercial exploitation. ",

Hip-fracture risk screening methods based on finite element analysis depend on segmented computed tomography (CT) images; however, current femur segmentation methods require manual delineations of large data sets.

Evaluation on a set of 1147 proximal femurs with ground truth segmentations demonstrates that our method is apt for hip-fracture risk screening, bringing us one step closer to a clinically viable option for screening at-risk patients for hip-fracture susceptibility.

    "abstract": "In the context of epilepsy monitoring, EEG artifacts are often mistaken for seizures due to their morphological similarity in both amplitude and frequency, making seizure detection systems susceptible to higher false alarm rates. In this work we present the implementation of an artifact detection algorithm based on a minimal number of EEG channels on a parallel ultra-low-power (PULP) embedded platform. The analyses are based on the TUH EEG Artifact Corpus dataset and focus on the temporal electrodes. First, we extract optimal feature models in the frequency domain using an automated machine learning framework, achieving a 93.95% accuracy, with a 0.838 F1 score for a 4 temporal EEG channel setup. The achieved accuracy levels surpass state-of-the-art by nearly 20%. Then, these algorithms are parallelized and optimized for a PULP platform, achieving a 5.21 times improvement of energy-efficient compared to state-of-the-art low-power implementations of artifact detection frameworks. Combining this model with a low-power seizure detection algorithm would allow for 300h of continuous monitoring on a 300 mAh battery in a wearable form factor and power budget. These results pave the way for implementing affordable, wearable, long-term epilepsy monitoring solutions with low false-positive rates and high sensitivity, meeting both patients' and caregivers' requirements.

    "abstract": "Forecasting time series data presents an emerging field of data science that has its application ranging from stock price and exchange rate prediction to the early prediction of epidemics. Numerous statistical and machine learning methods have been proposed in the last five decades with the demand for generating high-quality and reliable forecasts. However, in real-life prediction problems, situations exist in which a model based on one of the above paradigms is preferable, and therefore, hybrid solutions are needed to bridge the gap between classical forecasting methods and scalable neural network models. We introduce an interpretable probabilistic autoregressive neural network model for an explainable, scalable, and \"white box-like\" framework that can handle a wide variety of irregular time series data (e.g., nonlinearity and nonstationarity). Sufficient conditions for asymptotic stationarity and geometric ergodicity are obtained by considering the asymptotic behavior of the associated Markov chain. During computational experiments, PARNN outperforms standard statistical, machine learning, and deep learning models on a diverse collection of real-world datasets coming from economics, finance, and epidemiology, to mention a few. Furthermore, the proposed PARNN model improves forecast accuracy significantly for 10 out of 12 datasets compared to state-of-the-art models for short to long-term forecasts. ",
