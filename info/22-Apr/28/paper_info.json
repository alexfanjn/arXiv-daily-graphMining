    "title": "Enhancing Privacy against Inversion Attacks in Federated Learning by  using Mixing Gradients Strategies",
    "abstract": "Federated learning reduces the risk of information leakage, but remains vulnerable to attacks. We investigate how several neural network design decisions can defend against gradients inversion attacks. We show that overlapping gradients provides numerical resistance to gradient inversion on the highly vulnerable dense layer. Specifically, we propose to leverage batching to maximise mixing of gradients by choosing an appropriate loss function and drawing identical labels. We show that otherwise it is possible to directly recover all vectors in a mini-batch without any numerical optimisation due to the de-mixing nature of the cross entropy loss. To accurately assess data recovery, we introduce an absolute variation distance (AVD) metric for information leakage in images, derived from total variation. In contrast to standard metrics, e.g. Mean Squared Error or Structural Similarity Index, AVD offers a continuous metric for extracting information in noisy images. Finally, our empirical results on information recovery from various inversion attacks and training performance supports our defense strategies. These strategies are also shown to be useful for deep convolutional neural networks such as LeNET for image recognition. We hope that this study will help guide the development of further strategies that achieve a trustful federation policy. ",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we explore the problem of deep multi-view subspace clustering framework from an information-theoretic point of view. We extend the traditional information bottleneck principle to learn common information among different views in a self-supervised manner, and accordingly establish a new framework called Self-supervised Information Bottleneck based Multi-view Subspace Clustering (SIB-MSC). Inheriting the advantages from information bottleneck, SIB-MSC can learn a latent space for each view to capture common information among the latent representations of different views by removing superfluous information from the view itself while retaining sufficient information for the latent representations of other views. Actually, the latent representation of each view provides a kind of self-supervised signal for training the latent representations of other views. Moreover, SIB-MSC attempts to learn the other latent space for each view to capture the view-specific information by introducing mutual information based regularization terms, so as to further improve the performance of multi-view subspace clustering. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to explore information bottleneck for multi-view subspace clustering. Extensive experiments on real-world multi-view data demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance over the related state-of-the-art methods. ",

    "abstract": "In head-to-head racing, performing tightly constrained, but highly rewarding maneuvers, such as overtaking, require an accurate model of interactive behavior of the opposing target vehicle (TV). However, such information is not typically made available in competitive scenarios, we therefore propose to construct a prediction and uncertainty model given data of the TV from previous races. In particular, a one-step Gaussian Process (GP) model is trained on closed-loop interaction data to learn the behavior of a TV driven by an unknown policy. Predictions of the nominal trajectory and associated uncertainty are rolled out via a sampling-based approach and are used in a model predictive control (MPC) policy for the ego vehicle in order to intelligently trade-off between safety and performance when attempting overtaking maneuvers against a TV. We demonstrate the GP-based predictor in closed loop with the MPC policy in simulation races and compare its performance against several predictors from literature. In a Monte Carlo study, we observe that the GP-based predictor achieves similar win rates while maintaining safety in up to 3x more races. We finally demonstrate the prediction and control framework in real-time on hardware experiments. ",

    "abstract": "Building change detection is essential for monitoring urbanization, disaster assessment, urban planning and frequently updating the maps. 3D structure information from airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) is very effective for detecting urban changes. But the 3D point cloud from airborne LiDAR(ALS) holds an enormous amount of unordered and irregularly sparse information. Handling such data is tricky and consumes large memory for processing. Most of this information is not necessary when we are looking for a particular type of urban change. In this study, we propose an automatic method that reduces the 3D point clouds into a much smaller representation without losing the necessary information required for detecting Building changes. The method utilizes the Deep Learning(DL) model U-Net for segmenting the buildings from the background. Produced segmentation maps are then processed further for detecting changes and the results are refined using morphological methods. For the change detection task, we used multi-temporal airborne LiDAR data. The data is acquired over Stockholm in the years 2017 and 2019. The changes in buildings are classified into four types: 'newly built', 'demolished', 'taller' and 'shorter'. The detected changes are visualized in one map for better interpretation. ",

    "abstract": "Drivers have distinctively diverse behaviors when operating vehicles in natural traffic flow, such as preferred pedal position, car-following distance, preview time headway, etc. These highly personalized behavioral variations are known to impact vehicle fuel economy qualitatively. Nevertheless, the quantitative relationship between driving behaviors and vehicle fuel consumption remains obscure. Addressing this critical missing link will contribute to the improvement of transportation sustainability, as well as understanding drivers' behavioral diversity. This study proposed an integrated microscopic driver behavior and fuel consumption model to assess and predict vehicle fuel economy with naturalistic highway and local commuting traffic data. Through extensive Monte Carlo simulations, significant correlation results are revealed between specific individual driving preferences and fuel economy over drivers' frequent commuting routes. Correlation results indicate that the differences in fuel consumption incurred by various driving behaviors, even in the same traffic conditions, can be as much as 29% for a light-duty truck and 15% for a passenger car. A Gaussian Process Regression model is further trained, validated, and tested under different traffic and vehicle conditions to predict fuel consumption based on drivers' personalized behaviors. Such a quantitative and personalized model can be used to identify and recommend fuel-friendly driving behaviors and routes, demonstrating a strong incentive for relevant stakeholders. ",

Thus, the problem of abusive language should be addressed in all forms for online peace and safety. While extensive research exists in abusive speech detection, most studies focus on English. Recently, many smearing incidents have occurred in India, which provoked diverse forms of abusive speech in online space in various languages based on the geographic location. Therefore it is essential to deal with such malicious content. In this paper, to bridge the gap, we demonstrate a large-scale analysis of multilingual abusive speech in Indic languages. We examine different interlingual transfer mechanisms and observe the performance of various multilingual models for abusive speech detection for eight different Indic languages. We also experiment to show how robust these models are on adversarial attacks. Finally, we conduct an in-depth error analysis by looking into the models' misclassified posts across various settings.

Besides its computational saving, our single-shot approach is, to the extent of our knowledge, the first fair representation learning method that explains what information is affected by changes in the fairness / distortion properties of the representation.

However, given that WebAssembly binaries can be compiled from unsafe languages like C/C++, classical code vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows or format strings can be transferred over from the original programs down to the cross-compiled binaries. As a result, this possibility of incorporating vulnerabilities in WebAssembly modules has widened the attack surface of modern web applications. This paper presents Wasmati, a static analysis tool for finding security vulnerabilities in WebAssembly binaries. It is based on the generation of a code property graph (CPG), a program representation previously adopted for detecting vulnerabilities in various languages but hitherto unapplied to WebAssembly. We formalize the definition of CPG for WebAssembly, introduce techniques to generate CPG for complex WebAssembly, and present four different query specification languages for finding vulnerabilities by traversing a program's CPG. We implemented ten queries capturing different vulnerability types and extensively tested Wasmati on four heterogeneous datasets. We show that Wasmati can scale the generation of CPGs for large real-world applications and can efficiently find vulnerabilities for all our query types. We have also tested our tool on WebAssembly binaries collected in the wild and identified several potential vulnerabilities, some of which we have manually confirmed to exist unless the enclosing application properly sanitizes the interaction with such affected binaries.

We survey the limitations of existing approaches and explore many tools to show the model's inner workings in an interpretable way.

To achieve conservatism, we formulate the problem as a two-player zero sum game against an adversarial environment model. The model is trained minimise the value function while still accurately predicting the transitions in the dataset, forcing the policy to act conservatively in areas not covered by the dataset. To approximately solve the two-player game, we alternate between optimising the policy and optimising the model adversarially. The problem formulation that we address is theoretically grounded, resulting in a PAC performance guarantee and a pessimistic value function which lower bounds the value function in the true environment. We evaluate our approach on widely studied offline RL benchmarks, and demonstrate that our approach achieves state of the art performance. ",

Solving the fully coupled FSI equations for incompressible Navier-Stokes and finite elasticity is computationally expensive. Optimizing robotic swimmer design within such a system generally involves cumbersome, gradient-free procedures on top of the already costly simulation. To address this challenge we present a novel, fully differentiable hybrid approach to FSI that combines a 2D direct numerical simulation for the deformable solid structure of the swimmer and a physics-constrained neural network surrogate to capture hydrodynamic effects of the fluid. For the deformable simulation of the swimmer's body, we use state-of-the-art techniques from the field of computer graphics to speed up the finite-element method (FEM). For the fluid simulation, we use a U-Net architecture trained with a physics-based loss function to predict the flow field at each time step. The pressure and velocity field outputs from the neural network are sampled around the boundary of our swimmer using an immersed boundary method (IBM) to compute its swimming motion accurately and efficiently. We demonstrate the computational efficiency and differentiability of our hybrid simulator on a 2D carangiform swimmer. Since both the solid simulator and the hydrodynamics model are automatically differentiable, we obtain a fully differentiable FSI simulator that can be used for computational co-design of geometry and controls for rigid and soft bodies immersed in fluids, such as minimizing drag, maximizing speed, or maximizing efficiency via direct gradient-based optimization.

The study further explores Surrogate Assisted Genetic Algorithms (SA-GA) in more complex variants of the original plant design and optimisation problems, such as the inclusion of parallel and feedback components. The novel extension to the original algorithm proposed in this study, Surrogate Assisted NSGA-\\Romannum{2} (SA-NSGA), was tested on a popular literature case, the Pressure Swing Adsorption (PSA) system. We further provide extensive experimentation, comparing various meta-heuristic optimisation techniques and numerous machine learning models as surrogates. The results for both sets of systems illustrate the benefits of using Genetic Algorithms as an optimisation framework for complex chemical plant system design and optimisation for both single and multi-objective scenarios. We confirm that Random Forest surrogate assisted Evolutionary Algorithms can be scaled to increasingly complex chemical systems with parallel and feedback components. We further find that combining a Genetic Algorithm framework with Machine Learning Surrogate models as a substitute for long-running simulation models yields significant computational efficiency improvements, 1.7 - 1.84 times speedup for the increased complexity examples and a 2.7 times speedup for the Pressure Swing Adsorption system.

The proposed Stan function is smooth, non-saturating, and has a trainable parameter. During training, it can allow easy flow of gradients to compute the required derivatives and also enable systematic scaling of the input-output mapping. It is also shown theoretically that the PINN with the proposed Stan function has no spurious stationary points when using gradient descent algorithms. The proposed Stan is tested on a couple of numerical studies involving general regression problems. It is subsequently used for solving multiple forward problems, which involve second-order derivatives and multiple dimensions, and an inverse problem where the thermal diffusivity is predicted through heat conduction in a rod. Our results of these case studies establish empirically that the Stan activation function can achieve better training and more accurate predictions than the state-of-the-art activation functions. ",

Consequently, humans and machines are prone to mistake morphs made from two identities for either of the faces used to create the morph. This vulnerability has been exploited in \"morph attacks\" in security scenarios. Here, we asked whether the \"other-race effect\" (ORE) -- the human advantage for identifying own- vs. other-race faces -- exacerbates morph attack susceptibility for humans. We also asked whether face-identification performance in a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) is affected by the race of morphed faces. Caucasian (CA) and East-Asian (EA) participants performed a face-identity matching task on pairs of CA and EA face images in two conditions. In the morph condition, different-identity pairs consisted of an image of identity \"A\" and a 50/50 morph between images of identity \"A\" and \"B\". In the baseline condition, morphs of different identities never appeared. As expected, morphs were identified mistakenly more often than original face images. Moreover, CA participants showed an advantage for CA faces in comparison to EA faces (a partial ORE). Of primary interest, morph identification was substantially worse for cross-race faces than for own-race faces. Similar to humans, the DCNN performed more accurately for original face images than for morphed image pairs. Notably, the deep network proved substantially more accurate than humans in both cases. The results point to the possibility that DCNNs might be useful for improving face identification accuracy when morphed faces are presented.

    "abstract": "Early fault detection (EFD) of rolling bearings can recognize slight deviation of the health states and contribute to the stability of mechanical systems. In practice, very limited target bearing data are available to conduct EFD, which makes it hard to adapt to the EFD task of new bearings. To address this problem, many transfer learning based EFD methods utilize historical data to learn transferable domain knowledge and conduct early fault detection on new target bearings. However, most existing methods only consider the distribution drift across different working conditions but ignore the difference between bearings under the same working condition, which is called Unit-to-Unit Variability (UtUV). The setting of EFD with limited target data considering UtUV can be formulated as a Few-shot Anomaly Detection task. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel EFD method based on meta-learning considering UtUV. The proposed method can learn a generic metric based on Relation Network (RN) to measure the similarity between normal data and the new arrival target bearing data. Besides, the proposed method utilizes a health state embedding strategy to decrease false alarms. The performance of proposed method is tested on two bearing datasets. The results show that the proposed method can detect incipient faults earlier than the baselines with lower false alarms. ",

We also propose SCGC*, with a more effective, novel, Influence Augmented Contrastive (IAC) loss to fuse richer structural information, and half the original model parameters. SCGC(*) is faster with simple linear units, completely eliminate convolutions and attention of traditional GNNs, yet efficiently incorporates structure. It is impervious to layer depth and robust to over-smoothing, incorrect edges and heterophily. It is scalable by batching, a limitation in many prior GNN models, and trivially parallelizable. We obtain significant improvements over state-of-the-art on a wide range of benchmark graph datasets, including images, sensor data, text, and citation networks efficiently. Specifically, 20% on ARI and 18% on NMI for DBLP; overall 55% reduction in training time and overall, 81% reduction on inference time. Our code is available at : https://github.com/gayanku/SCGC ",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a novel approach based on semantic parsing to improve the performance of Knowledge Base Question Answering (KBQA). Specifically, we focus on how to select an optimal query graph from a candidate set so as to retrieve the answer from knowledge base (KB). In our approach, we first propose to linearize the query graph into a sequence, which is used to form a sequence pair with the question. It allows us to use mature sequence modeling, such as BERT, to encode the sequence pair. Then we use a ranking method to sort candidate query graphs. In contrast to the previous studies, our approach can efficiently model semantic interactions between the graph and the question as well as rank the candidate graphs from a global view. The experimental results show that our system achieves the top performance on ComplexQuestions and the second best performance on WebQuestions. ",

These new theoretical results reveal a rich geometric structure of adversarial learning problems in multiclass classification and extend recent results restricted to the binary classification setting. A direct computational implication of our results is that by solving either the barycenter problem and its dual, or the MOT problem and its dual, we can recover the optimal robust classification rule and the optimal adversarial strategy for the original adversarial problem.

    "abstract": "Vision transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated impressive performance in various computer vision tasks. However, the adversarial examples generated by ViTs are challenging to transfer to other networks with different structures. Recent attack methods do not consider the specificity of ViTs architecture and self-attention mechanism, which leads to poor transferability of the generated adversarial samples by ViTs. We attack the unique self-attention mechanism in ViTs by restructuring the embedded patches of the input. The restructured embedded patches enable the self-attention mechanism to obtain more diverse patches connections and help ViTs keep regions of interest on the object. Therefore, we propose an attack method against the unique self-attention mechanism in ViTs, called Self-Attention Patches Restructure (SAPR). Our method is simple to implement yet efficient and applicable to any self-attention based network and gradient transferability-based attack methods. We evaluate attack transferability on black-box models with different structures. The result show that our method generates adversarial examples on white-box ViTs with higher transferability and higher image quality. Our research advances the development of black-box transfer attacks on ViTs and demonstrates the feasibility of using white-box ViTs to attack other black-box models. ",

Due to its data-driven nature, existing FAS methods are sensitive to the noise in the dataset, which will hurdle the learning process. However, very few works consider noise modeling in FAS. In this work, we attempt to fill this gap by automatically addressing the noise problem from both label and data perspectives in a probabilistic manner. Specifically, we propose a unified framework called Dual Probabilistic Modeling (DPM), with two dedicated modules, DPM-LQ (Label Quality aware learning) and DPM-DQ (Data Quality aware learning). Both modules are designed based on the assumption that data and label should form coherent probabilistic distributions. DPM-LQ is able to produce robust feature representations without overfitting to the distribution of noisy semantic labels. DPM-DQ can eliminate data noise from `False Reject' and `False Accept' during inference by correcting the prediction confidence of noisy data based on its quality distribution. Both modules can be incorporated into existing deep networks seamlessly and efficiently. Furthermore, we propose the generalized DPM to address the noise problem in practical usage without the need of semantic annotations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that this probabilistic modeling can 1) significantly improve the accuracy, and 2) make the model robust to the noise in real-world datasets. Without bells and whistles, our proposed DPM achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple standard FAS benchmarks. ",

The complex agro-hydrological system dynamics, however, often pose challenges in closed-loop control applications. In this work, we propose a two-layer neural network (NN) framework to approximate the dynamics of the agro-hydrological system. To minimize the prediction error, a linear bias correction is added to the proposed model. The model is employed by a model predictive controller with zone tracking (ZMPC), which aims to keep the root zone soil moisture in the target zone while minimizing the total amount of irrigation. The performance of the proposed approximation model framework is shown to be better compared to a benchmark long-short-term-memory (LSTM) model for both open-loop and closed-loop applications. Significant computational cost reduction of the ZMPC is achieved with the proposed framework. To handle the tracking offset caused by the plant-model-mismatch of the proposed NN framework, a shrinking target zone is proposed for the ZMPC. Different hyper-parameters of the shrinking zone in the presence of noise and weather disturbances are investigated, of which the control performance is compared to a ZMPC with a time-invariant target zone.

In this work, we propose a novel ensemble knowledge transfer method named Fed-ET in which small models (different in architecture) are trained on clients, and used to train a larger model at the server. Unlike in conventional ensemble learning, in FL the ensemble can be trained on clients' highly heterogeneous data. Cognizant of this property, Fed-ET uses a weighted consensus distillation scheme with diversity regularization that efficiently extracts reliable consensus from the ensemble while improving generalization by exploiting the diversity within the ensemble. We show the generalization bound for the ensemble of weighted models trained on heterogeneous datasets that supports the intuition of Fed-ET. Our experiments on image and language tasks show that Fed-ET significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art FL algorithms with fewer communicated parameters, and is also robust against high data-heterogeneity.

Previous work has shown that many developers reuse the code snippets on SO when they find an answer (from SO) that functionally matches the programming problem they encounter in their development activities. To study how programmers reuse code on SO during project development, we conduct a comprehensive empirical study. First, to capture the development activities of programmers, we collect 342,148 modified code snippets in commits from 793 open-source Java projects, and these modified code can reflect the programming problems encountered during development. We also collect the code snippets from 1,355,617 posts on SO. Then, we employ CCFinder to detect the code clone between the modified code from commits and the code from SO, and further analyze the code reuse when programmer solves a programming problem during development. We count the code reuse ratios of the modified code snippets in the commits of each project in different years, the results show that the average code reuse ratio is 6.32%, and the maximum is 8.38%. The code reuse ratio in project commits has increased year by year, and the proportion of code reuse in the newly established project is higher than that of old projects. We also find that some projects reuse the code snippets from many years ago. Additionally, we find that experienced developers seem to be more likely to reuse the knowledge on SO. Moreover, we find that the code reuse ratio in bug-related commits (6.67%) is slightly higher than that of in non-bug-related commits (6.59%). Furthermore, we also find that the code reuse ratio (14.44%) in Java class files that have undergone multiple modifications is more than double the overall code reuse ratio (6.32%). ",

This often requires a high computational overhead to evaluate a number of candidate networks from the set of all possible networks in the search space during the search. Prediction of the networks' performance can alleviate this high computational overhead by mitigating the need for evaluating every candidate network. Developing such a predictor typically requires a large number of evaluated architectures which may be difficult to obtain. We address this challenge by proposing a novel evolutionary-based NAS strategy, Predictor-assisted E-NAS (PRE-NAS), which can perform well even with an extremely small number of evaluated architectures. PRE-NAS leverages new evolutionary search strategies and integrates high-fidelity weight inheritance over generations. Unlike one-shot strategies, which may suffer from bias in the evaluation due to weight sharing, offspring candidates in PRE-NAS are topologically homogeneous, which circumvents bias and leads to more accurate predictions. Extensive experiments on NAS-Bench-201 and DARTS search spaces show that PRE-NAS can outperform state-of-the-art NAS methods. With only a single GPU searching for 0.6 days, competitive architecture can be found by PRE-NAS which achieves 2.40% and 24% test error rates on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet respectively. ",

To address the above issues, we propose a novel action recognition pre-training framework, which exploits human-centered prior knowledge that generates more informative representation, and avoids the conflict between multiple tasks by using task-dependent representations. Specifically, we distill knowledge from a human parsing model to enrich the semantic capability of representation. In addition, we combine knowledge distillation with contrastive learning to constitute a task-dependent multi-task framework.

Besides, span-based methods have trouble predicting long entities due to limited span enumeration length. To mitigate these issues, we present the Propose-and-Refine Network (PnRNet), a two-stage set prediction network for nested NER. In the propose stage, we use a span-based predictor to generate some coarse entity predictions as entity proposals. In the refine stage, proposals interact with each other, and richer contextual information is incorporated into the proposal representations. The refined proposal representations are used to re-predict entity boundaries and classes. In this way, errors in coarse proposals can be eliminated, and the boundary prediction is no longer constrained by the span enumeration length limitation. Additionally, we build multi-scale sentence representations, which better model the hierarchical structure of sentences and provide richer contextual information than token-level representations. Experiments show that PnRNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on four nested NER datasets and one flat NER dataset. ",

To this end, we study an unsupervised scenario by proposing a novel Self-supervised Text Erasing (STE) framework that jointly learns to synthesize training images with erasure ground-truth and accurately erase texts in the real world. We first design a style-aware image synthesis function to generate synthetic images with diverse styled texts based on two synthetic mechanisms. To bridge the text style gap between the synthetic and real-world data, a policy network is constructed to control the synthetic mechanisms by picking style parameters with the guidance of two specifically designed rewards. The synthetic training images with erasure ground-truth are then fed to train a coarse-to-fine erasing network. To produce better erasing outputs, a triplet erasure loss is designed to enforce the refinement stage to recover background textures. Moreover, we provide a new dataset (called PosterErase), which contains 60K high-resolution posters with texts and is more challenging for the text erasing task. The proposed method has been extensively evaluated with both PosterErase and the widely-used SCUT-Enstext dataset. Notably, on PosterErase, our unsupervised method achieves 5.07 in terms of FID, with a relative performance of 20.9% over existing supervised baselines. ",

    "abstract": "We study the adversarial bandit problem with composite anonymous delayed feedback. In this setting, losses of an action are split into $d$ components, spreading over consecutive rounds after the action is chosen. And in each round, the algorithm observes the aggregation of losses that come from the latest $d$ rounds. Previous works focus on oblivious adversarial setting, while we investigate the harder non-oblivious setting. We show non-oblivious setting incurs $\\Omega(T)$ pseudo regret even when the loss sequence is bounded memory. However, we propose a wrapper algorithm which enjoys $o(T)$ policy regret on many adversarial bandit problems with the assumption that the loss sequence is bounded memory. Especially, for $K$-armed bandit and bandit convex optimization, we have $\\mathcal{O}(T^{2/3})$ policy regret bound. We also prove a matching lower bound for $K$-armed bandit. Our lower bound works even when the loss sequence is oblivious but the delay is non-oblivious. It answers the open problem proposed in \\cite{wang2021adaptive}, showing that non-oblivious delay is enough to incur $\\tilde{\\Omega}(T^{2/3})$ regret. ",

In this paper, we study which factor leads to the success of self-supervised learning on speaker-related tasks, e.g. speaker verification (SV), through a series of carefully designed experiments. Our empirical results on the Voxceleb-1 dataset suggest that the benefit of SSL to SV task is from a combination of mask speech prediction loss, data scale, and model size, while the SSL quantizer has a minor impact.

    "abstract": "Transformer-based models attain excellent results and generalize well when trained on sufficient amounts of data. However, constrained by the limited data available in the audio domain, most transformer-based models for audio tasks are finetuned from pre-trained models in other domains (e.g. image), which has a notable gap with the audio domain. Other methods explore the self-supervised learning approaches directly in the audio domain but currently do not perform well in the downstream tasks. In this paper, we present a novel self-supervised learning method for transformer-based audio models, called masked spectrogram prediction (MaskSpec), to learn powerful audio representations from unlabeled audio data (AudioSet used in this paper). Our method masks random patches of the input spectrogram and reconstructs the masked regions with an encoder-decoder architecture. Without using extra model weights or supervision, experimental results on multiple downstream datasets demonstrate MaskSpec achieves a significant performance gain against the supervised methods and outperforms the previous pre-trained models. In particular, our best model reaches the performance of 0.471 (mAP) on AudioSet, 0.854 (mAP) on OpenMIC2018, 0.982 (accuracy) on ESC-50, 0.976 (accuracy) on SCV2, and 0.823 (accuracy) on DCASE2019 Task1A respectively.

The main challenge of this task is to effectively model the relation between targets and sentiments so as to filter out noisy opinion words from irrelevant targets. Most recent efforts capture relations through target-sentiment pairs or opinion spans from a word-level or phrase-level perspective. Based on the observation that targets and sentiments essentially establish relations following the grammatical hierarchy of phrase-clause-sentence structure, it is hopeful to exploit comprehensive syntactic information for better guiding the learning process. Therefore, we introduce the concept of Scope, which outlines a structural text region related to a specific target. To jointly learn structural Scope and predict the sentiment polarity, we propose a hybrid graph convolutional network (HGCN) to synthesize information from constituency tree and dependency tree, exploring the potential of linking two syntax parsing methods to enrich the representation.

The significant advances in computer vision achieved over the last 20 years, the increased computational power, and the growing demand for long-term exploration contributed to efficiently performing such a complex task with inexpensive perception sensors.

Then, we describe a loop closure detection system's structure, covering an extensive collection of topics, including the feature extraction, the environment representation, the decision-making step, and the evaluation process. We conclude by discussing open and new research challenges, particularly concerning the robustness in dynamic environments, the computational complexity, and scalability in long-term operations.

Existing works mostly use deep learning based models to retrieve the order of the instances in an image or for occlusion detection. This requires labelled occluded data and it is time consuming. In this paper, we propose a simpler and faster method that can perform both operations without any training and only requires the modal segmentation masks. For occlusion detection, instead of scanning the two objects entirely, we only focus on the intersected area between their bounding boxes. Similarly, we use the segmentation mask inside the same area to recover the depth-ordering.

    "abstract": "Answering complex logical queries on incomplete knowledge graphs (KGs) with missing edges is a fundamental and important task for knowledge graph reasoning. The query embedding method is proposed to answer these queries by jointly encoding queries and entities to the same embedding space. Then the answer entities are selected according to the similarities between the entity embeddings and the query embedding. As the answers to a complex query are obtained from a combination of logical operations over sub-queries, the embeddings of the answer entities may not always follow a uni-modal distribution in the embedding space. Thus, it is challenging to simultaneously retrieve a set of diverse answers from the embedding space using a single and concentrated query representation such as a vector or a hyper-rectangle. To better cope with queries with diversified answers, we propose Query2Particles (Q2P), a complex KG query answering method. Q2P encodes each query into multiple vectors, named particle embeddings. By doing so, the candidate answers can be retrieved from different areas over the embedding space using the maximal similarities between the entity embeddings and any of the particle embeddings. Meanwhile, the corresponding neural logic operations are defined to support its reasoning over arbitrary first-order logic queries. The experiments show that Query2Particles achieves state-of-the-art performance on the complex query answering tasks on FB15k, FB15K-237, and NELL knowledge graphs. ",

    "abstract": "Graph pooling has been increasingly considered for graph neural networks (GNNs) to facilitate hierarchical graph representation learning. Existing graph pooling methods commonly consist of two stages, i.e., selecting the top-ranked nodes and removing the rest nodes to construct a coarsened graph representation. However, local structural information of the removed nodes would be inevitably dropped in these methods, due to the inherent coupling of nodes (location) and their features (signals). In this paper, we propose an enhanced three-stage method via lifting, named LiftPool, to improve hierarchical graph representation by maximally preserving the local structural information in graph pooling. LiftPool introduces an additional stage of graph lifting before graph coarsening to preserve the local information of the removed nodes and decouple the processes of node removing and feature reduction. Specifically, for each node to be removed, its local information is obtained by subtracting the global information aggregated from its neighboring preserved nodes. Subsequently, this local information is aligned and propagated to the preserved nodes to alleviate information loss in graph coarsening. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the proposed LiftPool is localized and permutation-invariant. The proposed graph lifting structure is general to be integrated with existing downsampling-based graph pooling methods. Evaluations on benchmark graph datasets show that LiftPool substantially outperforms the state-of-the-art graph pooling methods in the task of graph classification. ",

Issues are often inter-connected via different links such as the default JIRA link types Duplicate, Relate, Block, or Subtask. While previous research has mostly focused on analyzing and predicting duplication links, this work aims at understanding the various other link types, their prevalence, and characteristics towards a more reliable link type prediction. For this, we studied 607,208 links connecting 698,790 issues in 15 public JIRA repositories. Besides the default types, the custom types Depend, Incorporate, Split, and Cause were also common. We manually grouped all 75 link types used in the repositories into five general categories: General Relation, Duplication, Composition, Temporal / Causal, and Workflow. Comparing the structures of the corresponding graphs, we observed several trends. For instance, Duplication links tend to represent simpler issue graphs often with two components and Composition links present the highest amount of hierarchical tree structures (97.7%). Surprisingly, General Relation links have a significantly higher transitivity score than Duplication and Temporal / Causal links. Motivated by the differences between the link types and by their popularity, we evaluated the robustness of two state-of-the-art duplicate detection approaches from the literature on the JIRA dataset. We found that current deep-learning approaches confuse between Duplication and other links in almost all repositories. On average, the classification accuracy dropped by 6% for one approach and 12% for the other. Extending the training sets with other link types seems to partly solve this issue. We discuss our findings and their implications for research and practice. ",

To obtain the pedestrian trajectories, we propose a new cross-camera spatio-temporal model that integrates the walking habits of pedestrians and the path layout between cameras, forming a joint probability distribution. Such a spatio-temporal model among a camera network can be specified using sparsely sampled pedestrian data. Based on the spatio-temporal model, the cross-camera trajectories of a specific pedestrian can be extracted by the conditional random field model, and further optimized by the restricted nonnegative matrix factorization. Finally, a trajectory re-ranking technology is proposed to improve the person retrieval results. To verify the effectiveness of our approach, we build the first dataset of cross-camera pedestrian trajectories over an actual monitoring scenario, namely the Person Trajectory Dataset. Extensive experiments have verified the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method. ",

    "abstract": "Decentralization is emerging as a key feature of the future Internet. However, effective algorithms for search are missing from state-of-the-art decentralized technologies, such as distributed hash tables and blockchain. This is surprising, since decentralized search has been studied extensively in earlier peer-to-peer (P2P) literature. In this work, we adopt a fresh outlook for decentralized search in P2P networks that is inspired by advancements in dense information retrieval and graph signal processing. In particular, we generate latent representations of P2P nodes based on their stored documents and diffuse them to the rest of the network with graph filters, such as personalized PageRank. We then use the diffused representations to guide search queries towards relevant content. Our preliminary approach is successful in locating relevant documents in nearby nodes but the accuracy declines sharply with the number of stored documents, highlighting the need for more sophisticated techniques.

    "abstract": "Differentially private (DP) synthetic data generation is a practical method for improving access to data as a means to encourage productive partnerships. One issue inherent to DP is that the \"privacy budget\" is generally \"spent\" evenly across features in the data set. This leads to good statistical parity with the real data, but can undervalue the conditional probabilities and marginals that are critical for predictive quality of synthetic data. Further, loss of predictive quality may be non-uniform across the data set, with subsets that correspond to minority groups potentially suffering a higher loss. In this paper, we develop ensemble methods that distribute the privacy budget \"wisely\" to maximize predictive accuracy of models trained on DP data, and \"fairly\" to bound potential disparities in accuracy across groups and reduce inequality. Our methods are based on the insights that feature importance can inform how privacy budget is allocated, and, further, that per-group feature importance and fairness-related performance objectives can be incorporated in the allocation. These insights make our methods tunable to social contexts, allowing data owners to produce balanced synthetic data for predictive analysis. ",

    "abstract": "Code summarization with deep learning has been widely studied in recent years. Current deep learning models for code summarization generally follow the principle in neural machine translation and adopt the encoder-decoder framework, where the encoder learns the semantic representations from source code and the decoder transforms the learnt representations into human-readable text that describes the functionality of code snippets. Despite they achieve the new state-of-the-art performance, we notice that current models often either generate less fluent summaries, or fail to capture the core functionality, since they usually focus on a single type of code representations. As such we propose GypSum, a new deep learning model that learns hybrid representations using graph attention neural networks and a pre-trained programming and natural language model. We introduce particular edges related to the control flow of a code snippet into the abstract syntax tree for graph construction, and design two encoders to learn from the graph and the token sequence of source code, respectively. We modify the encoder-decoder sublayer in the Transformer's decoder to fuse the representations and propose a dual-copy mechanism to facilitate summary generation. Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of GypSum over existing code summarization models. ",

However, implementation of the PBN requires an iterative algorithm that includes the inversion of a symmetric matrix of size M X M in each layer, where M is the layer output dimension. This, and the fact that the network must be always dimension-reducing in each layer, can limit the types of problems where the PBN can be applied. In this paper, we describe techniques to avoid or mitigate these restrictions and use the PBN effectively at high dimension.

Recent developments in the field of causal machine learning enable the estimation of intervention impacts on an outcome of interest, for samples described by a set of observed characteristics. We introduce an extensible data-driven framework that leverages earth observations and frames agricultural land suitability as a geospatial impact assessment problem, where the estimated effects of agricultural practices on agroecosystems serve as a land suitability score and guide decision making. We formulate this as a causal machine learning task and discuss how this approach can be used for agricultural planning in a changing climate. Specifically, we extract the agricultural management practices of \"crop rotation\" and \"landscape crop diversity\" from crop type maps, account for climate and land use data, and use double machine learning to estimate their heterogeneous effect on Net Primary Productivity (NPP), within the Flanders region of Belgium from 2010 to 2020. We find that the effect of crop rotation was insignificant, while landscape crop diversity had a small negative effect on NPP. Finally, we observe considerable effect heterogeneity in space for both practices and analyze it. ",

    "abstract": "Recently, data-driven detectors and physics-based Moving Target Defences (MTD) have been proposed to detect false data injection (FDI) attacks on power system state estimation. However, the uncontrollable false positive rate of the data-driven detector and the extra cost of frequent MTD usage limit their wide applications. Few works have explored the overlap between these two areas to collaboratively detect FDI attacks. To fill the gap, this paper proposes blending data-driven and physics-based approaches to enhance the detection of FDI attacks. To start, a physics-informed data-driven attack detection and identification algorithm is proposed. Following this, an MTD protocol is triggered by a positive signal from the data-driven detector and is formulated as a bilevel optimisation to robustly guarantee the effectiveness of MTD against the worst-case attack around the identified attack vector while maximising the hiddenness of MTD. To guarantee the feasibility and convergence, the bilevel nonconvex optimisation is separated into two stages, and for each stage, a semidefinite programming is derived through duality and linear matrix inequality. The simulation results verify that by blending data and physics, it can significantly enhance the detection performance while simultaneously reducing the false positive rate of the data-driven detector and the usage of MTD.

    "abstract": "Object detection has attracted great attention in the computer vision area and has emerged as an indispensable component in many vision systems. In the era of deep learning, many high-performance object detection networks have been proposed. Although these detection networks show high performance, they are vulnerable to adversarial patch attacks. Changing the pixels in a restricted region can easily fool the detection network in the physical world. In particular, person-hiding attacks are emerging as a serious problem in many safety-critical applications such as autonomous driving and surveillance systems. Although it is necessary to defend against an adversarial patch attack, very few efforts have been dedicated to defending against person-hiding attacks. To tackle the problem, in this paper, we propose a novel defense strategy that mitigates a person-hiding attack by optimizing defense patterns, while previous methods optimize the model. In the proposed method, a frame-shaped pattern called a 'universal white frame' (UWF) is optimized and placed on the outside of the image. To defend against adversarial patch attacks, UWF should have three properties (i) suppressing the effect of the adversarial patch, (ii) maintaining its original prediction, and (iii) applicable regardless of images. To satisfy the aforementioned properties, we propose a novel pattern optimization algorithm that can defend against the adversarial patch. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed method effectively defends against the adversarial patch attack. ",

However, the initial formulation of GloVe is not theoretically sound in two aspects, namely the selection of the weighting function and its power exponent is ad-hoc. In this paper, we utilize the theory of extreme value analysis and propose a theoretically accurate version of GloVe. By reformulating the weighted least squares loss function as the expected loss function and accurately choosing the power exponent, we create a theoretically accurate version of GloVe. We demonstrate the competitiveness of our algorithm and show that the initial formulation of GloVe with the suggested optimal parameter can be viewed as a special case of our paradigm. ",

    "abstract": "Most research into anti-phishing defence assumes that the mal-actor is attempting to harvest end-users' personally identifiable information or login credentials and, hence, focuses on detecting phishing websites. The defences for this type of attack are usually activated after the end-user clicks on a link, at which point the link is checked. This is known as after-the-click detection. However, more sophisticated phishing attacks (such as spear-phishing and whaling) are rarely designed to get the end-user to visit a website. Instead, they attempt to get the end-user to perform some other action, for example, transferring money from their bank account to the mal-actors account. These attacks are rarer, and before-the-click defence has been investigated less than after-the-click defence. To better integrate and contextualize these studies in the overall anti-phishing research, this paper presents a systematic literature review of proposed anti-phishing defences. From a total of 6330 papers, 21 primary studies and 335 secondary studies were identified and examined. The current research was grouped into six primary categories, blocklist/allowlist, heuristics, content, visual, artificial intelligence/machine learning and proactive, with an additional category of \"other\" for detection techniques that do not fit into any of the primary categories. It then discusses the performance and suitability of using these techniques for detecting phishing emails before the end-user even reads the email.

Existing approaches for hand and object reconstruction require explicitly defined physical constraints and known objects, which limits its application domains. Our algorithm is agnostic to object models, and it learns the physical rules governing hand-object interaction. This requires automatically inferring the shapes and physical interaction of hands and (potentially unknown) objects. We seek to approach this challenging problem by proposing a collaborative learning strategy where two-branches of deep networks are learning from each other. Specifically, we transfer hand mesh information to the object branch and vice versa for the hand branch. The resulting optimisation (training) problem can be unstable, and we address this via two strategies: (i) attention-guided graph convolution which helps identify and focus on mutual occlusion and (ii) unsupervised associative loss which facilitates the transfer of information between the branches. Experiments using four widely-used benchmarks show that our framework achieves beyond state-of-the-art accuracy in 3D pose estimation, as well as recovers dense 3D hand and object shapes. Each technical component above contributes meaningfully in the ablation study. ",

    "abstract": "This research aims to study a self-supervised 3D clothing reconstruction method, which recovers the geometry shape, and texture of human clothing from a single 2D image. Compared with existing methods, we observe that three primary challenges remain: (1) the conventional template-based methods are limited to modeling non-rigid clothing objects, e.g., handbags and dresses, which are common in fashion images; (2) 3D ground-truth meshes of clothing are usually inaccessible due to annotation difficulties and time costs. (3) It remains challenging to simultaneously optimize four reconstruction factors, i.e., camera viewpoint, shape, texture, and illumination. The inherent ambiguity compromises the model training, such as the dilemma between a large shape with a remote camera or a small shape with a close camera. In an attempt to address the above limitations, we propose a causality-aware self-supervised learning method to adaptively reconstruct 3D non-rigid objects from 2D images without 3D annotations. In particular, to solve the inherent ambiguity among four implicit variables, i.e., camera position, shape, texture, and illumination, we study existing works and introduce an explainable structural causal map (SCM) to build our model. The proposed model structure follows the spirit of the causal map, which explicitly considers the prior template in the camera estimation and shape prediction. When optimization, the causality intervention tool, i.e., two expectation-maximization loops, is deeply embedded in our algorithm to (1) disentangle four encoders and (2) help the prior template update. Extensive experiments on two 2D fashion benchmarks, e.g., ATR, and Market-HQ, show that the proposed method could yield high-fidelity 3D reconstruction. Furthermore, we also verify the scalability of the proposed method on a fine-grained bird dataset, i.e., CUB. ",

However, it is not possible to represent relations between entities that do not co-occur in a single sentence using LDPs.

We propose a supervised borrowing method, SuperBorrow, that learns to score the suitability of an LDP to represent a without-mention entity pair using pre-trained entity embeddings and contextualised LDP representations. Experimental results show that SuperBorrow improves the link prediction performance of multiple widely-used prior KGE methods such as TransE, DistMult, ComplEx and RotatE. ",

    "abstract": "Progress in self-supervised learning has brought strong general image representation learning methods. Yet so far, it has mostly focused on image-level learning. In turn, tasks such as unsupervised image segmentation have not benefited from this trend as they require spatially-diverse representations. However, learning dense representations is challenging, as in the unsupervised context it is not clear how to guide the model to learn representations that correspond to various potential object categories. In this paper, we argue that self-supervised learning of object parts is a solution to this issue. Object parts are generalizable: they are a priori independent of an object definition, but can be grouped to form objects a posteriori. To this end, we leverage the recently proposed Vision Transformer's capability of attending to objects and combine it with a spatially dense clustering task for fine-tuning the spatial tokens. Our method surpasses the state-of-the-art on three semantic segmentation benchmarks by 17%-3%, showing that our representations are versatile under various object definitions. Finally, we extend this to fully unsupervised segmentation - which refrains completely from using label information even at test-time - and demonstrate that a simple method for automatically merging discovered object parts based on community detection yields substantial gains.

    "title": "FlowGNN: A Dataflow Architecture for Universal Graph Neural Network  Inference via Multi-Queue Streaming",
    "abstract": "Graph neural networks (GNNs) have recently exploded in popularity thanks to their broad applicability to graph-related problems such as quantum chemistry, drug discovery, and high energy physics. However, meeting demand for novel GNN models and fast inference simultaneously is challenging because of the gap between developing efficient accelerators and the rapid creation of new GNN models. Prior art focuses on the acceleration of specific classes of GNNs, such as Graph Convolutional Network (GCN), but lacks the generality to support a wide range of existing or new GNN models. Meanwhile, most work rely on graph pre-processing to exploit data locality, making them unsuitable for real-time applications. To address these limitations, in this work, we propose a generic dataflow architecture for GNN acceleration, named FlowGNN, which can flexibly support the majority of message-passing GNNs. The contributions are three-fold. First, we propose a novel and scalable dataflow architecture, which flexibly supports a wide range of GNN models with message-passing mechanism. The architecture features a configurable dataflow optimized for simultaneous computation of node embedding, edge embedding, and message passing, which is generally applicable to all models. We also propose a rich library of model-specific components. Second, we deliver ultra-fast real-time GNN inference without any graph pre-processing, making it agnostic to dynamically changing graph structures. Third, we verify our architecture on the Xilinx Alveo U50 FPGA board and measure the on-board end-to-end performance. We achieve a speed-up of up to 51-254x against CPU (6226R) and 1.3-477x against GPU (A6000) (with batch sizes 1 through 1024); we also outperform the SOTA GNN accelerator I-GCN by 1.03x and 1.25x across two datasets. Our implementation code and on-board measurement are publicly available on GitHub. ",

    "abstract": "In pathology, tissue samples are assessed using multiple staining techniques to enhance contrast in unique histologic features. In this paper, we introduce a multimodal CNN-GNN based graph fusion approach that leverages complementary information from multiple non-registered histopathology images to predict pathologic scores. We demonstrate this approach in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) by predicting CRN fibrosis stage and NAFLD Activity Score (NAS). Primary assessment of NASH typically requires liver biopsy evaluation on two histological stains: Trichrome (TC) and hematoxylin and eosin (H&E). Our multimodal approach learns to extract complementary information from TC and H&E graphs corresponding to each stain while simultaneously learning an optimal policy to combine this information. We report up to 20% improvement in predicting fibrosis stage and NAS component grades over single-stain modeling approaches, measured by computing linearly weighted Cohen's kappa between machine-derived vs. pathologist consensus scores. Broadly, this paper demonstrates the value of leveraging diverse pathology images for improved ML-powered histologic assessment. ",

    "abstract": "Theoretically, the accuracy of computational models in predicting compound-protein binding affinities (CPAs) could be improved by the introduction of protein 3D structure information. However, most of these models still suffer from a low accuracy due to the lack of an efficient approach to encode informative protein features. The major challenge is how to combine the multi-modal information such as the residue sequence of the protein, residue atom coordinates and the torsion angles. To tackle this problem, we develop Fast Evolutional Attention and Thoroughgoing-graph Neural Networks (FeatNN) to facilitate the application of protein 3D structure information for predicting CPAs. Specifically, we established a novel end-to-end architecture to jointly embed torsion matrix, discrete distance matrix, and sequence information of protein and extract compound features with deep graph convolution layers. In addition, a new pairwise mapping attention mechanism is introduced to comprehensively learn potential interaction information between proteins and compounds. FeatNN considerably outperforms various state-of-the-art baselines in CPA prediction with the Pearson value elevated by about 35.7%. Thus, FeatNN provides an outstanding method for highly accurate CPA prediction and facilitates high-throughput virtual screening of drug candidates. ",

We aim to find out how to configure the special kind of the model in applying the algorithm. To be more specific, we focus on SKG with a Gaussian kernel and specify how to find a suitable variance for the kernel. To do so, we introduce two variables with which we are able to set up requirements on the variance of the Gaussian kernel to achieve (near-) optimal performance and can better understand how SKG works. Our contribution is that we introduce two variables as analysis tools, illustrate how predictions will be affected under different Gaussian kernels, and provide an algorithm finding a suitable Gaussian kernel for SKG with knowledge about the training network. Simulation results on real datasets are provided. ",

This allows us to consider trade communities of different sizes and illuminate the underlying hierarchical structure of trade networks and its constituting blocks. Furthermore, by measuring membership inconsistency (MeI) of each country and conducting multiple regression analysis with various economic and political indicators, we demonstrate that there exists a positive correlation between the external instability of countries and their structural inconsistency in terms of network topology.

The volume and thickness of epicardial adipose tissue are linked to various cardiovascular diseases. It is shown to be an independent cardiovascular disease risk factor. Fully automatic and reliable measurements of epicardial adipose tissue from CT scans could provide better disease risk assessment and enable the processing of large CT image data sets for a systemic epicardial adipose tissue study. This paper proposes a method for fully automatic semantic segmentation of epicardial adipose tissue from CT images using a deep neural network. The proposed network uses a U-Net-based architecture with slice depth information embedded in the input image to segment a pericardium region of interest, which is used to obtain an epicardial adipose tissue segmentation. Image augmentation is used to increase model robustness. Cross-validation of the proposed method yields a Dice score of 0.86 on the CT scans of 20 patients. ",

    "abstract": "The article is concerned with the problem of multi-step financial time series forecasting of Foreign Exchange (FX) rates. To address this problem, we introduce a parameter-free regression network termed RegPred Net. The exchange rate to forecast is treated as a stochastic process. It is assumed to follow a generalization of Brownian motion and the mean-reverting process referred to as the generalized Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) process, with time-dependent coefficients. Using past observed values of the input time series, these coefficients can be regressed online by the cells of the first half of the network (Reg). The regressed coefficients depend only on - but are very sensitive to - a small number of hyperparameters required to be set by a global optimization procedure for which, Bayesian optimization is an adequate heuristic. Thanks to its multi-layered architecture, the second half of the regression network (Pred) can project time-dependent values for the OU process coefficients and generate realistic trajectories of the time series. Predictions can be easily derived in the form of expected values estimated by averaging values obtained by Monte Carlo simulation. The forecasting accuracy on a 100 days horizon is evaluated for several of the most important FX rates such as EUR/USD, EUR/CNY, and EUR/GBP. Our experimental results show that the RegPred Net significantly outperforms ARMA, ARIMA, LSTMs, and Autoencoder-LSTM models in this task. ",

In this paper, we focus on the target coin prediction task, i.e., to predict the pump probability of all coins listed in the target exchange before a pump. We conduct a comprehensive study of the latest P&Ds, investigate 709 events organized in Telegram channels from Jan. 2019 to Jan. 2022, and unearth some abnormal yet interesting patterns of P&Ds. Empirical analysis demonstrates that pumped coins exhibit intra-channel homogeneity and inter-channel heterogeneity, which inspires us to develop a novel sequence-based neural network named SNN. Specifically, SNN encodes each channel's pump history as a sequence representation via a positional attention mechanism, which filters useful information and alleviates the noise introduced when the sequence length is long. We also identify and address the coin-side cold-start problem in a practical setting. Extensive experiments show a lift of 1.6% AUC and 41.0% Hit Ratio@3 brought by our method, making it well-suited for real-world application. As a side contribution, we release the source code of our entire data science pipeline on GitHub, along with the dataset tailored for studying the latest P&Ds. ",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we address the problem of convergence of sequential variational inference filter (VIF) through the application of a robust variational objective and Hinf-norm based correction for a linear Gaussian system. As the dimension of state or parameter space grows, performing the full Kalman update with the dense covariance matrix for a large scale system requires increased storage and computational complexity, making it impractical. The VIF approach, based on mean-field Gaussian variational inference, reduces this burden through the variational approximation to the covariance usually in the form of a diagonal covariance approximation. The challenge is to retain convergence and correct for biases introduced by the sequential VIF steps. We desire a framework that improves feasibility while still maintaining reasonable proximity to the optimal Kalman filter as data is assimilated. To accomplish this goal, a Hinf-norm based optimization perturbs the VIF covariance matrix to improve robustness. This yields a novel VIF- Hinf recursion that employs consecutive variational inference and Hinf based optimization steps. We explore the development of this method and investigate a numerical example to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed filter. ",
