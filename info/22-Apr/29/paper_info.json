    "title": "Worst-Case Dynamic Power Distribution Network Noise Prediction Using  Convolutional Neural Network",
    "abstract": "Worst-case dynamic PDN noise analysis is an essential step in PDN sign-off to ensure the performance and reliability of chips. However, with the growing PDN size and increasing scenarios to be validated, it becomes very time- and resource-consuming to conduct full-stack PDN simulation to check the worst-case noise for different test vectors. Recently, various works have proposed machine learning based methods for supply noise prediction, many of which still suffer from large training overhead, inefficiency, or non-scalability. Thus, this paper proposed an efficient and scalable framework for the worst-case dynamic PDN noise prediction. The framework first reduces the spatial and temporal redundancy in the PDN and input current vector, and then employs efficient feature extraction as well as a novel convolutional neural network architecture to predict the worst-case dynamic PDN noise. Experimental results show that the proposed framework consistently outperforms the commercial tool and the state-of-the-art machine learning method with only 0.63-1.02% mean relative error and 25-69$\\times$ speedup.

    "abstract": "Let $G=(V, E)$ be a graph where $V$ and $E$ are the vertex and edge set, respectively. For two disjoint subsets $A$ and $B$, we say $A$ dominates $B$ if every vertex of $B$ is adjacent to at least one vertex of $A$. A vertex partition $\\pi = \\{V_1, V_2, \\ldots, V_k\\}$ of $G$ is called a \\emph{transitive $k$-partition} if $V_i$ dominates $V_j$ for all $i,j$ where $1\\leq i<j\\leq k$. The maximum integer $k$ for which the above partition exists is called \\emph{transitivity} of $G$ and it is denoted by $Tr(G)$. The \\textsc{Maximum Transitivity Problem} is to find a transitive partition of a given graph with the maximum number of partitions. It was known that the decision version of \\textsc{Maximum Transitivity Problem} is NP-complete for general graphs, which was proved by Hedetniemi et al. [Iterated colorings of graphs, \\emph{Discrete Mathematics}, 278, 2004]. This paper first strengthens the NP-completeness result by showing that this problem remains NP-complete for perfect elimination bipartite graphs. On the other hand, we propose a linear-time algorithm for finding the transitivity of a given bipartite chain graph. We then characterize graphs with transitivity at least $t$ for any integer $t$. This result answers two open questions posed by J. T. Hedetniemi and S. T. Hedetniemi [The transitivity of a graph, \\emph{J. Combin. Math. Combin. Comput}, 104, 2018]. ",

The resultant graph representation facilitates the training of a Graph Neural Networks for classification tasks, and achieves accuracy and robustness comparable to the state-of-the-art against translation and rotation attacks, as well as stronger attacks on graph vertices and topologies, i.e., modifications and addition of strokes, all without resorting to adversarial training. Prior studies on sketches, e.g., graph transformers, encode control points of stroke on vertices, which are not invariant to spatial transformations. In contrary, we encode vertices and edges using pairwise distances among control points to achieve invariance. Compared with existing generative sketch model for one-shot classification, our method does not rely on run-time statistical inference. Lastly, the proposed representation enables generation of novel sketches that are structurally similar to while separable from the existing dataset. ",

Generally, the attacker delivers an attack vector to the user by means of an email, an advertisement link or any other means of communication and directs them to a malicious website to steal sensitive information and to defraud them. Existing malicious URL detection techniques are limited and to handle unseen features as well as generalize to test data. In this study, we extract a novel set of lexical and web-scrapped features and employ machine learning technique to set up system for fraudulent advertisement URLs detection. The combination set of six different kinds of features precisely overcome the obfuscation in fraudulent URL classification. Based on different statistical properties, we use twelve different formatted datasets for detection, prediction and classification task. We extend our prediction analysis for mismatched and unlabelled datasets. For this framework, we analyze the performance of four machine learning techniques: Random Forest, Gradient Boost, XGBoost and AdaBoost in the detection part. With our proposed method, we can achieve a false negative rate as low as 0.0037 while maintaining high accuracy of 99.63%. Moreover, we devise a novel unsupervised technique for data clustering using K- Means algorithm for the visual analysis. This paper analyses the vulnerability of decision tree-based models using the limited knowledge attack scenario. We considered the exploratory attack and implemented Zeroth Order Optimization adversarial attack on the detection models. ",

We conducted the experiments on the ADNI database with imaging data from three modalities, including VBM-MRI, FDG-PET, and AV45-PET, and showed that the ROI features learned by our method were effective for enhancing the performances of both clinical score prediction and disease status identification.

    "abstract": "With the advent of cheap, miniaturized electronics, ubiquitous networking has reached an unprecedented level of complexity, scale and heterogeneity, becoming the core of several modern applications such as smart industry, smart buildings and smart cities. A crucial element for network performance is the protocol stack, namely the sets of rules and data formats that determine how the nodes in the network exchange information. A great effort has been put to devise formal techniques to synthesize (offline) network protocols, starting from system specifications and strict assumptions on the network environment. However, offline design can be hard to apply in the most modern network applications, either due to numerical complexity, or to the fact that the environment might be unknown and the specifications might not available. In these cases, online protocol design and adaptation has the potential to offer a much more scalable and robust solution. Nevertheless, so far only a few attempts have been done towards online automatic protocol design. Here, we envision a protocol as an emergent property of a network, obtained by an environment-driven Distributed Hill Climbing algorithm that uses node-local reinforcement signals to evolve, at runtime and without any central coordination, a network protocol from scratch. We test this approach with a 3-state Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) Medium Access Control (MAC) protocol and we observe its emergence in networks of various scales and with various settings. We also show how Distributed Hill Climbing can reach different trade-offs in terms of energy consumption and protocol performance. ",

    "abstract": "To improve the utility of learning applications and render machine learning solutions feasible for complex applications, a substantial amount of heavy computations is needed. Thus, it is essential to delegate the computations among several workers, which brings up the major challenge of coping with delays and failures caused by the system's heterogeneity and uncertainties. In particular, minimizing the end-to-end job in-order execution delay, from arrival to delivery, is of great importance for real-world delay-sensitive applications. In this paper, for computation of each job iteration in a stochastic heterogeneous distributed system where the workers vary in their computing and communicating powers, we present a novel joint scheduling-coding framework that optimally split the coded computational load among the workers. This closes the gap between the workers' response time, and is critical to maximize the resource utilization. To further reduce the in-order execution delay, we also incorporate redundant computations in each iteration of a distributed computational job. Our simulation results demonstrate that the delay obtained using the proposed solution is dramatically lower than the uniform split which is oblivious to the system's heterogeneity and, in fact, is very close to an ideal lower bound just by introducing a small percentage of redundant computations.

While previous approaches make crucial use of strong visual representations, e.g. by finetuning pretrained image recognition networks, significantly less attention has been paid to its counterpart: the speech component. In this work, we investigate ways of improving the base speech recognition system by following similar techniques to the ones used for the visual encoder, namely, transferring representations and data augmentation. First, we show that starting from a pretrained ASR significantly improves the state-of-the-art performance; remarkably, even when building upon a strong unimodal system, we still find gains by including the visual modality. Second, we employ speech data augmentation techniques to encourage the multimodal system to attend to the visual stimuli. This technique replaces previously used word masking and comes with the benefits of being conceptually simpler and yielding consistent improvements in the multimodal setting. We provide empirical results on three multimodal datasets, including the newly introduced Localized Narratives. ",

Several recent approaches for the problem have proposed enforcing a suitable margin in logit space. Such techniques are intuitive analogues of the guiding principle behind SVMs, and are equally applicable to linear models and neural models. However, when applied to neural models, such techniques do not explicitly control the geometry of the learned embeddings. This can be potentially sub-optimal, since embeddings for tail classes may be diffuse, resulting in poor generalization for these classes. We present Embedding and Logit Margins (ELM), a unified approach to enforce margins in logit space, and regularize the distribution of embeddings. This connects losses for long-tail learning to proposals in the literature on metric embedding, and contrastive learning. We theoretically show that minimising the proposed ELM objective helps reduce the generalisation gap. The ELM method is shown to perform well empirically, and results in tighter tail class embeddings. ",

For each hurricane making landfall in the US, we observe a significant decrease in sentiment in the affected areas before and during the hurricane followed by a rapid return to pre-hurricane baseline, often within 1-2 weeks. However, some communities exhibit markedly different rates of decline and return to previous equilibrium levels. This points towards the possibility of measuring the emotional resilience of communities from the dynamics of their online emotional response. ",

One state-of-the-art method, PairRE, leverages two separate vectors for relations to model complex relations (i.e., 1-to-N, N-to-1, and N-to-N) in knowledge graphs. However, such a method strictly restricts entities on the hyper-ellipsoid surface and thus limits the optimization of entity distribution, which largely hinders the performance of knowledge graph completion. To address this problem, we propose a novel score function TransHER, which leverages relation-specific translations between head and tail entities restricted on separate hyper-ellipsoids. Specifically, given a triplet, our model first maps entities onto two separate hyper-ellipsoids and then conducts a relation-specific translation on one of them. The relation-specific translation provides TransHER with more direct guidance in optimization and the ability to learn semantic characteristics of entities with complex relations. Experimental results show that TransHER can achieve state-of-the-art performance and generalize to datasets in different domains and scales. All our code will be publicly available. ",

The status quo is tabula rasa in vivo, i.e. learning visual representations from scratch while also learning to move, potentially augmented with auxiliary tasks (e.g. predicting the action taken between two successive observations). In this paper, we show that an alternative 2-stage strategy is far more effective: (1) offline pretraining of visual representations with self-supervised learning (SSL) using large-scale pre-rendered images of indoor environments (Omnidata), and (2) online finetuning of visuomotor representations on specific tasks with image augmentations under long learning schedules. We call this method Offline Visual Representation Learning (OVRL). We conduct large-scale experiments - on 3 different 3D datasets (Gibson, HM3D, MP3D), 2 tasks (ImageNav, ObjectNav), and 2 policy learning algorithms (RL, IL) - and find that the OVRL representations lead to significant across-the-board improvements in state of art, on ImageNav from 29.2% to 54.2% (+25% absolute, 86% relative) and on ObjectNav from 18.1% to 23.2% (+5.1% absolute, 28% relative). Importantly, both results were achieved by the same visual encoder generalizing to datasets that were not seen during pretraining. While the benefits of pretraining sometimes diminish (or entirely disappear) with long finetuning schedules, we find that OVRL's performance gains continue to increase (not decrease) as the agent is trained for 2 billion frames of experience.

Localization using only one camera can be challenging in medium-to-large-sized environments because similar-looking images are often observed repeatedly, especially in indoor environments. To overcome this issue, we propose a learning-based localization method that simultaneously utilizes the spatial consistency from topological maps and the temporal consistency from time-series images captured by the robot. Our method combines a convolutional neural network (CNN) to embed image features and a recurrent-type graph neural network to perform accurate localization. When training our model, it is difficult to obtain the ground truth pose of the robot when capturing images in real-world environments. Hence, we propose a sim2real transfer approach with semi-supervised learning that leverages simulator images with the ground truth pose in addition to real images. We evaluated our method quantitatively and qualitatively and compared it with several state-of-the-art baselines. The proposed method outperformed the baselines in environments where the map contained similar images.

Secondly, Green's function usually contains singularities which increase the difficulty to get a good approximation. Lastly, the computational domain may be very complex or even unbounded. To override these problems, we leverage the fundamental solution, boundary integral method and neural networks to develop a new method for computing Green's function with high accuracy in this paper. We focus on Green's function of Poisson and Helmholtz equations in bounded domains, unbounded domains. We also consider Poisson equation and Helmholtz domains with interfaces. Extensive numerical experiments illustrate the efficiency and the accuracy of our method for solving Green's function. In addition, we also use the Green's function calculated by our method to solve a class of PDE, and also obtain high-precision solutions, which shows the good generalization ability of our method on solving PDEs.

    "abstract": "Due to the widespread use of smart contracts, Ethereum has become the second-largest blockchain platform after Bitcoin. Many different types of Ethereum accounts (ICO, Mining, Gambling, etc.) also have quite active trading activities on Ethereum. Studying the transaction records of these specific Ethereum accounts is very important for understanding their particular transaction characteristics, and further labeling the pseudonymous accounts. However, traditional methods are generally based on static and global transaction networks to conduct research, ignoring useful information about dynamic changes. Our work chooses six kinds of important account labels, and builds ego networks for each kind of Ethereum account. We focus on the interaction between the target node and neighbor nodes with temporal analysis. Experiments show that there is a significant difference between various types of accounts in terms of several network features, helping us better understand their transaction patterns. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to analyze the dynamic characteristics of Ethereum labeled accounts from the perspective of transaction ego networks. ",

    "abstract": "Federated learning (FL) enables multiple clients to collaboratively train an accurate global model while protecting clients' data privacy. However, FL is susceptible to Byzantine attacks from malicious participants. Although the problem has gained significant attention, existing defenses have several flaws: the server irrationally chooses malicious clients for aggregation even after they have been detected in previous rounds; the defenses perform ineffectively against sybil attacks or in the heterogeneous data setting. To overcome these issues, we propose MAB-RFL, a new method for robust aggregation in FL. By modelling the client selection as an extended multi-armed bandit (MAB) problem, we propose an adaptive client selection strategy to choose honest clients that are more likely to contribute high-quality updates. We then propose two approaches to identify malicious updates from sybil and non-sybil attacks, based on which rewards for each client selection decision can be accurately evaluated to discourage malicious behaviors. MAB-RFL achieves a satisfying balance between exploration and exploitation on the potential benign clients. Extensive experimental results show that MAB-RFL outperforms existing defenses in three attack scenarios under different percentages of attackers. ",

The paper assumes that the geo-satellite is connected to the HAPS using free-space-optical backhaul link. The HAPS, equipped with multiple antennas, aims at transmitting the geo-satellite data to the users via radio-frequency (RF) links using spatial-multiplexing. Each ground BS, on the other hand, is equipped with multiple antennas and serves users through RF links. The paper then focuses on maximizing the network-wide throughput, subject to user-connectivity constraints, HAPS and BSs power constraints, and backhaul constraints, so as to jointly determine the user-association strategy of each user (i.e., user to geo-satellite via HAPS, or user to BS), and their associated beamforming vectors. We tackle such a mixed discrete-continuous optimization problem using an iterative approach, where the user-association is determined using a combination of linear integer programming and generalized assignment problems, and where the beamforming strategy is found using a weighted-minimum-mean-squared-error approach. The simulations illustrate the appreciable gain of our proposed algorithm, and highlight the prospects of augmenting the ground networks with beamforming-empowered HAPS for connecting the unconnected, and super-connecting the connected.

Previous studies mainly follow the encoder-decoder paradigm and focus on the aspect of text generation, with few studies considering the importance of cross-modal mappings and explicitly exploit such mappings to facilitate radiology report generation. In this paper, we propose a cross-modal memory networks (CMN) to enhance the encoder-decoder framework for radiology report generation, where a shared memory is designed to record the alignment between images and texts so as to facilitate the interaction and generation across modalities. Experimental results illustrate the effectiveness of our proposed model, where state-of-the-art performance is achieved on two widely used benchmark datasets, i.e., IU X-Ray and MIMIC-CXR.

While the training of spiking neural networks is still an open problem. One effective way is to map the weight of trained ANN to SNN to achieve high reasoning ability. However, the converted spiking neural network often suffers from performance degradation and a considerable time delay. To speed up the inference process and obtain higher accuracy, we theoretically analyze the errors in the conversion process from three perspectives: the differences between IF and ReLU, time dimension, and pooling operation. We propose a neuron model for releasing burst spikes, a cheap but highly efficient method to solve residual information. In addition, Lateral Inhibition Pooling (LIPooling) is proposed to solve the inaccuracy problem caused by MaxPooling in the conversion process. Experimental results on CIFAR and ImageNet demonstrate that our algorithm is efficient and accurate. For example, our method can ensure nearly lossless conversion of SNN and only use about 1/10 (less than 100) simulation time under 0.693$\\times$ energy consumption of the typical method.

To utilize the model hub, we first select a source model and then adapt the model for the target to compensate for differences. While there is yet limited research on a model selection and adaption for computer vision tasks, this holds even more for the field of renewable power. At the same time, it is a crucial challenge to provide forecasts for the increasing demand for power forecasts based on weather features from a numerical weather prediction. We close these gaps by conducting the first thorough experiment for model selection and adaptation for transfer learning in renewable power forecast, adopting recent results from the field of computer vision on six datasets. We adopt models based on data from different seasons and limit the amount of training data. As an extension of the current state of the art, we utilize a Bayesian linear regression for forecasting the response based on features extracted from a neural network. This approach outperforms the baseline with only seven days of training data. We further show how combining multiple models through ensembles can significantly improve the model selection and adaptation approach. In fact, with more than 30 days of training data, both proposed model combination techniques achieve similar results to those models trained with a full year of training data. ",

This paper aims at providing a community enhancement measure through adding links to clarify ambiguous community structures. The HAP method takes the neighbourhood uncertainty and Shannon entropy to identify boundary nodes, and establishes links by considering the nodes' community attributes and community size at the same time. The experimental results on twelve real-world datasets with ground truth community indicate that the proposed link prediction method outperforms other baseline methods and the enhancement of community follows the expected evolution process.

Inspired by this, we propose friendly adversarial data augmentation (FADA) to generate friendly adversarial data. On top of FADA, we propose geometry-aware adversarial training (GAT) to perform adversarial training on friendly adversarial data so that we can save a large number of search steps. Comprehensive experiments across two widely used datasets and three pre-trained language models demonstrate that GAT can obtain stronger robustness via fewer steps.

Even when end-to-end training is possible, each module has its own set of objectives used for safety assurance, sample efficiency, regularization, or interpretability. However, intermediate objectives do not always align with overall system performance. For example, optimizing the likelihood of a trajectory prediction module might focus more on easy-to-predict agents than safety-critical or rare behaviors (e.g., jaywalking). In this paper, we present control-aware prediction objectives (CAPOs), to evaluate the downstream effect of predictions on control without requiring the planner be differentiable. We propose two types of importance weights that weight the predictive likelihood: one using an attention model between agents, and another based on control variation when exchanging predicted trajectories for ground truth trajectories. Experimentally, we show our objectives improve overall system performance in suburban driving scenarios using the CARLA simulator. ",

This requires extensive expert knowledge, in particular when covering a large variety of diseases.

Since both the knowledge itself and its encoding can be incomplete, refining the knowledge graph with additional information helps physicians making better predictions. At the same time, for deployment in a hospital, the diagnosis must be explainable and transparent. In this paper, we present an approach using diagnosis paths in a medical knowledge graph. We show that those graphs can be refined using latent representations with RDF2vec, while the final diagnosis is still made in an explainable way. Using both an intrinsic as well as an expert-based evaluation, we show that the embedding-based prediction approach is beneficial for refining the graph with additional valid conditions. ",

To effectively leverage this kind of incomplete anomalous knowledge represented by the collected anomalies, we propose to learn a probability distribution that can not only model the normal samples, but also guarantee to assign low density values for the collected anomalies. To this end, an anomaly-aware generative adversarial network (GAN) is developed, which, in addition to modeling the normal samples as most GANs do, is able to explicitly avoid assigning probabilities for collected anomalous samples. Moreover, to facilitate the computation of anomaly detection criteria like reconstruction error, the proposed anomaly-aware GAN is designed to be bidirectional, attaching an encoder for the generator.

Although some methods are proposed to combine traditional optimization algorithms with DNN, they usually demand pre-defined degradation processes or handcrafted assumptions, making it difficult to deal with complex and real-world applications. In this paper, we propose a Deep Generalized Unfolding Network (DGUNet) for image restoration. Concretely, without loss of interpretability, we integrate a gradient estimation strategy into the gradient descent step of the Proximal Gradient Descent (PGD) algorithm, driving it to deal with complex and real-world image degradation. In addition, we design inter-stage information pathways across proximal mapping in different PGD iterations to rectify the intrinsic information loss in most deep unfolding networks (DUN) through a multi-scale and spatial-adaptive way. By integrating the flexible gradient descent and informative proximal mapping, we unfold the iterative PGD algorithm into a trainable DNN.

In this paper, we present an end-to-end self-supervised framework named Audio-Visual Contrastive Learning (AVCL), to learn discriminative audio-visual representations for action recognition. Specifically, we design an attention based multi-modal fusion module (AMFM) to fuse audio and visual modalities. To align heterogeneous audio-visual modalities, we construct a novel co-correlation guided representation alignment module (CGRA). To learn supervised information from unlabeled videos, we propose a novel self-supervised contrastive learning module (SelfCL). Furthermore, to expand the existing audio-visual action recognition datasets and better evaluate our framework AVCL, we build a new audio-visual action recognition dataset named Kinetics-Sounds100. Experimental results on Kinetics-Sounds32 and Kinetics-Sounds100 datasets demonstrate the superiority of our AVCL over the state-of-the-art methods on large-scale action recognition benchmark. ",

    "abstract": "Federated learning (FL) provides a privacy-preserving solution for distributed machine learning tasks. One challenging problem that severely damages the performance of FL models is the co-occurrence of data heterogeneity and long-tail distribution, which frequently appears in real FL applications. In this paper, we reveal an intriguing fact that the biased classifier is the primary factor leading to the poor performance of the global model. Motivated by the above finding, we propose a novel and privacy-preserving FL method for heterogeneous and long-tailed data via Classifier Re-training with Federated Features (CReFF). The classifier re-trained on federated features can produce comparable performance as the one re-trained on real data in a privacy-preserving manner without information leakage of local data or class distribution. Experiments on several benchmark datasets show that the proposed CReFF is an effective solution to obtain a promising FL model under heterogeneous and long-tailed data. Comparative results with the state-of-the-art FL methods also validate the superiority of CReFF. Our code is available at https://github.com/shangxinyi/CReFF-FL. ",

    "abstract": "With the ever increasing data deluge and the success of deep neural networks, the research of distributed deep learning has become pronounced. Two common approaches to achieve this distributed learning is synchronous and asynchronous weight update. In this manuscript, we have explored very simplistic synchronous weight update mechanisms. It has been seen that with an increasing number of worker nodes, the performance degrades drastically. This effect has been studied in the context of extreme imbalanced classification (e.g. outlier detection). In practical cases, the assumed conditions of i.i.d. may not be fulfilled. There may also arise global class imbalance situations like that of outlier detection where the local servers receive severely imbalanced data and may not get any samples from the minority class. In that case, the DNNs in the local servers will get completely biased towards the majority class that they receive. This would highly impact the learning at the parameter server (which practically does not see any data). It has been observed that in a parallel setting if one uses the existing federated weight update mechanisms at the parameter server, the performance degrades drastically with the increasing number of worker nodes. This is mainly because, with the increasing number of nodes, there is a high chance that one worker node gets a very small portion of the data, either not enough to train the model without overfitting or having a highly imbalanced class distribution. The chapter, hence, proposes a workaround to this problem by introducing the concept of adaptive cost-sensitive momentum averaging. It is seen that for the proposed system, there was no to minimal degradation in performance while most of the other methods hit their bottom performance before that. ",

Motivated by these observations, we propose a new SEMI-supervised Mixture Of rain REmoval Generative Adversarial Network (Semi-MoreGAN), which consists of four key modules: (I) a novel attentional depth prediction network to provide precise depth estimation; (ii) a context feature prediction network composed of several well-designed detailed residual blocks to produce detailed image context features; (iii) a pyramid depth-guided non-local network to effectively integrate the image context with the depth information, and produce the final rain-free images; and (iv) a comprehensive semi-supervised loss function to make the model not limited to synthetic datasets but generalize smoothly to real-world heavy rainy scenes.

    "abstract": "Stock prices are highly volatile and sudden changes in trends are often very problematic for traditional forecasting models to handle. The standard Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) networks are regarded as the state-of-the-art models for such predictions. But, these models fail to handle sudden and drastic changes in the price trend. Moreover, there are some inherent constraints with the open, high, low and close (OHLC) prices of the stocks. Literature lacks the study on the inherent property of OHLC prices. We argue that predicting the OHLC prices for the next day is much more informative than predicting the trends of the stocks as the trend is mostly calculated using these OHLC prices only. The problem mainly is focused on Buy-Today Sell-Tomorrow (BTST) trading. In this regard, AEs when pre-trained with the stock prices, may be beneficial. A novel framework is proposed where a pre-trained encoder is cascaded in front of the multi-task predictor network. This hybrid network can leverage the power of a combination of networks and can both handle the OHLC constraints as well as capture any sudden drastic changes in the prices. It is seen that such a network is much more efficient at predicting stock prices. The experiments have been extended to recommend the most profitable and most overbought stocks on the next day. The model has been tested for multiple Indian companies and it is found that the recommendations from the proposed model have not resulted in a single loss for a test period of 300 days. ",

The existing phishing scams detection technology on Ethereum mostly uses traditional machine learning or network representation learning to mine the key information from the transaction network to identify phishing addresses. However, these methods adopt the last transaction record or even completely ignore these records, and only manual-designed features are taken for the node representation. In this paper, we propose a Temporal Transaction Aggregation Graph Network (TTAGN) to enhance phishing scams detection performance on Ethereum. Specifically, in the temporal edges representation module, we model the temporal relationship of historical transaction records between nodes to construct the edge representation of the Ethereum transaction network. Moreover, the edge representations around the node are aggregated to fuse topological interactive relationships into its representation, also named as trading features, in the edge2node module. We further combine trading features with common statistical and structural features obtained by graph neural networks to identify phishing addresses. Evaluated on real-world Ethereum phishing scams datasets, our TTAGN (92.8% AUC, and 81.6% F1score) outperforms the state-of-the-art methods, and the effectiveness of temporal edges representation and edge2node module is also demonstrated.

    "abstract": "This paper investigates the channel impulse response (CIR), i.e., the molecule hitting rate, of a molecular communication (MC) system employing an absorbing receiver (RX) covered by multiple non overlapping receptors. In this system, receptors are heterogeneous, i.e., they may have different sizes and arbitrary locations. Furthermore, we consider two types of transmitter (TX), namely a point TX and a membrane fusion (MF)-based spherical TX. We assume the point TX or the center of the MF-based TX has a fixed distance to the center of the RX. Given this fixed distance, the TX can be at different locations and the CIR of the RX depends on the exact location of the TX. By averaging over all possible TX locations, we analyze the expected molecule hitting rate at the RX as a function of the sizes and locations of the receptors, where we assume molecule degradation may occur during the propagation of the signaling molecules. Notably, our analysis is valid for different numbers, a wide range of sizes, and arbitrary locations of the receptors, and its accuracy is confirmed via particle-based simulations. Exploiting our numerical results, we show that the expected number of absorbed molecules at the RX increases with the number of receptors, when the total area on the RX surface covered by receptors is fixed. Based on the derived analytical expressions, we compare different geometric receptor distributions by examining the expected number of absorbed molecules at the RX. We show that evenly distributed receptors result in a larger number of absorbed molecules than other distributions. We further compare three models that combine different types of TXs and RXs. ",

The MET of non-communicable diseases like diabetes is highly correlated to cumulative health conditions, more specifically, how much time the patient spent with specific health conditions in the past. The common time-series representation is indirect in extracting such information from EHR because it focuses on detailed dependencies between values in successive observations, not cumulative information. We propose a novel data representation for EHR called cumulative stay-time representation (CTR), which directly models such cumulative health conditions. We derive a trainable construction of CTR based on neural networks that has the flexibility to fit the target data and scalability to handle high-dimensional EHR. Numerical experiments using synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that CTR alone achieves a high prediction performance, and it enhances the performance of existing models when combined with them.

In this paper, we propose to learn light field saliency from pixel-level noisy labels obtained from unsupervised hand crafted featured based saliency methods. Given this goal, a natural question is: can we efficiently incorporate the relationships among light field cues while identifying clean labels in a unified framework? We address this question by formulating the learning as a joint optimization of intra light field features fusion stream and inter scenes correlation stream to generate the predictions. Specially, we first introduce a pixel forgetting guided fusion module to mutually enhance the light field features and exploit pixel consistency across iterations to identify noisy pixels. Next, we introduce a cross scene noise penalty loss for better reflecting latent structures of training data and enabling the learning to be invariant to noise. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of our framework showing that it learns saliency prediction comparable to state-of-the-art fully supervised light field saliency methods.

Furthermore, modern PLCs often employ commodity software such as Linux on ARM, further expanding the threat surface towards traditional vulnerabilities. Security analysis of Operational Technology (OT) software, specifically, the control runtime and IEC applications, remains relatively unexplored due to its proprietary nature. In this work, we implement FieldFuzz, a methodology for discovering supply chain vulnerabilities in every PLC component using stateful black-box fuzzing without the requirement of a real device. FieldFuzz has been built using the Codesys v3 protocol, making it applicable to at least 80 industrial device vendors ranging from over 400 devices. Fuzzing campaigns uncovered multiple vulnerabilities, leading to three reported CVE IDs. To study the cross-platform applicability of FieldFuzz, we reproduce the findings on a diverse set of Industrial Control System (ICS) devices, showing a significant improvement over the state-of-the-art.

With the rapid development of deep learning, convolutional neural networks (CNN) have dominated the medical image registration field. Due to the disadvantage of the local receptive field of CNN, some recent registration methods have focused on using transformers for non-local registration. However, the standard Transformer has a vast number of parameters and high computational complexity, which causes Transformer can only be applied at the bottom of the registration models. As a result, only coarse information is available at the lowest resolution, limiting the contribution of Transformer in their models. To address these challenges, we propose a convolution-based efficient multi-head self-attention (CEMSA) block, which reduces the parameters of the traditional Transformer and captures local spatial context information for reducing semantic ambiguity in the attention mechanism. Based on the proposed CEMSA, we present a novel Symmetric Transformer-based model (SymTrans). SymTrans employs the Transformer blocks in the encoder and the decoder respectively to model the long-range spatial cross-image relevance. We apply SymTrans to the displacement field and diffeomorphic registration. Experimental results show that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance in image registration.

Specifically, our attacks generate poisoned gradients for manipulated malicious users to upload based on two strategies (i.e., random approximation and hard user mining). Extensive experiments show that our well-designed attacks can effectively poison the target models, and the attack effectiveness sets the state-of-the-art. ",

In this article, to further study this important factor in Farsi, we examine various deep learning techniques on the SheEMO dataset.

    "abstract": "Educational process data, i.e., logs of detailed student activities in computerized or online learning platforms, has the potential to offer deep insights into how students learn. One can use process data for many downstream tasks such as learning outcome prediction and automatically delivering personalized intervention. However, analyzing process data is challenging since the specific format of process data varies a lot depending on different learning/testing scenarios. In this paper, we propose a framework for learning representations of educational process data that is applicable across many different learning scenarios. Our framework consists of a pre-training step that uses BERT-type objectives to learn representations from sequential process data and a fine-tuning step that further adjusts these representations on downstream prediction tasks. We apply our framework to the 2019 nation's report card data mining competition dataset that consists of student problem-solving process data and detail the specific models we use in this scenario. We conduct both quantitative and qualitative experiments to show that our framework results in process data representations that are both predictive and informative. ",

    "abstract": "A long-standing debate is whether social influence improves the collective wisdom of a crowd or undermines it. This paper addresses this question based on a naive learning setting in influence systems theory: in our models individuals evolve their estimates of an unknown truth according to the weighted-average opinion dynamics. A formal mathematization is provided with rigorous theoretical analysis. We obtain various conditions for improving, optimizing and undermining the crowd accuracy, respectively. We prove that if the wisdom of finite-size group is improved, then the collective estimate converges to the truth as group size increases, provided individuals' variances are finite. We show that whether social influence improves or undermines the wisdom is determined by the social power allocation of the influence system: if the influence system allocates relatively larger social power to relatively more accurate individuals, it improves the wisdom; on the contrary, if the influence system assigns less social power to more accurate individuals, it undermines the wisdom. At a population level, individuals' susceptibilities to interpersonal influence and network centralities are both crucial. To improve the wisdom, more accurate individuals should be less susceptible and have larger network centralities. Particularly, in democratic influence networks, if relatively more accurate individuals are relatively less susceptible, the wisdom is improved; if more accurate individuals are more susceptible, the wisdom is undermined, which is consistent with the reported empirical evidence. Our investigation provides a theoretical framework for understanding the role social influence plays in the emergence of collective wisdom. ",

Yet most existing methods focus on equivariance regarding a global input rotation while ignoring the fact that rotation symmetry has its own spatial support. Specifically, we consider the object detection problem in 3D scenes, where an object bounding box should be equivariant regarding the object pose, independent of the scene motion. This suggests a new desired property we call object-level rotation equivariance. To incorporate object-level rotation equivariance into 3D object detectors, we need a mechanism to extract equivariant features with local object-level spatial support while being able to model cross-object context information. To this end, we propose Equivariant Object detection Network (EON) with a rotation equivariance suspension design to achieve object-level equivariance. EON can be applied to modern point cloud object detectors, such as VoteNet and PointRCNN, enabling them to exploit object rotation symmetry in scene-scale inputs. Our experiments on both indoor scene and autonomous driving datasets show that significant improvements are obtained by plugging our EON design into existing state-of-the-art 3D object detectors. ",

The goal is to find a minimum-cost subgraph $H\\subseteq V$ such that every pair $(s,t)$ are connected by $k(s,t)$ edge or (openly) vertex disjoint paths, abbreviated as EC-SNDP and VC-SNDP, respectively. The seminal result of Jain [FOCS'98, Combinatorica'01] gives a $2$-approximation algorithm for EC-SNDP, and a decade later, an $O(k^3\\log n)$-approximation algorithm for VC-SNDP, where $k$ is the largest connectivity requirement, was discovered by Chuzhoy and Khanna [FOCS'09, Theory Comput.'12]. While there is rich literature on point-to-point settings of SNDP, the viable case of connectivity between subsets is still relatively poorly understood. This paper concerns the generalization of SNDP into the subset-to-subset setting, namely Group EC-SNDP. We develop the framework, which yields the first non-trivial (true) approximation algorithm for Group EC-SNDP. Previously, only a bicriteria approximation algorithm is known for Group EC-SNDP [Chalermsook, Grandoni, and Laekhanukit, SODA'15], and a true approximation algorithm is known only for the single-source variant with connectivity requirement $k(S,T)\\in\\{0,1,2\\}$ [Gupta, Krishnaswamy, and Ravi, SODA'10; Khandekar, Kortsarz, and Nutov, FSTTCS'09 and Theor.

Drawing on theories of team, social group, and organization recruitment, I propose three models that describe how such foci might form from the relationships in a social network. I show that these models can be used to generate empirically plausible two-mode networks characterized by positively-skewed degree distributions and an over-representation of four- and six-cycles.

Hand-tuned scenarios are typically added during simulation to induce safety-critical situations. An alternative approach is to adversarially perturb the background traffic trajectories. In this paper, we study this approach to safety-critical driving scenario generation using the CARLA simulator. We use a kinematic bicycle model as a proxy to the simulator's true dynamics and observe that gradients through this proxy model are sufficient for optimizing the background traffic trajectories. Based on this finding, we propose KING, which generates safety-critical driving scenarios with a 20% higher success rate than black-box optimization. By solving the scenarios generated by KING using a privileged rule-based expert algorithm, we obtain training data for an imitation learning policy. After fine-tuning on this new data, we show that the policy becomes better at avoiding collisions. Importantly, our generated data leads to reduced collisions on both held-out scenarios generated via KING as well as traditional hand-crafted scenarios, demonstrating improved robustness. ",

To improve the generalization of the Q-function, we propose a bilinear decomposition that represents the Q-value via a low-rank approximation in the form of a dot product between two vector fields. The first vector field, f(s, a), captures the environment's local dynamics at the state s; whereas the second component, {\\phi}(s, g), captures the global relationship between the current state and the goal. We show that our bilinear decomposition scheme substantially improves data efficiency, and has superior transfer to out-of-distribution goals compared to prior methods.

Specifically, the bidirectional aware guidance network is used to capture the context between global (low-level) and local (high-level) features from the input coarse saliency map. The introduction of the global feature map can reduce the interference of surrounding tissue (background) on the lesion regions. To evaluate the segmentation performance of the network, we compared with several state-of-the-art medical image segmentation methods on the public breast ultrasound dataset using six commonly used evaluation metrics. Extensive experimental results indicate that our method achieves the most competitive segmentation results on malignant breast ultrasound images. ",

While information transfer analysis has booming applications in both science and engineering fields, critical mysteries about its foundations remain unsolved. Fundamental yet difficult questions concern how information transfer and causal relation originate, what they depend on, how they differ from each other, and if they are created by a unified and general quantity. These questions essentially determine the validity of causal relation measurement via information transfer. Here we pursue to lay a complete theoretical basis of information transfer and causal relation. Beyond the well-known relations between these concepts that conditionally hold, we demonstrate that information transfer and causal relation universally originate from specific information synergy and redundancy phenomena characterized by high-order mutual information. More importantly, our theory analytically explains the mechanisms for information transfer and causal relation to originate, vanish, and differ from each other. Moreover, our theory naturally defines the effect sizes of information transfer and causal relation based on high-dimensional coupling events. These results may provide a unified view of information, synergy, and causal relation to bridge Pearl's causal inference theory in computer science and information transfer analysis in physics. ",

Initial theoretical guarantees for efficient recovery from compressed linear measurements have been developed for signals in the range of a ReLU network with Gaussian weights and logarithmic expansivity: that is when each layer is larger than the previous one by a logarithmic factor. It was later shown that constant expansivity is sufficient for recovery. It has remained open whether the expansivity can be relaxed allowing for networks with contractive layers, as often the case of real generators. In this work we answer this question, proving that a signal in the range of a Gaussian generative network can be recovered from a few linear measurements provided that the width of the layers is proportional to the input layer size (up to log factors). This condition allows the generative network to have contractive layers. Our result is based on showing that Gaussian matrices satisfy a matrix concentration inequality, which we term Range Restricted Weight Distribution Condition (R2WDC), and weakens the Weight Distribution Condition (WDC) upon which previous theoretical guarantees were based on. The WDC has also been used to analyze other signal recovery problems with generative network priors. By replacing the WDC with the R2WDC, we are able to extend previous results for signal recovery with expansive generative network priors to non-expansive ones. We discuss these extensions for phase retrieval, denoising, and spiked matrix recovery. ",
