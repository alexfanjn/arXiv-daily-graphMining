    "abstract": "Cookie banners, the pop ups that appear to collect your consent for data collection, are a tempting ground for dark patterns. Dark patterns are design elements that are used to influence the user's choice towards an option that is not in their interest. The use of dark patterns renders consent elicitation meaningless and voids the attempts to improve a fair collection and use of data. Can machine learning be used to automatically detect the presence of dark patterns in cookie banners? In this work, a dataset of cookie banners of 300 news websites was used to train a prediction model that does exactly that. The machine learning pipeline we used includes feature engineering, parameter search, training a Gradient Boosted Tree classifier and evaluation. The accuracy of the trained model is promising, but allows a lot of room for improvement. We provide an in-depth analysis of the interdisciplinary challenges that automated dark pattern detection poses to artificial intelligence. The dataset and all the code created using machine learning is available at the url to repository removed for review. ",

    "abstract": "Adversarial attacks hamper the functionality and accuracy of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) by meddling with subtle perturbations to their inputs.In this work, we propose a new Mask-based Adversarial Defense scheme (MAD) for DNNs to mitigate the negative effect from adversarial attacks. To be precise, our method promotes the robustness of a DNN by randomly masking a portion of potential adversarial images, and as a result, the %classification result output of the DNN becomes more tolerant to minor input perturbations. Compared with existing adversarial defense techniques, our method does not need any additional denoising structure, nor any change to a DNN's design. We have tested this approach on a collection of DNN models for a variety of data sets, and the experimental results confirm that the proposed method can effectively improve the defense abilities of the DNNs against all of the tested adversarial attack methods. In certain scenarios, the DNN models trained with MAD have improved classification accuracy by as much as 20% to 90% compared to the original models that are given adversarial inputs. ",

    "title": "Automating Neural Architecture Design without Search",
    "abstract": "Neural structure search (NAS), as the mainstream approach to automate deep neural architecture design, has achieved much success in recent years. However, the performance estimation component adhering to NAS is often prohibitively costly, which leads to the enormous computational demand. Though a large number of efforts have been dedicated to alleviating this pain point, no consensus has been made yet on which is optimal. In this paper, we study the automated architecture design from a new perspective that eliminates the need to sequentially evaluate each neural architecture generated during algorithm execution. Specifically, the proposed approach is built by learning the knowledge of high-level experts in designing state-of-the-art architectures, and then the new architecture is directly generated upon the knowledge learned. We implemented the proposed approach by using a graph neural network for link prediction and acquired the knowledge from NAS-Bench-101. Compared to existing peer competitors, we found a competitive network with minimal cost. In addition, we also utilized the learned knowledge from NAS-Bench-101 to automate architecture design in the DARTS search space, and achieved 97.82% accuracy on CIFAR10, and 76.51% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet consuming only $2\\times10^{-4}$ GPU days. This also demonstrates the high transferability of the proposed approach, and can potentially lead to a new, more computationally efficient paradigm in this research direction. ",

    "abstract": "Objective: Brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) aim to provide direct brain control of devices such as prostheses and computer cursors, which have demonstrated great potential for mobility restoration. One major limitation of current BMIs lies in the unstable performance in online control due to the variability of neural signals, which seriously hinders the clinical availability of BMIs. Method: To deal with the neural variability in online BMI control, we propose a dynamic ensemble Bayesian filter (DyEnsemble). DyEnsemble extends Bayesian filters with a dynamic measurement model, which adjusts its parameters in time adaptively with neural changes. This is achieved by learning a pool of candidate functions and dynamically weighting and assembling them according to neural signals. In this way, DyEnsemble copes with variability in signals and improves the robustness of online control. Results: Online BMI experiments with a human participant demonstrate that, compared with the velocity Kalman filter, DyEnsemble significantly improves the control accuracy (increases the success rate by 13.9% and reduces the reach time by 13.5% in the random target pursuit task) and robustness (performs more stably over different experiment days). Conclusion: Our results demonstrate the superiority of DyEnsemble in online BMI control. Significance: DyEnsemble frames a novel and flexible framework for robust neural decoding, which is beneficial to different neural decoding applications. ",

This work explores incorporating arbitrary dependency structures, as specified by Bayesian networks, into VAEs. This is achieved by extending both the prior and inference network with graphical residual flows - residual flows that encode conditional independence by masking the weight matrices of the flow's residual blocks.

The task in Compositional Zero-Shot learning (CZSL) is to learn composition of primitive concepts, i.e. objects and states, in such a way that even their novel compositions can be zero-shot classified. In this work, we do not assume any prior knowledge on the feasibility of novel compositions i.e.open-world setting, where infeasible compositions dominate the search space. We propose a Compositional Variational Graph Autoencoder (CVGAE) approach for learning the variational embeddings of the primitive concepts (nodes) as well as feasibility of their compositions (via edges). Such modelling makes CVGAE scalable to real-world application scenarios. This is in contrast to SOTA method, CGE, which is computationally very expensive. e.g.for benchmark C-GQA dataset, CGE requires 3.94 x 10^5 nodes, whereas CVGAE requires only 1323 nodes. We learn a mapping of the graph and image embeddings onto a common embedding space. CVGAE adopts a deep metric learning approach and learns a similarity metric in this space via bi-directional contrastive loss between projected graph and image embeddings. We validate the effectiveness of our approach on three benchmark datasets.We also demonstrate via an image retrieval task that the representations learnt by CVGAE are better suited for compositional generalization.

    "abstract": "Vessel navigation is influenced by various factors, such as dynamic environmental factors that change over time or static features such as vessel type or depth of the ocean. These dynamic and static navigational factors impose limitations on vessels, such as long waiting times in regions outside the actual ports, and we call these waiting regions gateway ports. Identifying gateway ports and their associated features such as congestion and available utilities can enhance vessel navigation by planning on fuel optimization or saving time in cargo operation. In this paper, we propose a novel temporal graph neural network (TGNN) based port classification method to enable vessels to discover gateway ports efficiently, thus optimizing their operations. The proposed method processes vessel trajectory data to build dynamic graphs capturing spatio-temporal dependencies between a set of static and dynamic navigational features in the data, and it is evaluated in terms of port classification accuracy on a real-world data set collected from ten vessels operating in Halifax, NS, Canada. The experimental results indicate that our TGNN-based port classification method provides an f-score of 95% in classifying ports. ",

    "abstract": "Multi-objective combinatorial optimization problems (MOCOPs), one type of complex optimization problems, widely exist in various real applications. Although meta-heuristics have been successfully applied to address MOCOPs, the calculation time is often much longer. Recently, a number of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) methods have been proposed to generate approximate optimal solutions to the combinatorial optimization problems. However, the existing studies on DRL have seldom focused on MOCOPs. This study proposes a single-model deep reinforcement learning framework, called multi-objective Pointer Network (MOPN), where the input structure of PN is effectively improved so that the single PN is capable of solving MOCOPs. In addition, two training strategies, based on representative model and transfer learning, respectively, are proposed to further enhance the performance of MOPN in different application scenarios. Moreover, compared to classical meta-heuristics, MOPN only consumes much less time on forward propagation to obtain the Pareto front. Meanwhile, MOPN is insensitive to problem scale, meaning that a trained MOPN is able to address MOCOPs with different scales. To verify the performance of MOPN, extensive experiments are conducted on three multi-objective traveling salesman problems, in comparison with one state-of-the-art model DRL-MOA and three classical multi-objective meta-heuristics. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms all the comparative methods with only 20\\% to 40\\% training time of DRL-MOA. ",

    "abstract": "The future sixth generation (6G) of communication systems is envisioned to provide numerous applications in safety-critical contexts, e.g., driverless traffic, modular industry, and smart cities, which require outstanding performance, high reliability and fault tolerance, as well as autonomy. Ensuring criticality awareness for diverse functional safety applications and providing fault tolerance in an autonomous manner are essential for future 6G systems. Therefore, this paper proposes jointly employing the concepts of resilience and mixed criticality. In this contribution, we conduct physical layer resource management in cloud-based networks under the rate-splitting paradigm, which is a promising factor towards achieving high resilience. We recapitulate the concepts individually, outline a joint metric to measure the criticality-aware resilience, and verify its merits in a case study. We, thereby, formulate a non-convex optimization problem, derive an efficient iterative algorithm, propose four resilience mechanisms differing in quality and time of adaption, and conduct numerical simulations. Towards this end, a highly autonomous rate-splitting-enabled physical layer resource management algorithm for future 6G networks respecting mixed-critical QoS levels and providing high levels of resilience is proposed. Results emphasize the appreciable improvements of implementing mixed criticality-aware resilience under channel outages and strict quality of service (QoS) demands. The rate-splitting paradigm is particularly shown to overcome state-of-the-art interference management techniques, and the resilience and throughput adaption over consecutive outage events reveals the proposed schemes suitability for future 6G networks.

In this paper we present a novel NLP pipeline for generating and visualizing trace link explanations. Our approach identifies domain-specific concepts, retrieves a corpus of concept-related sentences, mines concept definitions and usage examples, and identifies relations between cross-artifact concepts in order to explain the links. It applies a post-processing step to prioritize the most likely acronyms and definitions and to eliminate non-relevant ones. We evaluate our approach using project artifacts from three different domains of interstellar telescopes, positive train control, and electronic health-care systems, and then report coverage, correctness, and potential utility of the generated definitions. We design and utilize an explanation interface which leverages concept definitions and relations to visualize and explain trace link rationales, and we report results from a user study that was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the explanation interface. Results show that the explanations presented in the interface helped non-experts to understand the underlying semantics of a trace link and improved their ability to vet the correctness of the link.

In this context, the transition from the first generation of optical-electrical-optical (O-E-O) mode to the second generation of optical-bypass marked a paradigm shift in redesigning optical transport networks towards greater network efficiency. Optical-bypass operation has then become the \\textit{de facto} approach adopted by the majority of carriers in both metro and backbone networks in the last two decades and has remained basically unchanged. However, in optical-bypass network, the fact that in-transit lightpaths crossing a common intermediate node must be separated in either time, frequency or spatial domain to avoid adversarial interference appears to be a critical shortcoming as the interaction of such lightpaths in optical domain may result in efficient computing and/or signal processing operations for saving spectral resources. Inspired by the accelerated progresses in optical signal processing technologies and the integration of computing and communications, we introduce in this paper a new architectural paradigm for future optical networks and highlight how this new architecture has the potential to shatter the \\textit{status quo}. Indeed, our proposal is centered on exploiting the superposition of in-transit lightpaths at intermediate nodes to generate more spectrally efficient lightpaths and how to harness this opportunity from network design perspectives. We present two case studies featuring optical aggregation and optical XOR encoding to demonstrate the merit of optical-processing-enabled operation compared to its counterpart, optical-bypass.

Our approach uses fractional coloring for a b-fold coloring of characteristic graphs to provide a linear programming relaxation to the traditional coloring method and achieves coding at a fine-grained granularity. We derive the fundamental lower bound for compression, given by the fractional characteristic graph entropy, through generalizing the notion of K\\\"orner's graph entropy. We demonstrate the coding gains of fractional coloring over traditional coloring via a computation example. We conjecture that the integrality gap between fractional coloring and traditional coloring approaches the smallest b that attains the fractional chromatic number to losslessly represent the independent sets for a given characteristic graph, up to a linear scaling which is a function of the fractional chromatic number.

In the meanwhile, sparsity or smoothness based regularizations, such as total variation and $\\ell_1$, can be imposed on the foreground. Moreover, graph Laplacians are further imposed to capture the complicated geometry of background images. Recently, weighted regularization techniques including the weighted nuclear norm regularization have been proposed in the image processing community to promote adaptive sparsity while achieving efficient performance.

The proposed framework extracts multi-fractal topological features from code graphs, utilizes graph autoencoders to learn how to partition the graph into computational kernels, and exploits graph neural networks (GNN) to predict the correct assignment to a processor type.

    "abstract": "Neural networks work remarkably well in practice and theoretically they can be universal approximators. However, they still make mistakes and a specific type of them called adversarial errors seem inexcusable to humans. In this work, we analyze both test errors and adversarial errors on a well controlled but highly non-linear visual classification problem. We find that, when approximating training on infinite data, test errors tend to be close to the ground truth decision boundary. Qualitatively speaking these are also more difficult for a human. By contrast, adversarial examples can be found almost everywhere and are often obvious mistakes. However, when we constrain adversarial examples to the manifold, we observe a 90\\% reduction in adversarial errors. If we inflate the manifold by training with Gaussian noise we observe a similar effect. In both cases, the remaining adversarial errors tend to be close to the ground truth decision boundary. Qualitatively, the remaining adversarial errors are similar to test errors on difficult examples. They do not have the customary quality of being inexcusable mistakes. ",

Data augmentation, explored as an effective approach to tackle them, can improve the robustness and efficiency of classification models by generating new samples. This paper presents REPRINT, a simple and effective hidden-space data augmentation method for imbalanced data classification. Given hidden-space representations of samples in each class, REPRINT extrapolates, in a randomized fashion, augmented examples for target class by using subspaces spanned by principal components to summarize distribution structure of both source and target class. Consequently, the examples generated would diversify the target while maintaining the original geometry of target distribution. Besides, this method involves a label refinement component which allows to synthesize new soft labels for augmented examples. Compared with different NLP data augmentation approaches under a range of data imbalanced scenarios on four text classification benchmark, REPRINT shows prominent improvements. Moreover, through comprehensive ablation studies, we show that label refinement is better than label-preserving for augmented examples, and that our method suggests stable and consistent improvements in terms of suitable choices of principal components. Moreover, REPRINT is appealing for its easy-to-use since it contains only one hyperparameter determining the dimension of subspace and requires low computational resource. ",

In this context, we present a new research problem, entitled, routing, wavelength, network coding assignment and protection configuration (RWNCA-PC) arisen in exploiting photonic network coding (NC) for dedicated path protection in wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) networks with an extra degree of freedom in the selection of protection triggering mechanism, that is, network-side and client-side, tailoring to each connection. In order to maximize the NC benefits, we thus provide a weighted multi-objective optimization model for solving RWNCA-PC problem so as to minimize the wavelength count as the strictly prioritized goal and the redundant resources measured by the number of client-side connections as the secondary objective. Numerical results on the realistic COST239 network reveal that a saving of up to $25\\%$ wavelength resources could be achieved thanks to the optimal use of NC compared to the non-coding designs and among coding-aware designs, the use of mixed protection configurations would be spectrally more efficient than the design with only network-side protection scheme. Our proposal yields the highest spectrum efficiency compared to all reference designs and moreover, features an average saving of more than $40\\%$ transponder count compared with its single objective counterpart.

    "abstract": "Temporal knowledge prediction is a crucial task for the event early warning that has gained increasing attention in recent years, which aims to predict the future facts by using relevant historical facts on the temporal knowledge graphs. There are two main difficulties in this prediction task. First, from the historical facts point of view, how to model the evolutionary patterns of the facts to predict the query accurately. Second, from the query perspective, how to handle the two cases where the query contains seen and unseen entities in a unified framework. Driven by the two problems, we propose a novel adaptive pseudo-siamese policy network for temporal knowledge prediction based on reinforcement learning. Specifically, we design the policy network in our model as a pseudo-siamese policy network that consists of two sub-policy networks. In sub-policy network I, the agent searches for the answer for the query along the entity-relation paths to capture the static evolutionary patterns. And in sub-policy network II, the agent searches for the answer for the query along the relation-time paths to deal with unseen entities. Moreover, we develop a temporal relation encoder to capture the temporal evolutionary patterns. Finally, we design a gating mechanism to adaptively integrate the results of the two sub-policy networks to help the agent focus on the destination answer. To assess our model performance, we conduct link prediction on four benchmark datasets, the experimental results demonstrate that our method obtains considerable performance compared with existing methods.

    "abstract": "Spatial-temporal representation learning is ubiquitous in various real-world applications, including visual comprehension, video understanding, multi-modal analysis, human-computer interaction, and urban computing. Due to the emergence of huge amounts of multi-modal heterogeneous spatial/temporal/spatial-temporal data in big data era, the existing visual methods rely heavily on large-scale data annotations and supervised learning to learn a powerful big model. However, the lack of interpretability, robustness, and out-of-distribution generalization are becoming the bottleneck problems of these models, which hinders the progress of interpretable and reliable artificial intelligence. The majority of the existing methods are based on correlation learning with the assumption that the data are independent and identically distributed, which lack an unified guidance and analysis about why modern spatial-temporal representation learning methods have limited interpretability and easily collapse into dataset bias. Inspired by the strong inference ability of human-level agents, recent years have therefore witnessed great effort in developing causal reasoning paradigms to realize robust representation and model learning with good interpretability. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive review of existing causal reasoning methods for spatial-temporal representation learning, covering fundamental theories, models, and datasets. The limitations of current methods and datasets are also discussed. Moreover, we propose some primary challenges, opportunities, and future research directions for benchmarking causal reasoning algorithms in spatial-temporal representation learning. ",

The destruction to DNNs brought by the adversarial attack sparks the potential that adversarial examples serve as a new protection mechanism for privacy security in social networks.

To address this issue, we propose a recoverable generative adversarial network to generate self-recoverable adversarial examples. By modeling the adversarial attack and recovery as a united task, our method can minimize the error of the recovered examples while maximizing the attack ability, resulting in better recoverability of adversarial examples. To further boost the recoverability of these examples, we exploit a dimension reducer to optimize the distribution of adversarial perturbation. The experimental results prove that the adversarial examples generated by the proposed method present superior recoverability, attack ability, and robustness on different datasets and network architectures, which ensure its effectiveness as a protection mechanism in social networks.

By utilizing the auxiliary review information accompanied with user ratings, many of the existing review-based recommendation models enriched user/item embedding learning ability with historical reviews or better modeled user-item interactions with the help of available user-item target reviews. Though significant progress has been made, we argue that current solutions for review-based recommendation suffer from two drawbacks. First, as review-based recommendation can be naturally formed as a user-item bipartite graph with edge features from corresponding user-item reviews, how to better exploit this unique graph structure for recommendation? Second, while most current models suffer from limited user behaviors, can we exploit the unique self-supervised signals in the review-aware graph to guide two recommendation components better? To this end, in this paper, we propose a novel Review-aware Graph Contrastive Learning (RGCL) framework for review-based recommendation. Specifically, we first construct a review-aware user-item graph with feature-enhanced edges from reviews, where each edge feature is composed of both the user-item rating and the corresponding review semantics. This graph with feature-enhanced edges can help attentively learn each neighbor node weight for user and item representation learning. After that, we design two additional contrastive learning tasks (i.e., Node Discrimination and Edge Discrimination) to provide self-supervised signals for the two components in recommendation process. Finally, extensive experiments over five benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed RGCL compared to the state-of-the-art baselines. ",

Detailed analyses show that embedding these physics into the architecture of the neural network facilitates a more efficient training of the network with less training data, while also enhancing the extrapolation capability for loading regimes outside the training data. The architecture of EPNN is model and material-independent, i.e. it can be adapted to a wide range of elasto-plastic material types, including geomaterials and metals; and experimental data can potentially be directly used in training the network. To demonstrate the robustness of the proposed architecture, we adapt its general framework to the elasto-plastic behavior of sands. We use synthetic data generated from material point simulations based on a relatively advanced dilatancy-based constitutive model for granular materials to train the neural network. The superiority of EPNN over regular neural network architectures is explored through predicting unseen strain-controlled loading paths for sands with different initial densities. ",

It has information for 200 countries and is one of the biggest databases for political science. According to the V-Dem annual democracy report 2019, Taiwan is one of the two countries that got disseminated false information from foreign governments the most. It also shows that the \"made-up news\" has caused a great deal of confusion in Taiwanese society and has serious impacts on global stability. Although there are several applications helping distinguish the false information, we found out that the pre-processing of categorizing the news is still done by human labor. However, human labor may cause mistakes and cannot work for a long time. The growing demands for automatic machines in the near decades show that while the machine can do as good as humans or even better, using machines can reduce humans' burden and cut down costs. Therefore, in this work, we build a predictive model to classify the category of news. The corpora we used contains 28358 news and 200 news scraped from the online newspaper Liberty Times Net (LTN) website and includes 8 categories: Technology, Entertainment, Fashion, Politics, Sports, International, Finance, and Health. At first, we use Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) for word embeddings which transform each Chinese character into a (1,768) vector. Then, we use a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) layer to transform word embeddings into sentence embeddings and add another LSTM layer to transform them into document embeddings. Each document embedding is an input for the final predicting model, which contains two Dense layers and one Activation layer. And each document embedding is transformed into 1 vector with 8 real numbers, then the highest one will correspond to the 8 news categories with up to 99% accuracy. ",

Commonly-used methods such as k-means, spectral clustering, and agglomerative hierarchical clustering only take into account properties such as proximity and relative densities. In this paper we propose to view clustering-based diarization as a community detection problem. By doing so the topological structure is considered. This work has four major contributions. First it is shown that Leiden community detection algorithm significantly outperforms the previous methods on the clustering of speaker-segments. Second, we propose to use uniform manifold approximation to reduce dimension while retaining global and local topological structure. Third, a masked filtering approach is introduced to extract \"clean\" speaker embeddings.

    "abstract": "Multi-domain text classification can automatically classify texts in various scenarios. Due to the diversity of human languages, texts with the same label in different domains may differ greatly, which brings challenges to the multi-domain text classification. Current advanced methods use the private-shared paradigm, capturing domain-shared features by a shared encoder, and training a private encoder for each domain to extract domain-specific features. However, in realistic scenarios, these methods suffer from inefficiency as new domains are constantly emerging. In this paper, we propose a robust contrastive alignment method to align text classification features of various domains in the same feature space by supervised contrastive learning. By this means, we only need two universal feature extractors to achieve multi-domain text classification. Extensive experimental results show that our method performs on par with or sometimes better than the state-of-the-art method, which uses the complex multi-classifier in a private-shared framework.

Conventional Maximum A Posteriori estimation and deep learning-based deblurring methods are restricted by handcrafted priors and synthetic blurry-sharp training pairs respectively, thereby failing to generalize to real dynamic blurriness. To this end, we propose a Neural Maximum A Posteriori (NeurMAP) estimation framework for training neural networks to recover blind motion information and sharp content from unpaired data. The proposed NeruMAP consists of a motion estimation network and a deblurring network which are trained jointly to model the (re)blurring process (i.e. likelihood function). Meanwhile, the motion estimation network is trained to explore the motion information in images by applying implicit dynamic motion prior, and in return enforces the deblurring network training (i.e. providing sharp image prior). The proposed NeurMAP is an orthogonal approach to existing deblurring neural networks, and is the first framework that enables training image deblurring networks on unpaired datasets. Experiments demonstrate our superiority on both quantitative metrics and visual quality over state-of-the-art methods. Codes are available on https://github.com/yjzhang96/NeurMAP-deblur. ",

A key strength of GP-GOMEA is its way of performing variation, which dynamically adapts to the emergence of patterns in the population. However, GP-GOMEA lacks a mechanism to optimize coefficients. In this paper, we study how fairly simple approaches for optimizing coefficients can be integrated into GP-GOMEA. In particular, we considered two variants of Gaussian coefficient mutation. We performed experiments using different settings on 23 benchmark problems, and used machine learning to estimate what aspects of coefficient mutation matter most. We find that the most important aspect is that the number of coefficient mutation attempts needs to be commensurate with the number of mixing operations that GP-GOMEA performs. We applied GP-GOMEA with the best-performing coefficient mutation approach to the data sets of SRBench, a large SR benchmark, for which a ground-truth underlying equation is known. We find that coefficient mutation can help re-discovering the underlying equation by a substantial amount, but only when no noise is added to the target variable. In the presence of noise, GP-GOMEA with coefficient mutation discovers alternative but similarly-accurate equations. ",

This work proposes a word-level contrastive objective to leverage word alignments for many-to-many NMT. Empirical results show that this leads to 0.8 BLEU gains for several language pairs. Analyses reveal that in many-to-many NMT, the encoder's sentence retrieval performance highly correlates with the translation quality, which explains when the proposed method impacts translation.

However, most of the current researches are mainly aimed at the adversarial attack against ViTs, and there is still relatively little adversarial work on MLP-mixer. We propose an adversarial attack method against MLP-Mixer called Maxwell's demon Attack (MA). MA breaks the channel-mixing and token-mixing mechanism of MLP-Mixer by controlling the part input of MLP-Mixer's each Mixer layer, and disturbs MLP-Mixer to obtain the main information of images. Our method can mask the part input of the Mixer layer, avoid overfitting of the adversarial examples to the source model, and improve the transferability of cross-architecture. Extensive experimental evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness and superior performance of the proposed MA. Our method can be easily combined with existing methods and can improve the transferability by up to 38.0% on MLP-based ResMLP. Adversarial examples produced by our method on MLP-Mixer are able to exceed the transferability of adversarial examples produced using DenseNet against CNNs. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first work to study adversarial transferability of MLP-Mixer. ",

State-of-the-art methods directly learn image-based embedding space by leveraging powerful deep convolutional neural networks.

The recent advancements in human body and hand pose estimation in the wild promise new ways of addressing the task of human action alignment in videos. In this work, based on off-the-shelf human pose estimators, we propose a novel context-aware self-supervised learning architecture to align sequences of actions. We name it CASA. Specifically, CASA employs self-attention and cross-attention mechanisms to incorporate the spatial and temporal context of human actions, which can solve the temporal discontinuity problem. Moreover, we introduce a self-supervised learning scheme that is empowered by novel 4D augmentation techniques for 3D skeleton representations. We systematically evaluate the key components of our method. Our experiments on three public datasets demonstrate CASA significantly improves phase progress and Kendall's Tau scores over the previous state-of-the-art methods. ",

It has previously been suggested that a hybrid of the entropy and sum squared error loss functions could combine the advantages of the two functions, while limiting their disadvantages. The effectiveness of such hybrid loss functions is investigated in this study. It is shown that hybridisation of the two loss functions improves the generalisation ability of the ANNs on all problems considered. The hybrid loss function that starts training with the sum squared error loss function and later switches to the cross entropy error loss function is shown to either perform the best on average, or to not be significantly different than the best loss function tested for all problems considered. This study shows that the minima discovered by the sum squared error loss function can be further exploited by switching to cross entropy error loss function.

Existing attack methods construct such adversaries by randomly selecting some clean data from the benign set and then embedding a trigger into them. However, this selection strategy ignores the fact that each poisoned sample contributes inequally to the backdoor injection, which reduces the efficiency of poisoning. In this paper, we formulate improving the poisoned data efficiency by the selection as an optimization problem and propose a Filtering-and-Updating Strategy (FUS) to solve it. The experimental results on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet-10 indicate that the proposed method is effective: the same attack success rate can be achieved with only 47% to 75% of the poisoned sample volume compared to the random selection strategy. More importantly, the adversaries selected according to one setting can generalize well to other settings, exhibiting strong transferability. ",

However, the training of FL is an interactive process between local clients and the parameter server. Such process would cause privacy leakage since adversaries may retrieve sensitive information by analyzing the overheard messages. In this paper, we propose a new federated stochastic primal-dual algorithm with differential privacy (FedSPD-DP). Compared to the existing methods, the proposed FedSPD-DP incorporates local stochastic gradient descent (local SGD) and partial client participation (PCP) for addressing the issues of communication efficiency and straggler effects due to randomly accessed clients. Our analysis shows that the data sampling strategy and PCP can enhance the data privacy whereas the larger number of local SGD steps could increase privacy leakage, revealing a non-trivial tradeoff between algorithm communication efficiency and privacy protection. Specifically, we show that, by guaranteeing $(\\epsilon, \\delta)$-DP for each client per communication round, the proposed algorithm guarantees $(\\mathcal{O}(q\\epsilon \\sqrt{p T}), \\delta)$-DP after $T$ communication rounds while maintaining an $\\mathcal{O}(1/\\sqrt{pTQ})$ convergence rate for a convex and non-smooth learning problem, where $Q$ is the number of local SGD steps, $p$ is the client sampling probability, $q=\\max_{i} q_i/\\sqrt{1-q_i}$ and $q_i$ is the data sampling probability of each client under PCP.

In order to prevent this fraud, some researchers have begun to study the adversarial methods against DeepFake or face manipulation. However, existing works focus on the white-box setting or the black-box setting driven by abundant queries, which severely limits the practical application of these methods. To tackle this problem, we introduce a practical adversarial attack that does not require any queries to the facial image forgery model. Our method is built on a substitute model persuing for face reconstruction and then transfers adversarial examples from the substitute model directly to inaccessible black-box DeepFake models. Specially, we propose the Transferable Cycle Adversary Generative Adversarial Network (TCA-GAN) to construct the adversarial perturbation for disrupting unknown DeepFake systems. We also present a novel post-regularization module for enhancing the transferability of generated adversarial examples. To comprehensively measure the effectiveness of our approaches, we construct a challenging benchmark of DeepFake adversarial attacks for future development. Extensive experiments impressively show that the proposed adversarial attack method makes the visual quality of DeepFake face images plummet so that they are easier to be detected by humans and algorithms. Moreover, we demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can be generalized to offer face image protection against various face translation methods. ",

Our main observation is that image classifiers may perform poorly on out-of-distribution samples because spurious correlations between non-robust features and labels can be changed in a new environment. By analyzing procedures for out-of-distribution generalization with a causal graph, we show that standard classifiers fail because the association between images and labels is not transportable across settings. However, we then show that the causal effect, which severs all sources of confounding, remains invariant across domains. This motivates us to develop an algorithm to estimate the causal effect for image classification, which is transportable (i.e., invariant) across source and target environments. Without observing additional variables, we show that we can derive an estimand for the causal effect under empirical assumptions using representations in deep models as proxies. Theoretical analysis, empirical results, and visualizations show that our approach captures causal invariances and improves overall generalization. ",

    "abstract": "The recent success of audio-visual representation learning can be largely attributed to their pervasive property of audio-visual synchronization, which can be used as self-annotated supervision. As a state-of-the-art solution, Audio-Visual Instance Discrimination (AVID) extends instance discrimination to the audio-visual realm. Existing AVID methods construct the contrastive set by random sampling based on the assumption that the audio and visual clips from all other videos are not semantically related. We argue that this assumption is rough, since the resulting contrastive sets have a large number of faulty negatives. In this paper, we overcome this limitation by proposing a novel Active Contrastive Set Mining (ACSM) that aims to mine the contrastive sets with informative and diverse negatives for robust AVID. Moreover, we also integrate a semantically-aware hard-sample mining strategy into our ACSM. The proposed ACSM is implemented into two most recent state-of-the-art AVID methods and significantly improves their performance. Extensive experiments conducted on both action and sound recognition on multiple datasets show the remarkably improved performance of our method. ",

Here, we address both problems by employing a deep reinforcement learning model to optimize the social learning strategies (SLSs) of agents in a cooperative game in a multi-dimensional landscape. Throughout the training for maximizing the overall payoff, we find that the agent spontaneously learns various concepts of social learning, such as copying, focusing on frequent and well-performing neighbors, self-comparison, and the importance of balancing between individual and social learning, without any explicit guidance or prior knowledge about the system. The SLS from a fully trained agent outperforms all of the traditional, baseline SLSs in terms of mean payoff. We demonstrate the superior performance of the reinforcement learning agent in various environments, including temporally changing environments and real social networks, which also verifies the adaptability of our framework to different social settings.

    "abstract": "Several areas have been improved with Deep Learning during the past years. Implementing Deep Neural Networks (DNN) for non-safety related applications have shown remarkable achievements over the past years; however, for using DNNs in safety critical applications, we are missing approaches for verifying the robustness of such models. A common challenge for DNNs occurs when exposed to out-of-distribution samples that are outside of the scope of a DNN, but which result in high confidence outputs despite no prior knowledge of such input. In this paper, we analyze three methods that separate between in- and out-of-distribution data, called supervisors, on four well-known DNN architectures. We find that the outlier detection performance improves with the quality of the model. We also analyse the performance of the particular supervisors during the training procedure by applying the supervisor at a predefined interval to investigate its performance as the training proceeds. We observe that understanding the relationship between training results and supervisor performance is crucial to improve the model's robustness and to indicate, what input samples require further measures to improve the robustness of a DNN. In addition, our work paves the road towards an instrument for safety argumentation for safety critical applications. This paper is an extended version of our previous work presented at 2019 SEAA (cf. [1]); here, we elaborate on the used metrics, add an additional supervisor and test them on two additional datasets.

    "abstract": "Indoor thermal comfort immensely impacts the health and performance of occupants. Therefore, researchers and engineers have proposed numerous computational models to estimate thermal comfort (TC). Given the impetus toward energy efficiency, the current focus is on data-driven TC prediction solutions that leverage state-of-the-art machine learning (ML) algorithms. However, an indoor occupant's perception of indoor thermal comfort (TC) is subjective and multi-dimensional. Different aspects of TC are represented by various standard metrics/scales viz., thermal sensation (TSV), thermal comfort (TCV), and thermal preference (TPV). The current ML-based TC prediction solutions adopt the Single-task Learning approach, i.e., one prediction model per metric. Consequently, solutions often focus on only one TC metric. Moreover, when several metrics are considered, multiple TC models for a single indoor space lead to conflicting predictions, making real-world deployment infeasible. This work addresses these problems. With the vision toward energy conservation and real-world application, naturally ventilated primary school classrooms are considered. First, month-long field experiments are conducted in 5 schools and 14 classrooms, including 512 unique student participants. Further, \"DeepComfort,\" a Multi-task Learning inspired deep-learning model is proposed. DeepComfort predicts multiple TC output metrics viz., TSV, TPV, and TCV, simultaneously, through a single model. It demonstrates high F1-scores, Accuracy (>90%), and generalization capability when validated on the ASHRAE-II database and the dataset created in this study. DeepComfort is also shown to outperform 6 popular metric-specific single-task machine learning algorithms. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first application of Multi-task Learning to thermal comfort prediction in classrooms. ",

Nevertheless, BN is still used in adversarial training, which is the de-facto standard to learn robust features. In order to shed light on the role of BN in adversarial training, we investigate to what extent the expressiveness of BN can be used to robustify fragile features in comparison to random features. On CIFAR10, we find that adversarially fine-tuning just the BN layers can result in non-trivial adversarial robustness. Adversarially training only the BN layers from scratch, in contrast, is not able to convey meaningful adversarial robustness. Our results indicate that fragile features can be used to learn models with moderate adversarial robustness, while random features cannot ",

Following the modern paradigms of Industry 4.0, this contribution proposes a non-destructive RFID-based system for the automatic evaluation of the live ripening of avocados.

Various data-driven methods have been proposed for point prediction of battery cycle life with minimum knowledge of the battery degradation mechanisms. However, management of batteries at end-of-life with lower economic and technical risk requires prediction of cycle life with quantified uncertainty, which is still lacking. The interpretability (i.e., the reason for high prediction accuracy) of these advanced data-driven methods is also worthy of investigation. Here, a physics-informed Quantile Regression Forest (QRF) model is introduced to make cycle life range prediction with uncertainty quantified as the length of the prediction interval, in addition to point predictions with high accuracy. The hyperparameters of the QRF model are tuned with a proposed area-based performance evaluation metric so that the coverage probabilities associated with the prediction intervals are calibrated. The interpretability of the final QRF model is explored with two global model-agnostic methods, namely permutation importance, and partial dependence plot. The final QRF model facilitates dual-criteria decision-making to select the high-cycle-life charging protocol with consideration of both point predictions and uncertainty associated with the prediction.

Taking the constrained resource and unreliable nature of wireless communication into account, we jointly study the user selection and bandwidth optimization problem to minimize the FL training loss. To solve this joint optimization problem, we provide a thorough convergence analysis for TT-Fed. Based on the obtained analytical convergence upper bound, the optimization problem is decomposed into tractable sub-problems with respect to each global aggregation round, and finally solved by our proposed online search algorithm. Simulation results show that compared to asynchronous FL (FedAsync) and FL with asynchronous user tiers (FedAT) benchmarks, our proposed TT-Fed algorithm improves the converged test accuracy by up to 12.5% and 5%, respectively, under highly imbalanced and non-IID data, while substantially reducing the communication overhead.

With rapid advancements in technology, wearables, and learning algorithm in the last decade, its scope has evolved. Specifically, Cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPX) is one of the most commonly used laboratory tests for objective evaluation of exercise capacity and performance levels in patients. CPX provides a non-invasive, integrative assessment of the pulmonary, cardiovascular, and skeletal muscle systems involving the measurement of gas exchanges. However, its assessment is challenging, requiring the individual to process multiple time series data points, leading to simplification to peak values and slopes. But this simplification can discard the valuable trend information present in these time series. In this work, we encode the time series as images using the Gramian Angular Field and Markov Transition Field and use it with a convolutional neural network and attention pooling approach for the classification of heart failure and metabolic syndrome patients. Using GradCAMs, we highlight the discriminative features identified by the model. ",

However, requiring strategyproofness or participation with respect to this preference extension only leaves room for rather undesirable SDSs such as random dictatorships. Hence, we focus on the natural but little understood pairwise comparison (PC) preference extension, which postulates that one lottery is preferred to another if the former is more likely to return a preferred outcome. In particular, we settle three open questions raised by Brandt (2017): (i) there is no Condorcet-consistent SDS that satisfies PC-strategyproofness; (ii) there is no anonymous and neutral SDS that satisfies PC-efficiency and PC-strategyproofness; and (iii) there is no anonymous and neutral SDS that satisfies PC-efficiency and strict PC-participation.

To tackle the aforementioned issues, we propose a new transfer learning method to obtain accurate and reliable models for few-shot regression and classification. The resulting method does not require episodic meta-learning and is called meta-free representation learning (MFRL). MFRL first finds low-rank representation generalizing well on meta-test tasks. Given the learned representation, probabilistic linear models are fine-tuned with few-shot samples to obtain models with well-calibrated uncertainty. The proposed method not only achieves the highest accuracy on a wide range of few-shot learning benchmark datasets but also correctly quantifies the prediction uncertainty. In addition, weight averaging and temperature scaling are effective in improving the accuracy and reliability of few-shot learning in existing meta-learning algorithms with a wide range of learning paradigms and model architectures.

    "abstract": "Data about individuals may contain private and sensitive information. The differential privacy (DP) was proposed to address the problem of protecting the privacy of each individual while keeping useful information about a population. Sealfon (2016) introduced a private graph model in which the graph topology is assumed to be public while the weight information is assumed to be private. That model can express hidden congestion patterns in a known transportation system. In this paper, we revisit the problem of privately releasing approximate distances between all pairs of vertices in (Sealfon 2016). Our goal is to minimize the additive error, namely the difference between the released distance and actual distance under private setting. We propose improved solutions to that problem for several cases. For the problem of privately releasing all-pairs distances, we show that for tree with depth $h$, we can release all-pairs distances with additive error $O(\\log^{1.5} h \\cdot \\log^{1.5} V)$ for fixed privacy parameter where $V$ the number of vertices in the tree, which improves the previous error bound $O(\\log^{2.5} V)$, since the size of $h$ can be as small as $O(\\log V)$. Our result implies that a $\\log V$ factor is saved, and the additive error in tree can be smaller than the error on array/path. Additionally, for the grid graph with arbitrary edge weights, we also propose a method to release all-pairs distances with additive error $\\tilde O(V^{3/4}) $ for fixed privacy parameters. On the application side, many cities like Manhattan are composed of horizontal streets and vertical avenues, which can be modeled as a grid graph. ",

    "abstract": "Risk assessment is a substantial problem for financial institutions that has been extensively studied both for its methodological richness and its various practical applications. With the expansion of inclusive finance, recent attentions are paid to micro and small-sized enterprises (MSEs). Compared with large companies, MSEs present a higher exposure rate to default owing to their insecure financial stability. Conventional efforts learn classifiers from historical data with elaborate feature engineering. However, the main obstacle for MSEs involves severe deficiency in credit-related information, which may degrade the performance of prediction. Besides, financial activities have diverse explicit and implicit relations, which have not been fully exploited for risk judgement in commercial banks. In particular, the observations on real data show that various relationships between company users have additional power in financial risk analysis. In this paper, we consider a graph of banking data, and propose a novel HIDAM model for the purpose. Specifically, we attempt to incorporate heterogeneous information network with rich attributes on multi-typed nodes and links for modeling the scenario of business banking service. To enhance feature representation of MSEs, we extract interactive information through meta-paths and fully exploit path information. Furthermore, we devise a hierarchical attention mechanism respectively to learn the importance of contents inside each meta-path and the importance of different metapahs. Experimental results verify that HIDAM outperforms state-of-the-art competitors on real-world banking data. ",

For the drug, our processing method is similar to that of GraphDTA, but uses two different graph convolution methods.

This model has a conformer-based architecture which takes as inputs a single channel each of raw and enhanced signals, and uses self-attention to derive a time-frequency mask. The enhanced input is generated by a multichannel adaptive noise cancellation algorithm known as Speech Cleaner, which makes use of noise context to derive its filter taps. The time-frequency mask is applied to the noisy input to produce enhanced output features for ASR. Detailed evaluations are presented with simulated and re-recorded datasets in speech-based and non-speech-based noise that show significant reduction in word error rate (WER) when using a large-scale state-of-the-art ASR model. It also will be shown to significantly outperform enhancement using a beamformer with ideal steering. The enhancement model is agnostic of the number of microphones and array configuration and, therefore, can be used with different microphone arrays without the need for retraining. It is demonstrated that performance improves with more microphones, up to 4, with each additional microphone providing a smaller marginal benefit. Specifically, for an SNR of -6dB, relative WER improvements of about 80\\% are shown in both noise conditions. ",

    "abstract": "Self-supervised neural language models have recently achieved unprecedented success, from natural language processing to learning the languages of biological sequences and organic molecules. These models have demonstrated superior performance in the generation, structure classification, and functional predictions for proteins and molecules with learned representations. However, most of the masking-based pre-trained language models are not designed for generative design, and their black-box nature makes it difficult to interpret their design logic. Here we propose BLMM Crystal Transformer, a neural network based probabilistic generative model for generative and tinkering design of inorganic materials. Our model is built on the blank filling language model for text generation and has demonstrated unique advantages in learning the \"materials grammars\" together with high-quality generation, interpretability, and data efficiency. It can generate chemically valid materials compositions with as high as 89.7\\% charge neutrality and 84.8\\% balanced electronegativity, which are more than 4 and 8 times higher compared to a pseudo random sampling baseline. The probabilistic generation process of BLMM allows it to recommend tinkering operations based on learned materials chemistry and makes it useful for materials doping. Combined with the TCSP crysal structure prediction algorithm, We have applied our model to discover a set of new materials as validated using DFT calculations. Our work thus brings the unsupervised transformer language models based generative artificial intelligence to inorganic materials.

However, in real-world settings, patients often suffer from loss of vision on time scales of years despite therapy, whereas the prediction of the visual acuity (VA) and the earliest possible detection of deterioration under real-life conditions is challenging due to heterogeneous and incomplete data. In this contribution, we present a workflow for the development of a research-compatible data corpus fusing different IT systems of the department of ophthalmology of a German maximum care hospital. The extensive data corpus allows predictive statements of the expected progression of a patient and his or her VA in each of the three diseases. Within our proposed multistage system, we classify the VA progression into the three groups of therapy \"winners\", \"stabilizers\", and \"losers\" (WSL scheme). Our OCT biomarker classification using an ensemble of deep neural networks results in a classification accuracy (F1-score) of over 98 %, enabling us to complete incomplete OCT documentations while allowing us to exploit them for a more precise VA modelling process. Our VA prediction requires at least four VA examinations and optionally OCT biomarkers from the same time period to predict the VA progression within a forecasted time frame. While achieving a prediction accuracy of up to 69 % (macro average F1-score) when considering all three WSL-based progression groups, this corresponds to an improvement by 11 % in comparison to our ophthalmic expertise (58 %).

In this work, the ability of a state-of-the-art GAN to learn the statistics of canonical stochastic image models (SIMs) that are relevant to objective assessment of image quality is investigated. It is shown that although the employed GAN successfully learned several basic first- and second-order statistics of the specific medical SIMs under consideration and generated images with high perceptual quality, it failed to correctly learn several per-image statistics pertinent to the these SIMs, highlighting the urgent need to assess medical image GANs in terms of objective measures of image quality.

Time-frequency masking based approaches have been shown to work well, but they need additional hyper-parameters to scale the mask to limit speech distortion. Such mask scalars are typically hand-tuned and chosen conservatively. In this work, we present a technique to predict mask scalars using an ASR-based loss in an end-to-end fashion, with minimal increase in the overall model size and complexity. We evaluate the approach on two robust ASR tasks: multichannel enhancement in the presence of speech and non-speech noise, and acoustic echo cancellation (AEC). Results show that the presented algorithm consistently improves word error rate (WER) without the need for any additional tuning over strong baselines that use hand-tuned hyper-parameters: up to 16% for multichannel enhancement in noisy conditions, and up to 7% for AEC.

The desired reference tracking is solved using the well-known flatness and Lyapunov approaches. The reference profile is obtained by solving the motion planning problem for the nominal plant. To robustify the closed-loop system in the presence of the disturbances and uncertainties, it is then augmented with PI feedback plus a discontinuous component responsible for rejecting matched disturbances with \\textit{a priori} known magnitude bounds. Such control law only requires the information of the system at the same boundary as the control input is located. The resulting dynamic controller globally exponentially stabilizes the error dynamics while also attenuating the influence of Lipschitz-in-time external disturbances and parameter uncertainties. For the case when the motion planning is performed over the uncertain plant, an exponential Input-to-State Stability is obtained, preserving the boundedness of the tracking error norm. The proposed controller relies on a discontinuous term that however passes through an integrator, thereby minimizing the chattering effect in the plant dynamics. The performance of the closed-loop system, thus designed, is illustrated in simulations under different kinds of reference trajectories in the presence of external disturbances and parameter uncertainties.

In these cases, vehicle relays can be employed to enhance the network topology to better serve those users. This paper leverages stochastic geometry to propose a novel framework for the performance analysis of heterogeneous vehicular networks with RSUs, vehicle relays, and vehicle users. We present a two-dimensional analytical model where the spatial dependence between RSUs, vehicle relays, vehicle users, and roads is accurately taken into account through a Cox point process structure. Assuming relays are backhauled to RSUs over a reserved wireless resource and users are associated with the closest RSU or relay, we derive the probability that the typical user is associated with either an RSU or a relay. Then, we derive the signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) coverage probability of the typical user. Finally, using the derived formulas, we evaluate the average effective rate of the typical user in the network. This allows us to determine the gain of the average effective rate of users that results from the deployment of relays in the network. ",

    "title": "Masked Spectrogram Modeling using Masked Autoencoders for Learning  General-purpose Audio Representation",
    "abstract": "Recent general-purpose audio representations show state-of-the-art performance on various audio tasks. These representations are pre-trained by self-supervised learning methods that create training signals from the input. For example, typical audio contrastive learning uses temporal relationships among input sounds to create training signals, whereas some methods use a difference among input views created by data augmentations. However, these training signals do not provide information derived from the intact input sound, which we think is suboptimal for learning representation that describes the input as it is. In this paper, we seek to learn audio representations from the input itself as supervision using a pretext task of auto-encoding of masked spectrogram patches, Masked Spectrogram Modeling (MSM, a variant of Masked Image Modeling applied to audio spectrogram). To implement MSM, we use Masked Autoencoders (MAE), an image self-supervised learning method. MAE learns to efficiently encode the small number of visible patches into latent representations to carry essential information for reconstructing a large number of masked patches. While training, MAE minimizes the reconstruction error, which uses the input as training signal, consequently achieving our goal. We conducted experiments on our MSM using MAE (MSM-MAE) models under the evaluation benchmark of the HEAR 2021 NeurIPS Challenge. Our MSM-MAE models outperformed the HEAR 2021 Challenge results on seven out of 15 tasks (e.g., accuracies of 73.4% on CREMA-D and 85.8% on LibriCount), while showing top performance on other tasks where specialized models perform better. We also investigate how the design choices of MSM-MAE impact the performance and conduct qualitative analysis of visualization outcomes to gain an understanding of learned representations. We make our code available online. ",

    "title": "Graph Neural Networks for Microbial Genome Recovery",
    "abstract": "Microbes have a profound impact on our health and environment, but our understanding of the diversity and function of microbial communities is severely limited. Through DNA sequencing of microbial communities (metagenomics), DNA fragments (reads) of the individual microbes can be obtained, which through assembly graphs can be combined into long contiguous DNA sequences (contigs). Given the complexity of microbial communities, single contig microbial genomes are rarely obtained. Instead, contigs are eventually clustered into bins, with each bin ideally making up a full genome. This process is referred to as metagenomic binning. Current state-of-the-art techniques for metagenomic binning rely only on the local features for the individual contigs. These techniques therefore fail to exploit the similarities between contigs as encoded by the assembly graph, in which the contigs are organized. In this paper, we propose to use Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to leverage the assembly graph when learning contig representations for metagenomic binning. Our method, VaeG-Bin, combines variational autoencoders for learning latent representations of the individual contigs, with GNNs for refining these representations by taking into account the neighborhood structure of the contigs in the assembly graph. We explore several types of GNNs and demonstrate that VaeG-Bin recovers more high-quality genomes than other state-of-the-art binners on both simulated and real-world datasets. ",

    "abstract": "During the first years of life, infant vocalizations change considerably, as infants develop the vocalization skills that enable them to produce speech sounds. Characterizations based on specific acoustic features, protophone categories, or phonetic transcription are able to provide a representation of the sounds infants make at different ages and in different contexts but do not fully describe how sounds are perceived by listeners, can be inefficient to obtain at large scales, and are difficult to visualize in two dimensions without additional statistical processing. Machine-learning-based approaches provide the opportunity to complement these characterizations with purely data-driven representations of infant sounds. Here, we use spectral features extraction and unsupervised machine learning, specifically Uniform Manifold Approximation (UMAP), to obtain a novel 2-dimensional spatial representation of infant and caregiver vocalizations extracted from day-long home recordings. UMAP yields a continuous and well-distributed space conducive to certain analyses of infant vocal development. For instance, we found that the dispersion of infant vocalization acoustics within the 2-D space over a day increased from 3 to 9 months, and then decreased from 9 to 18 months. The method also permits analysis of similarity between infant and adult vocalizations, which also shows changes with infant age. ",

    "abstract": "The DPRM (Davis-Putnam-Robinson-Matiyasevich) theorem is the main step in the negative resolution of Hilbert's 10th problem. Almost three decades of work on the problem have resulted in several equally surprising results. These include the existence of diophantine equations with a reduced number of variables, as well as the explicit construction of polynomials that represent specific sets, in particular the set of primes. In this work, we formalize these constructions in the Mizar system. We focus on the set of prime numbers and its explicit representation using 10 variables. It is the smallest representation known today. For this, we show that the exponential function is diophantine, together with the same properties for the binomial coefficient and factorial. This formalization is the next step in the research on formal approaches to diophantine sets following the DPRM theorem. ",

However, there are indications that certain quantum machine learning algorithms might result in improved training capabilities with respect to their classical counterparts -- which might be particularly beneficial in situations with little training data available. Such situations naturally arise in medical classification tasks. Within this paper, different hybrid quantum-classical convolutional neural networks (QCCNN) with varying quantum circuit designs and encoding techniques are proposed. They are applied to two- and three-dimensional medical imaging data, e.g. featuring different, potentially malign, lesions in computed tomography scans. The performance of these QCCNNs is already similar to the one of their classical counterparts -- therefore encouraging further studies towards the direction of applying these algorithms within medical imaging tasks.

    "abstract": "Extensive data labeling on neurophysiological signals is often prohibitively expensive or impractical, as it may require particular infrastructure or domain expertise. To address the appetite for data of deep learning methods, we present for the first time a Fourier-based modeling framework for self-supervised pre-training of neurophysiology signals. The intuition behind our approach is simple: frequency and phase distribution of neurophysiology signals reveal the underlying neurophysiological activities of the brain and muscle. Our approach first randomly masks out a portion of the input signal and then predicts the missing information from either spatiotemporal or the Fourier domain. Pre-trained models can be potentially used for downstream tasks such as sleep stage classification using electroencephalogram (EEG) signals and gesture recognition using electromyography (EMG) signals. Unlike contrastive-based methods, which strongly rely on carefully hand-crafted augmentations and siamese structure, our approach works reasonably well with a simple transformer encoder with no augmentation requirements. By evaluating our method on several benchmark datasets, including both EEG and EMG, we show that our modeling approach improves downstream neurophysiological related tasks by a large margin. ",
