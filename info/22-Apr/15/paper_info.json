    "abstract": "Active camera relocalization (ACR) is a new problem in computer vision that significantly reduces the false alarm caused by image distortions due to camera pose misalignment in fine-grained change detection (FGCD). Despite the fruitful achievements that ACR can support, it still remains a challenging problem caused by the unstable results of relative pose estimation, especially for outdoor scenes, where the lighting condition is out of control, i.e., the twice observations may have highly varied illuminations. This paper studies an illumination-invariant active camera relocalization method, it improves both in relative pose estimation and scale estimation. We use plane segments as an intermediate representation to facilitate feature matching, thus further boosting pose estimation robustness and reliability under lighting variances. Moreover, we construct a linear system to obtain the absolute scale in each ACR iteration by minimizing the image warping error, thus, significantly reduce the time consume of ACR process, it is nearly $1.6$ times faster than the state-of-the-art ACR strategy. Our work greatly expands the feasibility of real-world fine-grained change monitoring tasks for cultural heritages. Extensive experiments tests and real-world applications verify the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed pose estimation method using for ACR tasks. ",

    "abstract": "Learning robot policies via preference-based reward learning is an increasingly popular method for customizing robot behavior. However, in recent years, there has been a growing body of anecdotal evidence that learning reward functions from preferences is prone to spurious correlations and reward gaming or hacking behaviors. While there is much anecdotal, empirical, and theoretical analysis of causal confusion and reward gaming behaviors both in reinforcement learning and imitation learning approaches that directly map from states to actions, we provide the first systematic study of causal confusion in the context of learning reward functions from preferences. To facilitate this study, we identify a set of three preference learning benchmark domains where we observe causal confusion when learning from offline datasets of pairwise trajectory preferences: a simple reacher domain, an assistive feeding domain, and an itch-scratching domain. To gain insight into this observed causal confusion, we present a sensitivity analysis that explores the effect of different factors--including the type of training data, reward model capacity, and feature dimensionality--on the robustness of rewards learned from preferences. We find evidence that learning rewards from pairwise trajectory preferences is highly sensitive and non-robust to spurious features and increasing model capacity, but not as sensitive to the type of training data.

    "abstract": "Recently a model for the interplay between homophily-based appraisal dynamics and influence-based opinion dynamics has been proposed. The model explores for the first time how the opinions of a group of agents on a certain number of issues/topics is influenced by the agents' mutual appraisal and, conversely, the agents' mutual appraisal is updated based on the agents' opinions on the various issues, according to a homophily model. In this paper we show that a simplified (and, in some situations, more feasible) version of the model, that accounts only for the signs of the agents' appraisals rather than for their numerical values, provides an equally accurate and effective model of the opinion dynamics in small networks. The equilibria reached by this model correspond, almost surely, to situations in which the agents' network is complete and structurally balanced. On the other hand, we ensure that such equlibria can always be reached in a finite number of steps, and, differently from the original model, we rule out other types of equilibria that correspond to disconnected social networks.

For this purpose, two machine learning algorithms, a Multilayer Perceptron and a Long Short-Term Memory network, are trained and compared with respect to their prediction accuracy and the required amount of training data. The training is performed using synthetic, normally distributed data that is realistic for automotive applications. A finite element model of a simple bipolar chip resistor in surface mount technology configuration is used to numerically compute the synthetic data. As a result, both machine learning algorithms show a relevant accuracy for the prediction of accumulated creep strains. With a training data length of 350 hours (12.5% of the available training data), both models show a constantly good fitting performance of $R^2$ of 0.72 for the Multilayer Perceptron and $R^2$ of 0.87 for the Long Short-Term Memory network. The prediction errors of the accumulated creep strains are less than 10% with an amount of 350 hours training data and decreases to less than 5 % when using further data. Therefore, both approaches are promising for the lifetime prediction directly on the electronic device. ",

    "abstract": "Multiscale topology optimization (M-TO) entails generating an optimal global topology, and an optimal set of microstructures at a smaller scale, for a physics-constrained problem. With the advent of additive manufacturing, M-TO has gained significant prominence. However, generating optimal microstructures at various locations can be computationally very expensive. As an alternate, graded multiscale topology optimization (GM-TO) has been proposed where one or more pre-selected and graded (parameterized) microstructural topologies are used to fill the domain optimally. This leads to a significant reduction in computation while retaining many of the benefits of M-TO. A successful GM-TO framework must: (1) be capable of efficiently handling numerous pre-selected microstructures, (2) be able to continuously switch between these microstructures during optimization, (3) ensure that the partition of unity is satisfied, and (4) discourage microstructure mixing at termination. In this paper, we propose to meet these requirements by exploiting the unique classification capacity of neural networks. Specifically, we propose a graded multiscale topology optimization using neural-network (GM-TOuNN) framework with the following features: (1) the number of design variables is only weakly dependent on the number of pre-selected microstructures, (2) it guarantees partition of unity while discouraging microstructure mixing, and (3) it supports automatic differentiation, thereby eliminating manual sensitivity analysis. The proposed framework is illustrated through several examples. ",

However, traditional statistics and shallow machine learning-based approaches in anomaly detection in the IAQ area could not detect anomalies involving the observation of correlations across several data points (i.e., often referred to as long-term dependences). We propose a hybrid deep learning model that combines LSTM with Autoencoder for anomaly detection tasks in IAQ to address this issue. In our approach, the LSTM network is comprised of multiple LSTM cells that work with each other to learn the long-term dependences of the data in a time-series sequence. Autoencoder identifies the optimal threshold based on the reconstruction loss rates evaluated on every data across all time-series sequences. Our experimental results, based on the Dunedin CO2 time-series dataset obtained through a real-world deployment of the schools in New Zealand, demonstrate a very high and robust accuracy rate (99.50%) that outperforms other similar models.

    "abstract": "Anomaly detection has emerged as a popular technique for detecting malicious activities in local area networks (LANs). Various aspects of LAN anomaly detection have been widely studied. Nonetheless, the privacy concern about individual users or their relationship in LAN has not been thoroughly explored in the prior work. In some realistic cases, the anomaly detection analysis needs to be carried out by an external party, located outside the LAN. Thus, it is important for the LAN admin to release LAN data to this party in a private way in order to protect privacy of LAN users; at the same time, the released data must also preserve the utility of being able to detect anomalies. This paper investigates the possibility of privately releasing ARP data that can later be used to identify anomalies in LAN. We present four approaches and show that they satisfy different levels of differential privacy - a rigorous and provable notion for quantifying privacy loss in a system. Our real-world experimental results confirm practical feasibility of our approaches. With a proper privacy budget, all of our approaches preserve more than 75% utility of detecting anomalies in the released data. ",

The most important motivation of this research is that we can use the very simple element-wise multiplication operation to replace the image convolution in frequency domain based on Cross-Correlation Theorem. We further introduce Weight Fixation Mechanism to alleviate over-fitting, and analyze the working behavior of Batch Normalization, Leaky ReLU and Dropout in frequency domain to design their counterparts for CEMNet. Also, to deal with complex inputs brought by DFT, we design two branch network structure for CEMNet. Experimental results imply that CEMNet works well in frequency domain, and achieve good performance on MNIST and CIFAR-10 databases. To our knowledge, CEMNet is the first model trained in Fourier Domain that achieves more than 70\\% validation accuracy on CIFAR-10 database. ",

Despite numerous advantages, low computing resources at IoT devices and high communication costs for exchanging model parameters make applications of FL in massive IoT networks very limited. In this work, we develop a novel compression scheme for FL, called high-compression federated learning (HCFL), for very large scale IoT networks. HCFL can reduce the data load for FL processes without changing their structure and hyperparameters. In this way, we not only can significantly reduce communication costs, but also make intensive learning processes more adaptable on low-computing resource IoT devices. Furthermore, we investigate a relationship between the number of IoT devices and the convergence level of the FL model and thereby better assess the quality of the FL process. We demonstrate our HCFL scheme in both simulations and mathematical analyses. Our proposed theoretical research can be used as a minimum level of satisfaction, proving that the FL process can achieve good performance when a determined configuration is met. Therefore, we show that HCFL is applicable in any FL-integrated networks with numerous IoT devices. ",

While many studies focus on informing DNNs with physics through differential equations or numerical simulation, much may be gained through integration of simplified relationships. To evaluate this hypothesis, a number of thin rectangular plates simply-supported on all edges are simulated for five materials. With plate dimensions and material properties as input features and fundamental natural frequency as the sole output, predictive performance of a purely data-driven DNN-based model is compared with models using additional inputs computed from simplified physical relationships among baseline parameters, namely plate weight, modulus of rigidity, and shear modulus. To better understand the benefit to model accuracy, these additional features are injected into various single and multiple DNN layers, and trained with four different dataset sizes. When these physics-enhanced models are evaluated against independent data of the same materials and similar dimensions to the training sets, supplementation with simplified physics-based parameters provides little reduction in prediction error over the baseline for models trained with dataset sizes of 60 and greater, although small improvement from 19.3% to 16.1% occurs when trained with a sparse size of 30. Conversely, notable accuracy gains occur when the independent test data is of material and dimensions not conforming to the training set. Specifically, when physics-enhanced data is injected into multiple DNN layers, reductions in error from 33.2% to 19.6%, 34.9% to 19.9%, 35.8% to 22.4%, and 43.0% to 28.4% are achieved for training dataset sizes of 261, 117, 60, and 30, respectively, demonstrating attainment of a degree of generalizability.

Image patterns eliciting highest responses are diagnostic of the coding content of the neuron. To find these patterns, we have used black-box optimizers to search a 4096d image space, leading to the evolution of images that maximize neuronal responses. Although genetic algorithm (GA) has been commonly used, there haven't been any systematic investigations to reveal the best performing optimizer or the underlying principles necessary to improve them. Here, we conducted a large scale in silico benchmark of optimizers for activation maximization and found that Covariance Matrix Adaptation (CMA) excelled in its achieved activation. We compared CMA against GA and found that CMA surpassed the maximal activation of GA by 66% in silico and 44% in vivo. We analyzed the structure of Evolution trajectories and found that the key to success was not covariance matrix adaptation, but local search towards informative dimensions and an effective step size decay. Guided by these principles and the geometry of the image manifold, we developed SphereCMA optimizer which competed well against CMA, proving the validity of the identified principles.

    "abstract": "Measures to predict 30-day readmission are considered an important quality factor for hospitals as accurate predictions can reduce the overall cost of care by identifying high risk patients before they are discharged. While recent deep learning-based studies have shown promising empirical results on readmission prediction, several limitations exist that may hinder widespread clinical utility, such as (a) only patients with certain conditions are considered, (b) existing approaches do not leverage data temporality, (c) individual admissions are assumed independent of each other, which is unrealistic, (d) prior studies are usually limited to single source of data and single center data. To address these limitations, we propose a multimodal, modality-agnostic spatiotemporal graph neural network (MM-STGNN) for prediction of 30-day all-cause hospital readmission that fuses multimodal in-patient longitudinal data. By training and evaluating our methods using longitudinal chest radiographs and electronic health records from two independent centers, we demonstrate that MM-STGNN achieves AUROC of 0.79 on both primary and external datasets. Furthermore, MM-STGNN significantly outperforms the current clinical reference standard, LACE+ score (AUROC=0.61), on the primary dataset. For subset populations of patients with heart and vascular disease, our model also outperforms baselines on predicting 30-day readmission (e.g., 3.7 point improvement in AUROC in patients with heart disease). Lastly, qualitative model interpretability analysis indicates that while patients' primary diagnoses were not explicitly used to train the model, node features crucial for model prediction directly reflect patients' primary diagnoses. Importantly, our MM-STGNN is agnostic to node feature modalities and could be utilized to integrate multimodal data for triaging patients in various downstream resource allocation tasks. ",

However, our analysis of existing results shows that omission faults pose a significant challenge to these techniques. For template based approaches, omission faults provide no location to apply templates to; for learning based approaches that formulate repair as Neural Machine Translation (NMT), omission faults similarly do not provide the faulty code to translate. To address these issues, we propose GLAD, a novel learning-based repair technique that specifically targets if-clause synthesis. GLAD does not require a faulty line as it is based on generative Language Models (LMs) instead of machine translation; consequently, it can repair omission faults. GLAD intelligently constrains the language model using a type-based grammar. Further, it efficiently reduces the validation cost by performing dynamic ranking of candidate patches using a debugger. Thanks to the shift from translation to synthesis, GLAD is highly orthogonal to existing techniques: GLAD can correctly fix 16 Defects4J v1.2 faults that previous NMT-based techniques could not, while maintaining a reasonable runtime cost, underscoring its utility as an APR tool and potential to complement existing tools in practice. An inspection of the bugs that GLAD fixes reveals that GLAD can quickly generate expressions that would be challenging for other techniques. ",

CNN backbones have met bottleneck due to lack of long-range dependencies and global context modeling power. Recent works proposed to combine vision transformer with CNN, due to its strong global capture ability and learning capability. However, most works are limited to simply applying pure transformer with several fatal flaws (i.e., lack of inductive bias, heavy computation and little consideration for 3D data). Therefore, designing an elegant and efficient vision transformer learner for dense prediction in medical volume is promising and challenging. In this paper, we propose a novel 3D Shuffle-Mixer network of a new Local Vision Transformer-MLP paradigm for medical dense prediction. In our network, a local vision transformer block is utilized to shuffle and learn spatial context from full-view slices of rearranged volume, a residual axial-MLP is designed to mix and capture remaining volume context in a slice-aware manner, and a MLP view aggregator is employed to project the learned full-view rich context to the volume feature in a view-aware manner. Moreover, an Adaptive Scaled Enhanced Shortcut is proposed for local vision transformer to enhance feature along spatial and channel dimensions adaptively, and a CrossMerge is proposed to skip-connects the multi-scale feature appropriately in the pyramid architecture. Extensive experiments demonstrate the proposed model outperforms other state-of-the-art medical dense prediction methods. ",

    "abstract": "Salient object detection (SOD) extracts meaningful contents from an input image. RGB-based SOD methods lack the complementary depth clues; hence, providing limited performance for complex scenarios. Similarly, RGB-D models process RGB and depth inputs, but the depth data availability during testing may hinder the model's practical applicability. This paper exploits only RGB images, estimates depth from RGB, and leverages the intermediate depth features. We employ a pyramidal attention structure to extract multi-level convolutional-transformer features to process initial stage representations and further enhance the subsequent ones. At each stage, the backbone transformer model produces global receptive fields and computing in parallel to attain fine-grained global predictions refined by our residual convolutional attention decoder for optimal saliency prediction. We report significantly improved performance against 21 and 40 state-of-the-art SOD methods on eight RGB and RGB-D datasets, respectively. Consequently, we present a new SOD perspective of generating RGB-D SOD without acquiring depth data during training and testing and assist RGB methods with depth clues for improved performance.

    "abstract": "Collecting accurate and fine-grain information about the music people like, dislike and actually listen to has long been a challenge for sociologists. As millions of people now use online music streaming services, research can build upon the individual listening history data that are collected by these platforms. Individual interviews in particular can benefit from such data, by allowing the interviewers to immerse themselves in the musical universe of consenting respondents, and thus ask them contextualized questions and get more precise answers. Designing a visual exploration tool allowing such an immersion is however difficult, because of the volume and heterogeneity of the listening data, the unequal \"visual literacy\" of the prospective users, or the interviewers' potential lack of knowledge of the music listened to by the respondents. In this case study we discuss the design and evaluation of such a tool. Designed with social scientists, its purpose is to help them in preparing and conducting semi-structured interviews that address various aspects of the listening experience. It was evaluated during thirty interviews with consenting users of a streaming platform in France. ",

    "abstract": "The principal task in supervised neural machine translation (NMT) is to learn to generate target sentences conditioned on the source inputs from a set of parallel sentence pairs, and thus produce a model capable of generalizing to unseen instances. However, it is commonly observed that the generalization performance of the model is highly influenced by the amount of parallel data used in training. Although data augmentation is widely used to enrich the training data, conventional methods with discrete manipulations fail to generate diverse and faithful training samples. In this paper, we present a novel data augmentation paradigm termed Continuous Semantic Augmentation (CsaNMT), which augments each training instance with an adjacency semantic region that could cover adequate variants of literal expression under the same meaning. We conduct extensive experiments on both rich-resource and low-resource settings involving various language pairs, including WMT14 English-{German,French}, NIST Chinese-English and multiple low-resource IWSLT translation tasks. The provided empirical evidences show that CsaNMT sets a new level of performance among existing augmentation techniques, improving on the state-of-the-art by a large margin.

    "abstract": "This work presents a deep learning approach for vehicle detection in satellite video. Vehicle detection is perhaps impossible in single EO satellite images due to the tininess of vehicles (4-10 pixel) and their similarity to the background. Instead, we consider satellite video which overcomes the lack of spatial information by temporal consistency of vehicle movement. A new spatiotemporal model of a compact $3 \\times 3$ convolutional, neural network is proposed which neglects pooling layers and uses leaky ReLUs. Then we use a reformulation of the output heatmap including Non-Maximum-Suppression (NMS) for the final segmentation. Empirical results on two new annotated satellite videos reconfirm the applicability of this approach for vehicle detection. They more importantly indicate that pre-training on WAMI data and then fine-tuning on few annotated video frames for a new video is sufficient. In our experiment only five annotated images yield a $F_1$ score of 0.81 on a new video showing more complex traffic patterns than the Las Vegas video. Our best result on Las Vegas is a $F_1$ score of 0.87 which makes the proposed approach a leading method for this benchmark. ",

    "abstract": "The ubiquity of implicit feedback makes them the default choice to build modern recommender systems. Generally speaking, observed interactions are considered as positive samples, while unobserved interactions are considered as negative ones. However, implicit feedback is inherently noisy because of the ubiquitous presence of noisy-positive and noisy-negative interactions. Recently, some studies have noticed the importance of denoising implicit feedback for recommendations, and enhanced the robustness of recommendation models to some extent. Nonetheless, they typically fail to (1) capture the hard yet clean interactions for learning comprehensive user preference, and (2) provide a universal denoising solution that can be applied to various kinds of recommendation models. In this paper, we thoroughly investigate the memorization effect of recommendation models, and propose a new denoising paradigm, i.e., Self-Guided Denoising Learning (SGDL), which is able to collect memorized interactions at the early stage of the training (i.e., \"noise-resistant\" period), and leverage those data as denoising signals to guide the following training (i.e., \"noise-sensitive\" period) of the model in a meta-learning manner. Besides, our method can automatically switch its learning phase at the memorization point from memorization to self-guided learning, and select clean and informative memorized data via a novel adaptive denoising scheduler to improve the robustness. We incorporate SGDL with four representative recommendation models (i.e., NeuMF, CDAE, NGCF and LightGCN) and different loss functions (i.e., binary cross-entropy and BPR loss). The experimental results on three benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of SGDL over the state-of-the-art denoising methods like T-CE, IR, DeCA, and even state-of-the-art robust graph-based methods like SGCN and SGL.

    "abstract": "For the 2D laser-based tasks, e.g., people detection and people tracking, leg detection is usually the first step. Thus, it carries great weight in determining the performance of people detection and people tracking. However, many leg detectors ignore the inevitable noise and the multiscale characteristics of the laser scan, which makes them sensitive to the unreliable features of point cloud and further degrades the performance of the leg detector. In this paper, we propose a multiscale adaptive-switch Random Forest (MARF) to overcome these two challenges. Firstly, the adaptive-switch decision tree is designed to use noisesensitive features to conduct weighted classification and noiseinvariant features to conduct binary classification, which makes our detector perform more robust to noise. Secondly, considering the multiscale property that the sparsity of the 2D point cloud is proportional to the length of laser beams, we design a multiscale random forest structure to detect legs at different distances. Moreover, the proposed approach allows us to discover a sparser human leg from point clouds than others. Consequently, our method shows an improved performance compared to other state-of-the-art leg detectors on the challenging Moving Legs dataset and retains the whole pipeline at a speed of 60+ FPS on lowcomputational laptops. Moreover, we further apply the proposed MARF to the people detection and tracking system, achieving a considerable gain in all metrics. ",

    "abstract": "We propose a one-step person detector for topview omnidirectional indoor scenes based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs). While state of the art person detectors reach competitive results on perspective images, missing CNN architectures as well as training data that follows the distortion of omnidirectional images makes current approaches not applicable to our data. The method predicts bounding boxes of multiple persons directly in omnidirectional images without perspective transformation, which reduces overhead of pre- and post-processing and enables real-time performance. The basic idea is to utilize transfer learning to fine-tune CNNs trained on perspective images with data augmentation techniques for detection in omnidirectional images. We fine-tune two variants of Single Shot MultiBox detectors (SSDs). The first one uses Mobilenet v1 FPN as feature extractor (moSSD). The second one uses ResNet50 v1 FPN (resSSD). Both models are pre-trained on Microsoft Common Objects in Context (COCO) dataset. We fine-tune both models on PASCAL VOC07 and VOC12 datasets, specifically on class person. Random 90-degree rotation and random vertical flipping are used for data augmentation in addition to the methods proposed by original SSD. We reach an average precision (AP) of 67.3 % with moSSD and 74.9 % with resSSD onthe evaluation dataset. To enhance the fine-tuning process, we add a subset of HDA Person dataset and a subset of PIROPOdatabase and reduce the number of perspective images to PASCAL VOC07. The AP rises to 83.2 % for moSSD and 86.3 % for resSSD, respectively. The average inference speed is 28 ms per image for moSSD and 38 ms per image for resSSD using Nvidia Quadro P6000. Our method is applicable to other CNN-based object detectors and can potentially generalize for detecting other objects in omnidirectional images. ",

More precisely, we design a teacher-student approach in which the teacher produces surrogate annotations on the unlabeled data to be used later for training a student which has the same architecture as the teacher. Furthermore, we introduce three training loss parametrizations that allow the student to doubt the predictions of the teacher during training depending on the proposal confidence score. We show that including unlabeled data in the training process allows to substantially improve the performances of the detection network trained only on the labeled data. Finally, we provide a thorough performance study including different proportions of labeled and unlabeled data, and establish the first benchmark on the new SoccerNet-v3 detection task, with an mAP of 52.3%.

    "abstract": "Deep Learning (DL) models have been widely used to support code completion. These models, once properly trained, can take as input an incomplete code component (e.g., an incomplete function) and predict the missing tokens to finalize it. GitHub Copilot is an example of code recommender built by training a DL model on millions of open source repositories: The source code of these repositories acts as training data, allowing the model to learn \"how to program\". The usage of such a code is usually regulated by Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) licenses, that establish under which conditions the licensed code can be redistributed or modified. As of Today, it is unclear whether the code generated by DL models trained on open source code should be considered as \"new\" or as \"derivative\" work, with possible implications on license infringements. In this work, we run a large-scale study investigating the extent to which DL models tend to clone code from their training set when recommending code completions. Such an exploratory study can help in assessing the magnitude of the potential licensing issues mentioned before: If these models tend to generate new code that is unseen in the training set, then licensing issues are unlikely to occur. Otherwise, a revision of these licenses urges to regulate how the code generated by these models should be treated when used, for example, in a commercial setting. Highlights from our results show that ~$10% to ~0.1% of the predictions generated by a state-of-the-art DL-based code completion tool are Type-1 clones of instances in the training set, depending on the size of the predicted code. Long predictions are unlikely to be cloned. ",

    "abstract": "Weakly supervised object detection (WSOD), which is an effective way to train an object detection model using only image-level annotations, has attracted considerable attention from researchers. However, most of the existing methods, which are based on multiple instance learning (MIL), tend to localize instances to the discriminative parts of salient objects instead of the entire content of all objects. In this paper, we propose a WSOD framework called the Spatial Likelihood Voting with Self-knowledge Distillation Network (SLV-SD Net). In this framework, we introduce a spatial likelihood voting (SLV) module to converge region proposal localization without bounding box annotations. Specifically, in every iteration during training, all the region proposals in a given image act as voters voting for the likelihood of each category in the spatial dimensions. After dilating the alignment on the area with large likelihood values, the voting results are regularized as bounding boxes, which are then used for the final classification and localization. Based on SLV, we further propose a self-knowledge distillation (SD) module to refine the feature representations of the given image. The likelihood maps generated by the SLV module are used to supervise the feature learning of the backbone network, encouraging the network to attend to wider and more diverse areas of the image. Extensive experiments on the PASCAL VOC 2007/2012 and MS-COCO datasets demonstrate the excellent performance of SLV-SD Net. In addition, SLV-SD Net produces new state-of-the-art results on these benchmarks. ",

In this ongoing research area, the end-to-end models are more favoured than traditional approaches requiring signal transformation pre-classification. They can eliminate the need for prior information from experts and the extraction of handcrafted features. However, although several deep learning algorithms have been already proposed in the literature, achieving high accuracies for classifying motor movements or mental tasks, they often face a lack of interpretability and therefore are not quite favoured by the neuroscience community. The reasons behind this issue can be the high number of parameters and the sensitivity of deep neural networks to capture tiny yet unrelated discriminative features. We propose an end-to-end deep learning architecture called EEG-ITNet and a more comprehensible method to visualise the network learned patterns. Using inception modules and causal convolutions with dilation, our model can extract rich spectral, spatial, and temporal information from multi-channel EEG signals with less complexity (in terms of the number of trainable parameters) than other existing end-to-end architectures, such as EEG-Inception and EEG-TCNet. By an exhaustive evaluation on dataset 2a from BCI competition IV and OpenBMI motor imagery dataset, EEG-ITNet shows up to 5.9\\% improvement in the classification accuracy in different scenarios with statistical significance compared to its competitors.

Aspect detection helps product owners and service providers to identify shortcomings and prioritize customers' needs, and hence, maintain revenues and mitigate customer churn. Existing methods focus on detecting the surface form of an aspect by training supervised learning methods that fall short when aspects are latent in reviews. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised method to extract latent occurrences of aspects. Specifically, we assume that a customer undergoes a two-stage hypothetical generative process when writing a review: (1) deciding on an aspect amongst the set of aspects available for the product or service, and (2) writing the opinion words that are more interrelated to the chosen aspect from the set of all words available in a language. We employ latent Dirichlet allocation to learn the latent aspects distributions for generating the reviews. Experimental results on benchmark datasets show that our proposed method is able to improve the state of the art when the aspects are latent with no surface form in reviews. ",

    "abstract": "A trust management system (TMS) is an integral component of any IoT network. A reliable trust management system must guarantee the network security, data integrity, and act as a referee that promotes legitimate devices, and punishes any malicious activities. Trust scores assigned by TMSs reflect devices' reputations, which can help predict the future behaviours of network entities and subsequently judge the reliability of different network entities in IoT networks. Many TMSs have been proposed in the literature, these systems are designed for small-scale trust attacks, and can deal with attacks where a malicious device tries to undermine TMS by spreading fake trust reports. However, these systems are prone to large-scale trust attacks. To address this problem, in this paper, we propose a TMS for large-scale IoT systems called Trust2Vec, which can manage trust relationships in large-scale IoT systems and can mitigate large-scale trust attacks that are performed by hundreds of malicious devices. Trust2Vec leverages a random-walk network exploration algorithm that navigates the trust relationship among devices and computes trust network embeddings, which enables it to analyze the latent network structure of trust relationships, even if there is no direct trust rating between two malicious devices. To detect large-scale attacks, suck as self-promoting and bad-mouthing, we propose a network embeddings community detection algorithm that detects and blocks communities of malicious nodes. The effectiveness of Trust2Vec is validated through large-scale IoT network simulation. The results show that Trust2Vec can achieve up to 94\\% mitigation rate in various network scenarios. ",

    "abstract": "Atmospheric turbulence distorts visual imagery and is always problematic for information interpretation by both human and machine. Most well-developed approaches to remove atmospheric turbulence distortion are model-based. However, these methods require high computation and large memory preventing their feasibility of real-time operation. Deep learning-based approaches have hence gained more attention but currently work efficiently only on static scenes. This paper presents a novel learning-based framework offering short temporal spanning to support dynamic scenes. We exploit complex-valued convolutions as phase information, altered by atmospheric turbulence, is captured better than using ordinary real-valued convolutions. Two concatenated modules are proposed. The first module aims to remove geometric distortions and, if enough memory, the second module is applied to refine micro details of the videos. Experimental results show that our proposed framework efficiently mitigate the atmospheric turbulence distortion and significantly outperforms the existing methods. ",

    "abstract": "Recent high-profile incidents have exposed security risks in control systems. Particularly important and safety-critical modules for security analysis are estimation and control (E&C). Prior works have analyzed the security of E&C for linear, time-invariant systems; however, there are few analyses of nonlinear systems despite their broad use. In an effort to facilitate identifying vulnerabilities in control systems, in this work we establish a class of optimal attacks on nonlinear E&C. Specifically, we define two attack objectives and illustrate that realizing the optimal attacks against the widely-adopted extended Kalman filter with industry-standard anomaly detection is equivalent to solving convex quadratically-constrained quadratic programs. Given an appropriate information model for the attacker (i.e., a specified amount of attacker knowledge), we provide practical relaxations on the optimal attacks to allow for their computation at runtime. We also show that the difference between the optimal and relaxed attacks is bounded. Finally, we illustrate the use of the introduced attack designs on a case-study. ",

In our approach we demonstrate the development of a framework which makes use of graph neural networks to learn the physical constraints of the power flow. We present our model architecture on which we perform unsupervised training to learn a general solution of the AC power flow formulation that is independent of the specific topologies and supply tasks used for training.

Thus, we want to characterise manifolds implicitly defined by level sets. Specifically, this characterisation should be of a global parametric form, which is especially useful for different informed data exploration tasks, such as building grid-based approximations, sampling points along the level curves, or finding trajectories on the manifold. However, global parameterisations can only exist if the level sets are connected. For this purpose, we introduce a novel and flexible class of neural networks that generalise input-convex networks. These networks represent functions that are guaranteed to have connected level sets forming smooth manifolds on the input space. We further show that global parameterisations of these level sets can be always found efficiently. Lastly, we demonstrate that our novel technique for characterising invariances is a powerful generative data exploration tool in real-world applications, such as computational chemistry. ",

    "abstract": "With the spreading of hate speech on social media in recent years, automatic detection of hate speech is becoming a crucial task and has attracted attention from various communities. This task aims to recognize online posts (e.g., tweets) that contain hateful information. The peculiarities of languages in social media, such as short and poorly written content, lead to the difficulty of learning semantics and capturing discriminative features of hate speech. Previous studies have utilized additional useful resources, such as sentiment hashtags, to improve the performance of hate speech detection. Hashtags are added as input features serving either as sentiment-lexicons or extra context information. However, our close investigation shows that directly leveraging these features without considering their context may introduce noise to classifiers. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to leverage sentiment hashtags to enhance hate speech detection in a natural language inference framework. We design a novel framework SRIC that simultaneously performs two tasks: (1) semantic relation inference between online posts and sentiment hashtags, and (2) sentiment classification on these posts. The semantic relation inference aims to encourage the model to encode sentiment-indicative information into representations of online posts. We conduct extensive experiments on two real-world datasets and demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework compared with state-of-the-art representation learning models. ",

Our main motivation for focusing on such a front-end classifier rather than other complex architectures is balancing recognition accuracy and the total number of training parameters. Herein, we measure the impact of different settings required for generating more informative Mel-frequency cepstral coefficient (MFCC), short-time Fourier transform (STFT), and discrete wavelet transform (DWT) representations on our front-end model. This measurement involves comparing the classification performance over the adversarial robustness. We demonstrate an inverse relationship between recognition accuracy and model robustness against six benchmarking attack algorithms on the balance of average budgets allocated by the adversary and the attack cost. Moreover, our experimental results have shown that while the ResNet-18 model trained on DWT spectrograms achieves a high recognition accuracy, attacking this model is relatively more costly for the adversary than other 2D representations. We also report some results on different convolutional neural network architectures such as ResNet-34, ResNet-56, AlexNet, and GoogLeNet, SB-CNN, and LSTM-based. ",

In Information Retrieval (IR), the ranking pipeline is generally decomposed in two stages: the first stage focus on retrieving a candidate set from the whole collection. The second stage re-ranks the candidate set by relying on more complex models. Recently, Siamese-BERT models have been used as first stage ranker to replace or complement the traditional bag-of-word models. However, indexing and searching a large document collection require efficient similarity search on dense vectors and this is why ANN techniques come into play. Since composite codes are naturally sparse, we first show how CCSA can learn efficient parallel inverted index thanks to an uniformity regularizer. Second, CCSA can be used as a binary quantization method and we propose to combine it with the recent graph based ANN techniques. Our experiments on MSMARCO dataset reveal that CCSA outperforms IVF with product quantization. Furthermore, CCSA binary quantization is beneficial for the index size, and memory usage for the graph-based HNSW method, while maintaining a good level of recall and MRR. Third, we compare with recent supervised quantization methods for image retrieval and find that CCSA is able to outperform them. ",

    "abstract": "This paper considers the distributed robust suboptimal consensus control problem of linear multi-agent systems, with both H2 and H_infty performance requirements. A novel two-step complementary design approach is proposed. In the first step, a distributed control law is designed for the nominal multi-agent system to achieve consensus with a prescribed H2 performance. In the second step, an extra control input, depending on some carefully chosen residual signals indicating the modeling mismatch, is designed to complement the H2 performance by providing robustness guarantee in terms of H_infty requirement with respect to disturbances or uncertainties. The proposed complementary design approach provides an additional degree of freedom for design, having two separate controls to deal with the H2 performance and the robustness of consensus, respectively. Thereby, it does not need to make much trade-off, and can be expected to be much less conservative than the trade-off design such as the mixed H2/H_infty control method. Besides, this complementary approach will recover the achievable H2 performance when external disturbances or uncertainties do not exist. The effectiveness of the theoretical results and the advantages of the complementary approach are validated via numerical simulations. ",

There are two significant challenges in practice to solve the AJP task. One is how to model the appeal judgment procedure appropriately. The other is how to improve the interpretability of the prediction results. We propose a Sequential Multi-task Learning Framework with Task Dependency for Appeal Judgement Prediction (SMAJudge) to address these challenges. SMAJudge utilizes two sequential components to model the complete proceeding from the lower court to the appellate court and employs an attention mechanism to make the prediction more explainable, which handles the challenges of AJP effectively. Experimental results obtained with a dataset consisting of more than 30K appeal judgment documents have revealed the effectiveness and superiority of SMAJudge. ",

However, optical fibers, serving as the data transmission medium providing connectivity to billons of users worldwide, are prone to a variety of anomalies resulting from hard failures (e.g., fiber cuts) and malicious physical attacks (e.g., optical eavesdropping (fiber tapping)) etc. Such anomalies may cause network disruption and thereby inducing huge financial and data losses, or compromise the confidentiality of optical networks by gaining unauthorized access to the carried data, or gradually degrade the network operations. Therefore, it is highly required to implement efficient anomaly detection, diagnosis, and localization schemes for enhancing the availability and reliability of optical networks. In this paper, we propose a data driven approach to accurately and quickly detect, diagnose, and localize fiber anomalies including fiber cuts, and optical eavesdropping attacks. The proposed method combines an autoencoder-based anomaly detection and an attention-based bidirectional gated recurrent unit algorithm, whereby the former is used for fault detection and the latter is adopted for fault diagnosis and localization once an anomaly is detected by the autoencoder. We verify the efficiency of our proposed approach by experiments under various anomaly scenarios using real operational data. The experimental results demonstrate that: (i) the autoencoder detects any fiber fault or anomaly with an F1 score of 96.86%; and (ii) the attention-based bidirectional gated recurrent unit algorithm identifies the the detected anomalies with an average accuracy of 98.2%, and localizes the faults with an average root mean square error of 0.19 m.

However, this strongly limits the use of these models inside audio generation setups, as most creative workflows are based on real-time digital signal processing. Although approaches based on recurrent networks can be naturally adapted to this buffer-based computation, the use of convolutions still poses some serious challenges. To tackle this issue, the use of causal streaming convolutions have been proposed. However, this requires specific complexified training and can impact the resulting audio quality. In this paper, we introduce a new method allowing to produce non-causal streaming models. This allows to make any convolutional model compatible with real-time buffer-based processing. As our method is based on a post-training reconfiguration of the model, we show that it is able to transform models trained without causal constraints into a streaming model. We show how our method can be adapted to fit complex architectures with parallel branches. To evaluate our method, we apply it on the recent RAVE model, which provides high-quality real-time audio synthesis. We test our approach on multiple music and speech datasets and show that it is faster than overlap-add methods, while having no impact on the generation quality. Finally, we introduce two open-source implementation of our work as Max/MSP and PureData externals, and as a VST audio plugin.

Due to stochastic back-propagation, the set of children has a variety of weights with different levels of performance. The weights that best minimize the reconstruction loss with a given signal dictionary are passed to the next generation.

    "abstract": "In this paper we conduct a longitudinal analysis of the structure of labour markets in the US over 7 decades of technological, economic and policy change. We make use of network science, natural language processing and machine learning to uncover structural changes in the labour market over time. We find a steady rate of both disappearance of jobs and a shift in the required work tasks, despite much technological and economic change over this time period. Machine learning is used to classify jobs as being predominantly cognitive or physical based on the textual description of the workplace tasks. We also measure increasing polarisation between these two classes of jobs, linked by the similarity of tasks, over time that could constrain workers wishing to move to different jobs. ",

    "abstract": "Understanding and controlling latent representations in deep generative models is a challenging yet important problem for analyzing, transforming and generating various types of data. In speech processing, inspiring from the anatomical mechanisms of phonation, the source-filter model considers that speech signals are produced from a few independent and physically meaningful continuous latent factors, among which the fundamental frequency $f_0$ and the formants are of primary importance. In this work, we show that the source-filter model of speech production naturally arises in the latent space of a variational autoencoder (VAE) trained in an unsupervised manner on a dataset of natural speech signals. Using only a few seconds of labeled speech signals generated with an artificial speech synthesizer, we experimentally illustrate that $f_0$ and the formant frequencies are encoded in orthogonal subspaces of the VAE latent space and we develop a weakly-supervised method to accurately and independently control these speech factors of variation within the learned latent subspaces. Without requiring additional information such as text or human-labeled data, this results in a deep generative model of speech spectrograms that is conditioned on $f_0$ and the formant frequencies, and which is applied to the transformation of speech signals.

A standard approach to the problem involves detecting all objects and selecting the one which best overlaps with the gaze of the visitor, measured through a gaze tracker. Since labeling large amounts of data to train a standard object detector is expensive in terms of costs and time, we propose a weakly supervised version of the task which leans only on gaze data and a frame-level label indicating the class of the attended object. To study the problem, we present a new dataset composed of egocentric videos and gaze coordinates of subjects visiting a museum. We hence compare three different baselines for weakly supervised attended object detection on the collected data. Results show that the considered approaches achieve satisfactory performance in a weakly supervised manner, which allows for significant time savings with respect to a fully supervised detector based on Faster R-CNN.

In this paper, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), or drones, with embedded RGB cameras were used to capture the fallen Acacia Xanthophloea trees from six designated plots around Lake Nakuru, Kenya. Motivated by the need to detect fallen trees around the lake, two well-established deep neural networks, i.e. Faster Region-based Convolution Neural Network (Faster R-CNN) and Retina-Net were used for fallen tree detection. A total of 7,590 annotations of three classes on 256 x 256 image patches were used for this study. Experimental results show the relevance of deep learning in this context, with Retina-Net model achieving 38.9% precision and 57.9% recall. ",

One of the recent methods of image restoration based on a Swin Transformer (ST), SwinIR, demonstrates state-of-the-art performance with a smaller number of parameters than neural network-based methods. Inspired by the success of SwinIR, we propose in this paper a novel Swin Transformer-based network for image demosaicing, called RSTCANet. To extract image features, RSTCANet stacks several residual Swin Transformer Channel Attention blocks (RSTCAB), introducing the channel attention for each two successive ST blocks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RSTCANet out- performs state-of-the-art image demosaicing methods, and has a smaller number of parameters. ",

    "abstract": "Recent development of neural implicit function has shown tremendous success on high-quality 3D shape reconstruction. However, most works divide the space into inside and outside of the shape, which limits their representing power to single-layer and watertight shapes. This limitation leads to tedious data processing (converting non-watertight raw data to watertight) as well as the incapability of representing general object shapes in the real world. In this work, we propose a novel method to represent general shapes including non-watertight shapes and shapes with multi-layer surfaces. We introduce General Implicit Function for 3D Shape (GIFS), which models the relationships between every two points instead of the relationships between points and surfaces. Instead of dividing 3D space into predefined inside-outside regions, GIFS encodes whether two points are separated by any surface. Experiments on ShapeNet show that GIFS outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods in terms of reconstruction quality, rendering efficiency, and visual fidelity.

    "abstract": "Skill routing is an important component in large-scale conversational systems. In contrast to traditional rule-based skill routing, state-of-the-art systems use a model-based approach to enable natural conversations. To provide supervision signal required to train such models, ideas such as human annotation, replication of a rule-based system, relabeling based on user paraphrases, and bandit-based learning were suggested. However, these approaches: (a) do not scale in terms of the number of skills and skill on-boarding, (b) require a very costly expert annotation/rule-design, (c) introduce risks in the user experience with each model update. In this paper, we present a scalable self-learning approach to explore routing alternatives without causing abrupt policy changes that break the user experience, learn from the user interaction, and incrementally improve the routing via frequent model refreshes. To enable such robust frequent model updates, we suggest a simple and effective approach that ensures controlled policy updates for individual domains, followed by an off-policy evaluation for making deployment decisions without any need for lengthy A/B experimentation. We conduct various offline and online A/B experiments on a commercial large-scale conversational system to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in real-world production settings. ",

As a result, MSNs improve the scalability of joint-embedding architectures, while producing representations of a high semantic level that perform competitively on low-shot image classification. For instance, on ImageNet-1K, with only 5,000 annotated images, our base MSN model achieves 72.4% top-1 accuracy, and with 1% of ImageNet-1K labels, we achieve 75.7% top-1 accuracy, setting a new state-of-the-art for self-supervised learning on this benchmark.

A multifidelity DeepONet includes two standard DeepONets coupled by residual learning and input augmentation. Multifidelity DeepONet significantly reduces the required amount of high-fidelity data and achieves one order of magnitude smaller error when using the same amount of high-fidelity data. We apply a multifidelity DeepONet to learn the phonon Boltzmann transport equation (BTE), a framework to compute nanoscale heat transport. By combining a trained multifidelity DeepONet with genetic algorithm or topology optimization, we demonstrate a fast solver for the inverse design of BTE problems. ",

The market can be regarded as a complex network whose nodes are stocks connected by edges that signify their correlation strength.

In this paper, we use a geometric measure derived from discrete Ricci curvature to capture the higher-order nonlinear architecture of financial networks. In order to confirm the effectiveness of our method, we use it to analyze the CSI 300 constituents of China's stock market from 2005--2020 and the systemic stability of the market is quantified through the network's Ricci type curvatures. Furthermore, we use a hybrid model to analyze the curvature time series and predict the future trends of the market accurately. As far as we know, this is the first paper to apply Ricci curvature to forecast the systemic stability of domestic stock market, and our results show that Ricci curvature has good explanatory power for the market stability and can be a good indicator to judge the future risk and volatility of the domestic market.

    "abstract": "Immunohistochemistry is a valuable diagnostic tool for cancer pathology. However, it requires specialist labs and equipment, is time-intensive, and is difficult to reproduce. Consequently, a long term aim is to provide a digital method of recreating physical immunohistochemical stains. Generative Adversarial Networks have become exceedingly advanced at mapping one image type to another and have shown promise at inferring immunostains from haematoxylin and eosin. However, they have a substantial weakness when used with pathology images as they can fabricate structures that are not present in the original data. CycleGANs can mitigate invented tissue structures in pathology image mapping but have a related disposition to generate areas of inaccurate staining. In this paper, we describe a modification to the loss function of a CycleGAN to improve its mapping ability for pathology images by enforcing realistic stain replication while retaining tissue structure. Our approach improves upon others by considering structure and staining during model training. We evaluated our network using the Fr\\'echet Inception distance, coupled with a new technique that we propose to appraise the accuracy of virtual immunohistochemistry. This assesses the overlap between each stain component in the inferred and ground truth images through colour deconvolution, thresholding and the Sorensen-Dice coefficient. Our modified loss function resulted in a Dice coefficient for the virtual stain of 0.78 compared with the real AE1/AE3 slide. This was superior to the unaltered CycleGAN's score of 0.74. Additionally, our loss function improved the Fr\\'echet Inception distance for the reconstruction to 74.54 from 76.47. We, therefore, describe an advance in virtual restaining that can extend to other immunostains and tumour types and deliver reproducible, fast and readily accessible immunohistochemistry worldwide.

These problems are solved by highly complex models, such as deep networks (DN), requiring a large amount of labeled data for training. Thereby, many DNs possess task- or imaging modality specific architectures with a decision-making process that is often hard to explain and interpret. Here, we propose a framework that embeds existing DNs into a low-dimensional subspace induced by the learnable explicit feature map (LEFM) layer. Compared to the existing DN, the framework adds one hyperparameter and only modestly increase the number of learnable parameters. The method is aimed at, but not limited to, segmentation of low-dimensional medical images, such as color histopathological images of stained frozen sections. Since features in the LEFM layer are polynomial functions of the original features, proposed LEFM-Nets contribute to the interpretability of network decisions. In this work, we combined LEFM with the known networks: DeepLabv3+, UNet, UNet++ and MA-net. New LEFM-Nets are applied to the segmentation of adenocarcinoma of a colon in a liver from images of hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained frozen sections. LEFM-Nets are also tested on nuclei segmentation from images of H&E stained frozen sections of ten human organs. On the first problem, LEFM-Nets achieved statistically significant performance improvement in terms of micro balanced accuracy and $F_1$ score than original networks. LEFM-Nets achieved only better performance in comparison with the original networks on the second problem. The source code is available at https://github.com/dsitnik/lefm. ",

We propose to train a (local) detector in each institution and aggregate their individual predictions into one final prediction. Four aggregation schemes are compared, namely, the majority vote, the mean, the weighted mean and the Dawid-Skene method. The approach allows different detector architectures amongst the institutions. The method was validated on an independent data set using only a subset of EEG channels. The ensemble reaches accuracy comparable to a single detector trained on all the data when sufficient amount of data is available in each institution. The weighted mean aggregation scheme showed best overall performance, it was only marginally outperformed by the Dawid-Skene method when local detectors approach performance of a single detector trained on all available data.

Recently, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) motivated from geometric deep learning have attracted broad interest due to their established power for modeling complex networked data. Despite their established performance in other fields, there has not yet been a systematic study of how to design effective GNNs for brain network analysis. To bridge this gap, we present BrainGB, a benchmark for brain network analysis with GNNs. BrainGB standardizes the process by 1) summarizing brain network construction pipelines for both functional and structural neuroimaging modalities and 2) modularizing the implementation of GNN designs. We conduct extensive experiments on datasets across cohorts and modalities and recommend a set of general recipes for effective GNN designs on brain networks. To support open and reproducible research on GNN-based brain network analysis, we also host the BrainGB website at https:// brainnet.us/ with models, tutorials, examples, as well as an out-of-box Python package.

    "title": "Learning Optimal Dynamic Treatment Regimes Using Causal Tree Methods in  Medicine",
    "abstract": "Dynamic treatment regimes (DTRs) are used in medicine to tailor sequential treatment decisions to patients by considering patient heterogeneity. Common methods for learning optimal DTRs, however, have shortcomings: they are typically based on outcome prediction and not treatment effect estimation, or they use linear models that are restrictive for patient data from modern electronic health records. To address these shortcomings, we develop two novel methods for learning optimal DTRs that effectively handle complex patient data. We call our methods DTR-CT and DTR-CF. Our methods are based on a data-driven estimation of heterogeneous treatment effects using causal tree methods, specifically causal trees and causal forests, that learn non-linear relationships, control for time-varying confounding, are doubly robust, and explainable. To the best of our knowledge, our paper is the first that adapts causal tree methods for learning optimal DTRs. We evaluate our proposed methods using synthetic data and then apply them to real-world data from intensive care units. Our methods outperform state-of-the-art baselines in terms of cumulative regret and percentage of optimal decisions by a considerable margin. Our work improves treatment recommendations from electronic health record and is thus of direct relevance for personalized medicine. ",

    "abstract": "For a connected graph $G=(V,E)$, a matching $M\\subseteq E$ is a matching cut of $G$ if $G-M$ is disconnected. It is known that for an integer $d$, the corresponding decision problem Matching Cut is polynomial-time solvable for graphs of diameter at most $d$ if $d\\leq 2$ and NP-complete if $d\\geq 3$. We prove the same dichotomy for graphs of bounded radius. For a graph $H$, a graph is $H$-free if it does not contain $H$ as an induced subgraph. As a consequence of our result, we can solve Matching Cut in polynomial time for $P_6$-free graphs, extending a recent result of Feghali for $P_5$-free graphs. We then extend our result to hold even for $(sP_3+P_6)$-free graphs for every $s\\geq 0$ and initiate a complexity classification of Matching Cut for $H$-free graphs. ",

    "abstract": "In this paper we analyze the effect of a policy recommendation on the performances of an artificial interbank market. Financial institutions stipulate lending agreements following a public recommendation and their individual information. The former, modeled by a reinforcement learning optimal policy trying to maximize the long term fitness of the system, gathers information on the economic environment and directs economic actors to create credit relationships based on the optimal choice between a low interest rate or high liquidity supply. The latter, based on the agents' balance sheet, allows to determine the liquidity supply and interest rate that the banks optimally offer on the market. Based on the combination between the public and the private signal, financial institutions create or cut their credit connections over time via a preferential attachment evolving procedure able to generate a dynamic network. Our results show that the emergence of a core-periphery interbank network, combined with a certain level of homogeneity on the size of lenders and borrowers, are essential features to ensure the resilience of the system. Moreover, the reinforcement learning optimal policy recommendation plays a crucial role in mitigating systemic risk with respect to alternative policy instruments. ",
