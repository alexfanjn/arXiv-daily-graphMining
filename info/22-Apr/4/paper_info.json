    "title": "Improving Adversarial Transferability via Neuron Attribution-Based  Attacks",
    "abstract": "Deep neural networks (DNNs) are known to be vulnerable to adversarial examples. It is thus imperative to devise effective attack algorithms to identify the deficiencies of DNNs beforehand in security-sensitive applications. To efficiently tackle the black-box setting where the target model's particulars are unknown, feature-level transfer-based attacks propose to contaminate the intermediate feature outputs of local models, and then directly employ the crafted adversarial samples to attack the target model. Due to the transferability of features, feature-level attacks have shown promise in synthesizing more transferable adversarial samples. However, existing feature-level attacks generally employ inaccurate neuron importance estimations, which deteriorates their transferability. To overcome such pitfalls, in this paper, we propose the Neuron Attribution-based Attack (NAA), which conducts feature-level attacks with more accurate neuron importance estimations. Specifically, we first completely attribute a model's output to each neuron in a middle layer. We then derive an approximation scheme of neuron attribution to tremendously reduce the computation overhead. Finally, we weight neurons based on their attribution results and launch feature-level attacks. Extensive experiments confirm the superiority of our approach to the state-of-the-art benchmarks. ",

    "abstract": "Privacy and ethics of citizens are at the core of the concerns raised by our increasingly digital society. Profiling users is standard practice for software applications triggering the need for users, also enforced by laws, to properly manage privacy settings. Users need to manage software privacy settings properly to protect personally identifiable information and express personal ethical preferences. AI technologies that empower users to interact with the digital world by reflecting their personal ethical preferences can be key enablers of a trustworthy digital society. We focus on the privacy dimension and contribute a step in the above direction through an empirical study on an existing dataset collected from the fitness domain. We find out which set of questions is appropriate to differentiate users according to their preferences. The results reveal that a compact set of semantic-driven questions (about domain-independent privacy preferences) helps distinguish users better than a complex domain-dependent one. This confirms the study's hypothesis that moral attitudes are the relevant piece of information to collect. Based on the outcome, we implement a recommender system to provide users with suitable recommendations related to privacy choices. We then show that the proposed recommender system provides relevant settings to users, obtaining high accuracy. ",

We show that an adversary who can poison a training dataset can cause models trained on this dataset to leak significant private details of training points belonging to other parties. Our active inference attacks connect two independent lines of work targeting the integrity and privacy of machine learning training data. Our attacks are effective across membership inference, attribute inference, and data extraction. For example, our targeted attacks can poison <0.1% of the training dataset to boost the performance of inference attacks by 1 to 2 orders of magnitude. Further, an adversary who controls a significant fraction of the training data (e.g., 50%) can launch untargeted attacks that enable 8x more precise inference on all other users' otherwise-private data points. Our results cast doubts on the relevance of cryptographic privacy guarantees in multiparty computation protocols for machine learning, if parties can arbitrarily select their share of training data.

Relevant information is often distributed between multiple modalities, and requires the organism to exhibit information assimilation capabilities in addition to information seeking behaviors. While biological beings leverage multiple sensing modalities for decision making, current robots are overly reliant on visual inputs. In this work, we want to augment our robots with the ability to leverage the (relatively under-explored) modality of touch. To focus our investigation, we study the problem of scene reconstruction where touch is the only available sensing modality. We present Tactile Slam (tSLAM) -- which prepares an agent to acquire information seeking behavior and use implicit understanding of common household items to reconstruct the geometric details of the object under exploration. Using the anthropomorphic `ADROIT' hand, we demonstrate that tSLAM is highly effective in reconstructing objects of varying complexities within 6 seconds of interactions. We also established the generality of tSLAM by training only on 3D Warehouse objects and testing on ContactDB objects. ",

    "abstract": "Recent studies in neuroscience suggest that Successor Representation (SR)-based models provide adaptation to changes in the goal locations or reward function faster than model-free algorithms, together with lower computational cost compared to that of model-based algorithms. However, it is not known how such representation might help animals to manage uncertainty in their decision-making. Existing methods for SR learning do not capture uncertainty about the estimated SR. In order to address this issue, the paper presents a Kalman filter-based SR framework, referred to as Adaptive Kalman Filtering-based Successor Representation (AKF-SR). First, Kalman temporal difference approach, which is a combination of the Kalman filter and the temporal difference method, is used within the AKF-SR framework to cast the SR learning procedure into a filtering problem to benefit from the uncertainty estimation of the SR, and also decreases in memory requirement and sensitivity to model's parameters in comparison to deep neural network-based algorithms. An adaptive Kalman filtering approach is then applied within the proposed AKF-SR framework in order to tune the measurement noise covariance and measurement mapping function of Kalman filter as the most important parameters affecting the filter's performance. Moreover, an active learning method that exploits the estimated uncertainty of the SR to form the behaviour policy leading to more visits to less certain values is proposed to improve the overall performance of an agent in terms of received rewards while interacting with its environment.

A distance-based backoff algorithm is used to reduce the number of hops and a novel mechanism to reduce redundant broadcasts is introduced.

Blockchain technology and its benefits like decentralization, security, and transparency have encouraged remote voting systems to use blockchains. Analysis of existing solutions reveals that anonymity, robustness, and scalability are common problems in blockchain-based election systems. In this work, we propose ElectAnon, a blockchain-based, ranked-choice election protocol focusing on anonymity, robustness, and scalability. ElectAnon achieves anonymity by enabling voters to cast their votes via zero-knowledge proofs anonymously. Robustness is realized by removing the direct control of the authorities in the voting process by using timed-state machines. Results show that ElectAnon is scalable amongst existing works as it reduces the gas consumption up to 89% compared to previous works. The proposed protocol includes a candidate proposal system and swappable tallying libraries. An extension is also proposed to minimize the trust assumption on election authorities.

Concretely, predictive models are often employed in estimating the parameters for the input values that are utilized for optimization models as isolated processes. Traditionally, the predictive models are built first, then the model outputs are used to generate decision values separately. However, it is often the case that the prediction values that are trained independently of the optimization process produce sub-optimal solutions. In this paper, we propose a formulation for the Simultaneous Prediction and Optimization (SimPO) framework.

For this problem, we present and prove a theorem on uniqueness of generalized solution for a broad class of non-ideal pressure-density relations that satisfy a monotonicity property. Further, we develop a Newton-Raphson algorithm for numerical solution of the steady-state problem, which is made possible by a systematic non-dimensionalization of the equations. The developed algorithm has been extensively tested on benchmark instances and shown to converge robustly to a generalized solution. Previous results indicate that the steady-state network flow equations for an ideal gas are difficult to solve by the Newton-Raphson method because of its extreme sensitivity to the initial guess. In contrast, we find that non-dimensionalization of the steady-state problem is key to robust convergence of the Newton-Raphson method. We identify criteria based on the uniqueness of solutions under which the existence of a non-physical generalized solution found by a non-linear solver implies non-existence of a physical solution, i.e., infeasibility of the problem. Finally, we compare pressure and flow solutions based on ideal and non-ideal equations of state to demonstrate the need to apply the latter in practice. The solver developed in this article is open-source and is made available for both the academic and research communities as well as the industry. ",

    "abstract": "Existing works have identified the limitation of top-$1$ attack success rate (ASR) as a metric to evaluate the attack strength but exclusively investigated it in the white-box setting, while our work extends it to a more practical black-box setting: transferable attack. It is widely reported that stronger I-FGSM transfers worse than simple FGSM, leading to a popular belief that transferability is at odds with the white-box attack strength. Our work challenges this belief with empirical finding that stronger attack actually transfers better for the general top-$k$ ASR indicated by the interest class rank (ICR) after attack. For increasing the attack strength, with an intuitive interpretation of the logit gradient from the geometric perspective, we identify that the weakness of the commonly used losses lie in prioritizing the speed to fool the network instead of maximizing its strength. To this end, we propose a new normalized CE loss that guides the logit to be updated in the direction of implicitly maximizing its rank distance from the ground-truth class. Extensive results in various settings have verified that our proposed new loss is simple yet effective for top-$k$ attack. Code is available at: \\url{https://bit.ly/3uCiomP} ",

Comments in code largely serve a similar purpose, helping future readers understand the program. It is thus natural to study what happens when these two forms of understanding collide. We ask: what documentation-related comments do reviewers make and how do they affect understanding of the contribution? We analyze ca.700K review comments on 2,000 (Java and Python) GitHub projects, and propose several filters to identify which comments are likely to be either in response to a change in documentation and/or call for such a change. We identify 65K such cases. We next develop a taxonomy of the reviewer intents behind such \"comments on comments\". We find that achieving a shared understanding of the code is key: reviewer comments most often focused on clarification, followed by pointing out issues to fix, such as typos and outdated comments. Curiously, clarifying comments were frequently suggested (often verbatim) by the reviewer, indicating a desire to persist their understanding acquired during code review. We conclude with a discussion of implications of our comments-on-comments dataset for research on improving code review, including the potential benefits for automating code review. ",

    "abstract": "In many machine learning tasks, input features with varying degrees of predictive capability are acquired at varying costs. In order to optimize the performance-cost trade-off, one would select features to observe a priori. However, given the changing context with previous observations, the subset of predictive features to select may change dynamically. Therefore, we face the challenging new problem of foresight dynamic selection (FDS): finding a dynamic and light-weight policy to decide which features to observe next, before actually observing them, for overall performance-cost trade-offs. To tackle FDS, this paper proposes a Bayesian learning framework of Variational Foresight Dynamic Selection (VFDS). VFDS learns a policy that selects the next feature subset to observe, by optimizing a variational Bayesian objective that characterizes the trade-off between model performance and feature cost. At its core is an implicit variational distribution on binary gates that are dependent on previous observations, which will select the next subset of features to observe. We apply VFDS on the Human Activity Recognition (HAR) task where the performance-cost trade-off is critical in its practice. Extensive results demonstrate that VFDS selects different features under changing contexts, notably saving sensory costs while maintaining or improving the HAR accuracy. Moreover, the features that VFDS dynamically select are shown to be interpretable and associated with the different activity types. We will release the code. ",

    "abstract": "Attacks on computer networks have increased significantly in recent days, due in part to the availability of sophisticated tools for launching such attacks as well as thriving underground cyber-crime economy to support it. Over the past several years, researchers in academia and industry used machine learning (ML) techniques to design and implement Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSes) for computer networks. Many of these researchers used datasets collected by various organizations to train ML models for predicting intrusions. In many of the datasets used in such systems, data are imbalanced (i.e., not all classes have equal amount of samples). With unbalanced data, the predictive models developed using ML algorithms may produce unsatisfactory classifiers which would affect accuracy in predicting intrusions. Traditionally, researchers used over-sampling and under-sampling for balancing data in datasets to overcome this problem. In this work, in addition to over-sampling, we also use a synthetic data generation method, called Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (CTGAN), to balance data and study their effect on various ML classifiers. To the best of our knowledge, no one else has used CTGAN to generate synthetic samples to balance intrusion detection datasets. Based on extensive experiments using a widely used dataset NSL-KDD, we found that training ML models on dataset balanced with synthetic samples generated by CTGAN increased prediction accuracy by up to $8\\%$, compared to training the same ML models over unbalanced data. Our experiments also show that the accuracy of some ML models trained over data balanced with random over-sampling decline compared to the same ML models trained over unbalanced data. ",

    "abstract": "Semi- and weakly-supervised learning have recently attracted considerable attention in the object detection literature since they can alleviate the cost of annotation needed to successfully train deep learning models. State-of-art approaches for semi-supervised learning rely on student-teacher models trained using a multi-stage process, and considerable data augmentation. Custom networks have been developed for the weakly-supervised setting, making it difficult to adapt to different detectors. In this paper, a weakly semi-supervised training method is introduced that reduces these training challenges, yet achieves state-of-the-art performance by leveraging only a small fraction of fully-labeled images with information in weakly-labeled images. In particular, our generic sampling-based learning strategy produces pseudo-ground-truth (GT) bounding box annotations in an online fashion, eliminating the need for multi-stage training, and student-teacher network configurations. These pseudo GT boxes are sampled from weakly-labeled images based on the categorical score of object proposals accumulated via a score propagation process. Empirical results on the Pascal VOC dataset, indicate that the proposed approach improves performance by 5.0% when using VOC 2007 as fully-labeled, and VOC 2012 as weak-labeled data. Also, with 5-10% fully annotated images, we observed an improvement of more than 10% in mAP, showing that a modest investment in image-level annotation, can substantially improve detection performance.

Our numerical results show that in certain cases the jammer may decide to launch a denial-of-service attack with the goal of deceiving the receiver even when the sensor decides not to transmit. ",

    "title": "An End-to-end Supervised Domain Adaptation Framework for Cross-Domain  Change Detection",
    "abstract": "Existing deep learning-based change detection methods try to elaborately design complicated neural networks with powerful feature representations, but ignore the universal domain shift induced by time-varying land cover changes, including luminance fluctuations and season changes between pre-event and post-event images, thereby producing sub-optimal results. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end Supervised Domain Adaptation framework for cross-domain Change Detection, namely SDACD, to effectively alleviate the domain shift between bi-temporal images for better change predictions. Specifically, our SDACD presents collaborative adaptations from both image and feature perspectives with supervised learning. Image adaptation exploits generative adversarial learning with cycle-consistency constraints to perform cross-domain style transformation, effectively narrowing the domain gap in a two-side generation fashion. As to feature adaptation, we extract domain-invariant features to align different feature distributions in the feature space, which could further reduce the domain gap of cross-domain images. To further improve the performance, we combine three types of bi-temporal images for the final change prediction, including the initial input bi-temporal images and two generated bi-temporal images from the pre-event and post-event domains. Extensive experiments and analyses on two benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and universality of our proposed framework. Notably, our framework pushes several representative baseline models up to new State-Of-The-Art records, achieving 97.34% and 92.36% on the CDD and WHU building datasets, respectively.

    "abstract": "The application of cross-dataset training in object detection tasks is complicated because the inconsistency in the category range across datasets transforms fully supervised learning into semi-supervised learning. To address this problem, recent studies focus on the generation of high-quality missing annotations. In this study, we first point out that it is not enough to generate high-quality annotations using a single model, which only looks once for annotations. Through detailed experimental analyses, we further conclude that hard-label training is conducive to generating high-recall annotations, while soft-label training tends to obtain high-precision annotations. Inspired by the aspects mentioned above, we propose a dynamic supervisor framework that updates the annotations multiple times through multiple-updated submodels trained using hard and soft labels. In the final generated annotations, both recall and precision improve significantly through the integration of hard-label training with soft-label training. Extensive experiments conducted on various dataset combination settings support our analyses and demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed dynamic supervisor. ",

We first establish that tight inclusion functions of neural networks, which provide the tightest rectangular over-approximation of an input-output map, lead to sharper robustness guarantees than the well-studied robustness measures of local Lipschitz constants. Like Lipschitz constants, tight inclusions functions are computationally challenging to obtain, and we thus propose using mixed monotonicity and contraction theory to obtain computationally efficient estimates of tight inclusion functions for INNs. We show that our approach performs at least as well as, and generally better than, applying state-of-the-art interval bound propagation methods to INNs. We design a novel optimization problem for training robust INNs and we provide empirical evidence that suitably-trained INNs can be more robust than comparably-trained feedforward networks. ",

This can be reduced by using a supernet for estimating the fitness of an architecture due to weight sharing among all architectures in the search space. However, the estimated fitness is very noisy due to the co-adaptation of the operations in the supernet which results in NAS methods getting trapped in local optimum. In this paper, we propose a method called NEvoNAS wherein the NAS problem is posed as a multi-objective problem with 2 objectives: (i) maximize architecture novelty, (ii) maximize architecture fitness/accuracy. The novelty search is used for maintaining a diverse set of solutions at each generation which helps avoiding local optimum traps while the architecture fitness is calculated using supernet. NSGA-II is used for finding the \\textit{pareto optimal front} for the NAS problem and the best architecture in the pareto front is returned as the searched architecture.

Summarizing findings is time-consuming and can be prone to error for inexperienced radiologists, and thus automatic impression generation has attracted substantial attention. With the encoder-decoder framework, most previous studies explore incorporating extra knowledge (e.g., static pre-defined clinical ontologies or extra background information). Yet, they encode such knowledge by a separate encoder to treat it as an extra input to their models, which is limited in leveraging their relations with the original findings. To address the limitation, we propose a unified framework for exploiting both extra knowledge and the original findings in an integrated way so that the critical information (i.e., key words and their relations) can be extracted in an appropriate way to facilitate impression generation. In detail, for each input findings, it is encoded by a text encoder, and a graph is constructed through its entities and dependency tree. Then, a graph encoder (e.g., graph neural networks (GNNs)) is adopted to model relation information in the constructed graph. Finally, to emphasize the key words in the findings, contrastive learning is introduced to map positive samples (constructed by masking non-key words) closer and push apart negative ones (constructed by masking key words). The experimental results on OpenI and MIMIC-CXR confirm the effectiveness of our proposed method. ",

    "abstract": "We present a data-driven workflow to biological tissue modeling, which aims to predict the displacement field based on digital image correlation (DIC) measurements under unseen loading scenarios, without postulating a specific constitutive model form nor possessing knowledges on the material microstructure. To this end, a material database is constructed from the DIC displacement tracking measurements of multiple biaxial stretching protocols on a porcine tricuspid valve anterior leaflet, with which we build a neural operator learning model. The material response is modeled as a solution operator from the loading to the resultant displacement field, with the material microstructure properties learned implicitly from the data and naturally embedded in the network parameters. Using various combinations of loading protocols, we compare the predictivity of this framework with finite element analysis based on the phenomenological Fung-type model. From in-distribution tests, the predictivity of our approach presents good generalizability to different loading conditions and outperforms the conventional constitutive modeling at approximately one order of magnitude. When tested on out-of-distribution loading ratios, the neural operator learning approach becomes less effective. To improve the generalizability of our framework, we propose a physics-guided neural operator learning model via imposing partial physics knowledge. This method is shown to improve the model's extrapolative performance in the small-deformation regime. Our results demonstrate that with sufficient data coverage and/or guidance from partial physics constraints, the data-driven approach can be a more effective method for modeling biological materials than the traditional constitutive modeling.

    "abstract": "The key of sequential recommendation lies in the accurate item correlation modeling. Previous models infer such information based on item co-occurrences, which may fail to capture the real causal relations, and impact the recommendation performance and explainability. In this paper, we equip sequential recommendation with a novel causal discovery module to capture causalities among user behaviors. Our general idea is firstly assuming a causal graph underlying item correlations, and then we learn the causal graph jointly with the sequential recommender model by fitting the real user behavior data. More specifically, in order to satisfy the causality requirement, the causal graph is regularized by a differentiable directed acyclic constraint. Considering that the number of items in recommender systems can be very large, we represent different items with a unified set of latent clusters, and the causal graph is defined on the cluster level, which enhances the model scalability and robustness. In addition, we provide theoretical analysis on the identifiability of the learned causal graph. To the best of our knowledge, this paper makes a first step towards combining sequential recommendation with causal discovery. For evaluating the recommendation performance, we implement our framework with different neural sequential architectures, and compare them with many state-of-the-art methods based on real-world datasets. Empirical studies manifest that our model can on average improve the performance by about 7% and 11% on f1 and NDCG, respectively. To evaluate the model explainability, we build a new dataset with human labeled explanations for both quantitative and qualitative analysis. ",

One challenge for the CTR prediction task is to capture the real interest of users from their clicked items, which is inherently biased by presented positions of items, i.e., more front positions tend to obtain higher CTR values. A popular line of existing works focuses on explicitly estimating position bias by result randomization which is expensive and inefficient, or by inverse propensity weighting (IPW) which relies heavily on the quality of the propensity estimation. Another common solution is modeling position as features during offline training and simply adopting fixed value or dropout tricks when serving. However, training-inference inconsistency can lead to sub-optimal performance. Furthermore, post-click information such as position values is informative while less exploited in CTR prediction. This work proposes a simple yet efficient knowledge distillation framework to alleviate the impact of position bias and leverage position information to improve CTR prediction. We demonstrate the performance of our proposed method on a real-world production dataset and online A/B tests, achieving significant improvements over competing baseline models. The proposed method has been deployed in the real world online ads systems, serving main traffic on one of the world's largest e-commercial platforms. ",

Results demonstrate that the proposed framework increases the success rate on the swarm-guidance environment by 11% and better stability in return for a modest increase in computational cost of 14.5% to achieve interpretability.

Unlike existing privacy-preserving technologies such as federated learning and differential privacy, we explore another way to mitigate users' privacy concerns, giving them control over their own data. For this goal, we propose a privacy aware recommendation framework that gives users delicate control over their personal data, including implicit behaviors, e.g., clicks and watches. In this new framework, users can proactively control which data to disclose based on the trade-off between anticipated privacy risks and potential utilities. Then we study users' privacy decision making under different data disclosure mechanisms and recommendation models, and how their data disclosure decisions affect the recommender system's performance. To avoid the high cost of real-world experiments, we apply simulations to study the effects of our proposed framework. Specifically, we propose a reinforcement learning algorithm to simulate users' decisions (with various sensitivities) under three proposed platform mechanisms on two datasets with three representative recommendation models. The simulation results show that the platform mechanisms with finer split granularity and more unrestrained disclosure strategy can bring better results for both end users and platforms than the \"all or nothing\" binary mechanism adopted by most real-world applications. It also shows that our proposed framework can effectively protect users' privacy since they can obtain comparable or even better results with much less disclosed data. ",

Noisy features and inappropriate embedding dimension assignments can impair the performance of recommender systems and introduce unnecessary complexity in model training and online serving. Optimizing the input configuration of DNN models, including feature selection and embedding dimension assignment, has become one of the essential topics in feature engineering. Typically, feature selection and embedding dimension search are optimized sequentially, i.e., feature selection is performed first, followed by embedding dimension search to determine the optimal dimension size for each selected feature. In contrast, this paper studies the joint optimization of feature selection and embedding dimension search. To this end, we propose a differentiable neural \\textbf{i}nput \\textbf{razor}, namely \\textbf{i-Razor}. Specifically, inspired by recent advances in neural architecture search, we introduce an end-to-end differentiable model to learn the relative importance between different embedding regions of each feature. Furthermore, a flexible pruning algorithm is proposed to simultaneously achieve feature filtering and dimension size derivation. Extensive experiments on two large-scale public datasets in the Click-Through-Rate (CTR) prediction task demonstrate the efficacy and superiority of i-Razor in balancing model complexity and performance.

    "abstract": "Few-Shot classification aims at solving problems that only a few samples are available in the training process. Due to the lack of samples, researchers generally employ a set of training tasks from other domains to assist the target task, where the distribution between assistant tasks and the target task is usually different. To reduce the distribution gap, several lines of methods have been proposed, such as data augmentation and domain alignment. However, one common drawback of these algorithms is that they ignore the similarity task selection before training. The fundamental problem is to push the auxiliary tasks close to the target task. In this paper, we propose a novel task selecting algorithm, named Optimal Transport Task Selecting (OTTS), to construct a training set by selecting similar tasks for Few-Shot learning. Specifically, the OTTS measures the task similarity by calculating the optimal transport distance and completes the model training via a self-supervised strategy. By utilizing the selected tasks with OTTS, the training process of Few-Shot learning become more stable and effective. Other proposed methods including data augmentation and domain alignment can be used in the meantime with OTTS. We conduct extensive experiments on a variety of datasets, including MiniImageNet, CIFAR, CUB, Cars, and Places, to evaluate the effectiveness of OTTS. Experimental results validate that our OTTS outperforms the typical baselines, i.e., MAML, matchingnet, protonet, by a large margin (averagely 1.72\\% accuracy improvement). ",

Therefore, attackers may be interested in copying, reverse engineering, or even modifying this IP. The current practices in hardware obfuscation, including the widely studied logic locking technique, are insufficient to protect the actual IP of a well-trained NN: its weights. Simply hiding the weights behind a key-based scheme is inefficient (resource-hungry) and inadequate (attackers can exploit knowledge distillation). This paper proposes an intuitive method to poison the predictions that prevent distillation-based attacks; this is the first work to consider such a poisoning approach in hardware-implemented NNs. The proposed technique obfuscates a NN so an attacker cannot train the NN entirely or accurately. We elaborate a threat model which highlights the difference between random logic obfuscation and the obfuscation of NN IP. Based on this threat model, our security analysis shows that the poisoning successfully and significantly reduces the accuracy of the stolen NN model on various representative datasets. Moreover, the accuracy and prediction distributions are maintained, no functionality is disturbed, nor are high overheads incurred. Finally, we highlight that our proposed approach is flexible and does not require manipulation of the NN toolchain. ",

    "abstract": "Actual causality and a closely related concept of responsibility attribution are central to accountable decision making. Actual causality focuses on specific outcomes and aims to identify decisions (actions) that were critical in realizing an outcome of interest. Responsibility attribution is complementary and aims to identify the extent to which decision makers (agents) are responsible for this outcome. In this paper, we study these concepts under a widely used framework for multi-agent sequential decision making under uncertainty: decentralized partially observable Markov decision processes (Dec-POMDPs). Following recent works in RL that show correspondence between POMDPs and Structural Causal Models (SCMs), we first establish a connection between Dec-POMDPs and SCMs. This connection enables us to utilize a language for describing actual causality from prior work and study existing definitions of actual causality in Dec-POMDPs. Given that some of the well-known definitions may lead to counter-intuitive actual causes, we introduce a novel definition that more explicitly accounts for causal dependencies between agents' actions. We then turn to responsibility attribution based on actual causality, where we argue that in ascribing responsibility to an agent it is important to consider both the number of actual causes in which the agent participates, as well as its ability to manipulate its own degree of responsibility. Motivated by these arguments we introduce a family of responsibility attribution methods that extends prior work, while accounting for the aforementioned considerations. Finally, through a simulation-based experiment, we compare different definitions of actual causality and responsibility attribution methods. The empirical results demonstrate the qualitative difference between the considered definitions of actual causality and their impact on attributed responsibility. ",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we study deep neural networks for solving extremely large linear systems arising from physically relevant problems. Because of the curse of dimensionality, it is expensive to store both solution and right hand side vectors in such extremely large linear systems. Our idea is to employ a neural network to characterize the solution with parameters being much fewer than the size of the solution. We present an error analysis of the proposed method provided that the solution vector can be approximated by the continuous quantity, which is in the Barron space. Several numerical examples arising from partial differential equations, queueing problems and probabilistic Boolean networks are presented to demonstrate that solutions of linear systems with sizes ranging from septillion ($10^{24}$) to nonillion ($10^{30})$ can be learned quite accurately.

    "abstract": "Graphs are a powerful tool for representing and analyzing unstructured, non-Euclidean data ubiquitous in the healthcare domain. Two prominent examples are molecule property prediction and brain connectome analysis. Importantly, recent works have shown that considering relationships between input data samples have a positive regularizing effect for the downstream task in healthcare applications. These relationships are naturally modeled by a (possibly unknown) graph structure between input samples. In this work, we propose Graph-in-Graph (GiG), a neural network architecture for protein classification and brain imaging applications that exploits the graph representation of the input data samples and their latent relation. We assume an initially unknown latent-graph structure between graph-valued input data and propose to learn end-to-end a parametric model for message passing within and across input graph samples, along with the latent structure connecting the input graphs. Further, we introduce a degree distribution loss that helps regularize the predicted latent relationships structure. This regularization can significantly improve the downstream task. Moreover, the obtained latent graph can represent patient population models or networks of molecule clusters, providing a level of interpretability and knowledge discovery in the input domain of particular value in healthcare.

    "abstract": "In autonomous driving, LiDAR point-clouds and RGB images are two major data modalities with complementary cues for 3D object detection. However, it is quite difficult to sufficiently use them, due to large inter-modal discrepancies. To address this issue, we propose a novel framework, namely Contrastively Augmented Transformer for multi-modal 3D object Detection (CAT-Det). Specifically, CAT-Det adopts a two-stream structure consisting of a Pointformer (PT) branch, an Imageformer (IT) branch along with a Cross-Modal Transformer (CMT) module. PT, IT and CMT jointly encode intra-modal and inter-modal long-range contexts for representing an object, thus fully exploring multi-modal information for detection. Furthermore, we propose an effective One-way Multi-modal Data Augmentation (OMDA) approach via hierarchical contrastive learning at both the point and object levels, significantly improving the accuracy only by augmenting point-clouds, which is free from complex generation of paired samples of the two modalities. Extensive experiments on the KITTI benchmark show that CAT-Det achieves a new state-of-the-art, highlighting its effectiveness. ",

    "abstract": "Cold-start issues have been more and more challenging for providing accurate recommendations with the fast increase of users and items. Most existing approaches attempt to solve the intractable problems via content-aware recommendations based on auxiliary information and/or cross-domain recommendations with transfer learning. Their performances are often constrained by the extremely sparse user-item interactions, unavailable side information, or very limited domain-shared users. Recently, meta-learners with meta-augmentation by adding noises to labels have been proven to be effective to avoid overfitting and shown good performance on new tasks. Motivated by the idea of meta-augmentation, in this paper, by treating a user's preference over items as a task, we propose a so-called Diverse Preference Augmentation framework with multiple source domains based on meta-learning (referred to as MetaDPA) to i) generate diverse ratings in a new domain of interest (known as target domain) to handle overfitting on the case of sparse interactions, and to ii) learn a preference model in the target domain via a meta-learning scheme to alleviate cold-start issues. Specifically, we first conduct multi-source domain adaptation by dual conditional variational autoencoders and impose a Multi-domain InfoMax (MDI) constraint on the latent representations to learn domain-shared and domain-specific preference properties. To avoid overfitting, we add a Mutually-Exclusive (ME) constraint on the output of decoders to generate diverse ratings given content data. Finally, these generated diverse ratings and the original ratings are introduced into the meta-training procedure to learn a preference meta-learner, which produces good generalization ability on cold-start recommendation tasks. Experiments on real-world datasets show our proposed MetaDPA clearly outperforms the current state-of-the-art baselines. ",

In this paper, we present a novel self-triggered MPC scheme which is robust to bounded packet loss by virtue of a min-max optimization problem.

To this end, we propose a novel flow embedding design which can predict more robust scene flow in conjunction with RS. Exhibiting high accuracy, our RMS-FlowNet provides a faster prediction than state-of-the-art methods and works efficiently on consecutive dense point clouds of more than 250K points at once. Our comprehensive experiments verify the accuracy of RMS-FlowNet on the established FlyingThings3D data set with different point cloud densities and validate our design choices.

Most existing methods exploit discriminative features in the spatial domain and report outstanding performance under intra-dataset settings. However, the degradation of performance is inevitable under cross-dataset settings, suffering from domain shift. In consideration of real-world applications, a small number of bonafide samples are easily accessible. We thus define a new domain adaptation setting called Few-shot One-class Domain Adaptation (FODA), where adaptation only relies on a limited number of target bonafide samples. To address this problem, we propose a novel FODA framework based on the expressive power of frequency information. Specifically, our method integrates frequency-related information through two proposed modules. Frequency-based Attention Module (FAM) aggregates frequency information into spatial attention and explicitly emphasizes high-frequency fine-grained features. Frequency Mixing Module (FMM) mixes certain frequency components to generate large-scale target-style samples for adaptation with limited target bonafide samples. Extensive experiments on LivDet-Iris 2017 dataset demonstrate the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art or competitive performance under both cross-dataset and intra-dataset settings. ",

We train on synthetic images only, present approaches to increase generalizability and improve the preservation of the semantics to real datasets of increasing visual complexity. We show that pre-trained feature extractors (e.g. VGG) can be sufficient for generalization on images of lower complexity, but additional improvements are required for visually more complex scenes. To this end, we demonstrate a new sampling technique, which matches semantically important parts of the image, while randomizing the other parts, leads to salient feature extraction and a neglection of unimportant parts.

Recovery forecasting is critical for the oil and gas industry as it directly affects a company's profit. However, current approaches to forecasting the RF are complex and computationally expensive. In addition, they require vast amount of data and are difficult to constrain in the early stages of reservoir development. To address this problem, we propose a BN approach and describe ways to improve parameter predictions' accuracy. Various training hyperparameters for BNs were considered, and the best ones were used. The approaches of structure and parameter learning, data discretization and normalization, subsampling on analogues of the target reservoir, clustering of networks and data filtering were considered. Finally, a physical model of a synthetic oil reservoir was used to validate BNs' predictions of the RF. All approaches to modelling based on BNs provide full coverage of the confidence interval for the RF predicted by the physical model, but at the same time require less time and data for modelling, which demonstrates the possibility of using in the early stages of reservoirs development. The main result of the work can be considered the development of a methodology for studying the parameters of reservoirs based on Bayesian networks built on small amounts of data and with minimal involvement of expert knowledge.

These layers require many new parameters and are hyperparameter sensitive. They significantly increase training time, memory cost, and potential latency which can prove costly for resource-limited or real-time applications. In this paper, we present a fast learnable once-for-all adversarial training (FLOAT) algorithm, which instead of the existing FiLM-based conditioning, presents a unique weight conditioned learning that requires no additional layer, thereby incurring no significant increase in parameter count, training time, or network latency compared to standard adversarial training. In particular, we add configurable scaled noise to the weight tensors that enables a trade-off between clean and adversarial performance. Extensive experiments show that FLOAT can yield SOTA performance improving both clean and perturbed image classification by up to ~6% and ~10%, respectively. Moreover, real hardware measurement shows that FLOAT can reduce the training time by up to 1.43x with fewer model parameters of up to 1.47x on iso-hyperparameter settings compared to the FiLM-based alternatives. Additionally, to further improve memory efficiency we introduce FLOAT sparse (FLOATS), a form of non-iterative model pruning and provide detailed empirical analysis to provide a three way accuracy-robustness-complexity trade-off for these new class of pruned conditionally trained models.

Model sets, such as neural networks (NNs) and physics-guided neural networks (PGNNs) are typically used as flexible parametrizations that enable accurate identification of the inverse system dynamics. Currently, these (PG)NNs are used to identify the inverse dynamics directly. However, direct identification of the inverse dynamics is sensitive to noise that is present in the training data, and thereby results in biased parameter estimates which limit the achievable tracking performance. In order to push performance further, it is therefore crucial to account for noise when performing the identification. To address this problem, this paper proposes the use of a forward system identification using (PG)NNs from noisy data. Afterwards, two methods are proposed for inverting PGNNs to design a feedforward controller for high-precision motion control. The developed methodology is validated on a real-life industrial linear motor, where it showed significant improvements in tracking performance with respect to the direct inverse identification. ",

    "title": "An image classification approach for hole detection in wireless sensor  networks",
    "abstract": "Hole detection is a crucial task for monitoring the status of wireless sensor networks (WSN) which often consist of low-capability sensors. Holes can form in WSNs due to the problems during placement of the sensors or power/hardware failure. In these situations, sensing or transmitting data could be affected and can interrupt the normal operation of the WSNs. It may also decrease the lifetime of the network and sensing coverage of the sensors. The problem of hole detection is especially challenging in WSNs since the exact location of the sensors is often unknown. In this paper, we propose a novel hole detection approach called FD-CNN which is based on Force-directed (FD) Algorithm and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). In contrast to existing approaches, FD-CNN is a centralized approach and is able to detect holes from WSNs without relying on the information related to the location of the sensors. The proposed approach also alleviates the problem of high computational complexity in distributed approaches. The proposed approach accepts the network topology of a WSN as an input and generates the identity of the nodes surrounding each detected hole in the network as the final output. In the proposed approach, an FD algorithm is used to generate the layout of the wireless sensor networks followed by the identification of the holes in the layouts using a trained CNN model. In order to prepare labeled datasets for training the CNN model, an unsupervised pre-processing method is also proposed in this paper. After the holes are detected by the CNN model, two algorithms are proposed to identify the regions of the holes and corresponding nodes surrounding the regions. Extensive experiments are conducted to evaluate the proposed approach based on different datasets. Experimental results show that FD-CNN can achieve 80% sensitivity and 93% specificity in less than 2 minutes. ",

    "abstract": "Force-directed (FD) algorithms can be used to explore relationships in social networks, visualize money markets, and analyze transaction networks. However, FD algorithms are mainly designed for visualizing static graphs in which the topology of the networks remains constant throughout the calculation. In contrast to static graphs, nodes and edges in dynamic graphs can be added or removed as time progresses. In these situations, existing FD algorithms do not scale well, since any changes in the topology will trigger these algorithms to completely restart the entire computation. To alleviate this problem, we propose a design and implementation of five online FD algorithms to visualize dynamic graphs while maintaining their native force models. The online FD algorithms developed in this paper are able to reuse the force models of existing FD algorithms without significant modifications. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, online FD algorithms are compared against static FD algorithms for visualizing dynamic graphs. Experimental results show that among the five algorithms evaluated, the online FD algorithm achieves the best number of edge crossings and the standard deviation of edge lengths for visualizing dynamic graphs.

    "abstract": "Recent advances in fake news detection have exploited the success of large-scale pre-trained language models (PLMs). The predominant state-of-the-art approaches are based on fine-tuning PLMs on labelled fake news datasets. However, large-scale PLMs are generally not trained on structured factual data and hence may not possess priors that are grounded in factually accurate knowledge. The use of existing knowledge bases (KBs) with rich human-curated factual information has thus the potential to make fake news detection more effective and robust. In this paper, we investigate the impact of knowledge integration into PLMs for fake news detection. We study several state-of-the-art approaches for knowledge integration, mostly using Wikidata as KB, on two popular fake news datasets - LIAR, a politics-based dataset, and COVID-19, a dataset of messages posted on social media relating to the COVID-19 pandemic. Our experiments show that knowledge-enhanced models can significantly improve fake news detection on LIAR where the KB is relevant and up-to-date. The mixed results on COVID-19 highlight the reliance on stylistic features and the importance of domain specific and current KBs. ",

The U-Net is trained on optical images of the Moon Global Morphology Mosaic based on data collected by the LRO and manual crater catalogues. The Moon-trained network will be tested on Dawn optical images of Ceres: this task is accomplished by means of a Transfer Learning (TL) approach. The trained model has been fine-tuned using 100, 500 and 1000 additional images of Ceres. The test performance was measured on 350 never before seen images, reaching a testing accuracy of 96.24%, 96.95% and 97.19%, respectively. This means that despite the intrinsic differences between the Moon and Ceres, TL works with encouraging results. The output of the U-Net contains predicted craters: it will be post-processed applying global thresholding for image binarization and a template matching algorithm to extract craters positions and radii in the pixel space. Post-processed craters will be counted and compared to the ground truth data in order to compute image segmentation metrics: precision, recall and F1 score. These indices will be computed, and their effect will be discussed for tasks such as automated crater cataloguing and optical navigation. ",

In object detection specifically, the feature backbone is typically initialized with Imagenet classifier weights and fine-tuned on the object detection task. Recent works show this is not strictly necessary under longer training regimes and provide recipes for training the backbone from scratch. We investigate the opposite direction of this end-to-end training trend: we show that an extreme form of knowledge preservation -- freezing the classifier-initialized backbone -- consistently improves many different detection models, and leads to considerable resource savings. We hypothesize and corroborate experimentally that the remaining detector components capacity and structure is a crucial factor in leveraging the frozen backbone. Immediate applications of our findings include performance improvements on hard cases like detection of long-tail object classes and computational and memory resource savings that contribute to making the field more accessible to researchers with access to fewer computational resources.

This, in contrast to prior approaches, enables both high standard accuracies and significant provable robustness.

    "title": "A Global Modeling Approach for Load Forecasting in Distribution Networks",
    "abstract": "Efficient load forecasting is needed to ensure better observability in the distribution networks, whereas such forecasting is made possible by an increasing number of smart meter installations. Because distribution networks include a large amount of different loads at various aggregation levels, such as individual consumers, transformer stations and feeders loads, it is impractical to develop individual (or so-called local) forecasting models for each load separately. Furthermore, such local models ignore the strong dependencies between different loads that might be present due to their spatial proximity and the characteristics of the distribution network. To address these issues, this paper proposes a global modeling approach based on deep learning for efficient forecasting of a large number of loads in distribution networks. In this way, the computational burden of training a large amount of local forecasting models can be largely reduced, and the cross-series information shared among different loads can be utilized. Additionally, an unsupervised localization mechanism and optimal ensemble construction strategy are also proposed to localize/personalize the forecasting model to different groups of loads and to improve the forecasting accuracy further. Comprehensive experiments are conducted on real-world smart meter data to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach compared to competing methods. ",

Mechanistic models that form the basis of traditional forecasting perform poorly near the ground. In this paper, we take an alternative data-driven approach based on supervised learning. We analyze a massive dataset of wind measured from anemometers located at 10 m height in 32 locations in two central and north west regions of Italy (Abruzzo and Liguria). We train supervised learning algorithms using the past history of wind to predict its value at a future time (horizon). Using data from a single location and time horizon we compare systematically several algorithms where we vary the input/output variables, the memory of the input and the linear vs non-linear learning model. We then compare performance of the best algorithms across all locations and forecasting horizons. We find that the optimal design as well as its performance vary with the location. We demonstrate that the presence of a reproducible diurnal cycle provides a rationale to understand this variation. We conclude with a systematic comparison with state of the art algorithms and show that, when the model is accurately designed, shallow algorithms are competitive with more complex deep architectures.

    "abstract": "Streaming data collection is essential to real-time data analytics in various IoTs and mobile device-based systems, which, however, may expose end users' privacy. Local differential privacy (LDP) is a promising solution to privacy-preserving data collection and analysis. However, existing few LDP studies over streams are either applicable to finite streams only or suffering from insufficient protection. This paper investigates this problem by proposing LDP-IDS, a novel $w$-event LDP paradigm to provide practical privacy guarantee for infinite streams at users end, and adapting the popular budget division framework in centralized differential privacy (CDP). By constructing a unified error analysi for LDP, we first develop two adatpive budget division-based LDP methods for LDP-IDS that can enhance data utility via leveraging the non-deterministic sparsity in streams. Beyond that, we further propose a novel population division framework that can not only avoid the high sensitivity of LDP noise to budget division but also require significantly less communication. Based on the framework, we also present two adaptive population division methods for LDP-IDS with theoretical analysis. We conduct extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency pf our proposed frameworks and methods. Experimental results demonstrate that, despite the effectiveness of the adaptive budget division methods, the proposed population division framework and methods can further achieve much higher effectiveness and efficiency.

    "abstract": "Adversarial learning is a widely used technique in fair representation learning to remove the biases on sensitive attributes from data representations. It usually requires to incorporate the sensitive attribute labels as prediction targets. However, in many scenarios the sensitive attribute labels of many samples can be unknown, and it is difficult to train a strong discriminator based on the scarce data with observed attribute labels, which may lead to generate unfair representations. In this paper, we propose a semi-supervised fair representation learning approach based on adversarial variational autoencoder, which can reduce the dependency of adversarial fair models on data with labeled sensitive attributes. More specifically, we use a bias-aware model to capture inherent bias information on sensitive attribute by accurately predicting sensitive attributes from input data, and we use a bias-free model to learn debiased fair representations by using adversarial learning to remove bias information from them. The hidden representations learned by the two models are regularized to be orthogonal. In addition, the soft labels predicted by the two models are further integrated into a semi-supervised variational autoencoder to reconstruct the input data, and we apply an additional entropy regularization to encourage the attribute labels inferred from the bias-free model to be high-entropy. In this way, the bias-aware model can better capture attribute information while the bias-free model is less discriminative on sensitive attributes if the input data is well reconstructed. Extensive experiments on two datasets for different tasks validate that our approach can achieve good representation learning fairness under limited data with sensitive attribute labels. ",

    "abstract": "Distributed learning paradigms, such as federated and decentralized learning, allow for the coordination of models across a collection of agents, and without the need to exchange raw data. Instead, agents compute model updates locally based on their available data, and subsequently share the update model with a parameter server or their peers. This is followed by an aggregation step, which traditionally takes the form of a (weighted) average. Distributed learning schemes based on averaging are known to be susceptible to outliers. A single malicious agent is able to drive an averaging-based distributed learning algorithm to an arbitrarily poor model. This has motivated the development of robust aggregation schemes, which are based on variations of the median and trimmed mean. While such procedures ensure robustness to outliers and malicious behavior, they come at the cost of significantly reduced sample efficiency. This means that current robust aggregation schemes require significantly higher agent participation rates to achieve a given level of performance than their mean-based counterparts in non-contaminated settings. In this work we remedy this drawback by developing statistically efficient and robust aggregation schemes for distributed learning. ",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a novel approach for guiding a Generative Adversarial Network trained on the FashionGen dataset to generate designs corresponding to target fashion styles. Finding the latent vectors in the generator's latent space that correspond to a style is approached as an evolutionary search problem. A Gaussian mixture model is applied to identify fashion styles based on the higher-layer representations of outfits in a clothing-specific attribute prediction model. Over generations, a genetic algorithm optimizes a population of designs to increase their probability of belonging to one of the Gaussian mixture components or styles. Showing that the developed system can generate images of maximum fitness visually resembling certain styles, our approach provides a promising direction to guide the search for style-coherent designs.

Historically, large communities often used a collection of mailing lists to discuss the different aspects of their projects. Multimodal tool use, with software development and communication happening on different channels, complicates the study of open source projects as a sociotechnical system. Here, we combine and standardize mailing lists of the Python community, resulting in 954,287 messages from 1995 to the present. We share all scraping and cleaning code to facilitate reproduction of this work, as well as smaller datasets for the Golang (122,721 messages), Angular (20,041 messages) and Node.js (12,514 messages) communities. To showcase the usefulness of these data, we focus on the CPython repository and merge the technical layer (which GitHub account works on what file and with whom) with the social layer (messages from unique email addresses) by identifying 33% of GitHub contributors in the mailing list data. We then explore correlations between the valence of social messaging and the structure of the collaboration network. We discuss how these data provide a laboratory to test theories from standard organizational science in large open source projects. ",

    "abstract": "We present Dance2Music-GAN (D2M-GAN), a novel adversarial multi-modal framework that generates complex musical samples conditioned on dance videos. Our proposed framework takes dance video frames and human body motion as input, and learns to generate music samples that plausibly accompany the corresponding input. Unlike most existing conditional music generation works that generate specific types of mono-instrumental sounds using symbolic audio representations (e.g., MIDI), and that heavily rely on pre-defined musical synthesizers, in this work we generate dance music in complex styles (e.g., pop, breakdancing, etc.) by employing a Vector Quantized (VQ) audio representation, and leverage both its generality and the high abstraction capacity of its symbolic and continuous counterparts. By performing an extensive set of experiments on multiple datasets, and following a comprehensive evaluation protocol, we assess the generative quality of our approach against several alternatives. The quantitative results, which measure the music consistency, beats correspondence, and music diversity, clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method. Last but not least, we curate a challenging dance-music dataset of in-the-wild TikTok videos, which we use to further demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in real-world applications - and which we hope to serve as a starting point for relevant future research.

    "abstract": "Many recent self-supervised frameworks for visual representation learning are based on certain forms of Siamese networks. Such networks are conceptually symmetric with two parallel encoders, but often practically asymmetric as numerous mechanisms are devised to break the symmetry. In this work, we conduct a formal study on the importance of asymmetry by explicitly distinguishing the two encoders within the network -- one produces source encodings and the other targets. Our key insight is keeping a relatively lower variance in target than source generally benefits learning. This is empirically justified by our results from five case studies covering different variance-oriented designs, and is aligned with our preliminary theoretical analysis on the baseline. Moreover, we find the improvements from asymmetric designs generalize well to longer training schedules, multiple other frameworks and newer backbones. Finally, the combined effect of several asymmetric designs achieves a state-of-the-art accuracy on ImageNet linear probing and competitive results on downstream transfer. We hope our exploration will inspire more research in exploiting asymmetry for Siamese representation learning. ",

This procedure imposes a structure on the representations that reduce their expressivity for training downstream classifiers, which helps them generalize better. Specifically, we show that the temperature $\\tau$ of the Softmax operation controls for the SEM representation's expressivity, allowing us to derive a tighter downstream classifier generalization bound than that for classifiers using unnormalized representations. We empirically demonstrate that SEMs considerably improve generalization on natural image datasets such as CIFAR-100 and ImageNet. Finally, we also present evidence of the emergence of semantically relevant features in SEMs, a pattern that is absent from baseline self-supervised models. ",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the most common public health issues the world is facing today. This disease has a high prevalence primarily in the elderly accompanying memory loss and cognitive decline. AD detection is a challenging task which many authors have developed numerous computerized automatic diagnosis systems utilizing neuroimaging and other clinical data. MRI scans provide high-intensity visible features, making these scans the most widely used brain imaging technique. In recent years deep learning has achieved leading success in medical image analysis. But a relatively little investigation has been done to apply deep learning techniques for the brain MRI classification. This paper explores the construction of several deep learning architectures evaluated on brain MRI images and segmented images. The idea behind segmented images investigates the influence of image segmentation step on deep learning classification. The image processing presented a pipeline consisting of pre-processing to enhance the MRI scans and post-processing consisting of a segmentation method for segmenting the brain tissues. The results show that the processed images achieved a better accuracy in the binary classification of AD vs. CN (Cognitively Normal) across four different architectures. ResNet architecture resulted in the highest prediction accuracy amongst the other architectures (90.83% for the original brain images and 93.50% for the processed images). ",

While various adversarial robustness testing approaches were introduced in the last decade, we note that most of them are incompatible with non-differentiable models such as tree ensembles. Since tree ensembles are widely used in industry, this reveals a crucial gap between adversarial robustness research and practical applications. This paper proposes a novel whitebox adversarial robustness testing approach for tree ensemble models. Concretely, the proposed approach smooths the tree ensembles through temperature controlled sigmoid functions, which enables gradient descent-based adversarial attacks. By leveraging sampling and the log-derivative trick, the proposed approach can scale up to testing tasks that were previously unmanageable. We compare the approach against both random perturbations and blackbox approaches on multiple public datasets (and corresponding models). Our results show that the proposed method can 1) successfully reveal the adversarial vulnerability of tree ensemble models without causing computational pressure for testing and 2) flexibly balance the search performance and time complexity to meet various testing criteria.

However, many practical problems call for decision-making with some auxiliary information, and DRO in the context of conditional distribution is not straightforward. We propose a conditional kernel distributionally robust optimization (CKDRO) method that enables robust decision making under conditional distributions through kernel DRO and the conditional mean operator in the reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). In particular, we consider problems where there is a correlation between the unknown variable y and an auxiliary observable variable x. Given past data of the two variables and a queried auxiliary variable, CKDRO represents the conditional distribution P(y|x) as the conditional mean operator in the RKHS space and quantifies the ambiguity set in the RKHS as well, which depends on the size of the dataset as well as the query point. To justify the use of RKHS, we demonstrate that the ambiguity set defined in RKHS can be viewed as a ball under a metric that is similar to the Wasserstein metric. The DRO is then dualized and solved via a finite dimensional convex program. The proposed CKDRO approach is applied to a generation scheduling problem and shows that the result of CKDRO is superior to common benchmarks in terms of quality and robustness. ",

    "abstract": "Existing light field representations, such as epipolar plane image (EPI) and sub-aperture images, do not consider the structural characteristics across the views, so they usually require additional disparity and spatial structure cues for follow-up tasks. Besides, they have difficulties dealing with occlusions or larger disparity scenes. To this end, this paper proposes a novel Epipolar Focus Spectrum (EFS) representation by rearranging the EPI spectrum. Different from the classical EPI representation where an EPI line corresponds to a specific depth, there is a one-to-one mapping from the EFS line to the view. Accordingly, compared to a sparsely-sampled light field, a densely-sampled one with the same field of view (FoV) leads to a more compact distribution of such linear structures in the double-cone-shaped region with the identical opening angle in its corresponding EFS. Hence the EFS representation is invariant to the scene depth. To demonstrate its effectiveness, we develop a trainable EFS-based pipeline for light field reconstruction, where a dense light field can be reconstructed by compensating the \"missing EFS lines\" given a sparse light field, yielding promising results with cross-view consistency, especially in the presence of severe occlusion and large disparity. Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the validity and superiority of the proposed method over SOTA methods. ",

We propose a simple framework that ease the creation of datasets for the training of deep nets targeting optical image reconstruction, and for the validation of machine learning based or deterministic approaches. These methods are quite different in terms of input images constraints, and comparing them is a problematic task not addressed in the literature. We show how space partitioning data structures help to query samples in terms of cloud coverage, relative acquisition date, pixel validity and relative proximity between SAR and optical images. We generate several datasets to compare the reconstructed images from networks that use a single pair of SAR and optical image, versus networks that use multiple pairs, and a traditional deterministic approach performing interpolation in temporal domain.

This work, investigating the speech representations derived from articulatory kinematics signals, uses a neural implementation of convolutive sparse matrix factorization to decompose the articulatory data into interpretable gestures and gestural scores. By applying sparse constraints, the gestural scores leverage the discrete combinatorial properties of phonological gestures. Phoneme recognition experiments were additionally performed to show that gestural scores indeed code phonological information successfully. The proposed work thus makes a bridge between articulatory phonology and deep neural networks to leverage informative, intelligible, interpretable,and efficient speech representations. ",

Contrary to existing literature that uses L1 regularization to approximate sparseness, we solve the problem with exact sparsity k. The main novelty in our proposal lies in showing a problem formulation with zero duality gap for which we adopt a dual approach to solve the problem in a decentralized way. This sets a foundational approach for the study of distributed optimization with explicit sparsity constraints. We show theoretically and empirically that, under appropriate assumptions, where each agent solves smaller and local integer programming problems, all agents will eventually reach a consensus on the same sparse optimal regressor.

In classical estimation theory, measure-valued stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs) are derived for the filtering and prediction measures. These equations can be hard to solve numerically. We provide an approximation algorithm using conditional generative adversarial networks (GANs) and signatures, an object from rough path theory. The signature of a sufficiently smooth path determines the path completely. In some cases, GANs based on signatures have been shown to efficiently approximate the law of a stochastic process. In this paper we extend this method to approximate the prediction measure conditional to noisy observation. We use controlled differential equations (CDEs) as universal approximators to propose an estimator for the conditional and prediction law.
