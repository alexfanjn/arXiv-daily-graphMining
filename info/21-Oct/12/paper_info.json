    "abstract": "Most numerical methods for time integration use real time steps. Complex time steps provide an additional degree of freedom, as we can select the magnitude of the step in both the real and imaginary directions. By time stepping along specific paths in the complex plane, integrators can gain higher orders of accuracy or achieve expanded stability regions. Complex time stepping also allows us to break the Runge-Kutta order barrier, enabling 5th order accuracy using only five function evaluations. We show how to derive these paths for explicit and implicit methods, discuss computational costs and storage benefits, and demonstrate clear advantages for complex-valued systems like the Schrodinger equation.

This work proposes a new ensemble method for managing multilabel classification: the core of the proposed approach combines a set of gated recurrent units and temporal convolutional neural networks trained with variants of the Adam optimization approach.

The proposed neural network approach is also combined with Incorporating Multiple Clustering Centers (IMCC), which further boosts classification performance. Multiple experiments on nine data sets representing a wide variety of multilabel tasks demonstrate the robustness of our best ensemble, which is shown to outperform the state-of-the-art.

    "abstract": "We introduce DeepABM, a framework for agent-based modeling that leverages geometric message passing of graph neural networks for simulating action and interactions over large agent populations. Using DeepABM allows scaling simulations to large agent populations in real-time and running them efficiently on GPU architectures. To demonstrate the effectiveness of DeepABM, we build DeepABM-COVID simulator to provide support for various non-pharmaceutical interventions (quarantine, exposure notification, vaccination, testing) for the COVID-19 pandemic, and can scale to populations of representative size in real-time on a GPU. Specifically, DeepABM-COVID can model 200 million interactions (over 100,000 agents across 180 time-steps) in 90 seconds, and is made available online to help researchers with modeling and analysis of various interventions. We explain various components of the framework and discuss results from one research study to evaluate the impact of delaying the second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine in collaboration with clinical and public health experts. While we simulate COVID-19 spread, the ideas introduced in the paper are generic and can be easily extend to other forms of agent-based simulations. Furthermore, while beyond scope of this document, DeepABM enables inverse agent-based simulations which can be used to learn physical parameters in the (micro) simulations using gradient-based optimization with large-scale real-world (macro) data. We are optimistic that the current work can have interesting implications for bringing ABM and AI communities closer. ",

    "abstract": "The end-to-end speech synthesis model can directly take an utterance as reference audio, and generate speech from the text with prosody and speaker characteristics similar to the reference audio. However, an appropriate acoustic embedding must be manually selected during inference. Due to the fact that only the matched text and speech are used in the training process, using unmatched text and speech for inference would cause the model to synthesize speech with low content quality. In this study, we propose to mitigate these two problems by using multiple reference audios and style embedding constraints rather than using only the target audio. Multiple reference audios are automatically selected using the sentence similarity determined by Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT). In addition, we use ''target'' style embedding from a Pre-trained encoder as a constraint by considering the mutual information between the predicted and ''target'' style embedding. The experimental results show that the proposed model can improve the speech naturalness and content quality with multiple reference audios and can also outperform the baseline model in ABX preference tests of style similarity.

A pre-trained, large teacher network, for example, was shown to be able to bootstrap a student model that eventually outperforms the teacher in a limited label environment. Despite these advances, it still is relatively unclear \\emph{why} this method works, that is, what the resulting student model does 'better'. To address this issue, here, we utilize two non-linear, low-dimensional embedding methods (t-SNE and IVIS) to visualize representation spaces of different layers in a network. We perform a set of extensive experiments with different architecture parameters and distillation methods. The resulting visualizations and metrics clearly show that distillation guides the network to find a more compact representation space for higher accuracy already in earlier layers compared to its non-distilled version.

In their self-supervised work Chen et al. found that colour augmentation prevents a classification network from using image colour statistics as a short-cut for self-supervised learning via instance discrimination. Drawing inspiration from this we find that a similar problem impedes semi-supervised semantic segmentation and offer colour augmentation as a solution, improving semi-supervised semantic segmentation performance on challenging photographic imagery.

    "abstract": "When interacting with smart devices such as mobile phones or wearables, the user typically invokes a virtual assistant (VA) by saying a keyword or by pressing a button on the device. However, in many cases, the VA can accidentally be invoked by the keyword-like speech or accidental button press, which may have implications on user experience and privacy. To this end, we propose an acoustic false-trigger-mitigation (FTM) approach for on-device device-directed speech detection that simultaneously handles the voice-trigger and touch-based invocation. To facilitate the model deployment on-device, we introduce a new streaming decision layer, derived using the notion of temporal convolutional networks (TCN) [1], known for their computational efficiency. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first approach that can detect device-directed speech from more than one invocation type in a streaming fashion. We compare this approach with streaming alternatives based on vanilla Average layer, and canonical LSTMs, and show: (i) that all the models show only a small degradation in accuracy compared with the invocation-specific models, and (ii) that the newly introduced streaming TCN consistently performs better or comparable with the alternatives, while mitigating device undirected speech faster in time, and with (relative) reduction in runtime peak-memory over the LSTM-based approach of 33% vs. 7%, when compared to a non-streaming counterpart.

The nonlinear flow problem finds broad application in the context of gas distribution networks. We propose a snapshot-based reduction approach that consists of a mixed variational Galerkin approximation combined with quadrature-type complexity reduction. Its main feature is that certain compatibility conditions are assured during the training phase, which make our approach structure-preserving. The resulting reduced models are locally mass conservative and inherit an energy-bound and port-Hamiltonian structure. We also derive a well-posedness result for them. In the training phase, the compatibility conditions pose challenges, we face constrained data approximation problems as opposed to the unconstrained training problems in the conventional reduction methods. The training of our model order reduction consists of a principal component analysis under a compatibility constraint and, notably, yields reduced models that fulfill an optimality condition for the snapshot data. The training of our quadrature-type complexity reduction involves a semi-definite program with combinatorial aspects, which we approach by a greedy procedure. ",

Identifying loose rocks by inspection of slopes adjacent to roadways and other infrastructure and removing them in advance can be an effective way to prevent unexpected rockfall incidents. This paper proposes a system towards an automated inspection for potential rockfalls. A robot is used to repeatedly strike or tap on the rock surface. The sound from the tapping is collected by the robot and subsequently classified with the intent of identifying rocks that are broken and prone to fall. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) of the collected acoustic data is used to recognize patterns associated with rocks of various conditions, including intact as well as rock with different types and locations of cracks. The PCA classification was first demonstrated simulating sounds of different characteristics that were automatically trained and tested. Secondly, a laboratory test was conducted tapping rock specimens with three different levels of discontinuity in depth and shape. A real microphone mounted on the robot recorded the sound and the data were classified in three clusters within 2D space. A model was created using the training data to classify the reminder of the data (the test data). The performance of the method is evaluated with a confusion matrix. ",

MELONS adopts a multi-step generation method with transformer-based networks by factoring melody generation into two sub-problems: structure generation and structure conditional melody generation. Experimental results show that MELONS can produce structured melodies with high quality and rich contents. ",

A popular performance measure currently used to do this is the Fr\\'echet Inception Distance (FID). However, FID assumes that images featurized using the penultimate layer of Inception-v3 follow a Gaussian distribution. This assumption allows FID to be easily computed, since FID uses the 2-Wasserstein distance of two Gaussian distributions fitted to the featurized images. However, we show that Inception-v3 features of the ImageNet dataset are not Gaussian; in particular, each marginal is not Gaussian. To remedy this problem, we model the featurized images using Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) and compute the 2-Wasserstein distance restricted to GMMs. We define a performance measure, which we call WaM, on two sets of images by using Inception-v3 (or another classifier) to featurize the images, estimate two GMMs, and use the restricted 2-Wasserstein distance to compare the GMMs. We experimentally show the advantages of WaM over FID, including how FID is more sensitive than WaM to image perturbations. By modelling the non-Gaussian features obtained from Inception-v3 as GMMs and using a GMM metric, we can more accurately evaluate generative network performance. ",

    "abstract": "In a recent work by three of the authors, in order to enforce synchronization for scalar heterogeneous multi-agent systems with some useful characteristics, a node-wise funnel coupling law was proposed. The emergent dynamics, to which each of the agents synchronizes, was characterized and it was studied how networks can be synthesized which exhibit these emergent dynamics. The advantage of this synthesis is its suitability for plug-and-play operation. However, the aforementioned emergent dynamics under node-wise funnel coupling are determined by an algebraic equation which does not admit an explicit solution in general, and even its pointwise solution proves rather difficult. Furthermore, the contractivity assumption on the emergent dynamics, required to establish the synchronization, is hard to be checked without solving the algebraic equation. To resolve these drawbacks, in the present paper we present a new funnel coupling law that uses edge-wise output differences. Under this novel coupling the benign properties of node-wise funnel coupling are retained, but the emergent dynamics are given explicitly by the blended dynamics of the multi-agent system, which already proved an advantageous tool in the analysis and design of such networks. Additionally, our results are not restricted to scalar systems and treat the case that neighboring agents only communicate their output information, and not their complete state. ",

Aura is `ears-off' because it relies on a feature extractor and a metric of speech quality, DNSMOS P.835, both pre-trained on data obtained from public sources. As an application of \\aura, we augment a current benchmark test set in noise suppression by sampling audio files from a new batch of data of 20K clean speech clips from Librivox mixed with noise clips obtained from AudioSet. Aura makes the existing benchmark test set harder by 100% in DNSMOS P.835, a 26 improvement in Spearman's rank correlation coefficient (SRCC) compared to random sampling and, identifies 73% out-of-distribution samples to augment the test set.

We show that a complex system like the baseline of the Voice Privacy Challenge can be approximated by a rotation, estimated using a limited set of x-vectors. This paper studies the space of solutions for voice anonymization within the specific scope of rotations. Rotations being reversible, the proposed method can recover up to 62% of the speaker identities from anonymized embeddings. ",
