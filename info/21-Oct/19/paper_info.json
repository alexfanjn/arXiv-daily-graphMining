    "abstract": "Recent developments in AI have made it ubiquitous, every industry is trying to adopt some form of intelligent processing of their data. Despite so many advances in the field, AIs full capability is yet to be exploited by the industry. Industries that involve some risk factors still remain cautious about the usage of AI due to the lack of trust in such autonomous systems. Present-day AI might be very good in a lot of things but it is very bad in reasoning and this behavior of AI can lead to catastrophic results. Autonomous cars crashing into a person or a drone getting stuck in a tree are a few examples where AI decisions lead to catastrophic results. To develop insight and generate an explanation about the learning capability of AI, we will try to analyze the working of loss functions. For our case, we will use two sets of loss functions, generalized loss functions like Binary cross-entropy or BCE and specialized loss functions like Dice loss or focal loss. Through a series of experiments, we will establish whether combining different loss functions is better than using a single loss function and if yes, then what is the reason behind it. In order to establish the difference between generalized loss and specialized losses, we will train several models using the above-mentioned losses and then compare their robustness on adversarial examples. In particular, we will look at how fast the accuracy of different models decreases when we change the pixels corresponding to the most salient gradients. ",

    "abstract": "In wireless multi-hop networks, such as wireless sensor networks, link quality (LQ) is one of the most important metrics and is widely used in higher-layer applications such as routing protocols. An accurate link quality prediction may greatly help to improve the performance of wireless multi-hop networks. Researchers have proposed a lot of link quality prediction models in recent years. However, due to the dynamic and stochastic nature of wireless transmission, the performance of link quality prediction remains challenging. In this article, we mainly analyze the influence of the stochastic nature of wireless transmission on the link quality prediction model and discuss the benefits in the application of wireless multi-hop networks with the performance-limited link quality prediction models.

In the field of statistics, current studies of citation data have mostly focused on the interactions between statistical journals and papers, limiting the measure of influence to mainly within statistics itself. In this paper, we take the first step towards understanding the impact statistics has made on other scientific fields in the era of Big Data. By collecting comprehensive bibliometric data from the Web of Science database for selected statistical journals, we investigate the citation trends and compositions of citing fields over time to show that their diversity has been increasing. Furthermore, we use the local clustering technique involving personalized PageRank with conductance for size selection to find the most relevant statistical research area for a given external topic of interest. We provide theoretical guarantees for the procedure and, through a number of case studies, show the results from our citation data align well with our knowledge and intuition about these external topics. Overall, we have found that the statistical theory and methods recently invented by the statistics community have made increasing impact on other scientific fields. ",

    "abstract": "Integrated healthcare systems require the transmission of medical images between medical centers. The presence of watermarks in such images has become important for patient privacy protection. However, some important issues should be considered while watermarking an image. Among these issues, the watermark should be robust against attacks and does not affect the quality of the image. In this paper, a watermarking approach employing a robust dynamic secret code is proposed. This approach is to process every pixel of the digital image and not only the pixels of the regions of non-interest at the same time it preserves the image details. The performance of the proposed approach is evaluated using several performance measures such as the Mean Square Error (MSE), the Mean Absolute Error (MAE), the Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR), the Universal Image Quality Index (UIQI) and the Structural Similarity Index (SSIM). The proposed approach has been tested and shown robustness in detecting the intentional attacks that change image, specifically the most important diagnostic information. ",

Current machine learning methods offer to project such body of literature into the vector space, where similar documents are located close to each other, offering an insightful exploration of scientific papers and other knowledge sources associated with COVID-19. However, to start searching, such texts need to be appropriately annotated, which is seldom the case due to the lack of human resources. In our system, the current body of COVID-19-related literature is annotated using unsupervised keyphrase extraction, facilitating the initial queries to the latent space containing the learned document embeddings (low-dimensional representations). The solution is accessible through a web server capable of interactive search, term ranking, and exploration of potentially interesting literature. We demonstrate the usefulness of the approach via case studies from the medicinal chemistry domain. ",

    "title": "Spy game: FPT-algorithm, hardness and graph products",
    "abstract": "In the $(s,d)$-spy game over a graph $G$, $k$ guards and one spy occupy some vertices of $G$ and, at each turn, the spy may move with speed $s$ (along at most $s$ edges) and each guard may move along one edge. The spy and the guards may occupy the same vertices. The spy wins if she reaches a vertex at distance more than the surveilling distance $d$ from every guard. This game was introduced by Cohen et al. in 2016 and is related to two well-studied games: Cops and robber game and Eternal Dominating game. The guard number $gn_{s,d}(G)$ is the minimum number of guards such that the guards have a winning strategy (of controlling the spy) in the graph $G$. In 2018, it was proved that deciding if the spy has a winning strategy is NP-hard for every speed $s\\geq 2$ and distance $d\\geq 0$. In this paper, we initiate the investigation of the guard number in grids and in graph products. We obtain a strict upper bound on the strong product of two general graphs and obtain examples with King grids that match this bound and other examples for which the guard number is smaller. We also obtain the exact value of the guard number in the lexicographical product of two general graphs for any distance $d\\geq 2$. From the algorithmic point of view, we prove a positive result: if the number $k$ of guards is fixed, the spy game is solvable in polynomial XP time $O(n^{3k+2})$ for every speed $s\\geq 2$ and distance $d\\geq 0$. In other words, the spy game is XP when parameterized by the number of guards. This XP algorithm is used to obtain an FPT algorithm on the $P_4$-fewness of the graph. As a negative result, we prove that the spy game is W[2]-hard even in bipartite graphs when parameterized by the number of guards, for every speed $s\\geq 2$ and distance $d\\geq 0$, extending the hardness result of Cohen et al. in 2018.

    "abstract": "In recent years, a new interest for the use of graph-theory based networks has emerged within the field of cognitive science. This has played a key role in mining the large amount of data generated by word association norms. In the present work, we applied semantic network analyses to explore norms of French word associations for concrete and abstract concepts (Lakhzoum et al., 2021). Graph analyses have shown that the network exhibits high clustering coefficient, sparse density, and small average shortest path length for both the concrete and abstract networks. These characteristics are consistent with a small-world structure. Comparisons between local node statistics and global structural topology showed that abstract and concrete concepts present a similar local connectivity but different overall patterns of structural organisation with concrete concepts presenting an organisation in densely connected communities compared to abstract concepts. These patterns confirm previously acquired knowledge about the dichotomy of abstract and concrete concepts on a larger scale. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to confirm the generalisability of these properties to the French language and with an emphasis on abstract and concrete concepts. ",

This research proposes a new method for measuring the influence of political beliefs within larger context of belief system networks, based on the advances in psychometric network methods and network influence research. Using the latest round of the European Social Survey data, we demonstrate this approach on a belief network expressing support for the regime in 29 European countries and capturing beliefs related to support for regime performance, principles, institutions, and political actors. Our results show that the average influence of beliefs can be related to the consistency and connectivity of the belief network and that the influence of specific beliefs (e.g. Satisfaction with Democracy) on a country level has a significant negative correlation with external indicators from the same domain (e.g. Liberal Democracy index), which suggests that highly influential beliefs are related to pressing political issues. These findings suggest that network-based belief influence metrics estimated from large-scale survey data can be used a new type of indicator in comparative political research, which opens new avenues for integrating psychometric network analysis methods into political science methodology.

Currently, IV contrast is poorly documented in imaging metadata and necessitates manual correction and annotation by clinician experts, presenting a major barrier to imaging analyses and algorithm deployment. We sought to develop and validate a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based deep learning (DL) platform to identify IV contrast within CT scans. Methods: For model development and evaluation, we used independent datasets of CT scans of head, neck (HN) and lung cancer patients, totaling 133,480 axial 2D scan slices from 1,979 CT scans manually annotated for contrast presence by clinical experts. Five different DL models were adopted and trained in HN training datasets for slice-level contrast detection. Model performances were evaluated on a hold-out set and on an independent validation set from another institution. DL models was then fine-tuned on chest CT data and externally validated on a separate chest CT dataset. Results: Initial DICOM metadata tags for IV contrast were missing or erroneous in 1,496 scans (75.6%). The EfficientNetB4-based model showed the best overall detection performance. For HN scans, AUC was 0.996 in the internal validation set (n = 216) and 1.0 in the external validation set (n = 595). The fine-tuned model on chest CTs yielded an AUC: 1.0 for the internal validation set (n = 53), and AUC: 0.980 for the external validation set (n = 402). Conclusion: The DL model could accurately detect IV contrast in both HN and chest CT scans with near-perfect performance. ",

    "abstract": "As a classical problem in the field of complex networks, link prediction has attracted much attention from researchers, which is of great significance to help us understand the evolution and dynamic development mechanisms of networks. Although various network type-specific algorithms have been proposed to tackle the link prediction problem, most of them suppose that the network structure is dominated by the Triadic Closure Principle. We still lack an adaptive and comprehensive understanding of network formation patterns for predicting potential links. In addition, it is valuable to investigate how network local information can be better utilized. To this end, we proposed a novel method named Link prediction using Multiple Order Local Information (MOLI) that exploits the local information from the neighbors of different distances, with parameters that can be a prior-driven based on prior knowledge, or data-driven by solving an optimization problem on observed networks. MOLI defined a local network diffusion process via random walks on the graph, resulting in better use of network information. We show that MOLI outperforms the other 11 widely used link prediction algorithms on 11 different types of simulated and real-world networks. We also conclude that there are different patterns of local information utilization for different networks, including social networks, communication networks, biological networks, etc. In particular, the classical common neighbor-based algorithm is not as adaptable to all social networks as it is perceived to be; instead, some of the social networks obey the Quadrilateral Closure Principle which preferentially connects paths of length three.

    "abstract": "Segmenting deep brain structures from magnetic resonance images is important for patient diagnosis, surgical planning, and research. Most current state-of-the-art solutions follow a segmentation-by-registration approach, where subject MRIs are mapped to a template with well-defined segmentations. However, registration-based pipelines are time-consuming, thus, limiting their clinical use. This paper uses deep learning to provide a robust and efficient deep brain segmentation solution. The method consists of a pre-processing step to conform all MRI images to the same orientation, followed by a convolutional neural network using the nnU-Net framework. We use a total of 14 datasets from both research and clinical collections. Of these, seven were used for training and validation and seven were retained for independent testing. We trained the network to segment 30 deep brain structures, as well as a brain mask, using labels generated from a registration-based approach. We evaluated the generalizability of the network by performing a leave-one-dataset-out cross-validation, and extensive testing on external datasets. Furthermore, we assessed cross-domain transportability by evaluating the results separately on different domains. We achieved an average DSC of 0.89 $\\pm$ 0.04 on the independent testing datasets when compared to the registration-based gold standard. On our test system, the computation time decreased from 42 minutes for a reference registration-based pipeline to 1 minute. Our proposed method is fast, robust, and generalizes with high reliability. It can be extended to the segmentation of other brain structures. The method is publicly available on GitHub, as well as a pip package for convenient usage. ",
