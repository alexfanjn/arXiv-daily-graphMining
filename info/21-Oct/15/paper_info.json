    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a new deep unfolding neural network based on the ADMM algorithm for analysis Compressed Sensing. The proposed network jointly learns a redundant analysis operator for sparsification and reconstructs the signal of interest. We compare our proposed network with a state-of-the-art unfolded ISTA decoder, that also learns an orthogonal sparsifier. Moreover, we consider not only image, but also speech datasets as test examples. Computational experiments demonstrate that our proposed network outperforms the state-of-the-art deep unfolding networks, consistently for both real-world image and speech datasets. ",

    "title": "Solving multiscale steady radiative transfer equation using neural  networks with uniform stability",
    "abstract": "This paper concerns solving the steady radiative transfer equation with diffusive scaling, using the physics informed neural networks (PINNs). The idea of PINNs is to minimize a least-square loss function, that consists of the residual from the governing equation, the mismatch from the boundary conditions, and other physical constraints such as conservation. It is advantageous of being flexible and easy to execute, and brings the potential for high dimensional problems. Nevertheless, due the presence of small scales, the vanilla PINNs can be extremely unstable for solving multiscale steady transfer equations. In this paper, we propose a new formulation of the loss based on the macro-micro decomposition. We prove that, the new loss function is uniformly stable with respect to the small Knudsen number in the sense that the $L^2$-error of the neural network solution is uniformly controlled by the loss. When the boundary condition is an-isotropic, a boundary layer emerges in the diffusion limit and therefore brings an additional difficulty in training the neural network. To resolve this issue, we include a boundary layer corrector that carries over the sharp transition part of the solution and leaves the rest easy to be approximated. The effectiveness of the new methodology is demonstrated in extensive numerical examples. ",

    "abstract": "Understanding of causal narratives communicated in clinical notes can help make strides towards personalized healthcare. In this work, MIMICause, we propose annotation guidelines, develop an annotated corpus and provide baseline scores to identify types and direction of causal relations between a pair of biomedical concepts in clinical notes; communicated implicitly or explicitly, identified either in a single sentence or across multiple sentences. We annotate a total of 2714 de-identified examples sampled from the 2018 n2c2 shared task dataset and train four different language model based architectures. Annotation based on our guidelines achieved a high inter-annotator agreement i.e. Fleiss' kappa score of 0.72 and our model for identification of causal relation achieved a macro F1 score of 0.56 on test data. The high inter-annotator agreement for clinical text shows the quality of our annotation guidelines while the provided baseline F1 score sets the direction for future research towards understanding narratives in clinical texts.

    "title": "Preconditioners for robust optimal control problems under uncertainty",
    "abstract": "The discretization of robust quadratic optimal control problems under uncertainty using the finite element method and the stochastic collocation method leads to large saddle-point systems, which are fully coupled across the random realizations. Despite its relevance for numerous engineering problems, the solution of such systems is notoriusly challenging. In this manuscript, we study efficient preconditioners for all-at-once approaches using both an algebraic and an operator preconditioning framework. We show in particular that for values of the regularization parameter not too small, the saddle-point system can be efficiently solved by preconditioning in parallel all the state and adjoint equations. For small values of the regularization parameter, robustness can be recovered by the additional solution of a small linear system, which however couples all realizations. A mean approximation and a Chebyshev semi-iterative method are investigated to solve this reduced system. Our analysis considers a random elliptic partial differential equation whose diffusion coefficient $\\kappa(x,\\omega)$ is modeled as an almost surely continuous and positive random field, though not necessarily uniformly bounded and coercive. We further provide estimates on the dependence of the preconditioned system on the variance of the random field. Such estimates involve either the first or second moment of the random variables $1/\\min_{x\\in \\overline{D}} \\kappa(x,\\omega)$ and $\\max_{x\\in \\overline{D}}\\kappa(x,\\omega)$, where $D$ is the spatial domain. The theoretical results are confirmed by numerical experiments, and implementation details are further addressed. ",

    "abstract": "Recently, physics informed neural networks have successfully been applied to a broad variety of problems in applied mathematics and engineering. The principle idea is to use a neural network as a global ansatz function to partial differential equations. Due to the global approximation, physics informed neural networks have difficulties in displaying localized effects and strong non-linear solutions by optimization. In this work we consider material non-linearities invoked by material inhomogeneities with sharp phase interfaces. This constitutes a challenging problem for a method relying on a global ansatz. To overcome convergence issues, adaptive training strategies and domain decomposition are studied. It is shown, that the domain decomposition approach is able to accurately resolve nonlinear stress, displacement and energy fields in heterogeneous microstructures obtained from real-world $\\mu$CT-scans.

However, traffic monitoring during inclement weather such as rain is a challenging task because video quality is corrupted by streaks of falling rain on the video image, and this hinders reliable characterization not only of the road environment but also of road-user behavior during such adverse weather events. This study proposes a two-stage self-supervised learning method to remove rain streaks in traffic videos. The first and second stages address intra- and inter-frame noise, respectively. The results indicated that the model exhibits satisfactory performance in terms of the image visual quality and the Peak Signal-Noise Ratio value. ",

    "title": "A neural simulation-based inference approach for characterizing the  Galactic Center $\u03b3$-ray excess",
    "abstract": "The nature of the Fermi gamma-ray Galactic Center Excess (GCE) has remained a persistent mystery for over a decade. Although the excess is broadly compatible with emission expected due to dark matter annihilation, an explanation in terms of a population of unresolved astrophysical point sources e.g., millisecond pulsars, remains viable. The effort to uncover the origin of the GCE is hampered in particular by an incomplete understanding of diffuse emission of Galactic origin. This can lead to spurious features that make it difficult to robustly differentiate smooth emission, as expected for a dark matter origin, from more \"clumpy\" emission expected for a population of relatively bright, unresolved point sources. We use recent advancements in the field of simulation-based inference, in particular density estimation techniques using normalizing flows, in order to characterize the contribution of modeled components, including unresolved point source populations, to the GCE. Compared to traditional techniques based on the statistical distribution of photon counts, our machine learning-based method is able to utilize more of the information contained in a given model of the Galactic Center emission, and in particular can perform posterior parameter estimation while accounting for pixel-to-pixel spatial correlations in the gamma-ray map. This makes the method demonstrably more resilient to certain forms of model misspecification. On application to Fermi data, the method generically attributes a smaller fraction of the GCE flux to unresolved point sources when compared to traditional approaches. We nevertheless infer such a contribution to make up a non-negligible fraction of the GCE across all analysis variations considered, with at least $38^{+9}_{-19}\\%$ of the excess attributed to unresolved points sources in our baseline analysis.

We validate this methodology by implementing the quantum network on artificial data generated from known underlying distributions.

The new quantum generator architecture leads to an improvement in state-of-the-art implementations while maintaining shallow-depth networks. Moreover, the quantum generator successfully learns the underlying distribution functions even if trained with small training sample sets; this is particularly interesting for data augmentation applications. We deploy this novel methodology on two different quantum hardware architectures, trapped-ion and superconducting technologies, to test its hardware-independent viability. ",
