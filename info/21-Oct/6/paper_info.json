We propose an energy-based graph embedding algorithm to characterize industrial automation systems, integrating knowledge from different domains like industrial automation, communications and cybersecurity. By combining knowledge from multiple domains, the learned model is capable of making context-aware predictions regarding novel system events and can be used to evaluate the severity of anomalies that might be indicative of, e.g., cybersecurity breaches. The presented model is mappable to a biologically-inspired neural architecture, serving as a first bridge between graph embedding methods and neuromorphic computing - uncovering a promising edge application for this upcoming technology.

    "abstract": "Operator learning techniques have recently emerged as a powerful tool for learning maps between infinite-dimensional Banach spaces. Trained under appropriate constraints, they can also be effective in learning the solution operator of partial differential equations (PDEs) in an entirely self-supervised manner. In this work we analyze the training dynamics of deep operator networks (DeepONets) through the lens of Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) theory, and reveal a bias that favors the approximation of functions with larger magnitudes. To correct this bias we propose to adaptively re-weight the importance of each training example, and demonstrate how this procedure can effectively balance the magnitude of back-propagated gradients during training via gradient descent. We also propose a novel network architecture that is more resilient to vanishing gradient pathologies. Taken together, our developments provide new insights into the training of DeepONets and consistently improve their predictive accuracy by a factor of 10-50x, demonstrated in the challenging setting of learning PDE solution operators in the absence of paired input-output observations.

To accommodate the change in topology, we define the Stokes and Darcy domains implicitly via a phase-field indicator function.

In addition, we introduce a modification of DEIM that leads to positivity-preserving approximations, thus guaranteeing positive-definiteness of the system matrix. We also present a strategy for determining the required number of DEIM modes for a given number of reduced basis functions. We couple reduced basis functions on neighboring patches to enable the efficient simulation of large-scale problems that consist of repetitive subdomains. We apply our reduced basis framework to efficiently solve the inverse problem of characterizing the subsurface damage state of a complete in-situ leach mining site. ",

Like many authors, we adopt the classic epidemic SIR model, where the infection rate is the control variable. Its differential flatness property yields elementary closed-form formulae for open-loop social distancing scenarios, where, for instance, the increase of the number of uninfected people may be taken into account. Those formulae might therefore be useful to decision makers. A feedback loop stemming from model-free control leads to a remarkable robustness with respect to severe uncertainties of various kinds.

(2016), along with Neural Tangent Kernel theory, we identify the main pathologies present in deep networks that prevent them from training fast and generalizing to unseen data, and show how these can be avoided by carefully controlling the \"shape\" of the network's initialization-time kernel function. We then develop a method called Deep Kernel Shaping (DKS), which accomplishes this using a combination of precise parameter initialization, activation function transformations, and small architectural tweaks, all of which preserve the model class. In our experiments we show that DKS enables SGD training of residual networks without normalization layers on Imagenet and CIFAR-10 classification tasks at speeds comparable to standard ResNetV2 and Wide-ResNet models, with only a small decrease in generalization performance. And when using K-FAC as the optimizer, we achieve similar results for networks without skip connections. Our results apply for a large variety of activation functions, including those which traditionally perform very badly, such as the logistic sigmoid. In addition to DKS, we contribute a detailed analysis of skip connections, normalization layers, special activation functions like RELU and SELU, and various initialization schemes, explaining their effectiveness as alternative (and ultimately incomplete) ways of \"shaping\" the network's initialization-time kernel.

The complex moment is given by contour integral and approximated by using numerical quadrature. We split the error in the complex moment into the truncation error of the quadrature and rounding errors and evaluate each. This idea for error evaluation inherits our previous Hankel matrix approach, whereas the proposed method requires half the number of quadrature points for the previous approach to reduce the truncation error to the same order.

Short-term predictions of these events rely on forecasts from numerical weather models, in which, despite much improvement in the past decades, outstanding issues remain concerning model uncertainties, and increasing demands for computation and storage resources. In recent years, the advance of deep learning offers a viable alternative approach. Here, we show that a 3D convolutional neural network using a single frame of meteorology fields as input is capable of predicting the precipitation spatial distribution. The network is developed based on 39-years (1980-2018) data of meteorology and daily precipitation over the contiguous United States. The results bring fundamental advancements in weather prediction. First, the trained network alone outperforms the state-of-the-art weather models in predicting daily total precipitation, and the superiority of the network extends to forecast leads up to 5 days. Second, combining the network predictions with the weather-model forecasts significantly improves the accuracy of model forecasts, especially for heavy-precipitation events. Third, the millisecond-scale inference time of the network facilitates large ensemble predictions for further accuracy improvement. These findings strongly support the use of deep-learning in short-term weather predictions. ",

    "abstract": "Protection of physical objects against counterfeiting is an important task for the modern economies. In recent years, the high-quality counterfeits appear to be closer to originals thanks to the rapid advancement of digital technologies. To combat these counterfeits, an anti-counterfeiting technology based on hand-crafted randomness implemented in a form of copy detection patterns (CDP) is proposed enabling a link between the physical and digital worlds and being used in various brand protection applications. The modern mobile phone technologies make the verification process of CDP easier and available to the end customers. Besides a big interest and attractiveness, the CDP authentication based on the mobile phone imaging remains insufficiently studied. In this respect, in this paper we aim at investigating the CDP authentication under the real-life conditions with the codes printed on an industrial printer and enrolled via a modern mobile phone under the regular light conditions. The authentication aspects of the obtained CDP are investigated with respect to the four types of copy fakes. The impact of fakes' type used for training of authentication classifier is studied in two scenarios: (i) supervised binary classification under various assumptions about the fakes and (ii) one-class classification under unknown fakes. The obtained results show that the modern machine-learning approaches and the technical capacity of modern mobile phones allow to make the CDP authentication under unknown fakes feasible with respect to the considered types of fakes and code design.

The goal is to assign labels to the nodes of a network to certify that some given property is satisfied, in such a way that the labels can be checked locally. We first investigate which properties can be locally certified with small certificates. Not surprisingly, this is almost never the case, except for not very expressive logic fragments. Following the steps of Courcelle-Grohe, we then look for meta-theorems explaining what happens when we parameterize the problem by some standard measures of how simple the graph classes are. In that direction, our main result states that any MSO formula can be locally certified on graphs with bounded treedepth with a logarithmic number of bits per node, which is the golden standard in certification.

    "abstract": "The tendency of a jet to stay attached to a flat or convex surface is called the Coand\\u{a} effect and has many potential technical applications. The aim of this thesis is to assess how well Computational Fluid Dynamics can capture it. A Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes approach with a 2-dimensional domain was first used to simulate an offset jet on a flat plane. Whether it was for $k-\\omega$ SST or $k-\\epsilon$ turbulence model, a good prediction of the flow was found. Since it is known that streamline curvature can have an important impact on the numerical results, a jet blown tangentially to a cylinder was then considered. Using the same approach as for the flat plane, with $k-\\omega$ SST turbulence model, some of the flow features such as the separation location or velocity profiles near the jet exit were accurately predicted. However, the jet development was overall poorly captured. A Curvature Correction was then introduced in the turbulence model and if it did slightly improve the jet development, the negative impact on other quantities makes its benefits questionable. Due to the known presence of longitudinal and spanwise vortices in the flow, a Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes approach with a 3-dimensional domain was attempted but was only able to reproduce the 2-dimensional results. Although if the longitudinal vortices are artificially generated at the inlet, their development is supported by the simulation. Finally, since the shortcomings of the numerical results obtained might be due to limitations of the Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes approach, a Large Eddy Simulation was attempted. Unfortunately, due to time and computational restrictions a fully developed flow could not be obtained, the methodology and preliminary results are however presented. ",

These functions can be integrated into variational autoencoders (VAE), generative adversarial networks (GAN) or normalizing flows, and have important applications in drug discovery. Set and graph generation is most commonly performed by generating points (and sometimes edge weights) i.i.d. from a normal distribution, and processing them along with the prior vector using Transformer layers or graph neural networks. This architecture is designed to generate exchangeable distributions (all permutations of a set are equally likely) but it is hard to train due to the stochasticity of i.i.d. generation. We propose a new definition of equivariance and show that exchangeability is in fact unnecessary in VAEs and GANs. We then introduce Top-n, a deterministic, non-exchangeable set creation mechanism which learns to select the most relevant points from a trainable reference set. Top-n can replace i.i.d. generation in any VAE or GAN -- it is easier to train and better captures complex dependencies in the data. Top-n outperforms i.i.d generation by 15% at SetMNIST reconstruction, generates sets that are 64% closer to the true distribution on a synthetic molecule-like dataset, and is able to generate more diverse molecules when trained on the classical QM9 dataset. With improved foundations in one-shot generation, our algorithm contributes to the design of more effective molecule generation methods. ",

We prove that when the clusters are both large and high-quality, the model that minimizes the modified loss on the noisy training set converges to small excess risk at a rate that is comparable to the rate for non-private learning. We describe both a centralized mechanism in which the entire training set is stored by a trusted curator, and a distributed mechanism where each user stores a single labeled example and replaces her label with the label of a randomly selected user from the same cluster. We also describe a learning problem in which large clusters are necessary to achieve both strong privacy and either good precision or good recall. Our experiments show that randomizing the labels within each cluster significantly improves the privacy vs. accuracy trade-off compared to applying uniform randomized response to the labels, and also compared to learning a model via DP-SGD.

Copy detection patterns (CDP) are considered as such solution in several applications. It is assumed that being printed at the maximum achievable limit of a printing resolution of an industrial printer with the smallest symbol size 1x1 elements, the CDP cannot be copied with sufficient accuracy and thus are unclonable. In this paper, we challenge this hypothesis and consider a copy attack against the CDP based on machine learning. The experimental based on samples produced on two industrial printers demonstrate that simple detection metrics used in the CDP authentication cannot reliably distinguish the original CDP from their fakes. Thus, the paper calls for a need of careful reconsideration of CDP cloneability and search for new authentication techniques and CDP optimization because of the current attack. ",

    "abstract": "It is well-known that machine learning protocols typically under-utilize information on the probability distributions of feature vectors and related data, and instead directly compute regression or classification functions of feature vectors. In this paper we introduce a set of novel features for identifying underlying stochastic behavior of input data using the Karhunen-Lo\\'{e}ve (KL) expansion, where classification is treated as detection of anomalies from a (nominal) signal class. These features are constructed from the recent Functional Data Analysis (FDA) theory for anomaly detection. The related signal decomposition is an exact hierarchical tensor product expansion with known optimality properties for approximating stochastic processes (random fields) with finite dimensional function spaces. In principle these primary low dimensional spaces can capture most of the stochastic behavior of `underlying signals' in a given nominal class, and can reject signals in alternative classes as stochastic anomalies. Using a hierarchical finite dimensional KL expansion of the nominal class, a series of orthogonal nested subspaces is constructed for detecting anomalous signal components. Projection coefficients of input data in these subspaces are then used to train an ML classifier. However, due to the split of the signal into nominal and anomalous projection components, clearer separation surfaces of the classes arise. In fact we show that with a sufficiently accurate estimation of the covariance structure of the nominal class, a sharp classification can be obtained. We carefully formulate this concept and demonstrate it on a number of high-dimensional datasets in cancer diagnostics. This method leads to a significant increase in precision and accuracy over the current top benchmarks for the Global Cancer Map (GCM) gene expression network dataset. ",

We establish that the union of complete subgraphs are largest eigenvalue \"local\" minimizer graphs. Further, under sufficient conditions satisfied by the edge/vertex counts we prove that this union of complete components graphs are, in fact, Laplacian largest eigenvalue \"global\" maximizers; these results generalize the ones in the literature that are for just two components. These sufficient conditions can be viewed as quantifying situations where the component sizes are either 'quite homogeneous' or some of them are relatively 'negligibly small', and thus generalize known results of homogeneity of components.
