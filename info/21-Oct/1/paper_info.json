    "abstract": "Deep neural networks (DNN) have been used successfully in many scientific problems for their high prediction accuracy, but their application to genetic studies remains challenging due to their poor interpretability. In this paper, we consider the problem of scalable, robust variable selection in DNN for the identification of putative causal genetic variants in genome sequencing studies. We identified a pronounced randomness in feature selection in DNN due to its stochastic nature, which may hinder interpretability and give rise to misleading results. We propose an interpretable neural network model, stabilized using ensembling, with controlled variable selection for genetic studies. The merit of the proposed method includes: (1) flexible modelling of the non-linear effect of genetic variants to improve statistical power; (2) multiple knockoffs in the input layer to rigorously control false discovery rate; (3) hierarchical layers to substantially reduce the number of weight parameters and activations to improve computational efficiency; (4) de-randomized feature selection to stabilize identified signals. We evaluated the proposed method in extensive simulation studies and applied it to the analysis of Alzheimer disease genetics. We showed that the proposed method, when compared to conventional linear and nonlinear methods, can lead to substantially more discoveries. ",

    "title": "A system on chip for melanoma detection using FPGA-based SVM classifier",
    "abstract": "Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a robust machine learning model that shows high accuracy with different classification problems, and is widely used for various embedded applications. However , implementation of embedded SVM classifiers is challenging, due to the inherent complicated computations required. This motivates implementing the SVM on hardware platforms for achieving high performance computing at low cost and power consumption. Melanoma is the most aggressive form of skin cancer that increases the mortality rate. We aim to develop an optimized embedded SVM classifier dedicated for a low-cost handheld device for early detection of melanoma at the primary healthcare. In this paper, we propose a hardware/software co-design for implementing the SVM classifier onto FPGA to realize melanoma detection on a chip. The implemented SVM on a recent hybrid FPGA (Zynq) platform utilizing the modern UltraFast High-Level Synthesis design methodology achieves efficient melanoma classification on chip. The hardware implementation results demonstrate classification accuracy of 97.9%, and a significant hardware acceleration rate of 21 with only 3% resources utilization and 1.69W for power consumption. These results show that the implemented system on chip meets crucial embedded system constraints of high performance and low resources utilization, power consumption, and cost, while achieving efficient classification with high classification accuracy.

The recent progress on this problem has not included complete pattern graphs, i.e., cliques (and their complements, i.e., edge-free pattern graphs, in the induced setting). The fastest algorithms for the aforementioned patterns are based on a straightforward reduction to triangle detection/counting. We provide an alternative method of detection/counting copies of fixed size cliques based on a multi-dimensional matrix product. It is at least as time efficient as the triangle method in cases of $K_4$ and $K_5.$ The complexity of the multi-dimensional matrix product is of interest in its own rights. We provide also another alternative method for detection/counting $K_r$ copies, again time efficient for $r\\in \\{ 4,\\ 5 \\}$. ",

Inspired by the structure of the visual cortex, the model (namely HSD) alternates layers of topologic sparse coding and pooling to build a more compact code of visual information. Intended for visual place recognition (VPR) systems that use local descriptors, the impact of its integration in a bio-inpired model for self-localization (LPMP) is evaluated. Our experimental results on the KITTI dataset show that HSD improves the runtime speed of LPMP by a factor of at least 2 and its localization accuracy by 10%. A comparison with CoHog, a state-of-the-art VPR approach, showed that our method achieves slightly better results. ",

    "abstract": "In network analysis, developing a unified theoretical framework that can compare methods under different models is an interesting problem. This paper proposes a partial solution to this problem. We summarize the idea of using separation condition for a standard network and sharp threshold of Erd\\\"os-R\\'enyi random graph to study consistent estimation, compare theoretical error rates and requirements on network sparsity of spectral methods under models that can degenerate to stochastic block model as a four-step criterion SCSTC. Using SCSTC, we find some inconsistent phenomena on separation condition and sharp threshold in community detection. Especially, we find original theoretical results of the SPACL algorithm introduced to estimate network memberships under the mixed membership stochastic blockmodel were sub-optimal. To find the formation mechanism of inconsistencies, we re-establish theoretical convergence rates of this algorithm by applying recent techniques on row-wise eigenvector deviation. The results are further extended to the degree corrected mixed membership model. By comparison, our results enjoy smaller error rates, lesser dependence on the number of communities, weaker requirements on network sparsity, and so forth. Furthermore, separation condition and sharp threshold obtained from our theoretical results match classical results, which shows the usefulness of this criterion on studying consistent estimation. ",

    "title": "Stroke recovery phenotyping through network trajectory approaches and  graph neural networks",
    "abstract": "Stroke is a leading cause of neurological injury characterized by impairments in multiple neurological domains including cognition, language, sensory and motor functions. Clinical recovery in these domains is tracked using a wide range of measures that may be continuous, ordinal, interval or categorical in nature, which presents challenges for standard multivariate regression approaches. This has hindered stroke researchers' ability to achieve an integrated picture of the complex time-evolving interactions amongst symptoms. Here we use tools from network science and machine learning that are particularly well-suited to extracting underlying patterns in such data, and may assist in prediction of recovery patterns. To demonstrate the utility of this approach, we analyzed data from the NINDS tPA trial using the Trajectory Profile Clustering (TPC) method to identify distinct stroke recovery patterns for 11 different neurological domains at 5 discrete time points. Our analysis identified 3 distinct stroke trajectory profiles that align with clinically relevant stroke syndromes, characterized both by distinct clusters of symptoms, as well as differing degrees of symptom severity. We then validated our approach using graph neural networks to determine how well our model performed predictively for stratifying patients into these trajectory profiles at early vs. later time points post-stroke. We demonstrate that trajectory profile clustering is an effective method for identifying clinically relevant recovery subtypes in multidimensional longitudinal datasets, and for early prediction of symptom progression subtypes in individual patients. This paper is the first work introducing network trajectory approaches for stroke recovery phenotyping, and is aimed at enhancing the translation of such novel computational approaches for practical clinical application.

    "abstract": "From sport and science production to everyday life, higher-level pursuits demand collaboration. Despite an increase in the number of data-driven studies on human behavior, the social dynamics of collaborative problem solving are still largely unexplored with network science and other computational and quantitative tools. Here we introduce escape rooms as a non-interventional and minimally biased social laboratory, which allows us to capture at a high resolution real-time communications in small project teams. Our analysis portrays a nuanced picture of different dimensions of social dynamics. We reveal how socio-demographic characteristics impact problem solving and the importance of prior relationships for enhanced interactions. We extract key conversation rules from motif analysis, and discuss turn-usurping gendered behavior, a phenomenon particularly strong in male dominated teams. We investigate the temporal evolution of signed and group interactions, finding that a minimum level of tense communication might be beneficial for collective problem solving, and revealing differences in the behavior of successful and failed teams. Our work unveils the innovative potential of escape rooms to study teams in their complexity, contributing to a deeper understanding of the micro-dynamics of collaborative team processes. ",
