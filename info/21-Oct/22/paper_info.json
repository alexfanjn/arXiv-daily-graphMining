    "title": "Multi-concept adversarial attacks",
    "abstract": "As machine learning (ML) techniques are being increasingly used in many applications, their vulnerability to adversarial attacks becomes well-known. Test time attacks, usually launched by adding adversarial noise to test instances, have been shown effective against the deployed ML models. In practice, one test input may be leveraged by different ML models. Test time attacks targeting a single ML model often neglect their impact on other ML models. In this work, we empirically demonstrate that naively attacking the classifier learning one concept may negatively impact classifiers trained to learn other concepts. For example, for the online image classification scenario, when the Gender classifier is under attack, the (wearing) Glasses classifier is simultaneously attacked with the accuracy dropped from 98.69 to 88.42. This raises an interesting question: is it possible to attack one set of classifiers without impacting the other set that uses the same test instance? Answers to the above research question have interesting implications for protecting privacy against ML model misuse. Attacking ML models that pose unnecessary risks of privacy invasion can be an important tool for protecting individuals from harmful privacy exploitation. In this paper, we address the above research question by developing novel attack techniques that can simultaneously attack one set of ML models while preserving the accuracy of the other. In the case of linear classifiers, we provide a theoretical framework for finding an optimal solution to generate such adversarial examples. Using this theoretical framework, we develop a multi-concept attack strategy in the context of deep learning. Our results demonstrate that our techniques can successfully attack the target classes while protecting the protected classes in many different settings, which is not possible with the existing test-time attack-single strategies.

    "title": "Fingerprint recognition with embedded presentation attacks detection:  are we ready?",
    "abstract": "The diffusion of fingerprint verification systems for security applications makes it urgent to investigate the embedding of software-based presentation attack detection algorithms (PAD) into such systems. Companies and institutions need to know whether such integration would make the system more \"secure\" and whether the technology available is ready, and, if so, at what operational working conditions. Despite significant improvements, especially by adopting deep learning approaches to fingerprint PAD, current research did not state much about their effectiveness when embedded in fingerprint verification systems. We believe that the lack of works is explained by the lack of instruments to investigate the problem, that is, modeling the cause-effect relationships when two non-zero error-free systems work together. Accordingly, this paper explores the fusion of PAD into verification systems by proposing a novel investigation instrument: a performance simulator based on the probabilistic modeling of the relationships among the Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) of the two individual systems when PAD and verification stages are implemented sequentially. As a matter of fact, this is the most straightforward, flexible, and widespread approach. We carry out simulations on the PAD algorithms' ROCs submitted to the most recent editions of LivDet (2017-2019), the state-of-the-art NIST Bozorth3, and the top-level Veryfinger 12 matchers. Reported experiments explore significant scenarios to get the conditions under which fingerprint matching with embedded PAD can improve, rather than degrade, the overall personal verification performance.

    "abstract": "Time-series modeling has shown great promise in recent studies using the latest deep learning algorithms such as LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory). These studies primarily focused on watershed-scale rainfall-runoff modeling or streamflow forecasting, but the majority of them only considered a single watershed as a unit. Although this simplification is very effective, it does not take into account spatial information, which could result in significant errors in large watersheds. Several studies investigated the use of GNN (Graph Neural Networks) for data integration by decomposing a large watershed into multiple sub-watersheds, but each sub-watershed is still treated as a whole, and the geoinformation contained within the watershed is not fully utilized. In this paper, we propose the GNRRM (Graph Neural Rainfall-Runoff Model), a novel deep learning model that makes full use of spatial information from high-resolution precipitation data, including flow direction and geographic information. When compared to baseline models, GNRRM has less over-fitting and significantly improves model performance. Our findings support the importance of hydrological data in deep learning-based rainfall-runoff modeling, and we encourage researchers to include more domain knowledge in their models. ",

    "abstract": "Currently, existing salient object detection methods based on convolutional neural networks commonly resort to constructing discriminative networks to aggregate high level and low level features. However, contextual information is always not fully and reasonably utilized, which usually causes either the absence of useful features or contamination of redundant features. To address these issues, we propose a novel ladder context correlation complementary network (LC3Net) in this paper, which is equipped with three crucial components. At the beginning, we propose a filterable convolution block (FCB) to assist the automatic collection of information on the diversity of initial features, and it is simple yet practical. Besides, we propose a dense cross module (DCM) to facilitate the intimate aggregation of different levels of features by validly integrating semantic information and detailed information of both adjacent and non-adjacent layers. Furthermore, we propose a bidirectional compression decoder (BCD) to help the progressive shrinkage of multi-scale features from coarse to fine by leveraging multiple pairs of alternating top-down and bottom-up feature interaction flows. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method against 16 state-of-the-art methods. ",

However, these CNN-based algorithms generally have limitations in perceiving global temporal dependencies of EEG signals. Besides, they also ignore the diverse contributions of different EEG channels to the classification task. To address such issues, a novel channel attention based MLP-Mixer network (CAMLP-Net) is proposed for EEG-based MI decoding. Specifically, the MLP-based architecture is applied in this network to capture the temporal and spatial information. The attention mechanism is further embedded into MLP-Mixer to adaptively exploit the importance of different EEG channels. Therefore, the proposed CAMLP-Net can effectively learn more global temporal and spatial information. The experimental results on the newly built MI-2 dataset indicate that our proposed CAMLP-Net achieves superior classification performance over all the compared algorithms. ",

    "abstract": "Accurate lane detection under various road conditions is a critical function for autonomous driving. Generally, when detected lane lines from a front camera image are projected into a birds-eye view (BEV) for motion planning, the resulting lane lines are often distorted. And convolutional neural network (CNN)-based feature extractors often lose resolution when increasing the receptive field to detect global features such as lane lines. However, Lidar point cloud has little image distortion in the BEV-projection. Since lane lines are thin and stretch over entire BEV image while occupying only a small portion, lane lines should be detected as a global feature with high resolution. In this paper, we propose Lane Mixer Network (LMN) that extracts local features from Lidar point cloud, recognizes global features, and detects lane lines using a BEV encoder, a Mixer-based global feature extractor, and a detection head, respectively. In addition, we provide a world-first large urban lane dataset for Lidar, K-Lane, which has maximum 6 lanes under various urban road conditions. We demonstrate that the proposed LMN achieves the state-of-the-art performance, an F1 score of 91.67%, with K-Lane. The K-Lane, LMN training code, pre-trained models, and total dataset development platform are available at github. ",

    "abstract": "Modelling the impact of a material's mesostructure on device level performance typically requires access to 3D image data containing all the relevant information to define the geometry of the simulation domain. This image data must include sufficient contrast between phases to distinguish each material, be of high enough resolution to capture the key details, but also have a large enough field-of-view to be representative of the material in general. It is rarely possible to obtain data with all of these properties from a single imaging technique. In this paper, we present a method for combining information from pairs of distinct but complementary imaging techniques in order to accurately reconstruct the desired multi-phase, high resolution, representative, 3D images. Specifically, we use deep convolutional generative adversarial networks to implement super-resolution, style transfer and dimensionality expansion. To demonstrate the widespread applicability of this tool, two pairs of datasets are used to validate the quality of the volumes generated by fusing the information from paired imaging techniques. Three key mesostructural metrics are calculated in each case to show the accuracy of this method. Having confidence in the accuracy of our method, we then demonstrate its power by applying to a real data pair from a lithium ion battery electrode, where the required 3D high resolution image data is not available anywhere in the literature. We believe this approach is superior to previously reported statistical material reconstruction methods both in terms of its fidelity and ease of use. Furthermore, much of the data required to train this algorithm already exists in the literature, waiting to be combined. As such, our open-access code could precipitate a step change by generating the hard to obtain high quality image volumes necessary to simulate behaviour at the mesoscale. ",

Apart from averseness to new technologies, this is due to missing interpretability, transparency and accountability of many machine learning methods. We propose a hazard-regularized variational autoencoder that supports straightforward interpretation of deep neural architectures in the context of survival analysis, a field highly relevant in healthcare.

We propose a kernel-based method, under the hypothesis that connected nodes of the graph are expected to have similar likelihood-ratio estimates when there is no change-point.

Through an improved (but still weaker) bound for all trees, we argue that the conjecture almost holds for all graphs with minimum degree at least $3$ and holds for all large enough graphs with minimum degree at least $4$.

Second, quantum evolutions are generalized to act over network configurations, in such a way that nodes be allowed to merge, split and reconnect coherently in a superposition. The hereby presented mathematical framework is anchored on solid grounds through numerous lemmas. Indeed, one might have feared that the familiar interrelations between the notions of unitarity, complete positivity, trace-preservation, non-signalling causality, locality and localizability that are standard in quantum theory be jeopardized as the partitioning of systems becomes both logical and dynamical.
