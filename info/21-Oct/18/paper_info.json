    "title": "Residual2Vec: Debiasing graph embedding with random graphs",
    "abstract": "Graph embedding maps a graph into a convenient vector-space representation for graph analysis and machine learning applications. Many graph embedding methods hinge on a sampling of context nodes based on random walks. However, random walks can be a biased sampler due to the structural properties of graphs. Most notably, random walks are biased by the degree of each node, where a node is sampled proportionally to its degree. The implication of such biases has not been clear, particularly in the context of graph representation learning. Here, we investigate the impact of the random walks' bias on graph embedding and propose residual2vec, a general graph embedding method that can debias various structural biases in graphs by using random graphs. We demonstrate that this debiasing not only improves link prediction and clustering performance but also allows us to explicitly model salient structural properties in graph embedding. ",

    "title": "4D flight trajectory prediction using a hybrid Deep Learning prediction  method based on ADS-B technology: a case study of Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta  International Airport(ATL)",
    "abstract": "The core of any flight schedule is the trajectories. In particular, 4D trajectories are the most crucial component for flight attribute prediction. In particular, 4D trajectories are the most crucial component for flight attribute prediction. Each trajectory contains spatial and temporal features that are associated with uncertainties that make the prediction process complex. Today because of the increasing demand for air transportation, it is compulsory for airports and airlines to have an optimized schedule to use all of the airport's infrastructure potential. This is possible using advanced trajectory prediction methods. This paper proposes a novel hybrid deep learning model to extract the spatial and temporal features considering the uncertainty of the prediction model for Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport(ATL). Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) data are used as input to the models. This research is conducted in three steps: (a) data preprocessing; (b) prediction by a hybrid Convolutional Neural Network and Gated Recurrent Unit (CNN-GRU) along with a 3D-CNN model; (c) The third and last step is the comparison of the model's performance with the proposed model by comparing the experimental results. The deep model uncertainty is considered using the Mont-Carlo dropout (MC-Dropout). Mont-Carlo dropouts are added to the network layers to enhance the model's prediction performance by a robust approach of switching off between different neurons. The results show that the proposed model has low error measurements compared to the other models (i.e., 3D CNN, CNN-GRU). The model with MC-dropout reduces the error further by an average of 21 %. ",

    "title": "Towards fast weak adversarial training to solve high dimensional  parabolic partial differential equations using XNODE-WAN",
    "abstract": "Due to the curse of dimensionality, solving high dimensional parabolic partial differential equations (PDEs) has been a challenging problem for decades. Recently, a weak adversarial network (WAN) proposed in (Y.Zang et al., 2020) offered a flexible and computationally efficient approach to tackle this problem defined on arbitrary domains by leveraging the weak solution. WAN reformulates the PDE problem as a generative adversarial network, where the weak solution (primal network) and the test function (adversarial network) are parameterized by the multi-layer deep neural networks (DNNs). However, it is not yet clear whether DNNs are the most effective model for the parabolic PDE solutions as they do not take into account the fundamentally different roles played by time and spatial variables in the solution. To reinforce the difference, we design a novel so-called XNODE model for the primal network, which is built on the neural ODE (NODE) model with additional spatial dependency to incorporate the a priori information of the PDEs and serve as a universal and effective approximation to the solution. The proposed hybrid method (XNODE-WAN), by integrating the XNODE model within the WAN framework, leads to significant improvement in the performance and efficiency of training. Numerical results show that our method can reduce the training time to a fraction of that of the WAN model. ",

    "abstract": "Neuro-inspired models and systems have great potential for applications in unconventional computing. Often, the mechanisms of biological neurons are modeled or mimicked in simulated or physical systems in an attempt to harness some of the computational power of the brain. However, the biological mechanisms at play in neural systems are complicated and challenging to capture and engineer; thus, it can be simpler to turn to a data-driven approach to transfer features of neural behavior to artificial substrates. In the present study, we used an evolutionary algorithm (EA) to produce spiking neural systems that emulate the patterns of behavior of biological neurons in vitro. The aim of this approach was to develop a method of producing models capable of exhibiting complex behavior that may be suitable for use as computational substrates. Our models were able to produce a level of network-wide synchrony and showed a range of behaviors depending on the target data used for their evolution, which was from a range of neuronal culture densities and maturities. The genomes of the top-performing models indicate the excitability and density of connections in the model play an important role in determining the complexity of the produced activity. ",

    "abstract": "Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is the result of a complication of diabetes affecting the retina. It can cause blindness, if left undiagnosed and untreated. An ophthalmologist performs the diagnosis by screening each patient and analyzing the retinal lesions via ocular imaging. In practice, such analysis is time-consuming and cumbersome to perform. This paper presents a model for automatic DR classification on eye fundus images. The approach identifies the main ocular lesions related to DR and subsequently diagnoses the illness. The proposed method follows the same workflow as the clinicians, providing information that can be interpreted clinically to support the prediction. A subset of the kaggle EyePACS and the Messidor-2 datasets, labeled with ocular lesions, is made publicly available. The kaggle EyePACS subset is used as a training set and the Messidor-2 as a test set for lesions and DR classification models. For DR diagnosis, our model has an area-under-the-curve, sensitivity, and specificity of 0.948, 0.886, and 0.875, respectively, which competes with state-of-the-art approaches. ",

However, acquiring multiple scans incurs increased radiation dose, time, and cost, and may not be possible in many cases, thus restricting the applicability of registration-based biomechanics. We propose a generative adversarial learning approach for estimating local tissue expansion directly from a single CT scan. The proposed framework was trained and evaluated on 2500 subjects from the SPIROMICS cohort. Once trained, the framework can be used as a registration-free method for predicting local tissue expansion. We evaluated model performance across varying degrees of disease severity and compared its performance with two image-to-image translation frameworks - UNet and Pix2Pix. Our model achieved an overall PSNR of 18.95 decibels, SSIM of 0.840, and Spearman's correlation of 0.61 at a high spatial resolution of 1 mm3. ",

    "abstract": "An extension to the interface finite element with eMbedded Profile for Joint Roughness (MPJR interface finite element) is herein proposed for solving the frictional contact problem between a rigid indenter of any complex shape and an elastic body under generic oblique load histories. The actual shape of the indenter is accounted for as a correction of the gap function. A regularised version of the Coulomb friction law is employed for modeling the tangential contact response, while a penalty approach is introduced in the normal contact direction. The development of the finite element (FE) formulation stemming from its variational formalism is thoroughly derived and the model is validated in relation to challenging scenarios for standard (alternative) finite element procedures and analytical methods, such as the contact with multi-scale rough profiles. The present framework enables the comprehensive investigation of the system response due to the occurrence of tangential tractions, which are at the origin of important phenomena such as wear and fretting fatigue, together with the analysis of the effects of coupling between normal and tangential contact tractions. This scenario is herein investigated in relation to challenging physical problems involving arbitrary loading histories. ",

In this paper, we study how pre-training data affects S3Ms by pre-training models on biased datasets targeting different factors of speech, including gender, content, and prosody, and evaluate these pre-trained S3Ms on selected downstream tasks in SUPERB Benchmark. Our experiments show that S3Ms have tolerance toward gender bias. Moreover, we find that the content of speech has little impact on the performance of S3Ms across downstream tasks, but S3Ms do show a preference toward a slower speech rate. ",
