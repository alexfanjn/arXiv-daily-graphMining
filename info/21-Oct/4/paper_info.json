    "title": "Machine learning models for prediction of droplet collision outcomes",
    "abstract": "Predicting the outcome of liquid droplet collisions is an extensively studied phenomenon but the current physics based models for predicting the outcomes are poor (accuracy $\\approx 43\\%$). The key weakness of these models is their limited complexity. They only account for 3 features while there are many more relevant features that go unaccounted for. This limitation of traditional models can be easily overcome through machine learning modeling of the problem. In an ML setting this problem directly translates to a classification problem with 4 classes. Here we compile a large labelled dataset and tune different ML classifiers over this dataset. We evaluate the accuracy and robustness of the classifiers. ML classifiers, with accuracies over 90\\%, significantly outperform the physics based models. Another key question we try to answer in this paper is whether existing knowledge of the physics based models can be exploited to boost the accuracy of the ML classifiers. We find that while this knowledge improves the accuracy marginally for small datasets, it does not improve accuracy with if larger datasets are used for training the models. ",

    "title": "Discovering care pathways for multi-morbid patients using event graphs",
    "abstract": "Patients suffering from multiple diseases (multi-morbid patients) often have complex clinical pathways. They are diagnosed and treated by different specialties and undergo other clinical actions related to various diagnoses. Coordination of care for these patients is often challenging, and it would be of great benefit to get better insight into how the clinical pathways develop in reality. Discovering these pathways using traditional process mining techniques and standard event logs may be difficult because the patient is involved in several highly independent clinical processes. Our objective is to explore the potential of analyzing these pathways using an event log representation reflecting the independent clinical processes. Our main research question is: How can we identify valuable insights by using a multi-entity event data representation for clinical pathways of multi-morbid patients? Our method was built on the idea to represent multiple entities in event logs as event graphs. The MIMIC-III data-set was used to evaluate the feasibility of this approach. Several clinical entities were identified and then mapped into an event graph. Finally, multi-entity directly follows graphs were discovered by querying the event graph visualizing them. Our result shows that paths involving multiple entities include traditional process mining concepts not for one clinical process but all involved processes. In addition, the relationship between activities of different clinical processes, which was not recognizable in traditional models, is visible in the event graph representation. ",

    "abstract": "Complex valued systems with an indefinite matrix term arise in important applications such as for certain time-harmonic partial differential equations such as the Maxwell's equation and for the Helmholtz equation. Complex systems with symmetric positive definite matrices can be solved readily by rewriting the complex matrix system in two-by-two block matrix form with real matrices which can be efficiently solved by iteration using the preconditioned square block (PRESB) preconditioning method and preferably accelerated by the Chebyshev method. The appearances of an indefinite matrix term causes however some difficulties. To handle this we propose different forms of matrix splitting methods, with or without any parameters involved. A matrix spectral analyses is presented followed by extensive numerical comparisons of various forms of the methods. ",

    "abstract": "In this work we examine how fine-tuning impacts the fairness of contrastive Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) models. Our findings indicate that Batch Normalization (BN) statistics play a crucial role, and that updating only the BN statistics of a pre-trained SSL backbone improves its downstream fairness (36% worst subgroup, 25% mean subgroup gap). This procedure is competitive with supervised learning, while taking 4.4x less time to train and requiring only 0.35% as many parameters to be updated. Finally, inspired by recent work in supervised learning, we find that updating BN statistics and training residual skip connections (12.3% of the parameters) achieves parity with a fully fine-tuned model, while taking 1.33x less time to train.

    "abstract": "This paper addresses the design of an active cyberattack detection architecture based on multiplicative watermarking, allowing for detection of covert attacks. We propose an optimal design problem, relying on the so-called output-to-output l2-gain, which characterizes the maximum gain between the residual output of a detection scheme and some performance output. Although optimal, this control problem is non-convex. Hence, we propose an algorithm to design the watermarking filters by solving the problem suboptimally via LMIs. We show that, against covert attacks, the output-to-output l2-gain is unbounded without watermarking, and we provide a sufficient condition for boundedness in the presence of watermarks. ",

Targeting the identification of new strong gravitational lens candidates, we first create a rapid similarity search tool to discover new strong lenses given only a single labelled example. We then show how training a simple linear classifier on the self-supervised representations, requiring only a few minutes on a CPU, can automatically classify strong lenses with great efficiency. We present 1192 new strong lens candidates that we identified through a brief visual identification campaign, and release an interactive web-based similarity search tool and the top network predictions to facilitate crowd-sourcing rapid discovery of additional strong gravitational lenses and other rare objects: github.com/georgestein/ssl-legacysurvey ",

    "title": "TyXe: Pyro-based Bayesian neural nets for Pytorch",
    "abstract": "We introduce TyXe, a Bayesian neural network library built on top of Pytorch and Pyro. Our leading design principle is to cleanly separate architecture, prior, inference and likelihood specification, allowing for a flexible workflow where users can quickly iterate over combinations of these components. In contrast to existing packages TyXe does not implement any layer classes, and instead relies on architectures defined in generic Pytorch code. TyXe then provides modular choices for canonical priors, variational guides, inference techniques, and layer selections for a Bayesian treatment of the specified architecture. Sampling tricks for variance reduction, such as local reparameterization or flipout, are implemented as effect handlers, which can be applied independently of other specifications. We showcase the ease of use of TyXe to explore Bayesian versions of popular models from various libraries: toy regression with a pure Pytorch neural network; large-scale image classification with torchvision ResNets; graph neural networks based on DGL; and Neural Radiance Fields built on top of Pytorch3D. Finally, we provide convenient abstractions for variational continual learning. In all cases the change from a deterministic to a Bayesian neural network comes with minimal modifications to existing code, offering a broad range of researchers and practitioners alike practical access to uncertainty estimation techniques. The library is available at https://github.com/TyXe-BDL/TyXe. ",
