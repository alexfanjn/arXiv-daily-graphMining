    "title": "A global convergence theory for deep ReLU implicit networks via  over-parameterization",
    "abstract": "Implicit deep learning has received increasing attention recently due to the fact that it generalizes the recursive prediction rules of many commonly used neural network architectures. Its prediction rule is provided implicitly based on the solution of an equilibrium equation. Although a line of recent empirical studies has demonstrated its superior performances, the theoretical understanding of implicit neural networks is limited. In general, the equilibrium equation may not be well-posed during the training. As a result, there is no guarantee that a vanilla (stochastic) gradient descent (SGD) training nonlinear implicit neural networks can converge. This paper fills the gap by analyzing the gradient flow of Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activated implicit neural networks. For an $m$-width implicit neural network with ReLU activation and $n$ training samples, we show that a randomly initialized gradient descent converges to a global minimum at a linear rate for the square loss function if the implicit neural network is \\textit{over-parameterized}. It is worth noting that, unlike existing works on the convergence of (S)GD on finite-layer over-parameterized neural networks, our convergence results hold for implicit neural networks, where the number of layers is \\textit{infinite}.

    "title": "DecGAN: Decoupling Generative Adversarial Network detecting abnormal  neural circuits for Alzheimer's disease",
    "abstract": "One of the main reasons for Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the disorder of some neural circuits. Existing methods for AD prediction have achieved great success, however, detecting abnormal neural circuits from the perspective of brain networks is still a big challenge. In this work, a novel decoupling generative adversarial network (DecGAN) is proposed to detect abnormal neural circuits for AD. Concretely, a decoupling module is designed to decompose a brain network into two parts: one part is composed of a few sparse graphs which represent the neural circuits largely determining the development of AD; the other part is a supplement graph, whose influence on AD can be ignored. Furthermore, the adversarial strategy is utilized to guide the decoupling module to extract the feature more related to AD. Meanwhile, by encoding the detected neural circuits to hypergraph data, an analytic module associated with the hyperedge neurons algorithm is designed to identify the neural circuits. More importantly, a novel sparse capacity loss based on the spatial-spectral hypergraph similarity is developed to minimize the intrinsic topological distribution of neural circuits, which can significantly improve the accuracy and robustness of the proposed model. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model can effectively detect the abnormal neural circuits at different stages of AD, which is helpful for pathological study and early treatment. ",

    "abstract": "Attribute-driven privacy aims to conceal a single user's attribute, contrary to anonymisation that tries to hide the full identity of the user in some data. When the attribute to protect from malicious inferences is binary, perfect privacy requires the log-likelihood-ratio to be zero resulting in no strength-of-evidence. This work presents an approach based on normalizing flow that maps a feature vector into a latent space where the strength-of-evidence, related to the binary attribute, and an independent residual are disentangled. It can be seen as a non-linear discriminant analysis where the mapping is invertible allowing generation by mapping the latent variable back to the original space. This framework allows to manipulate the log-likelihood-ratio of the data and thus to set it to zero for privacy. We show the applicability of the approach on an attribute-driven privacy task where the sex information is removed from speaker embeddings. Results on VoxCeleb2 dataset show the efficiency of the method that outperforms in terms of privacy and utility our previous experiments based on adversarial disentanglement. ",

    "abstract": "Heterogeneous network (HetNet) is a specified cellular platform to tackle the rapidly growing anticipated data traffic. From communications perspective, data loads can be mapped to energy loads that are generally placed on the operator networks. Meanwhile, renewable energy aided networks offer to curtail fossil fuel consumption, so to reduce environmental pollution. This paper proposes a renewable energy based power supply architecture for off-grid HetNet using a novel energy sharing model. Solar photovoltaic (PV) along with sufficient energy storage devices are used for each macro, micro, pico, or femto base station (BS). Additionally, biomass generator (BG) is used for macro and micro BSs. The collocated macro and micro BSs are connected through end-to-end resistive lines. A novel weighted proportional-fair resource-scheduling algorithm with sleep mechanisms is proposed for non-real time (NRT) applications by trading-off the power consumption and communication delays. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm with extended discontinuous reception (eDRX) and power saving mode (PSM) for narrowband internet of things (IoT) applications extends battery lifetime for IoT devices. HOMER optimization software is used to perform optimal system architecture, economic, and carbon footprint analyses while Monte-Carlo simulation tool is used for evaluating the throughput and energy efficiency performances. The proposed algorithms are valid for the practical data of the rural areas. We demonstrate the proposed power supply architecture is energy-efficient, cost-effective, reliable, and eco-friendly. ",

Scientific features such as the number of collaborations, the productivity and its research impact tend to be directly affected by such movements. In this paper, we analyse the dynamics of the collaboration network of researchers as they move from an institution to the next one. We specifically highlight cases where they increase and when they shrink, and quantify the dependency between the collaboration networks before and after such a movement. Finally, we drill down the analysis by dividing movements depending on the career stage of the researchers. The analysis shows a remarkable dynamism of collaboration networks across migrations. Interestingly, not always movements result in larger collaboration networks, while the overall similarity between networks across movements is quite limited on average. Qualitatively, the same effects can be found at all career stages, while, clearly, the magnitude of them might vary. These results are based on a dataset extracted from Scopus, containing detailed scientific information for the publications of 84,141 researchers. ",

    "abstract": "The need to avoid confident predictions on unfamiliar data has sparked interest in out-of-distribution (OOD) detection. It is widely assumed that Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) are well suited for this task, as the endowed epistemic uncertainty should lead to disagreement in predictions on outliers. In this paper, we question this assumption and show that proper Bayesian inference with function space priors induced by neural networks does not necessarily lead to good OOD detection. To circumvent the use of approximate inference, we start by studying the infinite-width case, where Bayesian inference can be exact due to the correspondence with Gaussian processes. Strikingly, the kernels induced under common architectural choices lead to uncertainties that do not reflect the underlying data generating process and are therefore unsuited for OOD detection. Importantly, we find this OOD behavior to be consistent with the corresponding finite-width networks. Desirable function space properties can be encoded in the prior in weight space, however, this currently only applies to a specified subset of the domain and thus does not inherently extend to OOD data. Finally, we argue that a trade-off between generalization and OOD capabilities might render the application of BNNs for OOD detection undesirable in practice. Overall, our study discloses fundamental problems when naively using BNNs for OOD detection and opens interesting avenues for future research. ",

    "abstract": "Sound recordings are used in various ecological studies, including acoustic wildlife monitoring. Such surveys require automatic detection of target sound events. However, current detectors, especially those relying on band-limited energy, are severely impacted by wind. The rapid dynamics of this noise invalidate standard noise estimators, and no satisfactory method for dealing with it exists in bioacoustics, where simple training and generalization between conditions are important. We propose to estimate the transient noise level by fitting short-term spectrum models to a wavelet packet representation. This estimator is then combined with log-spectral subtraction to stabilize the background level. The resulting adjusted wavelet series can be analysed by standard energy detectors. We use real monitoring data to tune this workflow, and test it on two acoustic surveys of birds. Additionally, we show how the estimator can be incorporated in a denoising method to restore sound. The proposed noise-robust workflow greatly reduced the number of false alarms in the surveys, compared to unadjusted energy detection. As a result, the survey efficiency (precision of the estimated call density) improved for both species. Denoising was also more effective when using the short-term estimate, whereas standard wavelet shrinkage with a constant noise estimate struggled to remove the effects of wind. In contrast to existing methods, the proposed estimator can adjust for transient broadband noises without requiring additional hardware or extensive tuning to each species. It improved the detection workflow based on very little training data, making it particularly attractive for detection of rare species. ",

When operated as stabilizer codes, surface code computations consist of a syndrome decoding step where measured stabilizer operators are used to determine appropriate corrections for errors in physical qubits. Decoding algorithms have undergone substantial development, with recent work incorporating machine learning (ML) techniques. Despite promising initial results, the ML-based syndrome decoders are still limited to small scale demonstrations with low latency and are incapable of handling surface codes with boundary conditions and various shapes needed for lattice surgery and braiding. Here, we report the development of an artificial neural network (ANN) based scalable and fast syndrome decoder capable of decoding surface codes of arbitrary shape and size with data qubits suffering from the depolarizing error model. Based on rigorous training over 50 million random quantum error instances, our ANN decoder is shown to work with code distances exceeding 1000 (more than 4 million physical qubits), which is the largest ML-based decoder demonstration to-date. The established ANN decoder demonstrates an execution time in principle independent of code distance, implying that its implementation on dedicated hardware could potentially offer surface code decoding times of O($\\mu$sec), commensurate with the experimentally realisable qubit coherence times. With the anticipated scale-up of quantum processors within the next decade, their augmentation with a fast and scalable syndrome decoder such as developed in our work is expected to play a decisive role towards experimental implementation of fault-tolerant quantum information processing.

Our approach is information-theoretic and uses a local Markov boundary search procedure in order to recursively construct ancestral sets in the underlying graphical model. Perhaps surprisingly, we show that for certain graph ensembles, a simple forward greedy search algorithm (i.e. without a backward pruning phase) suffices to learn the Markov boundary of each node. This substantially improves the sample complexity, which we show is at most polynomial in the number of nodes. This is then applied to learn the entire graph under a novel identifiability condition that generalizes existing conditions from the literature. As a matter of independent interest, we establish finite-sample guarantees for the problem of recovering Markov boundaries from data. Moreover, we apply our results to the special case of polytrees, for which the assumptions simplify, and provide explicit conditions under which polytrees are identifiable and learnable in polynomial time. We further illustrate the performance of the algorithm, which is easy to implement, in a simulation study. Our approach is general, works for discrete or continuous distributions without distributional assumptions, and as such sheds light on the minimal assumptions required to efficiently learn the structure of directed graphical models from data.

For sound event localization and detection (SELD) tasks several augmentation methods have been proposed, with most borrowing ideas from other domains such as images, speech, or monophonic audio. However, only a few exploit the spatial properties of a full 3D audio scene. We propose Spatial Mixup, as an application of parametric spatial audio effects for data augmentation, which modifies the directional properties of a multi-channel spatial audio signal encoded in the ambisonics domain. Similarly to beamforming, these modifications enhance or suppress signals arriving from certain directions, although the effect is less pronounced. Therefore enabling deep learning models to achieve invariance to small spatial perturbations. The method is evaluated with experiments in the DCASE 2021 Task 3 dataset, where spatial mixup increases performance over a non-augmented baseline, and compares to other well known augmentation methods. Furthermore, combining spatial mixup with other methods greatly improves performance. ",
