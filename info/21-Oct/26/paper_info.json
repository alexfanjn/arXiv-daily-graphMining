    "abstract": "Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have been widely applied. But as the CNNs grow, the number of arithmetic operations and memory footprint also increase. Furthermore, typical non-linear activation functions do not allow associativity of the operations encoded by consecutive layers, preventing the simplification of intermediate steps by combining them. We present a new activation function that allows associativity between sequential layers of CNNs. Even though our activation function is non-linear, it can be represented by a sequence of linear operations in the conformal model for Euclidean geometry. In this domain, operations like, but not limited to, convolution, average pooling, and dropout remain linear. We take advantage of associativity to combine all the \"conformal layers\" and make the cost of inference constant regardless of the depth of the network. ",

    "abstract": "Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have revolutionized the understanding of visual content. This is mainly due to their ability to break down an image into smaller pieces, extract multi-scale localized features and compose them to construct highly expressive representations for decision making. However, the convolution operation is unable to capture long-range dependencies such as arbitrary relations between pixels since it operates on a fixed-size window. Therefore, it may not be suitable for discriminating subtle changes (e.g. fine-grained visual recognition). To this end, our proposed method captures the high-level long-range dependencies by exploring Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs), which aggregate information by establishing relationships among multi-scale hierarchical regions. These regions consist of smaller (closer look) to larger (far look), and the dependency between regions is modeled by an innovative attention-driven message propagation, guided by the graph structure to emphasize the neighborhoods of a given region. Our approach is simple yet extremely effective in solving both the fine-grained and generic visual classification problems. It outperforms the state-of-the-arts with a significant margin on three and is very competitive on other two datasets. ",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we consider the problem of $\\ell_{p}$ norm linear regression, which has several applications such as in sparse recovery, data clustering, and semi-supervised learning. The problem, even though convex, does not enjoy a closed-form solution. The state-of-the-art algorithms are iterative but suffer from convergence issues, i.e., they either diverge for p>3 or the convergence to the optimal solution is sensitive to the initialization of the algorithm. Also, these algorithms are not generalizable to every possible value of $p$. In this paper, we propose an iterative algorithm : Parallel IteRative AlgOrithM for $\\ell_{P}$ norm regression via MajorizaTion Minimization (PROMPT) based on the principle of Majorization Minimization and prove that the proposed algorithm is monotonic and converges to the optimal solution of the problem for any value of $p$. The proposed algorithm can also parallelly update each element of the regression variable, which helps to handle large scale data efficiently, a common scenario in this era of data explosion. Subsequently, we show that the proposed algorithm can also be applied for the graph based semi-supervised learning problem. We show through numerical simulations that the proposed algorithm converges to the optimal solution for any random initialization and also performs better than the state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of speed of convergence. We also evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm using simulated and real data for the graph based semi-supervised learning problem. ",

    "abstract": "Translating face sketches to photo-realistic faces is an interesting and essential task in many applications like law enforcement and the digital entertainment industry. One of the most important challenges of this task is the inherent differences between the sketch and the real image such as the lack of color and details of the skin tissue in the sketch. With the advent of adversarial generative models, an increasing number of methods have been proposed for sketch-to-image synthesis. However, these models still suffer from limitations such as the large number of paired data required for training, the low resolution of the produced images, or the unrealistic appearance of the generated images. In this paper, we propose a method for converting an input facial sketch to a colorful photo without the need for any paired dataset. To do so, we use a pre-trained face photo generating model to synthesize high-quality natural face photos and employ an optimization procedure to keep high-fidelity to the input sketch. We train a network to map the facial features extracted from the input sketch to a vector in the latent space of the face generating model. Also, we study different optimization criteria and compare the results of the proposed model with those of the state-of-the-art models quantitatively and qualitatively. The proposed model achieved 0.655 in the SSIM index and 97.59% rank-1 face recognition rate with higher quality of the produced images. ",

    "abstract": "Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have been shown to be vulnerable to adversarial examples, which are slightly perturbed input images which lead DNNs to make wrong predictions. To protect from such examples, various defense strategies have been proposed. A very recent defense strategy for detecting adversarial examples, that has been shown to be robust to current attacks, is to check for intrinsic context consistencies in the input data, where context refers to various relationships (e.g., object-to-object co-occurrence relationships) in images. In this paper, we show that even context consistency checks can be brittle to properly crafted adversarial examples and to the best of our knowledge, we are the first to do so. Specifically, we propose an adaptive framework to generate examples that subvert such defenses, namely, Adversarial attacks against object Detection that evade Context consistency checks (ADC). In ADC, we formulate a joint optimization problem which has two attack goals, viz., (i) fooling the object detector and (ii) evading the context consistency check system, at the same time. Experiments on both PASCAL VOC and MS COCO datasets show that examples generated with ADC fool the object detector with a success rate of over 85% in most cases, and at the same time evade the recently proposed context consistency checks, with a bypassing rate of over 80% in most cases. Our results suggest that how to robustly model context and check its consistency, is still an open problem. ",

In cultures where line or connect-the-dot figures were documented, these visual representations are constrained to the fixed background of stars, but are free in their choice of stars and lines to draw. Over a dataset of 1591 constellation line figures from 50 astronomical cultures, we define metrics to measure the visual signature (or complexity) of a constellation, and answer two questions: (1) does the type of culture associate with the visual signature of constellations? 2) does the sky region associate with the visual signature of constellations? We find that (1) individual cultures are only rarely and weakly thus associated, but the type of culture (by practical use, level of development, and ancestry) show an association. We find clear clusters of cross-culture and cross-type similarity in visual signatures, with SE Asian traditions far apart from Mesopotamian, N and S American, Austronesian and Polynesian traditions, which are similar. We also find (2) more diversity of constellation signature per sky region than expected, with diverse designs around the majority of popular stars. ",

The method produces estimates of neural patterns encoding complex linguistic structures, under the assumption that the contributions of individual constituents are additive. Like usual techniques for modeling compositional structure in fMRI, the proposed method employs pattern superposition to synthesize complex structures from their parts. Unlike these techniques, superpositions are sensitive to the structural positions of constituents, making them irreducible to structure-indiscriminate (\"bag-of-words\") models of composition. Reanalyzing data from a study by Frankland and Greene (2015), it is shown that comparison of neural predictive models with differing specifications can illuminate aspects of neural representational contents that are not apparent when composition is not modelled. The results indicate that the neural instantiations of the binding of fillers to thematic roles in a sentence are non-orthogonal, and therefore spatially overlapping. ",

We recommend the use of data compression based approaches for causality testing since these make very little assumptions on data as opposed to infotheoretic measures, and are more robust to finite data length effects. We conclude with a discussion on the challenges posed in modeling the effects of conditioning process $X$ with another process $Y$ in causal machine learning. Specifically, conditioning can increase 'confusion' which can be difficult to model by classical information theory. A conscious causal agent creates new choices, decisions and meaning which poses huge challenges for AI. ",

WOLF extends the applications of factor graphs from the typical problems of SLAM and odometry to a general estimation framework able to handle self-calibration, model identification, or the observation of dynamic quantities other than localization. WOLF produces high throughput estimates at sensor rates up to the kHz range, which can be used for feedback control of highly dynamic robots such as humanoids, quadrupeds or aerial manipulators. Departing from the factor graph paradigm, the architecture of WOLF allows for a modular yet tightly-coupled estimator. Modularity is based on plugins that are loaded at runtime. Then, integration is achieved simply through YAML files, allowing users to configure a wide range of applications without the need of writing or compiling code. Synchronization of incoming data and their processing into a unique factor graph is achieved through a decentralized strategy of frame creation and joining. Most algorithmic assets are coded as abstract algorithms in base classes with varying levels of specialization. Overall, these assets allow for coherent processing and favor code reusability and scalability. WOLF can be interfaced with different solvers, and we provide a wrapper to Google Ceres. Likewise, we offer ROS integration, providing a generic ROS node and specialized packages with subscribers and publishers. WOLF is made publicly available and open to collaboration. ",

The key step is to develop a generic network architecture to extract discriminative features for the spatio-temporal skeleton data. In this paper, we propose a novel module, namely Logsig-RNN, which is the combination of the log-signature layer and recurrent type neural networks (RNNs). The former one comes from the mathematically principled technology of signatures and log-signatures as representations for streamed data, which can manage high sample rate streams, non-uniform sampling and time series of variable length. It serves as an enhancement of the recurrent layer, which can be conveniently plugged into neural networks. Besides we propose two path transformation layers to significantly reduce path dimension while retaining the essential information fed into the Logsig-RNN module. Finally, numerical results demonstrate that replacing the RNN module by the Logsig-RNN module in SOTA networks consistently improves the performance on both Chalearn gesture data and NTU RGB+D 120 action data in terms of accuracy and robustness. In particular, we achieve the state-of-the-art accuracy on Chalearn2013 gesture data by combining simple path transformation layers with the Logsig-RNN.

Two cities of similar size might have distinct characteristics if one is located on a corridor between two capitals and the other is near a barrier, such as a mountain range. The level of intermediacy is a property of cities that characterises their position in the urban network. We measure the level of intermediacy of African cities by constructing the road infrastructure network obtained from OpenStreetMap. The infrastructure network allows defining city metrics such as degree and centrality. A proxy for the number of journeys that flow through each network edge is approximated using a mathematical model based on the level of attraction or gravity between all pairs of cities. Our model considers the extra time of crossing an international border as a parameter that enables us to proxy the cost of having fragmented regions with costly political barriers. Our results show that small cities have a wide range of intermediacy. We detect a phase transition where cities with less than one million inhabitants have a centrality that depends on the size and degree. For cities above one million inhabitants, centrality tends to be larger and depending primarily on city size rather than degree. ",

    "title": "Vertebrae segmentation, identification and localization using a graph  optimization and a synergistic cycle",
    "abstract": "This paper considers the segmentation, identification and localization of vertebrae in CT images. Although these three tasks are related, they face specific problems that add up when they are addressed together. For example neighboring vertebrae with similar shapes perturb the identification and vertebrae with complex or even pathological morphologies impact the segmentation. Consequently, the three tasks tend to be approached independently, e.g. labelling (localization and identification) or segmenting only, or, when treated globally, a sequential strategy is used. Sequential methods however are prone to accumulate errors as they are not able to recover from mistakes of the previous module. In this work, we propose to combine all three tasks and leverage their interdependence: locations ease the segmentation, the segmentations in turn improve the locations and they all contribute and benefit from the identification task. To this purpose we propose a virtuous cycle to enforce coherence between the three tasks. Within such a cycle, the tasks interoperate and are iterated until a global consistency criterion is satisfied. Our experiments validate this strategy with anatomically coherent results that outperform the state of the art on the VerSe20 challenge benchmark. Our code and model are openly available for research purposes at https://gitlab.inria.fr/spine/vertebrae_segmentation. ",

    "title": "Automatic segmentation of novel coronavirus pneumonia lesions in CT  images utilizing deep-supervised ensemble learning network",
    "abstract": "Background: The 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has been spread widely in the world, causing a huge threat to people's living environment. Objective: Under computed tomography (CT) imaging, the structure features of COVID-19 lesions are complicated and varied greatly in different cases. To accurately locate COVID-19 lesions and assist doctors to make the best diagnosis and treatment plan, a deep-supervised ensemble learning network is presented for COVID-19 lesion segmentation in CT images. Methods: Considering the fact that a large number of COVID-19 CT images and the corresponding lesion annotations are difficult to obtained, a transfer learning strategy is employed to make up for the shortcoming and alleviate the overfitting problem. Based on the reality that traditional single deep learning framework is difficult to extract COVID-19 lesion features effectively, which may cause some lesions to be undetected. To overcome the problem, a deep-supervised ensemble learning network is presented to combine with local and global features for COVID-19 lesion segmentation. Results: The performance of the proposed method was validated in experiments with a publicly available dataset. Compared with manual annotations, the proposed method acquired a high intersection over union (IoU) of 0.7279. Conclusion: A deep-supervised ensemble learning network was presented for coronavirus pneumonia lesion segmentation in CT images. The effectiveness of the proposed method was verified by visual inspection and quantitative evaluation. Experimental results shown that the proposed mehtod has a perfect performance in COVID-19 lesion segmentation. ",

Three different learning datasets of particle displacements, momenta and energy density values are considered. Efficiency of the classification algorithms are further improved by two dimensionality reduction techniques: Principal Component Analysis and Locally Linear Embedding. Robustness of classifiers are investigated and demonstrated. Developed algorithms are successfully applied to detect localized intrinsic modes in three numerical simulations considering a case of two localized stationary breather solutions, a single stationary breather solution in noisy background and two mobile breather collision.
