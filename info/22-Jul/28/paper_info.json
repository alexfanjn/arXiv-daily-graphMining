    "abstract": "This paper addresses the analysis and design of quadratic neural networks, which have been recently introduced in the literature, and their applications to regression, classification, system identification and control of dynamical systems. These networks offer several advantages, the most important of which are the fact that the architecture is a by-product of the design and is not determined a-priori, their training can be done by solving a convex optimization problem so that the global optimum of the weights is achieved, and the input-output mapping can be expressed analytically by a quadratic form. It also appears from several examples that these networks work extremely well using only a small fraction of the training data. The results in the paper cast regression, classification, system identification, stability and control design as convex optimization problems, which can be solved efficiently with polynomial-time algorithms to a global optimum. Several examples will show the effectiveness of quadratic neural networks in applications. ",

    "abstract": "We propose transferability from Large Geometric Vicinity (LGV), a new technique to increase the transferability of black-box adversarial attacks. LGV starts from a pretrained surrogate model and collects multiple weight sets from a few additional training epochs with a constant and high learning rate. LGV exploits two geometric properties that we relate to transferability. First, models that belong to a wider weight optimum are better surrogates. Second, we identify a subspace able to generate an effective surrogate ensemble among this wider optimum. Through extensive experiments, we show that LGV alone outperforms all (combinations of) four established test-time transformations by 1.8 to 59.9 percentage points. Our findings shed new light on the importance of the geometry of the weight space to explain the transferability of adversarial examples. ",

    "title": "TINYCD: A (Not So) Deep Learning Model For Change Detection",
    "abstract": "The aim of change detection (CD) is to detect changes occurred in the same area by comparing two images of that place taken at different times. The challenging part of the CD is to keep track of the changes the user wants to highlight, such as new buildings, and to ignore changes due to external factors such as environmental, lighting condition, fog or seasonal changes. Recent developments in the field of deep learning enabled researchers to achieve outstanding performance in this area. In particular, different mechanisms of space-time attention allowed to exploit the spatial features that are extracted from the models and to correlate them also in a temporal way by exploiting both the available images. The downside is that the models have become increasingly complex and large, often unfeasible for edge applications. These are limitations when the models must be applied to the industrial field or in applications requiring real-time performances. In this work we propose a novel model, called TinyCD, demonstrating to be both lightweight and effective, able to achieve performances comparable or even superior to the current state of the art with 13-150X fewer parameters. In our approach we have exploited the importance of low-level features to compare images. To do this, we use only few backbone blocks. This strategy allow us to keep the number of network parameters low. To compose the features extracted from the two images, we introduce a novel, economical in terms of parameters, mixing block capable of cross correlating features in both space and time domains. Finally, to fully exploit the information contained in the computed features, we define the PW-MLP block able to perform a pixel wise classification.

As notoriously data-hungry companies become increasingly involved in VR development, this experimental scenario may soon represent a typical VR user experience. While virtual telepresence applications (and the so-called \"metaverse\") have recently received increased attention and investment from major tech firms, these environments remain relatively under-studied from a security and privacy standpoint. In this work, we illustrate how VR attackers can covertly ascertain dozens of personal data attributes from seemingly-anonymous users of popular metaverse applications like VRChat. These attackers can be as simple as other VR users without special privilege, and the potential scale and scope of this data collection far exceed what is feasible within traditional mobile and web applications. We aim to shed light on the unique privacy risks of the metaverse, and provide the first holistic framework for understanding intrusive data harvesting attacks in these emerging VR ecosystems. ",

    "abstract": "Recently, adversarial machine learning attacks have posed serious security threats against practical audio signal classification systems, including speech recognition, speaker recognition, and music copyright detection. Previous studies have mainly focused on ensuring the effectiveness of attacking an audio signal classifier via creating a small noise-like perturbation on the original signal. It is still unclear if an attacker is able to create audio signal perturbations that can be well perceived by human beings in addition to its attack effectiveness. This is particularly important for music signals as they are carefully crafted with human-enjoyable audio characteristics. In this work, we formulate the adversarial attack against music signals as a new perception-aware attack framework, which integrates human study into adversarial attack design. Specifically, we conduct a human study to quantify the human perception with respect to a change of a music signal. We invite human participants to rate their perceived deviation based on pairs of original and perturbed music signals, and reverse-engineer the human perception process by regression analysis to predict the human-perceived deviation given a perturbed signal. The perception-aware attack is then formulated as an optimization problem that finds an optimal perturbation signal to minimize the prediction of perceived deviation from the regressed human perception model. We use the perception-aware framework to design a realistic adversarial music attack against YouTube's copyright detector. Experiments show that the perception-aware attack produces adversarial music with significantly better perceptual quality than prior work. ",

    "abstract": "Masked language modeling (MLM) has become one of the most successful self-supervised pre-training task. Inspired by its success, Point-Bert, as a pioneer work in point cloud, proposed masked point modeling (MPM) to pre-train point transformer on large scale unanotated dataset. Despite its great performance, we find inherent difference between language and point cloud tends to cause ambiguous tokenization for point cloud. For point cloud, there doesn't exist a gold standard for point cloud tokenization. Although Point-Bert introduce a discrete Variational AutoEncoder (dVAE) as tokenizer to allocate token ids to local patches, it tends to generate ambigious token ids for local patches. We find this imperfect tokenizer might generate different token ids for semantically-similar patches and same token ids for semantically-dissimilar patches. To tackle above problem, we propose our Point-McBert, a pre-training framework with eased and refined supervision signals. Specifically, we ease the previous single-choice constraint on patches, and provide multi-choice token ids for each patch as supervision. Moreover, we utilitze the high-level semantics learned by transformer to further refine our supervision signals. Extensive experiments on point cloud classification, few-shot classification and part segmentation tasks demonstrate the superiority of our method, e.g., the pre-trained transformer achieves 94.1% accuracy on ModelNet40, 84.28% accuracy on the hardest setting of ScanObjectNN and new state-of-the-art performance on few-shot learning. We also demonstrate that our method not only improves the performance of Point-Bert on all downstream tasks, but also incurs almost no extra computational overhead. ",

Although remarkable advancement has been made in facial expression recognition (FER) task, challenges due to large variations of expression patterns and unavoidable data uncertainties still remain.

On one hand, MRE is introduced to avoid expression representation learning being dominated by a limited number of highly discriminative patterns. On the other hand, GUS is introduced to suppress the feature ambiguity in the representation space. The proposed method not only has stronger generalization capability to handle different variations of expression patterns but also more robustness to capture expression representations.

Different from existing works, we use a one-sided generative model and add a weighted patch-wise contrastive loss between sampled patches of the input image and the corresponding synthetic image, which serves as shape constraints. Moreover, we notice that the generated images and input images share similar structural information but are in different modalities. As such, we enforce contrastive losses on the generated images and the input images to train the encoder of a segmentation model to minimize the discrepancy between paired images in the learned embedding space. Compared with existing works that rely on adversarial learning for feature adaptation, such a method enables the encoder to learn domain-independent features in a more explicit way. We extensively evaluate our methods on segmentation tasks containing CT and MRI images for abdominal cavities and whole hearts. Experimental results show that the proposed framework not only outputs synthetic images with less distortion of organ shapes, but also outperforms state-of-the-art domain adaptation methods by a large margin.

Moreover, the timespan between interacted items is not sufficiently utilized by previous models, restricting SR performance gains. To address these problems, we propose a novel SR system employing a hierarchical graph neural network (HGNN) to model factorial user preferences. Specifically, a timespan-aware sequence graph (TSG) for the target user is first constructed with the timespan among interacted items. Next, all original nodes in TSG are softly clustered into factor nodes, each of which represents a certain factor of the user's preference. At last, all factor nodes' representations are used together to predict SR results. Our extensive experiments upon two datasets justify that our HGNN-based factorial user modeling obtains better SR performance than the state-of-the-art SR models. ",

However, time being consumed in training the DNN is excessive, and explainability analysis for the FDC neural network is still underwhelming. A concept known as imagefication-based intelligent FDC has been studied in recent years. This concept advocates to stack the sensors measurement data into an image format, the sensors FDC issue is then transformed to abnormal regions detection problem on the stacked image, which may well borrow the recent advances in the machine vision vision realm. Although promising results have been claimed in the imagefication-based intelligent FDC researches, due to the low size of the stacked image, small convolutional kernels and shallow DNN layers were used, which hinders the FDC performance. In this paper, we first propose a data augmentation method which inflates the stacked image to a larger size (correspondent to the VGG16 net developed in the machine vision realm). The FDC neural network is then trained via fine-tuning the VGG16 directly. To truncate and compress the FDC net size (hence its running time), we perform model pruning on the fine-tuned net. Class activation mapping (CAM) method is also adopted for explainability analysis of the FDC net to verify its internal operations. Via data augmentation, fine-tuning from VGG16, and model pruning, the FDC net developed in this paper claims an FDC accuracy 98.90% across 4 aircraft at 5 flight conditions (running time 26 ms). The CAM results also verify the FDC net w.r.t. its internal operations. ",

However, for decentralized bilevel optimization over peer-to-peer networks with limited computation and communication capabilities, how to achieve low sample and communication complexities are two fundamental challenges that remain under-explored so far. In this paper, we make the first attempt to investigate the class of decentralized bilevel optimization problems with nonconvex and strongly-convex structure corresponding to the outer and inner subproblems, respectively. Our main contributions in this paper are two-fold: i) We first propose a deterministic algorithm called INTERACT (inner-gradient-descent-outer-tracked-gradient) that requires the sample complexity of $\\mathcal{O}(n \\epsilon^{-1})$ and communication complexity of $\\mathcal{O}(\\epsilon^{-1})$ to solve the bilevel optimization problem, where $n$ and $\\epsilon > 0$ are the number of samples at each agent and the desired stationarity gap, respectively. ii) To relax the need for full gradient evaluations in each iteration, we propose a stochastic variance-reduced version of INTERACT (SVR-INTERACT), which improves the sample complexity to $\\mathcal{O}(\\sqrt{n} \\epsilon^{-1})$ while achieving the same communication complexity as the deterministic algorithm. To our knowledge, this work is the first that achieves both low sample and communication complexities for solving decentralized bilevel optimization problems over networks. Our numerical experiments also corroborate our theoretical findings. ",

The perturbations consist of fixing a set of components to a fixed value. They can destroy and create new attractors. In each case, we give an upper bound on their theoretical computational complexity, and give an implementation of the resolution using the BoNesis Python framework.

    "abstract": "This study examines how active participation, financial commitment, and passive participation in the leading social live-streaming service, Twitch.tv, relate to individuals' psychological well-being. The three dimensions of social capital-structural, relational, and cognitive-as well as parasocial relationship are explored as mediators. Cross-sectional survey data from 396 respondents was analyzed by comparing two fully saturated structural equation models. Findings indicate actively participating in a favorite streamers' Chat is positively associated with increased well-being. Structural social capital, or having more social interaction ties, positively mediates the relationship between active participation and well-being, as well as financial commitment and well-being. Greater cognitive social capital, or shared values and goals with a favorite streamer, is related to decreased well-being. Parasocial relationship does not significantly mediate the relationship between use and well-being. Our results demonstrate the importance of tangible social ties over the perceived relationships or identification with a favorite streamer. ",

    "title": "NICEST: Noisy Label Correction and Training for Robust Scene Graph  Generation",
    "abstract": "Nearly all existing scene graph generation (SGG) models have overlooked the ground-truth annotation qualities of mainstream SGG datasets, i.e., they assume: 1) all the manually annotated positive samples are equally correct; 2) all the un-annotated negative samples are absolutely background. In this paper, we argue that neither of the assumptions applies to SGG: there are numerous noisy ground-truth predicate labels that break these two assumptions and harm the training of unbiased SGG models. To this end, we propose a novel NoIsy label CorrEction and Sample Training strategy for SGG: NICEST. Specifically, it consists of two parts: NICE and NIST, which rule out these noisy label issues by generating high-quality samples and the effective training strategy, respectively. NICE first detects noisy samples and then reassigns them more high-quality soft predicate labels. NIST is a multi-teacher knowledge distillation based training strategy, which enables the model to learn unbiased fusion knowledge. And a dynamic trade-off weighting strategy in NIST is designed to penalize the bias of different teachers. Due to the model-agnostic nature of both NICE and NIST, our NICEST can be seamlessly incorporated into any SGG architecture to boost its performance on different predicate categories. In addition, to better evaluate the generalization of SGG models, we further propose a new benchmark VG-OOD, by re-organizing the prevalent VG dataset and deliberately making the predicate distributions of the training and test sets as different as possible for each subject-object category pair. This new benchmark helps disentangle the influence of subject-object category based frequency biases. Extensive ablations and results on different backbones and tasks have attested to the effectiveness and generalization ability of each component of NICEST. ",

    "abstract": "Vision Transformers (ViTs) have recently dominated a range of computer vision tasks, yet it suffers from low training data efficiency and inferior local semantic representation capability without appropriate inductive bias. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) inherently capture regional-aware semantics, inspiring researchers to introduce CNNs back into the architecture of the ViTs to provide desirable inductive bias for ViTs. However, is the locality achieved by the micro-level CNNs embedded in ViTs good enough? In this paper, we investigate the problem by profoundly exploring how the macro architecture of the hybrid CNNs/ViTs enhances the performances of hierarchical ViTs. Particularly, we study the role of token embedding layers, alias convolutional embedding (CE), and systemically reveal how CE injects desirable inductive bias in ViTs. Besides, we apply the optimal CE configuration to 4 recently released state-of-the-art ViTs, effectively boosting the corresponding performances. Finally, a family of efficient hybrid CNNs/ViTs, dubbed CETNets, are released, which may serve as generic vision backbones. Specifically, CETNets achieve 84.9% Top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K (training from scratch), 48.6% box mAP on the COCO benchmark, and 51.6% mIoU on the ADE20K, substantially improving the performances of the corresponding state-of-the-art baselines.

    "abstract": "With the increasing attention in various 3D safety-critical applications, point cloud learning models have been shown to be vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Although existing 3D attack methods achieve high success rates, they delve into the data space with point-wise perturbation, which may neglect the geometric characteristics. Instead, we propose point cloud attacks from a new perspective -- the graph spectral domain attack, aiming to perturb graph transform coefficients in the spectral domain that corresponds to varying certain geometric structure. Specifically, leveraging on graph signal processing, we first adaptively transform the coordinates of points onto the spectral domain via graph Fourier transform (GFT) for compact representation. Then, we analyze the influence of different spectral bands on the geometric structure, based on which we propose to perturb the GFT coefficients via a learnable graph spectral filter. Considering the low-frequency components mainly contribute to the rough shape of the 3D object, we further introduce a low-frequency constraint to limit perturbations within imperceptible high-frequency components. Finally, the adversarial point cloud is generated by transforming the perturbed spectral representation back to the data domain via the inverse GFT. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed attack in terms of both the imperceptibility and attack success rates. ",

In this article, we present a solution to better forecast GMV inside Alipay app. Thanks to graph neural networks (GNN) which has great ability to correlate different entities to enrich information, we propose Gaia, a graph neural network (GNN) model with temporal shift aware attention. Gaia leverages the relevant e-seller' sales information and learn neighbor correlation based on temporal dependencies. By testing on Alipay's real dataset and comparing with other baselines, Gaia has shown the best performance.

    "abstract": "Active learning is an important technology for automated machine learning systems. In contrast to Neural Architecture Search (NAS) which aims at automating neural network architecture design, active learning aims at automating training data selection. It is especially critical for training a long-tailed task, in which positive samples are sparsely distributed. Active learning alleviates the expensive data annotation issue through incrementally training models powered with efficient data selection. Instead of annotating all unlabeled samples, it iteratively selects and annotates the most valuable samples. Active learning has been popular in image classification, but has not been fully explored in object detection. Most of current approaches on object detection are evaluated with different settings, making it difficult to fairly compare their performance. To facilitate the research in this field, this paper contributes an active learning benchmark framework named as ALBench for evaluating active learning in object detection. Developed on an automatic deep model training system, this ALBench framework is easy-to-use, compatible with different active learning algorithms, and ensures the same training and testing protocols. We hope this automated benchmark system help researchers to easily reproduce literature's performance and have objective comparisons with prior arts. The code will be release through Github. ",

However, previous methods often fail to counteract particular regions related to dynamic objects with more severe environmental changes. To mitigate this issue, we propose to incorporate an auxiliary point-selective network into a meta-learning framework, called PointFix, to provide a robust initialization of stereo models for online stereo adaptation. In a nutshell, our auxiliary network learns to fix local variants intensively by effectively back-propagating local information through the meta-gradient for the robust initialization of the baseline model. This network is model-agnostic, so can be used in any kind of architectures in a plug-and-play manner. We conduct extensive experiments to verify the effectiveness of our method under three adaptation settings such as short-, mid-, and long-term sequences. Experimental results show that the proper initialization of the base stereo model by the auxiliary network enables our learning paradigm to achieve state-of-the-art performance at inference. ",

In this work, we test whether these rather novel sensors can be applied to the popular task of traffic sign detection. To this end, we analyse different representations of the event data: event frame, event frequency, and the exponentially decaying time surface, and apply video frame reconstruction using a deep neural network called FireNet. We use the deep convolutional neural network YOLOv4 as a detector. For particular representations, we obtain a detection accuracy in the range of 86.9-88.9% mAP@0.5. The use of a fusion of the considered representations allows us to obtain a detector with higher accuracy of 89.9% mAP@0.5. In comparison, the detector for the frames reconstructed with FireNet is characterised by an accuracy of 72.67% mAP@0.5. The results obtained illustrate the potential of event cameras in automotive applications, either as standalone sensors or in close cooperation with typical frame-based cameras. ",

In this context, popular social media users play a major role, as they have the ability to broadcast messages to large audiences, thus influencing public opinion. We make use of publicly available Twitter data to study the behavior of influential users discussing the pandemic, whom we term COVID-19 Twitter elites. We tackle the issue from a network perspective, by considering users as nodes and following relationships as directed edges. The resulting network structure is modeled by embedding the actors in a latent social space, where users closer to one another have a higher probability of forming edges. The results suggest the existence of two distinct communities, which can be interpreted as \"generally pro\" and \"generally against\" vaccine mandates. We further focus on a number of exposed users, such as politicians, activists, and news outlets, and discuss their roles in the latent space. Our findings show that the full spectrum of beliefs between the two poles is represented, with more radical users positioned towards the extremes of the space, and more moderate actors in the middle. Our analysis demonstrates how it is possible to provide a nuanced representation of the COVID-19 Twitter ecosystem by only considering follows within the network of elites. This finding corroborates existing evidence on the pervasiveness of echo chamber effects on the platform, and showcases the power of latent space models for studying communication on social media. ",

    "abstract": "Camouflaged object detection (COD) aims to identify the objects that conceal themselves in natural scenes. Accurate COD suffers from a number of challenges associated with low boundary contrast and the large variation of object appearances, e.g., object size and shape. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Context-aware Cross-level Fusion Network (C2F-Net), which fuses context-aware cross-level features for accurately identifying camouflaged objects. Specifically, we compute informative attention coefficients from multi-level features with our Attention-induced Cross-level Fusion Module (ACFM), which further integrates the features under the guidance of attention coefficients. We then propose a Dual-branch Global Context Module (DGCM) to refine the fused features for informative feature representations by exploiting rich global context information. Multiple ACFMs and DGCMs are integrated in a cascaded manner for generating a coarse prediction from high-level features. The coarse prediction acts as an attention map to refine the low-level features before passing them to our Camouflage Inference Module (CIM) to generate the final prediction. We perform extensive experiments on three widely used benchmark datasets and compare C2F-Net with state-of-the-art (SOTA) models. The results show that C2F-Net is an effective COD model and outperforms SOTA models remarkably. Further, an evaluation on polyp segmentation datasets demonstrates the promising potentials of our C2F-Net in COD downstream applications.

In the first stage, the feature extractor is trained via self-supervised learning, which enables the preservation of the cluster structures among the data points. To preserve the cluster structures even better, we propose to replace the first stage with another model that is pretrained on a much larger dataset via self-supervised learning. The method is simple and might suffer from domain shift. Nonetheless, we have empirically shown that it can achieve superior clustering performance. When a vision transformer (ViT) architecture is used for feature extraction, our method has achieved clustering accuracy 94.0%, 55.6% and 97.9% on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and STL-10 respectively.

However, all existing Trojan attacks adopt noticeable patch-based triggers (e.g., a square pattern), making them perceptible to humans and easy to be spotted by machines. In this paper, we present a novel attack, namely hardly perceptible Trojan attack (HPT). HPT crafts hardly perceptible Trojan images by utilizing the additive noise and per pixel flow field to tweak the pixel values and positions of the original images, respectively. To achieve superior attack performance, we propose to jointly optimize bit flips, additive noise, and flow field. Since the weight bits of the DNNs are binary, this problem is very hard to be solved. We handle the binary constraint with equivalent replacement and provide an effective optimization algorithm. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, SVHN, and ImageNet datasets show that the proposed HPT can generate hardly perceptible Trojan images, while achieving comparable or better attack performance compared to the state-of-the-art methods.

    "abstract": "Non-local (NL) block is a popular module that demonstrates the capability to model global contexts. However, NL block generally has heavy computation and memory costs, so it is impractical to apply the block to high-resolution feature maps. In this paper, to investigate the efficacy of NL block, we empirically analyze if the magnitude and direction of input feature vectors properly affect the attention between vectors. The results show the inefficacy of softmax operation which is generally used to normalize the attention map of the NL block. Attention maps normalized with softmax operation highly rely upon magnitude of key vectors, and performance is degenerated if the magnitude information is removed. By replacing softmax operation with the scaling factor, we demonstrate improved performance on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny-ImageNet. In Addition, our method shows robustness to embedding channel reduction and embedding weight initialization. Notably, our method makes multi-head attention employable without additional computational cost. ",

    "abstract": "Active speaker detection plays a vital role in human-machine interaction. Recently, a few end-to-end audiovisual frameworks emerged. However, these models' inference time was not explored and are not applicable for real-time applications due to their complexity and large input size. In addition, they explored a similar feature extraction strategy that employs the ConvNet on audio and visual inputs. This work presents a novel two-stream end-to-end framework fusing features extracted from images via VGG-M with raw Mel Frequency Cepstrum Coefficients features extracted from the audio waveform. The network has two BiGRU layers attached to each stream to handle each stream's temporal dynamic before fusion. After fusion, one BiGRU layer is attached to model the joint temporal dynamics. The experiment result on the AVA-ActiveSpeaker dataset indicates that our new feature extraction strategy shows more robustness to noisy signals and better inference time than models that employed ConvNet on both modalities. The proposed model predicts within 44.41 ms, which is fast enough for real-time applications. Our best-performing model attained 88.929% accuracy, nearly the same detection result as state-of-the-art -work. ",

    "abstract": "The task of scene graph generation entails identifying object entities and their corresponding interaction predicates in a given image (or video). Due to the combinatorially large solution space, existing approaches to scene graph generation assume certain factorization of the joint distribution to make the estimation feasible (e.g., assuming that objects are conditionally independent of predicate predictions). However, this fixed factorization is not ideal under all scenarios (e.g., for images where an object entailed in interaction is small and not discernible on its own). In this work, we propose a novel framework for scene graph generation that addresses this limitation, as well as introduces dynamic conditioning on the image, using message passing in a Markov Random Field. This is implemented as an iterative refinement procedure wherein each modification is conditioned on the graph generated in the previous iteration. This conditioning across refinement steps allows joint reasoning over entities and relations. This framework is realized via a novel and end-to-end trainable transformer-based architecture. In addition, the proposed framework can improve existing approach performance. Through extensive experiments on Visual Genome and Action Genome benchmark datasets we show improved performance on the scene graph generation. ",

With the advent and omnipresence of computer vision deep learning models, increased interest has also emerged for the task of visual compatibility detection with the aim to develop quality fashion outfit recommendation systems. Previous works have defined visual compatibility as a binary classification task with items in a garment being considered as fully compatible or fully incompatible. However, this is not applicable to Outfit Maker applications where users create their own outfits and need to know which specific items may be incompatible with the rest of the outfit. To address this, we propose the Visual InCompatibility TransfORmer (VICTOR) that is optimized for two tasks: 1) overall compatibility as regression and 2) the detection of mismatching items. Unlike previous works that either rely on feature extraction from ImageNet-pretrained models or by end-to-end fine tuning, we utilize fashion-specific contrastive language-image pre-training for fine tuning computer vision neural networks on fashion imagery. Moreover, we build upon the Polyvore outfit benchmark to generate partially mismatching outfits, creating a new dataset termed Polyvore-MISFITs, that is used to train VICTOR. A series of ablation and comparative analyses show that the proposed architecture can compete and even surpass the current state-of-the-art on Polyvore datasets while reducing the instance-wise floating operations by 88%, striking a balance between high performance and efficiency.

Selfish mining can preserve discovered blocks and strategically release them, wasting honest miners' computing resources and getting higher profits. Previous mining attacks either conceal the mined whole blocks (hiding or discarding), or release them completely in a particular time slot (e.g., causing a fork). In this paper, we extend the mining attack's strategy space to partial block sharing, and propose a new and feasible Partial Selfish Mining (PSM) attack. We show that by releasing partial block data publicly and attracting rational miners to work on attacker's private branch, attackers and these attracted miners can gain an unfair share of mining rewards. We then propose Advanced PSM (A-PSM) attack that can further improve attackers' profits to be no less than the selfish mining. Both theoretical and experimental results show that PSM attackers can be more profitable than selfish miners under a certain range of mining power and network conditions. A-PSM attackers can gain even higher profits than both selfish mining and honest mining with attracted rational miners. ",

Recently, there has been an increase in fake news content due to the recent proliferation of social media and fake content generation techniques such as Deep Fake. The majority of the existing modalities of fake news detection focus on content based approaches. However, most of these techniques fail to deal with ultra realistic synthesized media produced by generative models. Our recent studies find that the propagation characteristics of authentic and fake news are distinguishable, irrespective of their modalities. In this regard, we have investigated the auxiliary information based on social context to detect fake news. This paper has analyzed the social context of fake news detection with a hybrid graph neural network based approach. This hybrid model is based on integrating a graph neural network on the propagation of news and bi directional encoder representations from the transformers model on news content to learn the text features. Thus this proposed approach learns the content as well as the context features and hence able to outperform the baseline models with an f1 score of 0.91 on PolitiFact and 0.93 on the Gossipcop dataset, respectively ",

    "abstract": "There has been growing interest in the use of multi-robot systems in various tasks and scenarios. The main attractiveness of such systems is their flexibility, robustness, and scalability. An often overlooked yet promising feature is system modularity, which offers the possibility to harness agent specialization, while also enabling system-level upgrades. However, altering the agents' capacities can change the exploration-exploitation balance required to maximize the system's performance. Here, we study the effect of a swarm's heterogeneity on its exploration-exploitation balance while tracking multiple fast-moving evasive targets under the Cooperative Multi-Robot Observation of Multiple Moving Targets framework. To this end, we use a decentralized search and tracking strategy with adjustable levels of exploration and exploitation. By indirectly tuning the balance, we first confirm the presence of an optimal balance between these two key competing actions. Next, by substituting slower moving agents with faster ones, we show that the system exhibits a performance improvement without any modifications to the original strategy. In addition, owing to the additional amount of exploitation carried out by the faster agents, we demonstrate that a heterogeneous system's performance can be further improved by reducing an agent's level of connectivity, to favor the conduct of exploratory actions. Furthermore, in studying the influence of the density of swarming agents, we show that the addition of faster agents can counterbalance a reduction in the overall number of agents while maintaining the level of tracking performance. Finally, we explore the challenges of using differentiated strategies to take advantage of the heterogeneous nature of the swarm. ",

After exploring fundamental problems such as minimization and equivalence testing of PMRs, we explore how their use can lead to significant time and space savings when executing query plans. We show that, from a computational complexity point of view, PMRs seem especially well-suited for representing results of regular path queries and extensions thereof involving counting, random sampling, unions, and joins.

In human-robot interaction, the robot's ability to establish joint attention with a human partner and exploit various social cues to react accordingly is a crucial step in creating communicative robots. Along the social component, an effective human-robot interaction can be seen as a new method to improve and make the robot's learning process more natural and robust for a given task. In this work we use different social skills, such as mutual gaze, gaze following, speech and human face recognition, to develop an effective teacher-learner scenario tailored to visual object learning in dynamic environments. Experiments on the iCub robot demonstrate that the system allows the robot to learn new objects through a natural interaction with a human teacher in presence of distractors. ",

From the perspective of optimization, DUNs inherit a well-defined and interpretable structure from iterative steps.

In this paper, to break the above bottleneck, we first propose a generalized dual-domain optimization framework, which is general for inverse imaging and integrates the merits of both (1) image-domain and (2) convolutional-coding-domain priors to constrain the feasible region in the solution space. By unfolding the proposed framework into deep neural networks, we further design a novel Dual-Domain Deep Convolutional Coding Network (D3C2-Net) for CS imaging with the capability of transmitting high-throughput feature-level image representation through all the unfolded stages. Experiments on natural and MR images demonstrate that our D3C2-Net achieves higher performance and better accuracy-complexity trade-offs than other state-of-the-arts. ",

The problem nevertheless is not trivial especially for the real-world deployments, which often demand high efficiency in inference latency. In this paper, we thoroughly analyze the design of convolutional blocks (the type of convolutions and the number of channels in convolutions), and the ways of interactions across multiple scales, all from lightweight standpoint for semantic segmentation. With such in-depth comparisons, we conclude three principles, and accordingly devise Lightweight and Progressively-Scalable Networks (LPS-Net) that novelly expands the network complexity in a greedy manner. Technically, LPS-Net first capitalizes on the principles to build a tiny network. Then, LPS-Net progressively scales the tiny network to larger ones by expanding a single dimension (the number of convolutional blocks, the number of channels, or the input resolution) at one time to meet the best speed/accuracy tradeoff. Extensive experiments conducted on three datasets consistently demonstrate the superiority of LPS-Net over several efficient semantic segmentation methods. More remarkably, our LPS-Net achieves 73.4% mIoU on Cityscapes test set, with the speed of 413.5FPS on an NVIDIA GTX 1080Ti, leading to a performance improvement by 1.5% and a 65% speed-up against the state-of-the-art STDC.

    "abstract": "Given a set of images of a scene, the re-rendering of this scene from novel views and lighting conditions is an important and challenging problem in Computer Vision and Graphics. On the one hand, most existing works in Computer Vision usually impose many assumptions regarding the image formation process, e.g. direct illumination and predefined materials, to make scene parameter estimation tractable. On the other hand, mature Computer Graphics tools allow modeling of complex photo-realistic light transport given all the scene parameters. Combining these approaches, we propose a method for scene relighting under novel views by learning a neural precomputed radiance transfer function, which implicitly handles global illumination effects using novel environment maps. Our method can be solely supervised on a set of real images of the scene under a single unknown lighting condition. To disambiguate the task during training, we tightly integrate a differentiable path tracer in the training process and propose a combination of a synthesized OLAT and a real image loss. Results show that the recovered disentanglement of scene parameters improves significantly over the current state of the art and, thus, also our re-rendering results are more realistic and accurate.

    "title": "Proprioceptive Slip Detection for Planetary Rovers in Perceptually  Degraded Extraterrestrial Environments",
    "abstract": "Slip detection is of fundamental importance for the safety and efficiency of rovers driving on the surface of extraterrestrial bodies. Current planetary rover slip detection systems rely on visual perception on the assumption that sufficient visual features can be acquired in the environment. However, visual-based methods are prone to suffer in perceptually degraded planetary environments with dominant low terrain features such as regolith, glacial terrain, salt-evaporites, and poor lighting conditions such as dark caves and permanently shadowed regions. Relying only on visual sensors for slip detection also requires additional computational power and reduces the rover traversal rate. This paper answers the question of how to detect wheel slippage of a planetary rover without depending on visual perception. In this respect, we propose a slip detection system that obtains its information from a proprioceptive localization framework that is capable of providing reliable, continuous, and computationally efficient state estimation over hundreds of meters. This is accomplished by using zero velocity update, zero angular rate update, and non-holonomic constraints as pseudo-measurement updates on an inertial navigation system framework. The proposed method is evaluated on actual hardware and field-tested in a planetary-analog environment. The method achieves greater than 92% slip detection accuracy for distances around 150 m using only an IMU and wheel encoders. ",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a direct construction of a novel type of code set, which has combined properties of complete complementary code (CCC) and zero-correlation zone (ZCZ) sequences and called it complete complementary-ZCZ (CC-ZCZ) code set. The code set is constructed by using multivariable functions. The proposed construction also provides Golay-ZCZ codes with new lengths, i.e., prime-power lengths. The proposed Golay-ZCZ codes are optimal and asymptotically optimal for binary and non-binary cases, respectively, by \\emph{Tang-Fan-Matsufuzi} bound. Furthermore, the proposed direct construction provides novel ZCZ sequences of length $p^k$, where $k$ is an integer $\\geq 2$. We establish a relationship between the proposed CC-ZCZ code set and the first-order generalized Reed-Muller (GRM) code, and proved that both have the same Hamming distance. We also counted the number of CC-ZCZ code set in first-order GRM codes. The column sequence peak-to-mean envelope power ratio (PMEPR) of the proposed CC-ZCZ construction is derived and compared with existing works. The proposed construction is also deduced to Golay-ZCZ and ZCZ sequences which are compared to the existing work. The proposed construction generalizes many of the existing work. ",

In this paper, we propose BotBuster, a social bot detector built with the concept of a mixture of experts approach. Each expert is trained to analyze a portion of account information, e.g. username, and are combined to estimate the probability that the account is a bot. Experiments on 10 Twitter datasets show that BotBuster outperforms popular bot-detection baselines (avg F1=73.54 vs avg F1=45.12). This is accompanied with F1=60.04 on a Reddit dataset and F1=60.92 on an external evaluation set. Further analysis shows that only 36 posts is required for a stable bot classification. Investigation shows that bot post features have changed across the years and can be difficult to differentiate from human features, making bot detection a difficult and ongoing problem. ",

However, the concept of bias is not always clearly defined in the literature. Definitions of bias are often ambiguous, or definitions are not provided at all. To study biases in a precise way, it is important to have a well-defined concept of bias. We propose to define bias as a direct causal effect that is unjustified. We propose to define the closely related concept of disparity as a direct or indirect causal effect that includes a bias. Our proposed definitions can be used to study biases and disparities in a more rigorous and systematic way. We compare our definitions of bias and disparity with various definitions of fairness introduced in the artificial intelligence literature. We also illustrate our definitions in two case studies, focusing on gender bias in science and racial bias in police shootings. Our proposed definitions aim to contribute to a better appreciation of the causal intricacies of studies of biases and disparities. This will hopefully also lead to an improved understanding of the policy implications of such studies. ",

    "abstract": "There has been a growing number of machine learning methods for approximately solving the travelling salesman problem. However, these methods often require solved instances for training or use complex reinforcement learning approaches that need a large amount of tuning. To avoid these problems, we introduce a novel unsupervised learning approach. We use a relaxation of an integer linear program for TSP to construct a loss function that does not require correct instance labels. With variable discretization, its minimum coincides with the optimal or near-optimal solution. Furthermore, this loss function is differentiable and thus can be used to train neural networks directly. We use our loss function with a Graph Neural Network and design controlled experiments on both Euclidean and asymmetric TSP. Our approach has the advantage over supervised learning of not requiring large labelled datasets. In addition, the performance of our approach surpasses reinforcement learning for asymmetric TSP and is comparable to reinforcement learning for Euclidean instances. Our approach is also more stable and easier to train than reinforcement learning. ",

    "abstract": "Rich temporal information and variations in viewpoints make video data an attractive choice for learning image representations using unsupervised contrastive learning (UCL) techniques. State-of-the-art (SOTA) contrastive learning techniques consider frames within a video as positives in the embedding space, whereas the frames from other videos are considered negatives. We observe that unlike multiple views of an object in natural scene videos, an Ultrasound (US) video captures different 2D slices of an organ. Hence, there is almost no similarity between the temporally distant frames of even the same US video. In this paper we propose to instead utilize such frames as hard negatives. We advocate mining both intra-video and cross-video negatives in a hardness-sensitive negative mining curriculum in a UCL framework to learn rich image representations. We deploy our framework to learn the representations of Gallbladder (GB) malignancy from US videos. We also construct the first large-scale US video dataset containing 64 videos and 15,800 frames for learning GB representations. We show that the standard ResNet50 backbone trained with our framework improves the accuracy of models pretrained with SOTA UCL techniques as well as supervised pretrained models on ImageNet for the GB malignancy detection task by 2-6%. We further validate the generalizability of our method on a publicly available lung US image dataset of COVID-19 pathologies and show an improvement of 1.5% compared to SOTA.

We find that using Leaky ReLU activations leads to more Gaussian-like weight posteriors and achieves a lower expected calibration error (ECE) than its ReLU-based counterpart. ",

    "abstract": "Convolutional neural networks have been widely applied to medical image segmentation and have achieved considerable performance. However, the performance may be significantly affected by the domain gap between training data (source domain) and testing data (target domain). To address this issue, we propose a data manipulation based domain generalization method, called Automated Augmentation for Domain Generalization (AADG). Our AADG framework can effectively sample data augmentation policies that generate novel domains and diversify the training set from an appropriate search space. Specifically, we introduce a novel proxy task maximizing the diversity among multiple augmented novel domains as measured by the Sinkhorn distance in a unit sphere space, making automated augmentation tractable. Adversarial training and deep reinforcement learning are employed to efficiently search the objectives. Quantitative and qualitative experiments on 11 publicly-accessible fundus image datasets (four for retinal vessel segmentation, four for optic disc and cup (OD/OC) segmentation and three for retinal lesion segmentation) are comprehensively performed. Two OCTA datasets for retinal vasculature segmentation are further involved to validate cross-modality generalization. Our proposed AADG exhibits state-of-the-art generalization performance and outperforms existing approaches by considerable margins on retinal vessel, OD/OC and lesion segmentation tasks. The learned policies are empirically validated to be model-agnostic and can transfer well to other models. The source code is available at https://github.com/CRazorback/AADG. ",

Therefore, for further imaging surveillance and treatment planning, it is important to be able to predict if an UIA is likely to grow based on an initial baseline Time-of-Flight MRA (TOF-MRA). It is known that the size and shape of UIAs are predictors of aneurysm growth and/or rupture. We perform a feasibility study of using a mesh convolutional neural network for future UIA growth prediction from baseline TOF-MRAs. We include 151 TOF-MRAs, with 169 UIAs where 49 UIAs were classified as growing and 120 as stable, based on the clinical definition of growth (>1 mm increase in size in follow-up scan). UIAs were segmented from TOF-MRAs and meshes were automatically generated. We investigate the input of both UIA mesh only and region-of-interest (ROI) meshes including UIA and surrounding parent vessels. We develop a classification model to predict UIAs that will grow or remain stable. The model consisted of a mesh convolutional neural network including additional novel input edge features of shape index and curvedness which describe the surface topology. It was investigated if input edge mid-point co-ordinates influenced the model performance. The model with highest AUC (63.8%) for growth prediction was using UIA meshes with input edge mid-point co-ordinate features (average F1 score = 62.3%, accuracy = 66.9%, sensitivity = 57.3%, specificity = 70.8%).
