    "abstract": "Standard neural networks can approximate general nonlinear operators, represented either explicitly by a combination of mathematical operators, e.g., in an advection-diffusion-reaction partial differential equation, or simply as a black box, e.g., a system-of-systems. The first neural operator was the Deep Operator Network (DeepONet), proposed in 2019 based on rigorous approximation theory. Since then, a few other less general operators have been published, e.g., based on graph neural networks or Fourier transforms. For black box systems, training of neural operators is data-driven only but if the governing equations are known they can be incorporated into the loss function during training to develop physics-informed neural operators. Neural operators can be used as surrogates in design problems, uncertainty quantification, autonomous systems, and almost in any application requiring real-time inference. Moreover, independently pre-trained DeepONets can be used as components of a complex multi-physics system by coupling them together with relatively light training. Here, we present a review of DeepONet, the Fourier neural operator, and the graph neural operator, as well as appropriate extensions with feature expansions, and highlight their usefulness in diverse applications in computational mechanics, including porous media, fluid mechanics, and solid mechanics.

    "abstract": "In the past decade, with the development of big data technology, an increasing amount of patient information has been stored as electronic health records (EHRs). Leveraging these data, various doctor recommendation systems have been proposed. Typically, such studies process the EHR data in a flat-structured manner, where each encounter was treated as an unordered set of features. Nevertheless, the heterogeneous structured information such as service sequence stored in claims shall not be ignored. This paper presents a doctor recommendation system with time embedding to reconstruct the potential connections between patients and doctors using heterogeneous graph attention network. Besides, to address the privacy issue of patient data sharing crossing hospitals, a federated decentralized learning method based on a minimization optimization model is also proposed. The graph-based recommendation system has been validated on a EHR dataset. Compared to baseline models, the proposed method improves the AUC by up to 6.2%. And our proposed federated-based algorithm not only yields the fictitious fusion center's performance but also enjoys a convergence rate of O(1/T). ",

    "abstract": "A counter-intuitive property of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) is their inherent susceptibility to adversarial examples, which severely hinders the application of CNNs in security-critical fields. Adversarial examples are similar to original examples but contain malicious perturbations. Adversarial training is a simple and effective training method to improve the robustness of CNNs to adversarial examples. The mechanisms behind adversarial examples and adversarial training are worth exploring. Therefore, this work investigates similarities and differences between two types of CNNs (both normal and robust ones) in information extraction by observing the trends towards the mutual information. We show that 1) the amount of mutual information that CNNs extract from original and adversarial examples is almost similar, whether CNNs are in normal training or adversarial training; the reason why adversarial examples mislead CNNs may be that they contain more texture-based information about other categories; 2) compared with normal training, adversarial training is more difficult and the amount of information extracted by the robust CNNs is less; 3) the CNNs trained with different methods have different preferences for certain types of information; normally trained CNNs tend to extract texture-based information from the inputs, while adversarially trained models prefer to shape-based information. Furthermore, we also analyze the mutual information estimators used in this work, kernel-density-estimation and binning methods, and find that these estimators outline the geometric properties of the middle layer's output to a certain extent.

Due to the nature of regulated medical device software and the difficulty in acquiring large amounts of labeled medical datasets, we consider the task of predicting the test accuracy of an arbitrary black-box model on an unlabeled target domain without modification to the original training process or any distributional assumptions of the original source data (i.e. we treat the model as a \"black-box\" and only use the predicted output responses). We propose a \"black-box\" test estimation technique based on conformal prediction and evaluate it against other methods on three medical imaging datasets (mammography, dermatology, and histopathology) under several clinically relevant types of distribution shift (institution, hardware scanner, atlas, hospital). We hope that by promoting practical and effective estimation techniques for black-box models, manufacturers of medical devices will develop more standardized and realistic evaluation procedures to improve the robustness and trustworthiness of clinical AI tools.

Taking the form of a bipartite graph, a FOON contains symbolic (high-level) concepts useful to a robot's understanding of tasks and its environment for object-level planning. Prior to this paper, little has been done to demonstrate how task plans acquired from FOON via task tree retrieval can be executed by a robot, as the concepts in a FOON are too abstract for immediate execution. We propose a hierarchical task planning approach that translates a FOON graph into a PDDL-based representation of domain knowledge for manipulation planning. As a result of this process, a task plan can be acquired that a robot can execute from start to end, leveraging the use of action contexts and skills in the form of dynamic movement primitives (DMP). We demonstrate the entire pipeline from planning to execution using CoppeliaSim and show how learned action contexts can be extended to never-before-seen scenarios. ",

RelaxLoss is applicable to any classification model with added benefits of easy implementation and negligible overhead. Through extensive evaluations on five datasets with diverse modalities (images, medical data, transaction records), our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art defense mechanisms in terms of resilience against MIAs as well as model utility.

Although there are effective methods to train fair models from scratch, how to automatically reveal and explain the unfairness of a trained model remains a challenging task. Revealing unfairness of machine learning models in interpretable fashion is a critical step towards fair and trustworthy AI. In this paper, we systematically tackle the novel task of revealing unfair models by mining interpretable evidence (RUMIE). The key idea is to find solid evidence in the form of a group of data instances discriminated most by the model. To make the evidence interpretable, we also find a set of human-understandable key attributes and decision rules that characterize the discriminated data instances and distinguish them from the other non-discriminated data. As demonstrated by extensive experiments on many real-world data sets, our method finds highly interpretable and solid evidence to effectively reveal the unfairness of trained models. Moreover, it is much more scalable than all of the baseline methods. ",

In addition to a person's physiological features, we also incorporate the environment's impact through weather and social network. To this end, we leverage phone data to construct social networks and develop a machine learning architecture that aggregates information from multiple users of the graph network and integrates it with the temporal dynamics of data to predict emotion for all the users. The construction of social networks does not incur additional cost in terms of EMAs or data collection from users and doesn't raise privacy concerns. We propose an architecture that automates the integration of a user's social network affect prediction, is capable of dealing with the dynamic distribution of real-life social networks, making it scalable to large-scale networks. Our extensive evaluation highlights the improvement provided by the integration of social networks. We further investigate the impact of graph topology on model's performance. ",

In this paper we address power system problems of bilevel structure, commonly arising after the deregulation of the power industry. Such problems are predominantly solved by converting the lower-level problem into a set of equivalent constraints using the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker optimality conditions at an expense of binary variables. Furthermore, in case the lower-level problem is nonconvex, the strong duality does not hold rendering the single-level reduction techniques inapplicable. To overcome this, we propose an effective numerical scheme based on bypassing the lower level completely using an approximation function that replicates the relevant lower level effect on the upper level. The approximation function is constructed by training a deep convolutional neural network. The numerical procedure is run iteratively to enhance the accuracy. As a case study, the proposed method is applied to a price-maker energy storage optimal bidding problem that considers an AC power flow-based market clearing in the lower level. The results indicate that greater actual profits are achieved as compared to the less accurate DC market representation. ",

Hence, for every new task, we often resolve to design new models and train them on model-specific datasets collected, whenever possible, in an environment mimicking the model's deployment. This approach essentially gives up on generalization. Yet, an ML architecture called_Transformer_ has enabled previously unimaginable generalization in other domains. Nowadays, one can download a model pre-trained on massive datasets and only fine-tune it for a specific task and context with comparatively little time and data. These fine-tuned models are now state-of-the-art for many benchmarks. We believe this progress could translate to networking and propose a Network Traffic Transformer (NTT), a transformer adapted to learn network dynamics from packet traces. Our initial results are promising: NTT seems able to generalize to new prediction tasks and contexts. This study suggests there is still hope for generalization, though it calls for a lot of future research. ",

It is an open problem how best to represent and fuse information about road geometry, lane connectivity, time-varying traffic light state, and history of a dynamic set of agents and their interactions into an effective encoding. To model this diverse set of input features, many approaches proposed to design an equally complex system with a diverse set of modality specific modules. This results in systems that are difficult to scale, extend, or tune in rigorous ways to trade off quality and efficiency. In this paper, we present Wayformer, a family of attention based architectures for motion forecasting that are simple and homogeneous. Wayformer offers a compact model description consisting of an attention based scene encoder and a decoder. In the scene encoder we study the choice of early, late and hierarchical fusion of the input modalities. For each fusion type we explore strategies to tradeoff efficiency and quality via factorized attention or latent query attention. We show that early fusion, despite its simplicity of construction, is not only modality agnostic but also achieves state-of-the-art results on both Waymo Open MotionDataset (WOMD) and Argoverse leaderboards, demonstrating the effectiveness of our design philosophy ",

Specifically, for a target speaker, we design a Deep Neural Network (DNN) model to extract high-level speaker-specific but utterance-independent vocal features from his/her reference audios. When the microphone is recording, the DNN generates a shadow sound to cancel the target voice in real-time. Moreover, we modulate the audible shadow sound onto an ultrasound frequency, making it inaudible for humans. By leveraging the non-linearity of the microphone circuit, the microphone can accurately decode the shadow sound for target voice cancellation. We implement and evaluate NEC comprehensively with 8 smartphone microphones in different settings. The results show that NEC effectively mutes the target speaker at a microphone without interfering with other users' normal conversations. ",

To tackle the problem of decision-making in the presence of pedestrians, the authors introduce a framework based on Social Value Orientation and Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) that is capable of generating decision-making policies with different driving styles. The policy is trained using state-of-the-art DRL algorithms in a simulated environment. A novel computationally-efficient pedestrian model that is suitable for DRL training is also introduced. We perform experiments to validate our framework and we conduct a comparative analysis of the policies obtained with two different model-free Deep Reinforcement Learning Algorithms. Simulations results show how the developed model exhibits natural driving behaviours, such as short-stopping, to facilitate the pedestrian's crossing. ",

Recently, cluster graphs and their extensions like block graphs were given additional attention. We complement hardness results provided by other researchers for block graphs by providing approximation algorithms. In particular, we provide a $2$-approximation algorithm for identical machines and PTAS for its special case with unit time jobs. In the case of uniform machines, we analyze two cases: when the number of blocks is bounded; and when the number of blocks is arbitrary, but the number of cut-vertices is bounded and jobs are unit time processing length.

Leveraging insights from sociology and neuroscience, our proposed framework models agent relationships using the notion of Reward-Sharing Relational Networks (RSRN), where network edge weights act as a measure of how much one agent is invested in the success of (or `cares about') another. We construct relational rewards as a function of the RSRN interaction weights to collectively train the multi-agent system via a multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm. The performance of the system is tested for a 3-agent scenario with different relational network structures (e.g., self-interested, communitarian, and authoritarian networks). Our results indicate that reward-sharing relational networks can significantly influence learned behaviors. We posit that RSRN can act as a framework where different relational networks produce distinct emergent behaviors, often analogous to the intuited sociological understanding of such networks. ",

In fact, while efforts have mostly focused on optimizing the architecture of the neural network, fewer works have attempted to characterize (a) the different classes of spatial convolution operators, (b) how the choice of a particular class relates to properties of the data , and (c) its impact on the geometry of the embedding space.

Finally, we show that this aggregation operator is in fact tunable, and explicit regimes in which certain choices of operators -- and therefore, embedding geometries -- might be more appropriate. ",

    "abstract": "Recent works on machine learning for combinatorial optimization have shown that learning based approaches can outperform heuristic methods in terms of speed and performance. In this paper, we consider the problem of finding an optimal topological order on a directed acyclic graph with focus on the memory minimization problem which arises in compilers. We propose an end-to-end machine learning based approach for topological ordering using an encoder-decoder framework. Our encoder is a novel attention based graph neural network architecture called \\emph{Topoformer} which uses different topological transforms of a DAG for message passing. The node embeddings produced by the encoder are converted into node priorities which are used by the decoder to generate a probability distribution over topological orders. We train our model on a dataset of synthetically generated graphs called layered graphs. We show that our model outperforms, or is on-par, with several topological ordering baselines while being significantly faster on synthetic graphs with up to 2k nodes. We also train and test our model on a set of real-world computation graphs, showing performance improvements. ",

    "abstract": "It is known that deep neural networks (DNNs) classify an input image by paying particular attention to certain specific pixels; a graphical representation of the magnitude of attention to each pixel is called a saliency-map. Saliency-maps are used to check the validity of the classification decision basis, e.g., it is not a valid basis for classification if a DNN pays more attention to the background rather than the subject of an image. Semantic perturbations can significantly change the saliency-map. In this work, we propose the first verification method for attention robustness, i.e., the local robustness of the changes in the saliency-map against combinations of semantic perturbations. Specifically, our method determines the range of the perturbation parameters (e.g., the brightness change) that maintains the difference between the actual saliency-map change and the expected saliency-map change below a given threshold value. Our method is based on activation region traversals, focusing on the outermost robust boundary for scalability on larger DNNs. Experimental results demonstrate that our method can show the extent to which DNNs can classify with the same basis regardless of semantic perturbations and report on performance and performance factors of activation region traversals.

    "abstract": "Existing Deep-Learning-based (DL-based) Unsupervised Salient Object Detection (USOD) methods learn saliency information in images based on the prior knowledge of traditional saliency methods and pretrained deep networks. However, these methods employ a simple learning strategy to train deep networks and therefore cannot properly incorporate the \"hidden\" information of the training samples into the learning process. Moreover, appearance information, which is crucial for segmenting objects, is only used as post-process after the network training process. To address these two issues, we propose a novel appearance-guided attentive self-paced learning framework for unsupervised salient object detection. The proposed framework integrates both self-paced learning (SPL) and appearance guidance into a unified learning framework. Specifically, for the first issue, we propose an Attentive Self-Paced Learning (ASPL) paradigm that organizes the training samples in a meaningful order to excavate gradually more detailed saliency information. Our ASPL facilitates our framework capable of automatically producing soft attention weights that measure the learning difficulty of training samples in a purely self-learning way. For the second issue, we propose an Appearance Guidance Module (AGM), which formulates the local appearance contrast of each pixel as the probability of saliency boundary and finds the potential boundary of the target objects by maximizing the probability. Furthermore, we further extend our framework to other multi-modality SOD tasks by aggregating the appearance vectors of other modality data, such as depth map, thermal image or optical flow. Extensive experiments on RGB, RGB-D, RGB-T and video SOD benchmarks prove that our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance against existing USOD methods and is comparable to the latest supervised SOD methods.

    "abstract": "Collaborative filtering (CF) is a widely searched problem in recommender systems. Linear autoencoder is a kind of well-established method for CF, which estimates item-item relations through encoding user-item interactions. Despite the excellent performance of linear autoencoders, the rapidly increasing computational and storage costs caused by the growing number of items limit their scalabilities in large-scale real-world scenarios. Recently, graph-based approaches have achieved success on CF with high scalability, and have been shown to have commonalities with linear autoencoders in user-item interaction modeling. Motivated by this, we propose an efficient and scalable recommendation via item-item graph partitioning (ERGP), aiming to address the limitations of linear autoencoders. In particular, a recursive graph partitioning strategy is proposed to ensure that the item set is divided into several partitions of finite size. Linear autoencoders encode user-item interactions within partitions while preserving global information across the entire item set. This allows ERGP to have guaranteed efficiency and high scalability when the number of items increases. Experiments conducted on 3 public datasets and 3 open benchmarking datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of ERGP, which outperforms state-of-the-art models with lower training time and storage costs.

    "abstract": "In federated learning (FL), a set of participants share updates computed on their local data with an aggregator server that combines updates into a global model. However, reconciling accuracy with privacy and security is a challenge to FL. On the one hand, good updates sent by honest participants may reveal their private local information, whereas poisoned updates sent by malicious participants may compromise the model's availability and/or integrity. On the other hand, enhancing privacy via update distortion damages accuracy, whereas doing so via update aggregation damages security because it does not allow the server to filter out individual poisoned updates. To tackle the accuracy-privacy-security conflict, we propose {\\em fragmented federated learning} (FFL), in which participants randomly exchange and mix fragments of their updates before sending them to the server. To achieve privacy, we design a lightweight protocol that allows participants to privately exchange and mix encrypted fragments of their updates so that the server can neither obtain individual updates nor link them to their originators. To achieve security, we design a reputation-based defense tailored for FFL that builds trust in participants and their mixed updates based on the quality of the fragments they exchange and the mixed updates they send. Since the exchanged fragments' parameters keep their original coordinates and attackers can be neutralized, the server can correctly reconstruct a global model from the received mixed updates without accuracy loss. Experiments on four real data sets show that FFL can prevent semi-honest servers from mounting privacy attacks, can effectively counter poisoning attacks and can keep the accuracy of the global model.

    "abstract": "This paper considers the problem of estimating exposure to information in a social network. Given a piece of information (e.g., a URL of a news article on Facebook, a hashtag on Twitter), our aim is to find the fraction of people on the network who have been exposed to it. The exact value of exposure to a piece of information is determined by two features: the structure of the underlying social network and the set of people who shared the piece of information. Often, both features are not publicly available (i.e., access to the two features is limited only to the internal administrators of the platform) and difficult to be estimated from data. As a solution, we propose two methods to estimate the exposure to a piece of information in an unbiased manner: a vanilla method which is based on sampling the network uniformly and a method which non-uniformly samples the network motivated by the Friendship Paradox. We provide theoretical results which characterize the conditions (in terms of properties of the network and the piece of information) under which one method outperforms the other. Further, we outline extensions of the proposed methods to dynamic information cascades (where the exposure needs to be tracked in real-time). We demonstrate the practical feasibility of the proposed methods via experiments on multiple synthetic and real-world datasets. ",

In contrast, system identification (SysID) algorithms for generic dynamic system models seek to approximate such models using only input-output data without relying on network parameters. The objective of this paper is to investigate SysID algorithms for water quality model approximation. This research problem is challenging due to (i) complex water quality and reaction dynamics and (ii) the mismatch between the requirements of SysID algorithms and the properties of water quality dynamics. In this paper, we present the first attempt to identify water quality models in WDNs using only input-output experimental data and classical SysID methods without knowing any WDN parameters. Properties of water quality models are introduced, the ensuing challenges caused by these properties when identifying water quality models are discussed, and remedial solutions are given. Through case studies, we demonstrate the applicability of SysID algorithms, show the corresponding performance in terms of accuracy and computational time, and explore the possible factors impacting water quality model identification.

In contrast, when human programmers write programs, they frequently refer to textual resources such as code manuals, documentation, and tutorials, to explore and understand available library functionality. Inspired by this observation, we introduce DocCoder: an approach that explicitly leverages code manuals and documentation by (1) retrieving the relevant documentation given the NL intent, and (2) generating the code based on the NL intent and the retrieved documentation. Our approach is general, can be applied to any programming language, and is agnostic to the underlying neural model. We demonstrate that DocCoder consistently improves NL-to-code models: DocCoder achieves 11x higher exact match accuracy than strong baselines on a new Bash dataset tldr; on the popular Python CoNaLa benchmark, DocCoder improves over strong baselines by 1.65 BLEU.

In this paper, we propose a text-based interface for emotional style control and cross-speaker style transfer in multi-speaker TTS. We propose the bi-modal style encoder which models the semantic relationship between text description embedding and speech style embedding with a pretrained language model. To further improve cross-speaker style transfer on disjoint, multi-style datasets, we propose the novel style loss. The experimental results show that our model can generate high-quality expressive speech even in unseen style. ",

We conduct thorough ablation studies on the key components of GNN pretraining, including pretraining objectives, data splitting methods, input features, pretraining dataset scales, and GNN architectures, in deciding the accuracy of the downstream tasks. Our first important finding is, self-supervised graph pretraining do not have statistically significant advantages over non-pretraining methods in many settings. Second, although improvement can be observed with additional supervised pretraining, the improvement may diminish with richer features or more balanced data splits. Third, experimental hyper-parameters have a larger impact on accuracy of downstream tasks than the choice of pretraining tasks. We hypothesize the complexity of pretraining on molecules is insufficient, leading to less transferable knowledge for downstream tasks. ",

Embeddings have gained a lot of uptake and have been heavily used in link prediction and other downstream prediction tasks. Most approaches are evaluated on a single task or a single group of tasks to determine their overall performance. The evaluation is then assessed in terms of how well the embedding approach performs on the task at hand. Still, it is hardly evaluated (and often not even deeply understood) what information the embedding approaches are actually learning to represent. To fill this gap, we present the DLCC (Description Logic Class Constructors) benchmark, a resource to analyze embedding approaches in terms of which kinds of classes they can represent. Two gold standards are presented, one based on the real-world knowledge graph DBpedia and one synthetic gold standard. In addition, an evaluation framework is provided that implements an experiment protocol so that researchers can directly use the gold standard. To demonstrate the use of DLCC, we compare multiple embedding approaches using the gold standards. We find that many DL constructors on DBpedia are actually learned by recognizing different correlated patterns than those defined in the gold standard and that specific DL constructors, such as cardinality constraints, are particularly hard to be learned for most embedding approaches.

Through context-dependent modeling, the ambiguity in viseme-to-phoneme mapping can be refined for mask generation. The noisy representations are masked out with the noise reduction mask resulting in enhanced audio features. The enhanced audio features are fused with the visual features and taken to an encoder-decoder model composed of Conformer and Transformer for speech recognition. We show the proposed end-to-end AVSR with the V-CAFE can further improve the noise-robustness of AVSR.

Due to their invasiveness, bio-incompatibility, and high energy consumption for some applications, molecular communication (MC) has been introduced as an alternative approach, which enables promising systems for abnormality detection and localization. In this paper, we overview the MC-based abnormality detection and localization schemes. To do this, we propose a general MC system for abnormality detection and localization to encompass the most related works. The general MC-based abnormality detection and localization system consists of multiple tiers for sensing the abnormality and communication between different agents in the system. We describe different abnormality recognition methods, which can be used by the sensors to obtain information about the abnormality. Further, we describe the functional units of the sensors and different sensor features. We explain different interfaces for connecting the internal and external communication networks and generally model the sensing and communication channels. We formulate the abnormality detection and localization problem using MC systems and present a general framework for the externally-controllable localization systems. We categorize the MC-based abnormality detection schemes based on the sensor mobility, cooperative detection, and cooperative sensing/activation. We classify the localization approaches based on the sensor mobility and propulsion mechanisms. Finally, we provide the ongoing challenges and future research directions to realize and develop MC-based systems for detection and localization of the abnormality. ",

    "abstract": "Deep learning-based face recognition models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. To curb these attacks, most defense methods aim to improve the robustness of recognition models against adversarial perturbations. However, the generalization capacities of these methods are quite limited. In practice, they are still vulnerable to unseen adversarial attacks. Deep learning models are fairly robust to general perturbations, such as Gaussian noises. A straightforward approach is to inactivate the adversarial perturbations so that they can be easily handled as general perturbations. In this paper, a plug-and-play adversarial defense method, named perturbation inactivation (PIN), is proposed to inactivate adversarial perturbations for adversarial defense. We discover that the perturbations in different subspaces have different influences on the recognition model. There should be a subspace, called the immune space, in which the perturbations have fewer adverse impacts on the recognition model than in other subspaces. Hence, our method estimates the immune space and inactivates the adversarial perturbations by restricting them to this subspace. The proposed method can be generalized to unseen adversarial perturbations since it does not rely on a specific kind of adversarial attack method. This approach not only outperforms several state-of-the-art adversarial defense methods but also demonstrates a superior generalization capacity through exhaustive experiments. Moreover, the proposed method can be successfully applied to four commercial APIs without additional training, indicating that it can be easily generalized to existing face recognition systems.

    "abstract": "Great progress has been achieved in the community of autonomous driving in the past few years. As a safety-critical problem, however, anomaly detection is a huge hurdle towards a large-scale deployment of autonomous vehicles in the real world. While many approaches, such as uncertainty estimation or segmentation-based image resynthesis, are extremely promising, there is more to be explored. Especially inspired by works on anomaly detection based on image resynthesis, we propose a novel approach for anomaly detection through style transfer. We leverage generative models to map an image from its original style domain of road traffic to an arbitrary one and back to generate pixelwise anomaly scores. However, our experiments have proven our hypothesis wrong, and we were unable to produce significant results. Nevertheless, we want to share our findings, so that others can learn from our experiments. ",

    "abstract": "Voice conversion is to generate a new speech with the source content and a target voice style. In this paper, we focus on one general setting, i.e., non-parallel many-to-many voice conversion, which is close to the real-world scenario. As the name implies, non-parallel many-to-many voice conversion does not require the paired source and reference speeches and can be applied to arbitrary voice transfer. In recent years, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and other techniques such as Conditional Variational Autoencoders (CVAEs) have made considerable progress in this field. However, due to the sophistication of voice conversion, the style similarity of the converted speech is still unsatisfactory. Inspired by the inherent structure of mel-spectrogram, we propose a new voice conversion framework, i.e., Subband-based Generative Adversarial Network for Voice Conversion (SGAN-VC). SGAN-VC converts each subband content of the source speech separately by explicitly utilizing the spatial characteristics between different subbands. SGAN-VC contains one style encoder, one content encoder, and one decoder. In particular, the style encoder network is designed to learn style codes for different subbands of the target speaker. The content encoder network can capture the content information on the source speech. Finally, the decoder generates particular subband content. In addition, we propose a pitch-shift module to fine-tune the pitch of the source speaker, making the converted tone more accurate and explainable. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on VCTK Corpus and AISHELL3 datasets both qualitatively and quantitatively, whether on seen or unseen data. Furthermore, the content intelligibility of SGAN-VC on unseen data even exceeds that of StarGANv2-VC with ASR network assistance. ",

    "abstract": "Recent work by Xia et al. leveraged the continuous-limit of the classical momentum accelerated gradient descent and proposed heavy-ball neural ODEs. While this model offers computational efficiency and high utility over vanilla neural ODEs, this approach often causes the overshooting of internal dynamics, leading to unstable training of a model. Prior work addresses this issue by using ad-hoc approaches, e.g., bounding the internal dynamics using specific activation functions, but the resulting models do not satisfy the exact heavy-ball ODE. In this work, we propose adaptive momentum estimation neural ODEs (AdamNODEs) that adaptively control the acceleration of the classical momentum-based approach. We find that its adjoint states also satisfy AdamODE and do not require ad-hoc solutions that the prior work employs. In evaluation, we show that AdamNODEs achieve the lowest training loss and efficacy over existing neural ODEs. We also show that AdamNODEs have better training stability than classical momentum-based neural ODEs. This result sheds some light on adapting the techniques proposed in the optimization community to improving the training and inference of neural ODEs further.

    "abstract": "Traffic sign detection is a vital task in the visual system of self-driving cars and the automated driving system. Recently, novel Transformer-based models have achieved encouraging results for various computer vision tasks. We still observed that vanilla ViT could not yield satisfactory results in traffic sign detection because the overall size of the datasets is very small and the class distribution of traffic signs is extremely unbalanced. To overcome this problem, a novel Pyramid Transformer with locality mechanisms is proposed in this paper. Specifically, Pyramid Transformer has several spatial pyramid reduction layers to shrink and embed the input image into tokens with rich multi-scale context by using atrous convolutions. Moreover, it inherits an intrinsic scale invariance inductive bias and is able to learn local feature representation for objects at various scales, thereby enhancing the network robustness against the size discrepancy of traffic signs. The experiments are conducted on the German Traffic Sign Detection Benchmark (GTSDB). The results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed model in the traffic sign detection tasks. More specifically, Pyramid Transformer achieves 75.6% mAP in GTSDB when applied to the Cascade RCNN as the backbone and surpassing most well-known and widely used SOTAs. ",

Specifically, we extend the idea of slimmable networks to a discriminative SSL paradigm, by integrating SSL and knowledge distillation gracefully.

    "abstract": "Deep learning models memorize training data, which hurts their ability to generalize to under-represented classes. We empirically study a convolutional neural network's internal representation of imbalanced image data and measure the generalization gap between a model's feature embeddings in the training and test sets, showing that the gap is wider for minority classes. This insight enables us to design an efficient three-phase CNN training framework for imbalanced data. The framework involves training the network end-to-end on imbalanced data to learn accurate feature embeddings, performing data augmentation in the learned embedded space to balance the train distribution, and fine-tuning the classifier head on the embedded balanced training data. We propose Expansive Over-Sampling (EOS) as a data augmentation technique to utilize in the training framework. EOS forms synthetic training instances as convex combinations between the minority class samples and their nearest enemies in the embedded space to reduce the generalization gap. The proposed framework improves the accuracy over leading cost-sensitive and resampling methods commonly used in imbalanced learning. Moreover, it is more computationally efficient than standard data pre-processing methods, such as SMOTE and GAN-based oversampling, as it requires fewer parameters and less training time. ",

    "abstract": "In this work, we for the first time present a method for detecting label errors in image datasets with semantic segmentation, i.e., pixel-wise class labels. Annotation acquisition for semantic segmentation datasets is time-consuming and requires plenty of human labor. In particular, review processes are time consuming and label errors can easily be overlooked by humans. The consequences are biased benchmarks and in extreme cases also performance degradation of deep neural networks (DNNs) trained on such datasets. DNNs for semantic segmentation yield pixel-wise predictions, which makes detection of label errors via uncertainty quantification a complex task. Uncertainty is particularly pronounced at the transitions between connected components of the prediction. By lifting the consideration of uncertainty to the level of predicted components, we enable the usage of DNNs together with component-level uncertainty quantification for the detection of label errors. We present a principled approach to benchmarking the task of label error detection by dropping labels from the Cityscapes dataset as well from a dataset extracted from the CARLA driving simulator, where in the latter case we have the labels under control. Our experiments show that our approach is able to detect the vast majority of label errors while controlling the number of false label error detections. Furthermore, we apply our method to semantic segmentation datasets frequently used by the computer vision community and present a collection of label errors along with sample statistics. ",

Leveraging strong resilience and security properties provided by the path-aware SCION networking architecture, the presented design can be implemented as a backward compatible active standby solution for existing time synchronization deployments. Through extensive evaluation, we demonstrate that over 94% of time servers reliably minimize the offset of their local clocks to real-time in the presence of up to 20% malicious nodes, and all time servers remain synchronized with a skew of only 2 ms even after one year of reference clock outage.

In existing solutions, such optimization is carried out from scratch for any new traffic configuration, often by means of conventional reinforcement learning (RL). In this paper, we propose the use of continual meta-RL as a means to transfer information from previously experienced traffic configurations to new conditions, with the goal of reducing the time needed to optimize the UABS's policy.

However, the traditional method of using a single sensor is inevitably limited by the performance of the sensor. Therefore, a precision and robust method for fusing the LiDAR and stereo cameras is proposed. This method fully combines the advantages of the LiDAR and stereo camera, which can retain the advantages of the high precision of the LiDAR and the high resolution of images respectively. Compared with the traditional stereo matching method, the texture of the object and lighting conditions have less influence on the algorithm. Firstly, the depth of the LiDAR data is converted to the disparity of the stereo camera. Because the density of the LiDAR data is relatively sparse on the y-axis, the converted disparity map is up-sampled using the interpolation method. Secondly, in order to make full use of the precise disparity map, the disparity map and stereo matching are fused to propagate the accurate disparity. Finally, the disparity map is converted to the depth map. Moreover, the converted disparity map can also increase the speed of the algorithm. We evaluate the proposed pipeline on the KITTI benchmark. The experiment demonstrates that our algorithm has higher accuracy than several classic methods. ",

Despite significant efforts, both practical and theoretical, training deep learning models robust to adversarial attacks is still an open problem. In this paper, we analyse the geometry of adversarial attacks in the large-data, overparameterized limit for Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs). We show that, in the limit, vulnerability to gradient-based attacks arises as a result of degeneracy in the data distribution, i.e., when the data lies on a lower-dimensional submanifold of the ambient space. As a direct consequence, we demonstrate that in this limit BNN posteriors are robust to gradient-based adversarial attacks. Crucially, we prove that the expected gradient of the loss with respect to the BNN posterior distribution is vanishing, even when each neural network sampled from the posterior is vulnerable to gradient-based attacks. Experimental results on the MNIST, Fashion MNIST, and half moons datasets, representing the finite data regime, with BNNs trained with Hamiltonian Monte Carlo and Variational Inference, support this line of arguments, showing that BNNs can display both high accuracy on clean data and robustness to both gradient-based and gradient-free based adversarial attacks.

Two mainstream unsupervised learning schemes are the instance-level contrastive framework and clustering-based schemes. The former adopts the extremely fine-grained instance-level discrimination whose supervisory signal is not efficient due to the false negatives. Though the latter solves this, they commonly come with some restrictions affecting the performance. To integrate their advantages, we design the SMoG method. SMoG follows the framework of contrastive learning but replaces the contrastive unit from instance to group, mimicking clustering-based methods. To achieve this, we propose the momentum grouping scheme which synchronously conducts feature grouping with representation learning. In this way, SMoG solves the problem of supervisory signal hysteresis which the clustering-based method usually faces, and reduces the false negatives of instance contrastive methods. We conduct exhaustive experiments to show that SMoG works well on both CNN and Transformer backbones. Results prove that SMoG has surpassed the current SOTA unsupervised representation learning methods. Moreover, its linear evaluation results surpass the performances obtained by vanilla supervised learning and the representation can be well transferred to downstream tasks. ",

The appropriate CCTA Vessel-level Image Quality Assessment (CCTA VIQA) algorithm can be used to reduce the risk of error diagnosis. The primary challenges of CCTA VIQA are that the local part of coronary that determines final quality is hard to locate. To tackle the challenge, we formulate CCTA VIQA as a multiple-instance learning (MIL) problem, and exploit Transformer-based MIL backbone (termed as T-MIL) to aggregate the multiple instances along the coronary centerline into the final quality. However, not all instances are informative for final quality. There are some quality-irrelevant/negative instances intervening the exact quality assessment(e.g., instances covering only background or the coronary in instances is not identifiable). Therefore, we propose a Progressive Reinforcement learning based Instance Discarding module (termed as PRID) to progressively remove quality-irrelevant/negative instances for CCTA VIQA. Based on the above two modules, we propose a Reinforced Transformer Network (RTN) for automatic CCTA VIQA based on end-to-end optimization. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method achieves the state-of-the-art performance on the real-world CCTA dataset, exceeding previous MIL methods by a large margin. ",

In contrast, hand-crafted heuristics perform highly effective search well and exploit the computation time given to them, but contain heuristics that are difficult to adapt to a dataset being solved. With the goal of providing a powerful search procedure to neural CO approaches, we propose simulation-guided beam search (SGBS), which examines candidate solutions within a fixed-width tree search that both a neural net-learned policy and a simulation (rollout) identify as promising. We further hybridize SGBS with efficient active search (EAS), where SGBS enhances the quality of solutions backpropagated in EAS, and EAS improves the quality of the policy used in SGBS. We evaluate our methods on well-known CO benchmarks and show that SGBS significantly improves the quality of the solutions found under reasonable runtime assumptions. ",

To mitigate this issue, we propose a Robust Detector (RobustDet) based on adversarially-aware convolution to disentangle gradients for model learning on clean and adversarial images. RobustDet also employs the Adversarial Image Discriminator (AID) and Consistent Features with Reconstruction (CFR) to ensure a reliable robustness.

This question can be formally stated as a property of the centrality measure that defines the importance of the actors of the network. Score monotonicity means that adding an arc increases the centrality score of the target of the arc; rank monotonicity means that adding an arc improves the importance of the target of the arc relatively to the remaining nodes. It is known that most centralities are both score and rank monotone on directed, strongly connected graphs. In this paper, we study the problem of score and rank monotonicity for classical centrality measures in the case of undirected networks: in this case, we require that score, or relative importance, improve at both endpoints of the new edge. We show that, surprisingly, the situation in the undirected case is very different, and in particular that closeness, harmonic centrality, betweenness, eigenvector centrality, Seeley's index, Katz's index, and PageRank are not rank monotone; betweenness and PageRank are not even score monotone. In other words, while it is always a good thing to get a new follower, it is not always beneficial to get a new friend. ",

    "title": "Collaboration-Aware Graph Convolutional Networks for Recommendation  Systems",
    "abstract": "By virtue of the message-passing that implicitly injects collaborative effect into the embedding process, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been successfully adopted in recommendation systems. Nevertheless, most of existing message-passing mechanisms in recommendation are directly inherited from GNNs without any recommendation-tailored modification. Although some efforts have been made towards simplifying GNNs to improve the performance/efficiency of recommendation, no study has comprehensively scrutinized how message-passing captures collaborative effect and whether the captured effect would benefit the prediction of user preferences over items. Therefore, in this work we aim to demystify the collaborative effect captured by message-passing in GNNs and develop new insights towards customizing message-passing for recommendation. First, we theoretically analyze how message-passing captures and leverages the collaborative effect in predicting user preferences. Then, to determine whether the captured collaborative effect would benefit the prediction of user preferences, we propose a recommendation-oriented topological metric, Common Interacted Ratio (CIR), which measures the level of interaction between a specific neighbor of a node with the rest of its neighborhood set. Inspired by our theoretical and empirical analysis, we propose a recommendation-tailored GNN, Augmented Collaboration-Aware Graph Convolutional Network (CAGCN*), that extends upon the LightGCN framework and is able to selectively pass information of neighbors based on their CIR via the Collaboration-Aware Graph Convolution. Experimental results on six benchmark datasets show that CAGCN* outperforms the most representative GNN-based recommendation model, LightGCN, by 9% in Recall@20 and also achieves more than 79% speedup.

    "abstract": "Timeliness and contextual accuracy of recommendations are increasingly important when delivering contemporary digital marketing experiences. Conventional recommender systems (RS) suggest relevant but time-invariant items to users by accounting for their past purchases. These recommendations only map to customers' general preferences rather than a customer's specific needs immediately preceding a purchase. In contrast, RSs that consider the order of transactions, purchases, or experiences to measure evolving preferences can offer more salient and effective recommendations to customers: Sequential RSs not only benefit from a better behavioral understanding of a user's current needs but also better predictive power. In this paper, we demonstrate and rank the effectiveness of a sequential recommendation system by utilizing a production dataset of over 2.7 million credit card transactions for 46K cardholders. The method first employs an autoencoder on raw transaction data and submits observed transaction encodings to a GRU-based sequential model. The sequential model produces a MAP@1 metric of 47% on the out-of-sample test set, in line with existing research. We also discuss implications for embedding real-time predictions using the sequential RS into Nexus, a scalable, low-latency, event-based digital experience architecture. ",

To determine the appropriate approach needs the data engineering in order to get the behavior associated with the data. Each social network has the resources and the information source, but the relationship between resources and information sources requires explanation. This paper aimed to address the behavior of the resource as a part of social network analysis (SNA) in the growth of social networks by using the statistical calculations to explain the evolutionary mechanisms. To represent the analysis unit of the SNA, this paper only considers the degree of a vertex, where it is the core of all the analysis in the SNA and it is basic for defining the relation between resources and SNA in SNM. There is a strong effect on the growth of the resources of social networks. In total, the behavior of resources has positive effects. Thus, different information sources behave similarly and have relations with SNA. ",

Here we investigate the tasks of inferring and predicting participant behavior, in terms of motion paths and actions, under such conditions. We narrow the problem to that of estimating how a set target participants react to the behavior of other observed participants. Our key idea is to model the spatio-temporal relations among participants in a manner that is robust to error accumulation during frame-wise inference and prediction. We propose a novel Entry-Flipped Transformer (EF-Transformer), which models the relations of participants by attention mechanisms on both spatial and temporal domains. Unlike typical transformers, we tackle the problem of error accumulation by flipping the order of query, key, and value entries, to increase the importance and fidelity of observed features in the current frame. Comparative experiments show that our EF-Transformer achieves the best performance on a newly-collected tennis doubles dataset, a Ceilidh dance dataset, and two pedestrian datasets. Furthermore, it is also demonstrated that our EF-Transformer is better at limiting accumulated errors and recovering from wrong estimations. ",

    "abstract": "The application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) to cybersecurity challenges has gained traction in industry and academia, partially as a result of widespread malware attacks on critical systems such as cloud infrastructures and government institutions. Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS), using some forms of AI, have received widespread adoption due to their ability to handle vast amounts of data with a high prediction accuracy. These systems are hosted in the organizational Cyber Security Operation Center (CSoC) as a defense tool to monitor and detect malicious network flow that would otherwise impact the Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability (CIA). CSoC analysts rely on these systems to make decisions about the detected threats. However, IDSs designed using Deep Learning (DL) techniques are often treated as black box models and do not provide a justification for their predictions. This creates a barrier for CSoC analysts, as they are unable to improve their decisions based on the model's predictions. One solution to this problem is to design explainable IDS (X-IDS). This survey reviews the state-of-the-art in explainable AI (XAI) for IDS, its current challenges, and discusses how these challenges span to the design of an X-IDS. In particular, we discuss black box and white box approaches comprehensively. We also present the tradeoff between these approaches in terms of their performance and ability to produce explanations. Furthermore, we propose a generic architecture that considers human-in-the-loop which can be used as a guideline when designing an X-IDS. Research recommendations are given from three critical viewpoints: the need to define explainability for IDS, the need to create explanations tailored to various stakeholders, and the need to design metrics to evaluate explanations.

    "abstract": "We consider the fundamental problem of clock synchronization in a synchronous multi-agent system. Each agent holds a clock with an arbitrary initial value, and clocks must eventually indicate the same value. Previous algorithms worked in static networks with drastic connectivity properties and assumed that global information is available at each agent. In this paper, we propose different solutions for time-varying topologies that require neither strong connectivity nor any global knowledge on the network. First, we study the case of unbounded clocks, and propose a self-stabilizing $MinMax$ algorithm that works if, in each sufficiently long but bounded period of time, there is an agent, called a root, that can send messages, possibly indirectly, to all other agents. Such networks are highly dynamic in the sense that roots may change arbitrarily over time. Moreover, the bound on the time required for achieving this rootedness property is unknown to the agents. Then we present a finite-state algorithm that synchronizes periodic clocks in dynamic networks that are strongly connected over bounded period of time. Here also, the bound on the time for achieving strong connectivity exists, but is not supposed to be known. Interestingly, our algorithm unifies several seemingly different algorithms proposed previously for static networks. Next, we show that strong connectivity is actually not required: our algorithm still works when the network is just rooted over bounded period of time with a set of roots that becomes stable. Finally, we study the time and space complexities of our algorithms, and discuss how initial timing information allows for more efficient solutions. ",

    "abstract": "Mental health disorders may cause severe consequences on all the countries' economies and health. For example, the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, such as isolation and travel ban, can make us feel depressed. Identifying early signs of mental health disorders is vital. For example, depression may increase an individual's risk of suicide. The state-of-the-art research in identifying mental disorder patterns from textual data, uses hand-labelled training sets, especially when a domain expert's knowledge is required to analyse various symptoms. This task could be time-consuming and expensive. To address this challenge, in this paper, we study and analyse the various clinical and non-clinical approaches to identifying mental health disorders. We leverage the domain knowledge and expertise in cognitive science to build a domain-specific Knowledge Base (KB) for the mental health disorder concepts and patterns. We present a weaker form of supervision by facilitating the generating of training data from a domain-specific Knowledge Base (KB). We adopt a typical scenario for analysing social media to identify major depressive disorder symptoms from the textual content generated by social users. We use this scenario to evaluate how our knowledge-based approach significantly improves the quality of results. ",

CL models can benefit from self-supervised pre-training as it enables learning more generalizable task-agnostic features. However, the effect of self-supervised pre-training diminishes as the length of task sequences increases. Furthermore, the domain shift between pre-training data distribution and the task distribution reduces the generalizability of the learned representations. To address these limitations, we propose Task Agnostic Representation Consolidation (TARC), a two-stage training paradigm for CL that intertwines task-agnostic and task-specific learning whereby self-supervised training is followed by supervised learning for each task. To further restrict the deviation from the learned representations in the self-supervised stage, we employ a task-agnostic auxiliary loss during the supervised stage. We show that our training paradigm can be easily added to memory- or regularization-based approaches and provides consistent performance gain across more challenging CL settings. We further show that it leads to more robust and well-calibrated models. ",

    "abstract": "In recent years, machine learning algorithms have become ubiquitous in a multitude of high-stakes decision-making applications. The unparalleled ability of machine learning algorithms to learn patterns from data also enables them to incorporate biases embedded within. A biased model can then make decisions that disproportionately harm certain groups in society -- limiting their access to financial services, for example. The awareness of this problem has given rise to the field of Fair ML, which focuses on studying, measuring, and mitigating unfairness in algorithmic prediction, with respect to a set of protected groups (e.g., race or gender). However, the underlying causes for algorithmic unfairness still remain elusive, with researchers divided between blaming either the ML algorithms or the data they are trained on. In this work, we maintain that algorithmic unfairness stems from interactions between models and biases in the data, rather than from isolated contributions of either of them. To this end, we propose a taxonomy to characterize data bias and we study a set of hypotheses regarding the fairness-accuracy trade-offs that fairness-blind ML algorithms exhibit under different data bias settings. On our real-world account-opening fraud use case, we find that each setting entails specific trade-offs, affecting fairness in expected value and variance -- the latter often going unnoticed. Moreover, we show how algorithms compare differently in terms of accuracy and fairness, depending on the biases affecting the data. Finally, we note that under specific data bias conditions, simple pre-processing interventions can successfully balance group-wise error rates, while the same techniques fail in more complex settings.

    "abstract": "Quantization is one of the most applied Deep Neural Network (DNN) compression strategies, when deploying a trained DNN model on an embedded system or a cell phone. This is owing to its simplicity and adaptability to a wide range of applications and circumstances, as opposed to specific Artificial Intelligence (AI) accelerators and compilers that are often designed only for certain specific hardware (e.g., Google Coral Edge TPU). With the growing demand for quantization, ensuring the reliability of this strategy is becoming a critical challenge. Traditional testing methods, which gather more and more genuine data for better assessment, are often not practical because of the large size of the input space and the high similarity between the original DNN and its quantized counterpart. As a result, advanced assessment strategies have become of paramount importance. In this paper, we present DiverGet, a search-based testing framework for quantization assessment. DiverGet defines a space of metamorphic relations that simulate naturally-occurring distortions on the inputs. Then, it optimally explores these relations to reveal the disagreements among DNNs of different arithmetic precision. We evaluate the performance of DiverGet on state-of-the-art DNNs applied to hyperspectral remote sensing images. We chose the remote sensing DNNs as they're being increasingly deployed at the edge (e.g., high-lift drones) in critical domains like climate change research and astronomy. Our results show that DiverGet successfully challenges the robustness of established quantization techniques against naturally-occurring shifted data, and outperforms its most recent concurrent, DiffChaser, with a success rate that is (on average) four times higher.

In this work, we propose to use level sets of signed distance functions (SDFs) to represent cell shapes. We optimize a neural network as an implicit neural representation of the SDF value at any point in a 3D+time domain. The model is conditioned on a latent code, thus allowing the synthesis of new and unseen shape sequences. We validate our approach quantitatively and qualitatively on C. elegans cells that grow and divide, and lung cancer cells with growing complex filopodial protrusions. Our results show that shape descriptors of synthetic cells resemble those of real cells, and that our model is able to generate topologically plausible sequences of complex cell shapes in 3D+time. ",

    "abstract": "5G radio access network (RAN) is consuming much more energy than legacy RAN due to the denser deployments of gNodeBs (gNBs) and higher single-gNB power consumption. In an effort to achieve an energy-conserving RAN, this paper develops a dynamic on-off switching paradigm, where the ON/OFF states of gNBs can be dynamically configured according to the evolvements of the associated users. We formulate the dynamic sleep control for a cluster of gNBs as a Markov decision process (MDP) and analyze various switching policies to reduce the energy expenditure. The optimal policy of the MDP that minimizes the energy expenditure can be derived from dynamic programming, but the computation is expensive. To circumvent this issue, this paper puts forth a greedy policy and an index policy for gNB sleep control. When there is no constraint on the number of gNBs that can be turned off, we prove the dual-threshold structure of the greedy policy and analyze its connections with the optimal policy. Inspired by the dual-threshold structure and Whittle index, we develop an index policy by decoupling the original MDP into multiple one-dimensional MDPs -- the indexability of the decoupled MDP is proven and an algorithm to compute the index is proposed. Extensive simulation results verify that the index policy exhibits close-to-optimal performance in terms of the energy expenditure of the gNB cluster. As far as the computational complexity is concerned, on the other hand, the index policy is much more efficient than the optimal policy, which is computationally prohibitive when the number of gNBs is large.

Based on this observation, we propose a dual-path Symmetry-Aware Transformer-based mirror detection Network (SATNet), which includes two novel modules: Symmetry-Aware Attention Module (SAAM) and Contrast and Fusion Decoder Module (CFDM). Specifically, we first introduce the transformer backbone to model global information aggregation in images, extracting multi-scale features in two paths. We then feed the high-level dual-path features to SAAMs to capture the symmetry relations. Finally, we fuse the dual-path features and refine our prediction maps progressively with CFDMs to obtain the final mirror mask.

    "abstract": "In order to promote the use of machine learning in 5G, the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) proposed in 2021 the second edition of the ITU AI/ML in 5G challenge, with over 1600 participants from 82 countries. This work details the second place solution overall, which is also the winning solution of the Graph Neural Networking Challenge 2021. We tackle the problem of generalization when applying a model to a 5G network that may have longer paths and larger link capacities than the ones observed in training. To achieve this, we propose to first extract robust features related to Queueing Theory (QT), and then fine-tune the analytical baseline prediction using a modification of the Routenet Graph Neural Network (GNN) model. The proposed solution generalizes much better than simply using Routenet, and manages to reduce the analytical baseline's 10.42 mean absolute percent error to 1.45 (1.27 with an ensemble). This suggests that making small changes to an approximate model that is known to be robust can be an effective way to improve accuracy without compromising generalization. ",

    "title": "Learning robust marking policies for adaptive mesh refinement",
    "abstract": "In this work, we revisit the marking decisions made in the standard adaptive finite element method (AFEM). Experience shows that a na\\\"{i}ve marking policy leads to inefficient use of computational resources for adaptive mesh refinement (AMR). Consequently, using AFEM in practice often involves ad-hoc or time-consuming offline parameter tuning to set appropriate parameters for the marking subroutine. To address these practical concerns, we recast AMR as a Markov decision process in which refinement parameters can be selected on-the-fly at run time, without the need for pre-tuning by expert users. In this new paradigm, the refinement parameters are also chosen adaptively via a marking policy that can be optimized using methods from reinforcement learning. We use the Poisson equation to demonstrate our techniques on $h$- and $hp$-refinement benchmark problems, and our experiments suggest that superior marking policies remain undiscovered for many classical AFEM applications. Furthermore, an unexpected observation from this work is that marking policies trained on one family of PDEs are sometimes robust enough to perform well on problems far outside the training family. For illustration, we show that a simple $hp$-refinement policy trained on 2D domains with only a single re-entrant corner can be deployed on far more complicated 2D domains, and even 3D domains, without significant performance loss. For reproduction and broader adoption, we accompany this work with an open-source implementation of our methods. ",

For neural networks, even when centralized SGD easily finds a solution that is simultaneously performant for all clients, current federated optimization methods fail to converge to a comparable solution. We show that this performance disparity can largely be attributed to optimization challenges presented by nonconvexity. Specifically, we find that the early layers of the network do learn useful features, but the final layers fail to make use of them. That is, federated optimization applied to this non-convex problem distorts the learning of the final layers. Leveraging this observation, we propose a Train-Convexify-Train (TCT) procedure to sidestep this issue: first, learn features using off-the-shelf methods (e.g., FedAvg); then, optimize a convexified problem obtained from the network's empirical neural tangent kernel approximation. Our technique yields accuracy improvements of up to +36% on FMNIST and +37% on CIFAR10 when clients have dissimilar data. ",

In this scenario, high levels of polyphony, as in the number of overlapping sound sources, are prone to happen resulting in a complex acoustic outcome. Sound Event Detection (SED) tasks analyze acoustic scenarios in order to identify the occurring events and their respective temporal information. However, highly dense scenarios can be hard to process and have not been studied in depth. Here we show, using a Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network (CRNN), how birdsong polyphonic scenarios can be detected when dealing with higher polyphony and how effectively this type of model can face a very dense scene with up to 10 overlapping birds. We found that models trained with denser examples (i.e., higher polyphony) learn at a similar rate as models that used simpler samples in their training set. Additionally, the model trained with the densest samples maintained a consistent score for all polyphonies, while the model trained with the least dense samples degraded as the polyphony increased. Our results demonstrate that highly dense acoustic scenarios can be dealt with using CRNNs. We expect that this study serves as a starting point for working on highly populated bird scenarios such as dawn chorus or other dense acoustic problems. ",

In particular, the model is evaluated on two large-scale and challenging datasets: KITTI Vision Benchmark and Cityscapes dataset and achieve the best performance in terms of relative error.

The growth of COVID-19 cases, especially in Indonesia, can be predicted using several approaches, such as the Deep Neural Network (DNN). One of the DNN models that can be used is Deep Transformer which can predict time series. The model is trained with several test scenarios to get the best model.

Based on the results of the evaluations, Deep Transformer produces the best results when using the Pre-Layer Normalization and predicting one day ahead with a MAPE value of 18.83.

As such, it poses numerous ethical, legal, and social implications (ELSI) for researchers and policy makers. Various efforts to ensure socially responsible synthetic biology are underway. Policy making is one regulatory avenue, and other initiatives have sought to embed social scientists and ethicists on synthetic biology projects. However, given the nascency of synthetic biology, the number of heterogeneous domains it spans, and the open nature of many ethical questions, it has proven challenging to establish widespread concrete policies, and including social scientists and ethicists on synthetic biology teams has met with mixed success. This text proposes a different approach, asking instead is it possible to develop a well-performing recommender model based upon natural language processing (NLP) to connect synthetic biologists with information on the ELSI of their specific research? This recommender was developed as part of a larger project building a Synthetic Biology Knowledge System (SBKS) to accelerate discovery and exploration of the synthetic biology design space.

We focus on the organic mud, or \"scum\" that accumulates on the river's surface and gives it its peculiar odor and external economic effects on the landscape. Because of its feature of a sparsely distributed and unstable pattern of organic shape, automating the monitoring has proved difficult. We propose a patch classification pipeline to detect scum features on the river surface using mixture image augmentation to increase the diversity between the scum floating on the river and the entangled background on the river surface reflected by nearby structures like buildings, bridges, poles, and barriers. Furthermore, we propose a scum index covered on rivers to help monitor worse grade online, collecting floating scum and deciding on chemical treatment policies. Finally, we show how to use our method on a time series dataset with frames every ten minutes recording river scum events over several days. We discuss the value of our pipeline and its experimental findings. ",

Since the CM model corresponds to a more challenging optimisation problem, we propose four numerical algorithms that leverage the problem structure, each with different trade-offs between computational cost and convergence guarantees. These algorithms are evaluated on synthetic data to provide some intuition of their performance. We also provide strong (but partial) analytical results to facilitate efficient solution of the CM problem, which call for the introduction of a new concept: optimal zonal stack curves, and these results are used to devise one of the four solution algorithms. An evaluation of the CM and SWM models and their comparison is performed, under the assumption of truthful bidding, on the real world data of Central Western European Day Ahead Power Market during the period of 2019-2020. We show that the SWM model we introduce gives a good representation of the historical time series of the real prices. Further, the CM reduces the market power of producers, as generally this results in decreased zonal prices and always decreases the total cost of electricity procurement when compared to the currently employed SWM.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we address the challenging problem of 3D concept grounding (i.e. segmenting and learning visual concepts) by looking at RGBD images and reasoning about paired questions and answers. Existing visual reasoning approaches typically utilize supervised methods to extract 2D segmentation masks on which concepts are grounded. In contrast, humans are capable of grounding concepts on the underlying 3D representation of images. However, traditionally inferred 3D representations (e.g., point clouds, voxelgrids, and meshes) cannot capture continuous 3D features flexibly, thus making it challenging to ground concepts to 3D regions based on the language description of the object being referred to. To address both issues, we propose to leverage the continuous, differentiable nature of neural fields to segment and learn concepts. Specifically, each 3D coordinate in a scene is represented as a high-dimensional descriptor. Concept grounding can then be performed by computing the similarity between the descriptor vector of a 3D coordinate and the vector embedding of a language concept, which enables segmentations and concept learning to be jointly learned on neural fields in a differentiable fashion. As a result, both 3D semantic and instance segmentations can emerge directly from question answering supervision using a set of defined neural operators on top of neural fields (e.g., filtering and counting). Experimental results show that our proposed framework outperforms unsupervised/language-mediated segmentation models on semantic and instance segmentation tasks, as well as outperforms existing models on the challenging 3D aware visual reasoning tasks. Furthermore, our framework can generalize well to unseen shape categories and real scans. ",

One open problem in the field is what should drive the choice of the adopted mathematical framework to describe higher-order networks starting from data of higher-order interactions. Unweighted simplicial complexes typically involve a loss of information of the data, though having the benefit to capture the higher-order topology of the data. In this work we show that weighted simplicial complexes allow to circumvent all the limitations of unweighted simplicial complexes to represent higher-order interactions. In particular, weighted simplicial complexes can represent higher-order networks without loss of information, allowing at the same time to capture the weighted topology of the data. The higher-order topology is probed by studying the spectral properties of suitably defined weighted Hodge Laplacians displaying a normalized spectrum. The higher-order spectrum of (weighted) normalized Hodge Laplacians is here studied combining cohomology theory with information theory. In the proposed framework, we quantify and compare the information content of higher-order spectra of different dimension using higher-order spectral entropies and spectral relative entropies. The proposed methodology is tested on real higher-order collaboration networks and on the weighted version of the simplicial complex model \"Network Geometry with Flavor\". ",

However, reducing an aspect of a complex image to a single, meaningful number is challenging. Thus, methods for calculating retinal traits tend to be complex, multi-step pipelines that can only be applied to high quality images. This means that researchers often have to discard substantial portions of the available data. We hypothesise that such pipelines can be approximated with a single, simpler step that can be made robust to common quality issues. We propose Deep Approximation of Retinal Traits (DART) where a deep neural network is used predict the output of an existing pipeline on high quality images from synthetically degraded versions of these images. We demonstrate DART on retinal Fractal Dimension (FD) calculated by VAMPIRE, using retinal images from UK Biobank that previous work identified as high quality. Our method shows very high agreement with FD VAMPIRE on unseen test images (Pearson r=0.9572). Even when those images are severely degraded, DART can still recover an FD estimate that shows good agreement with FD VAMPIRE obtained from the original images (Pearson r=0.8817). This suggests that our method could enable researchers to discard fewer images in the future. Our method can compute FD for over 1,000img/s using a single GPU. We consider these to be very encouraging initial results and hope to develop this approach into a useful tool for retinal analysis. ",

However, most existing video codecs directly use the ready-made entropy model from image codec to encode the residual or motion, and do not fully leverage the spatial-temporal characteristics in video. To this end, this paper proposes a powerful entropy model which efficiently captures both spatial and temporal dependencies. In particular, we introduce the latent prior which exploits the correlation among the latent representation to squeeze the temporal redundancy. Meanwhile, the dual spatial prior is proposed to reduce the spatial redundancy in a parallel-friendly manner. In addition, our entropy model is also versatile. Besides estimating the probability distribution, our entropy model also generates the quantization step at spatial-channel-wise. This content-adaptive quantization mechanism not only helps our codec achieve the smooth rate adjustment in single model but also improves the final rate-distortion performance by dynamic bit allocation. Experimental results show that, powered by the proposed entropy model, our neural codec can achieve 18.2% bitrate saving on UVG dataset when compared with H.266 (VTM) using the highest compression ratio configuration. It makes a new milestone in the development of neural video codec. The codes are at https://github.com/microsoft/DCVC. ",

In the proposed study, we first use the Lucas-Kanade pyramidal optical flow algorithm to perform deformable image registration of chest computed tomography scan images of four patients with lung cancer. We then track three internal points close to the lung tumor based on the previously computed deformation field and predict their position with a recurrent neural network (RNN) trained using real-time recurrent learning (RTRL) and gradient clipping. The breathing data is quite regular, sampled at approximately 2.5Hz, and includes artificial drift in the spine direction. The amplitude of the motion of the tracked points ranged from 12.0mm to 22.7mm. Finally, we propose a simple method for recovering and predicting 3D tumor images from the tracked points and the initial tumor image based on a linear correspondence model and Nadaraya-Watson non-linear regression. The root-mean-square error, maximum error, and jitter corresponding to the RNN prediction on the test set were smaller than the same performance measures obtained with linear prediction and least mean squares (LMS). In particular, the maximum prediction error associated with the RNN, equal to 1.51mm, is respectively 16.1% and 5.0% lower than the maximum error associated with linear prediction and LMS. The average prediction time per time step with RTRL is equal to 119ms, which is less than the 400ms marker position sampling time. The tumor position in the predicted images appears visually correct, which is confirmed by the high mean cross-correlation between the original and predicted images, equal to 0.955. ",

    "abstract": "Given an image of a white shoe drawn on a blackboard, how are the white pixels deemed (say by human minds) to be informative for recognizing the shoe without any labeling information on the pixels? Here we investigate such a \"white shoe\" recognition problem from the perspective of tensor network (TN) machine learning and quantum entanglement. Utilizing a generative TN that captures the probability distribution of the features as quantum amplitudes, we propose an unsupervised recognition scheme of informative features with the variations of entanglement entropy (EE) caused by designed measurements. In this way, a given sample, where the values of its features are statistically meaningless, is mapped to the variations of EE that are statistically meaningful. We show that the EE variations identify the features that are critical to recognize this specific sample, and the EE itself reveals the information distribution from the TN model. The signs of the variations further reveal the entanglement structures among the features. We test the validity of our scheme on a toy dataset of strip images, the MNIST dataset of hand-drawn digits, and the fashion-MNIST dataset of the pictures of fashion articles. Our scheme opens the avenue to the quantum-inspired and interpreted unsupervised learning and could be applied to, e.g., image segmentation and object detection. ",

Many researchers are using supervised, semi-supervised, and unsupervised Machine Learning models to reduce the positioning error and offer reliable solutions to the end-users. In this article, we propose a new architecture by combining Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Long short-term memory (LSTM) and Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) in order to increase the training data and thus improve the position accuracy. The proposed combination of supervised and unsupervised models was tested in 17 public datasets, providing an extensive analysis of its performance. As a result, the positioning error has been reduced in more than 70% of them. ",

    "abstract": "One aim of representation learning is to recover the original latent code that generated the data, a task which requires additional information or inductive biases. A recently proposed approach termed Independent Mechanism Analysis (IMA) postulates that each latent source should influence the observed mixtures independently, complementing standard nonlinear independent component analysis, and taking inspiration from the principle of independent causal mechanisms. While it was shown in theory and experiments that IMA helps recovering the true latents, the method's performance was so far only characterized when the modeling assumptions are exactly satisfied. Here, we test the method's robustness to violations of the underlying assumptions. We find that the benefits of IMA-based regularization for recovering the true sources extend to mixing functions with various degrees of violation of the IMA principle, while standard regularizers do not provide the same merits. Moreover, we show that unregularized maximum likelihood recovers mixing functions which systematically deviate from the IMA principle, and provide an argument elucidating the benefits of IMA-based regularization.

    "abstract": "Recently, large, high-quality public datasets have led to the development of convolutional neural networks that can detect lymph node metastases of breast cancer at the level of expert pathologists. Many cancers, regardless of the site of origin, can metastasize to lymph nodes. However, collecting and annotating high-volume, high-quality datasets for every cancer type is challenging. In this paper we investigate how to leverage existing high-quality datasets most efficiently in multi-task settings for closely related tasks. Specifically, we will explore different training and domain adaptation strategies, including prevention of catastrophic forgetting, for colon and head-and-neck cancer metastasis detection in lymph nodes. Our results show state-of-the-art performance on both cancer metastasis detection tasks. Furthermore, we show the effectiveness of repeated adaptation of networks from one cancer type to another to obtain multi-task metastasis detection networks. Last, we show that leveraging existing high-quality datasets can significantly boost performance on new target tasks and that catastrophic forgetting can be effectively mitigated using regularization.

    "title": "Stochastic Functional Analysis and Multilevel Vector Field Anomaly  Detection",
    "abstract": "Massive vector field datasets are common in multi-spectral optical and radar sensors and modern multimodal MRI data, among many other areas of application. In this paper we develop a novel stochastic functional analysis approach for detecting anomalies based on the covariance structure of nominal stochastic behavior across a domain with multi-band vector field data. An optimal vector field Karhunen-Loeve (KL) expansion is applied to such random field data. A series of multilevel orthogonal functional subspaces is constructed from the geometry of the domain, adapted from the KL expansion. Detection is achieved by examining the projection of the random field on the multilevel basis. The anomalies can be quantified in suitable normed spaces based on local and global information. In addition, reliable hypothesis tests are formed with controllable distributions that do not require prior assumptions on probability distributions of the data. Only the covariance function is needed, which makes for significantly simpler estimates. Furthermore this approach allows stochastic vector-based fusion of anomalies without any loss of information. The method is applied to the important problem of deforestation and degradation in the Amazon forest. This is a complex non-monotonic process, as forests can degrade and recover. This particular problem is further compounded by the presence of clouds that are hard to remove with current masking algorithms. Using multi-spectral satellite data from Sentinel 2, the multilevel filter is constructed and anomalies are treated as deviations from the initial state of the forest. Forest anomalies are quantified with robust hypothesis tests and distinguished from false variations such as cloud cover. Our approach shows the advantage of using multiple bands of data in a vectorized complex, leading to better anomaly detection beyond the capabilities of scalar-based methods. ",

    "title": "Normalized gradient flow optimization in the training of ReLU artificial  neural networks",
    "abstract": "The training of artificial neural networks (ANNs) is nowadays a highly relevant algorithmic procedure with many applications in science and industry. Roughly speaking, ANNs can be regarded as iterated compositions between affine linear functions and certain fixed nonlinear functions, which are usually multidimensional versions of a one-dimensional so-called activation function. The most popular choice of such a one-dimensional activation function is the rectified linear unit (ReLU) activation function which maps a real number to its positive part $ \\mathbb{R} \\ni x \\mapsto \\max\\{ x, 0 \\} \\in \\mathbb{R} $. In this article we propose and analyze a modified variant of the standard training procedure of such ReLU ANNs in the sense that we propose to restrict the negative gradient flow dynamics to a large submanifold of the ANN parameter space, which is a strict $ C^{ \\infty } $-submanifold of the entire ANN parameter space that seems to enjoy better regularity properties than the entire ANN parameter space but which is also sufficiently large and sufficiently high dimensional so that it can represent all ANN realization functions that can be represented through the entire ANN parameter space. In the special situation of shallow ANNs with just one-dimensional ANN layers we also prove for every Lipschitz continuous target function that every gradient flow trajectory on this large submanifold of the ANN parameter space is globally bounded. For the standard gradient flow on the entire ANN parameter space with Lipschitz continuous target functions it remains an open problem of research to prove or disprove the global boundedness of gradient flow trajectories even in the situation of shallow ANNs with just one-dimensional ANN layers.
