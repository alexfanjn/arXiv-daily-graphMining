    "abstract": "In this paper, a mode decomposition (MD) method for degenerated modes has been studied. Convolution neural network (CNN) has been applied for image training and predicting the mode coefficients. Four-fold degenerated $LP_{11}$ series has been the target to be decomposed. Multiple images are regarded as an input to decompose the degenerate modes. Total of seven different images, including the full original near-field image, and images after linear polarizers of four directions (0$^\\circ$, 45$^\\circ$, 90$^\\circ$, and 135$^\\circ$), and images after two circular polarizers (right-handed and left-handed) has been considered for training, validation, and test. The output label of the model has been chosen as the real and imaginary components of the mode coefficient, and the loss function has been selected to be the root-mean-square (RMS) of the labels. The RMS and mean-absolute-error (MAE) of the label, intensity, phase, and field correlation between the actual and predicted values have been selected to be the metrics to evaluate the CNN model. The CNN model has been trained with 100,000 three-dimensional images with depths of three, four, and seven. The performance of the trained model was evaluated via 10,000 test samples with four sets of images - images after three linear polarizers (0$^\\circ$, 45$^\\circ$, 90$^\\circ$) and image after right-handed circular polarizer - showed 0.0634 of label RMS, 0.0292 of intensity RMS, 0.1867 rad of phase MAE, and 0.9978 of average field correlation. The performance of 4 image sets showed at least 50.68\\% of performance enhancement compared to models considering only images after linear polarizers. ",

Our goal is to design an online controller that dynamically schedules users and configures their links to minimize the system delay. To solve this complex scheduling problem, we model it as a dynamic decision-making process and develop two reinforcement learning-based solutions. The first solution is based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL), which leverages the proximal policy optimization to train a neural network-based solution. Due to the potential high sample complexity of DRL, we also propose an empirical multi-armed bandit (MAB)-based solution, which decomposes the decision-making process into a sequential of sub-actions and exploits classic maxweight scheduling and Thompson sampling to decide those sub-actions. Our evaluation of the proposed solutions confirms their effectiveness in providing acceptable system delay. It also shows that the DRL-based solution has better delay performance while the MAB-based solution has a faster training process. ",

To integrate the new features into the popular ORB-SLAM framework, we develop feature masks to filter out the unreliable features and employ KNN strategy to strengthen the matching robustness. We also retrained visual vocabulary upon new descriptors for efficient loop closing. The resulting RWT-SLAM is tested in various public datasets such as TUM and OpenLORIS, as well as our own data.

    "abstract": "A number of recent self-supervised learning methods have shown impressive performance on image classification and other tasks. A somewhat bewildering variety of techniques have been used, not always with a clear understanding of the reasons for their benefits, especially when used in combination. Here we treat the embeddings of images as point particles and consider model optimization as a dynamic process on this system of particles. Our dynamic model combines an attractive force for similar images, a locally dispersive force to avoid local collapse, and a global dispersive force to achieve a globally-homogeneous distribution of particles. The dynamic perspective highlights the advantage of using a delayed-parameter image embedding (a la BYOL) together with multiple views of the same image. It also uses a purely-dynamic local dispersive force (Brownian motion) that shows improved performance over other methods and does not require knowledge of other particle coordinates. The method is called MSBReg which stands for (i) a Multiview centroid loss, which applies an attractive force to pull different image view embeddings toward their centroid, (ii) a Singular value loss, which pushes the particle system toward spatially homogeneous density, (iii) a Brownian diffusive loss. We evaluate downstream classification performance of MSBReg on ImageNet as well as transfer learning tasks including fine-grained classification, multi-class object classification, object detection, and instance segmentation. In addition, we also show that applying our regularization term to other methods further improves their performance and stabilize the training by preventing a mode collapse. ",

    "abstract": "RGB-thermal salient object detection (RGB-T SOD) aims to locate the common prominent objects of an aligned visible and thermal infrared image pair and accurately segment all the pixels belonging to those objects. It is promising in challenging scenes such as nighttime and complex backgrounds due to the insensitivity to lighting conditions of thermal images. Thus, the key problem of RGB-T SOD is to make the features from the two modalities complement and adjust each other flexibly, since it is inevitable that any modalities of RGB-T image pairs failure due to challenging scenes such as extreme light conditions and thermal crossover. In this paper, we propose a novel mirror complementary Transformer network (MCNet) for RGB-T SOD. Specifically, we introduce a Transformer-based feature extraction module to effective extract hierarchical features of RGB and thermal images. Then, through the attention-based feature interaction and serial multiscale dilated convolution (SDC) based feature fusion modules, the proposed model achieves the complementary interaction of low-level features and the semantic fusion of deep features. Finally, based on the mirror complementary structure, the salient regions of the two modalities can be accurately extracted even one modality is invalid. To demonstrate the robustness of the proposed model under challenging scenes in real world, we build a novel RGB-T SOD dataset VT723 based on a large public semantic segmentation RGB-T dataset used in the autonomous driving domain. Expensive experiments on benchmark and VT723 datasets show that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, including CNN-based and Transformer-based methods.

    "abstract": "Neural networks' lack of robustness against attacks raises concerns in security-sensitive settings such as autonomous vehicles. While many countermeasures may look promising, only a few withstand rigorous evaluation. Defenses using random transformations (RT) have shown impressive results, particularly BaRT (Raff et al., 2019) on ImageNet. However, this type of defense has not been rigorously evaluated, leaving its robustness properties poorly understood. Their stochastic properties make evaluation more challenging and render many proposed attacks on deterministic models inapplicable. First, we show that the BPDA attack (Athalye et al., 2018a) used in BaRT's evaluation is ineffective and likely overestimates its robustness. We then attempt to construct the strongest possible RT defense through the informed selection of transformations and Bayesian optimization for tuning their parameters. Furthermore, we create the strongest possible attack to evaluate our RT defense. Our new attack vastly outperforms the baseline, reducing the accuracy by 83% compared to the 19% reduction by the commonly used EoT attack ($4.3\\times$ improvement). Our result indicates that the RT defense on the Imagenette dataset (a ten-class subset of ImageNet) is not robust against adversarial examples. Extending the study further, we use our new attack to adversarially train RT defense (called AdvRT), resulting in a large robustness gain.

    "abstract": "Knowing \"what is happening\" and \"what will happen\" of the mobility in a city is the building block of a data-driven smart city system. In recent years, mobility digital twin that makes a virtual replication of human mobility and predicting or simulating the fine-grained movements of the subjects in a virtual space at a metropolitan scale in near real-time has shown its great potential in modern urban intelligent systems. However, few studies have provided practical solutions. The main difficulties are four-folds. 1) The daily variation of human mobility is hard to model and predict; 2) the transportation network enforces a complex constraints on human mobility; 3) generating a rational fine-grained human trajectory is challenging for existing machine learning models; and 4) making a fine-grained prediction incurs high computational costs, which is challenging for an online system. Bearing these difficulties in mind, in this paper we propose a two-stage human mobility predictor that stratifies the coarse and fine-grained level predictions. In the first stage, to encode the daily variation of human mobility at a metropolitan level, we automatically extract citywide mobility trends as crowd contexts and predict long-term and long-distance movements at a coarse level. In the second stage, the coarse predictions are resolved to a fine-grained level via a probabilistic trajectory retrieval method, which offloads most of the heavy computations to the offline phase. We tested our method using a real-world mobile phone GPS dataset in the Kanto area in Japan, and achieved good prediction accuracy and a time efficiency of about 2 min in predicting future 1h movements of about 220K mobile phone users on a single machine to support more higher-level analysis of mobility prediction.

Machine learning (ML) has demonstrated its ability as a potential tool for anomaly detection-based intrusion detection systems to build secure computer networks. Increasingly, ML approaches are widely adopted than heuristic approaches for cybersecurity because they learn directly from data. Data is critical for the development of ML systems, and becomes potential targets for attackers. Basically, data poisoning or contamination is one of the most common techniques used to fool ML models through data. This paper evaluates the robustness of six recent deep learning algorithms for intrusion detection on contaminated data.

The new neurons were generated using automatic programming and are formulated as pure functional programs that easily can be transformed. We present experimental results for eight datasets and found excellent improvements for seven of them, but LSTM remained the best for one dataset.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we leverage low-level compiler intermediate representations (IR) to improve code translation. Traditional transpilers rely on syntactic information and handcrafted rules, which limits their applicability and produces unnatural-looking code. Applying neural machine translation (NMT) approaches to code has successfully broadened the set of programs on which one can get a natural-looking translation. However, they treat the code as sequences of text tokens, and still do not differentiate well enough between similar pieces of code which have different semantics in different languages. The consequence is low quality translation, reducing the practicality of NMT, and stressing the need for an approach significantly increasing its accuracy. Here we propose to augment code translation with IRs, specifically LLVM IR, with results on the C++, Java, Rust, and Go languages. Our method improves upon the state of the art for unsupervised code translation, increasing the number of correct translations by 11% on average, and up to 79% for the Java - Rust pair. We extend previous test sets for code translation, by adding hundreds of Go and Rust functions. Additionally, we train models with high performance on the problem of IR decompilation, generating programming source code from IR, and study using IRs as intermediary pivot for translation. ",

It adopts a novel temporal graph attention network as an encoder to capture more efficient spatio-temporal features by attention mechanism in both spatial and temporal dimensions.

To the best of our knowledge, this paper provides the first theoretical justification of graph topology sampling in training (up to) three-layer GCNs for semi-supervised node classification. We formally characterize some sufficient conditions on graph topology sampling such that GCN training leads to a diminishing generalization error.

However, exhaustively collecting and labeling the data necessary to fully test the long tail of rare and challenging scenarios is difficult and expensive. In this work, we construct a new benchmark for evaluating and improving model robustness by applying perturbations to existing data. Specifically, we conduct an extensive labeling effort to identify causal agents, or agents whose presence influences human driver behavior in any way, in the Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD), and we use these labels to perturb the data by deleting non-causal agents from the scene. We then evaluate a diverse set of state-of-the-art deep-learning model architectures on our proposed benchmark and find that all models exhibit large shifts under perturbation. Under non-causal perturbations, we observe a $25$-$38\\%$ relative change in minADE as compared to the original. We then investigate techniques to improve model robustness, including increasing the training dataset size and using targeted data augmentations that drop agents throughout training. We plan to provide the causal agent labels as an additional attribute to WOMD and release the robustness benchmarks to aid the community in building more reliable and safe deep-learning models for motion forecasting.

    "abstract": "This paper analyzes the convergence and generalization of training a one-hidden-layer neural network when the input features follow the Gaussian mixture model consisting of a finite number of Gaussian distributions. Assuming the labels are generated from a teacher model with an unknown ground truth weight, the learning problem is to estimate the underlying teacher model by minimizing a non-convex risk function over a student neural network. With a finite number of training samples, referred to the sample complexity, the iterations are proved to converge linearly to a critical point with guaranteed generalization error. In addition, for the first time, this paper characterizes the impact of the input distributions on the sample complexity and the learning rate. ",

    "abstract": "Prior research on intelligent reflection surface (IRS)-assisted unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communications has focused on a fixed location for the IRS or mounted on a UAV. The assumption that the IRS is located at a fixed position will prohibit mobile users from maximizing many wireless network benefits, such as data rate and coverage. Furthermore, assuming that the IRS is placed on a UAV is impractical for various reasons, including the IRS's weight and size and the speed of wind in severe weather. Unlike previous studies, this study assumes a single UAV and an IRS mounted on a mobile ground vehicle (M-IRS) to be deployed in an Internet-of-Things (IoT) 6G wireless network to maximize the average data rate. Such a methodology for providing wireless coverage using an M-IRS assisted UAV system is expected in smart cities. In this paper, we formulate an optimization problem to find an efficient trajectory for the UAV, an efficient path for the M-IRS, and users' power allocation coefficients that maximize the average data rate for mobile ground users. Due to its intractability, we propose efficient techniques that can help in finding the solution to the optimization problem. First, we show that our dynamic power allocation technique outperforms the fixed power allocation technique in terms of network average sum rate. Then we employ the individual movement model (Random Waypoint Model) in order to represent the users' movements inside the coverage area. Finally, we propose an efficient approach using a Genetic Algorithm (GA) for finding an efficient trajectory for the UAV, and an efficient path for the M-IRS to provide wireless connectivity for mobile users during their movement. We demonstrate through simulations that our methodology can enhance the average data rate by 15\\% on average compared with the static IRS and by 25\\% on average compared without the IRS system. ",

In recent years, class activation mapping-based method has been widely used to interpret the internal decisions of models in computer vision tasks. However, when this method uses backpropagation to obtain gradients, it will cause noise in the saliency map, and even locate features that are irrelevant to decisions. In this paper, we propose an Absolute value Class Activation Mapping-based (Abs-CAM) method, which optimizes the gradients derived from the backpropagation and turns all of them into positive gradients to enhance the visual features of output neurons' activation, and improve the localization ability of the saliency map. The framework of Abs-CAM is divided into two phases: generating initial saliency map and generating final saliency map. The first phase improves the localization ability of the saliency map by optimizing the gradient, and the second phase linearly combines the initial saliency map with the original image to enhance the semantic information of the saliency map. We conduct qualitative and quantitative evaluation of the proposed method, including Deletion, Insertion, and Pointing Game. The experimental results show that the Abs-CAM can obviously eliminate the noise in the saliency map, and can better locate the features related to decisions, and is superior to the previous methods in recognition and localization tasks.

Given that deepfake faces do not completely discard the features of original faces, especially facial expressions and poses, we argue that original faces can be approximately speculated from their deepfake counterparts.

    "abstract": "Planning under social interactions with other agents is an essential problem for autonomous driving. As the actions of the autonomous vehicle in the interactions affect and are also affected by other agents, autonomous vehicles need to efficiently infer the reaction of the other agents. Most existing approaches formulate the problem as a generalized Nash equilibrium problem solved by optimization-based methods. However, they demand too much computational resource and easily fall into the local minimum due to the non-convexity. Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) successfully tackles such issues in game-theoretic problems. However, as the interaction game tree grows exponentially, the general MCTS still requires a huge amount of iterations to reach the optima. In this paper, we introduce an efficient game-theoretic trajectory planning algorithm based on general MCTS by incorporating a prediction algorithm as a heuristic. On top of it, a social-compliant reward and a Bayesian inference algorithm are designed to generate diverse driving behaviors and identify the other driver's driving preference. Results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework with datasets containing naturalistic driving behavior in highly interactive scenarios. ",

At first, a Spatial Aware Double Head(SADH) structure is proposed to disentangle the representation learning for classification and localization from two different spatial perspectives. The proposed SADH ensures a steeper classification confidence gradient and suppresses the proposals having low intersection-over-union(IoU) with the matched ground truth. Then, we propose a Normalized Wasserstein Distance prediction branch to improve the correlation between the proposals' classification scores and IoUs. In addition, to facilitate further research on acne detection, we construct a new dataset named AcneSCU, with high-resolution imageries, precise annotations, and fine-grained lesion categories.

An Agg-GNN is a hybrid architecture where information is defined on the nodes of a graph, but it is processed block-wise by Euclidean CNNs on the nodes after several diffusions on the graph shift operator. We derive stability bounds for the mapping operator associated to a generic Agg-GNN, and we specify conditions under which such operators can be stable to deformations. We prove that the stability bounds are defined by the properties of the filters in the first layer of the CNN that acts on each node. Additionally, we show that there is a close relationship between the number of aggregations, the filter's selectivity, and the size of the stability constants. We also conclude that in Agg-GNNs the selectivity of the mapping operators is tied to the properties of the filters only in the first layer of the CNN stage. This shows a substantial difference with respect to the stability properties of selection GNNs, where the selectivity of the filters in all layers is constrained by their stability. We provide numerical evidence corroborating the results derived, testing the behavior of Agg-GNNs in real life application scenarios considering perturbations of different magnitude. ",

Traditional approaches cannot be adopted on attributed networks' settings to solve the problem of anomaly detection. The main limitation of such approaches is that they inherently ignore the relational information between data features. With a rapid explosion in deep learning- and graph neural networks-based techniques, spotting rare objects on attributed networks has significantly stepped forward owing to the potentials of deep techniques in extracting complex relationships. In this paper, we propose a new architecture on anomaly detection. The main goal of designing such an architecture is to utilize multi-task learning which would enhance the detection performance. Multi-task learning-based anomaly detection is still in its infancy and only a few studies in the existing literature have catered to the same. We incorporate both community detection and multi-view representation learning techniques for extracting distinct and complementary information from attributed networks and subsequently fuse the captured information for achieving a better detection result. The mutual collaboration between two main components employed in this architecture, i.e., community-specific learning and multi-view representation learning, exhibits a promising solution to reach more effective results.

Therefore, it becomes necessary to retrain these models against adversarial inputs, as part of the software testing process addressing the vulnerability to these inputs. Furthermore, for an energy efficient testing and retraining, data scientists need support on which are the best guidance metrics and optimal dataset configurations. Aims: We examined four guidance metrics for retraining convolutional neural networks and three retraining configurations. Our goal is to improve the models against adversarial inputs regarding accuracy, resource utilization and time from the point of view of a data scientist in the context of image classification. Method: We conducted an empirical study in two datasets for image classification. We explore: (a) the accuracy, resource utilization and time of retraining convolutional neural networks by ordering new training set by four different guidance metrics (neuron coverage, likelihood-based surprise adequacy, distance-based surprise adequacy and random), (b) the accuracy and resource utilization of retraining convolutional neural networks with three different configurations (from scratch and augmented dataset, using weights and augmented dataset, and using weights and only adversarial inputs). Results: We reveal that retraining with adversarial inputs from original weights and by ordering with surprise adequacy metrics gives the best model w.r.t. the used metrics. Conclusions: Although more studies are necessary, we recommend data scientists to use the above configuration and metrics to deal with the vulnerability to adversarial inputs of deep learning models, as they can improve their models against adversarial inputs without using many inputs.

In this paper, we present a generic INR framework that achieves both data and training efficiency by learning a Neural Implicit Dictionary (NID) from a data collection and representing INR as a functional combination of basis sampled from the dictionary. Our NID assembles a group of coordinate-based subnetworks which are tuned to span the desired function space. After training, one can instantly and robustly acquire an unseen scene representation by solving the coding coefficients. To parallelly optimize a large group of networks, we borrow the idea from Mixture-of-Expert (MoE) to design and train our network with a sparse gating mechanism. Our experiments show that, NID can improve reconstruction of 2D images or 3D scenes by 2 orders of magnitude faster with up to 98% less input data. We further demonstrate various applications of NID in image inpainting and occlusion removal, which are considered to be challenging with vanilla INR.

Current path planning methods for such scenarios consider the aircraft pose, radar position, and radar parameters to be deterministic and known. This paper presents a framework for incorporating uncertainty in these quantities into a radar detection model that is used by a path planner. The developed path planner evaluates the radar detection risk in the presence of uncertainties and uses linear covariance analysis to efficiently generate error budgets. The error budgets identify the contribution of each source of uncertainty (e.g., sensor measurement noise, radar position uncertainty) to the overall variability in the probability of detection. The framework is applied to a modified visibility graph path planner that uses the detection risk and its variability to calculate path adjustments, which maintain the detection risk below a specified threshold. The results show that the framework is effective at providing actionable information to the mission planner that improves the final planned path and reduces the detection risk. ",

To resolve this tradeoff, we propose Adaptive Multi-scale Pooling, which aggregates features from an adaptive number of layers, i.e., only the first few layers for short data and more layers for long data. Furthermore, to address the second problem, we introduce Temporal Encoding, which embeds the observation timestamps into the intermediate features. Experiments on our private dataset and the UCR/UEA time series archive show that our modules improve classification accuracy especially on short data obtained as partial time series. ",

However, the released trajectories also bring severe concern about personal privacy, and several recent studies have demonstrated the existence of personally-identifying information in spatial trajectories. Trajectory anonymization is nontrivial due to the trade-off between privacy protection and utility preservation. Furthermore, recovery attack has not been well studied in the current literature. To tackle these issues, we propose a frequency-based randomization model with a rigorous differential privacy guarantee for trajectory data publishing. In particular, we introduce two randomized mechanisms to perturb the local/global frequency distributions of significantly important locations in trajectories by injecting Laplace noise. We design a hierarchical indexing along with a novel search algorithm to support efficient trajectory modification, ensuring the modified trajectories satisfy the perturbed distributions without compromising privacy guarantee or data utility. Extensive experiments on a real-world trajectory dataset verify the effectiveness of our approaches in resisting individual re-identification and recovery attacks and meanwhile preserving desirable data utility as well as the feasibility in practice.

    "abstract": "With the rapid growth of in-the-wild videos taken by non-specialists, blind video quality assessment (VQA) has become a challenging and demanding problem. Although lots of efforts have been made to solve this problem, it remains unclear how the human visual system (HVS) relates to the temporal quality of videos. Meanwhile, recent work has found that the frames of natural video transformed into the perceptual domain of the HVS tend to form a straight trajectory of the representations. With the obtained insight that distortion impairs the perceived video quality and results in a curved trajectory of the perceptual representation, we propose a temporal perceptual quality index (TPQI) to measure the temporal distortion by describing the graphic morphology of the representation. Specifically, we first extract the video perceptual representations from the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) and primary visual area (V1) of the HVS, and then measure the straightness and compactness of their trajectories to quantify the degradation in naturalness and content continuity of video. Experiments show that the perceptual representation in the HVS is an effective way of predicting subjective temporal quality, and thus TPQI can, for the first time, achieve comparable performance to the spatial quality metric and be even more effective in assessing videos with large temporal variations. We further demonstrate that by combining with NIQE, a spatial quality metric, TPQI can achieve top performance over popular in-the-wild video datasets. More importantly, TPQI does not require any additional information beyond the video being evaluated and thus can be applied to any datasets without parameter tuning.

We focus on one such representation, scene graphs, and propose a novel scene expansion task where we enrich an input seed graph by adding new nodes (objects) and the corresponding relationships. To this end, we formulate scene graph expansion as a sequential prediction task involving multiple steps of first predicting a new node and then predicting the set of relationships between the newly predicted node and previous nodes in the graph. We propose a sequencing strategy for observed graphs that retains the clustering patterns amongst nodes. In addition, we leverage external knowledge to train our graph generation model, enabling greater generalization of node predictions. Due to the inefficiency of existing maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) based metrics for graph generation problems in evaluating predicted relationships between nodes (objects), we design novel metrics that comprehensively evaluate different aspects of predicted relations. We conduct extensive experiments on Visual Genome and VRD datasets to evaluate the expanded scene graphs using the standard MMD-based metrics and our proposed metrics. We observe that the graphs generated by our method, GEMS, better represent the real distribution of the scene graphs than the baseline methods like GraphRNN. ",

    "abstract": "In the practical application of the Bridge Weigh-In-Motion (BWIM) methods, the position of the wheels or axles during the passage of a vehicle is in most cases a prerequisite. To avoid the use of conventional axle detectors and bridge type specific methods, we propose a novel method for axle detection through the placement of accelerometers at any point of a bridge. In order to develop a model that is as simple and comprehensible as possible, the axle detection task is implemented as a binary classification problem instead of a regression problem. The model is implemented as a Fully Convolutional Network to process signals in the form of Continuous Wavelet Transforms. This allows passages of any length to be processed in a single step with maximum efficiency while utilising multiple scales in a single evaluation. This enables our method to use acceleration signals at any location of the bridge structure serving as Virtual Axle Detectors (VADs) without being limited to specific structural types of bridges. To test the proposed method, we analysed 3787 train passages recorded on a steel trough railway bridge of a long-distance traffic line. Our results on the measurement data show that our model detects 95% of the axes, thus, 128,599 of 134,800 previously unseen axles were correctly detected. In total, 90% of the axles can be detected with a maximum spatial error of 20cm, with a maximum velocity of $v_{\\mathrm{max}}=56,3~\\mathrm{m/s}$. The analysis shows that our developed model can use accelerometers as VADs even under real operating conditions. ",

    "abstract": "Existing face forgery detection methods usually treat face forgery detection as a binary classification problem and adopt deep convolution neural networks to learn discriminative features. The ideal discriminative features should be only related to the real/fake labels of facial images. However, we observe that the features learned by vanilla classification networks are correlated to unnecessary properties, such as forgery methods and facial identities. Such phenomenon would limit forgery detection performance especially for the generalization ability. Motivated by this, we propose a novel method which utilizes adversarial learning to eliminate the negative effect of different forgery methods and facial identities, which helps classification network to learn intrinsic common discriminative features for face forgery detection. To leverage data lacking ground truth label of facial identities, we design a special identity discriminator based on similarity information derived from off-the-shelf face recognition model. With the help of adversarial learning, our face forgery detection model learns to extract common discriminative features through eliminating the effect of forgery methods and facial identities. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method under both intra-dataset and cross-dataset evaluation settings. ",

We introduce a unique and meaningful flow decomposition between the physical prior and the data-driven complement, including an uncertainty quantification of the BC model. We derive a joint training scheme for learning the different components of the decomposition ensuring an optimal cooperation, in a supervised but also in a semi-supervised context. Experiments show that COMBO can improve performances over state-of-the-art supervised networks, e.g. RAFT, reaching state-of-the-art results on several benchmarks. We highlight how COMBO can leverage the BC model and adapt to its limitations. Finally, we show that our semi-supervised method can significantly simplify the training procedure. ",

    "abstract": "Many real-world networks, like the Internet, are not the result of central design but instead the outcome of the interaction of local agents who are selfishly optimizing for their individual utility. The famous Network Creation Game [Fabrikant et al., PODC 2003] enables us to understand such processes, their dynamics, and their outcomes in the form of equilibrium states. In this model, agents buy incident edges towards other agents for a price of~\\(\\alpha\\) and simultaneously try to minimize their buying cost and their total hop distance. Since in many real-world networks, e.g., social networks, consent from both sides is required to maintain a connection, Corbo and Parkes [PODC 2005] proposed a bilateral version of the Network Creation Game, in which mutual consent and payment are required in order to create edges. It is known that the bilateral version has a significantly higher Price of Anarchy, compared to the unilateral version. This is counter-intuitive, since cooperation should help to avoid socially bad states. We investigate this phenomenon by analyzing the Price of Anarchy of the bilateral version with respect to different solution concepts that allow for various degrees of cooperation among the agents. With this, we provide insights into what kind of cooperation is needed to ensure that socially good networks are created. We present a collection of asymptotically tight bounds on the Price of Anarchy that precisely map the impact of cooperation on the quality of tree networks and we find that weak forms of cooperation already yield a significantly improved Price of Anarchy. Moreover, for general networks we show that enhanced cooperation yields close to optimal networks for a wide range of edge prices. ",

The product segmentation newsvendor problem is a new variant of the newsvendor problem, reflecting that sellers maximize profits by determining the inventory of the whole item in the context of uncertain demand for sub-items. We derive the closed-form robust ordering decision by assuming that the means and covariance matrix of stochastic demand are available but not the distributions. However, robust approaches that always trade-off in the worst-case demand scenario face a concern in solution conservatism; thus, the traditional robust schemes offer unsatisfactory. In this paper, we integrate robust and deep reinforcement learning (DRL) techniques and propose a new paradigm termed robust learning to increase the attractiveness of robust policies. Notably, we take the robust decision as human domain knowledge and implement it into the training process of DRL by designing a full-process human-machine collaborative mechanism of teaching experience, normative decision, and regularization return. Simulation results confirm that our approach effectively improves robust performance and can generalize to various problems that require robust but less conservative solutions. Simultaneously, fewer training episodes, increased training stability, and interpretability of behavior may have the opportunity to facilitate the deployment of DRL algorithms in operational practice. Furthermore, the successful attempt of RLDQN to solve the 1000-dimensional demand scenarios reveals that the algorithm provides a path to solve complex operational problems through human-machine collaboration and may have potential significance for solving other complex operational management problems.

The DR method usually falls into feature selection~(FS) and feature projection~(FP). FS focuses on selecting a critical subset of dimensions but risks destroying the data distribution (structure). On the other hand, FP combines all the input features into lower dimensions space, aiming to maintain the data structure; but lacks interpretability and sparsity. FS and FP are traditionally incompatible categories; thus, they have not been unified into an amicable framework. We propose that the ideal DR approach combines both FS and FP into a unified end-to-end manifold learning framework, simultaneously performing fundamental feature discovery while maintaining the intrinsic relationships between data samples in the latent space. In this work, we develop a unified framework, Unified Dimensional Reduction Neural-network~(UDRN), that integrates FS and FP in a compatible, end-to-end way. We improve the neural network structure by implementing FS and FP tasks separately using two stacked sub-networks. In addition, we designed data augmentation of the DR process to improve the generalization ability of the method when dealing with extensive feature datasets and designed loss functions that can cooperate with the data augmentation. Extensive experimental results on four image and four biological datasets, including very high-dimensional data, demonstrate the advantages of DRN over existing methods~(FS, FP, and FS\\&FP pipeline), especially in downstream tasks such as classification and visualization.

This chapter gives a basic introduction into the motivation for Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and traces the path of their success by abstracting the basic task and working mechanism, and deriving the difficulty of early practical approaches. Methods for a more stable training will be shown, and also typical signs for poor convergence and their reasons. Though this chapter focuses on GANs that are meant for image generation and image analysis, the adversarial training paradigm itself is not specific to images, and also generalizes to tasks in image analysis. Examples of architectures for image semantic segmentation and abnormality detection will be acclaimed, before contrasting GANs with further generative modeling approaches lately entering the scene. This will allow a contextualized view on the limits but also benefits of GANs. ",

    "abstract": "Adversarial attacks on deep learning-based models pose a significant threat to the current AI infrastructure. Among them, Trojan attacks are the hardest to defend against. In this paper, we first introduce a variation of the Badnet kind of attacks that introduces Trojan backdoors to multiple target classes and allows triggers to be placed anywhere in the image. The former makes it more potent and the latter makes it extremely easy to carry out the attack in the physical space. The state-of-the-art Trojan detection methods fail with this threat model. To defend against this attack, we first introduce a trigger reverse-engineering mechanism that uses multiple images to recover a variety of potential triggers. We then propose a detection mechanism by measuring the transferability of such recovered triggers. A Trojan trigger will have very high transferability i.e. they make other images also go to the same class. We study many practical advantages of our attack method and then demonstrate the detection performance using a variety of image datasets. The experimental results show the superior detection performance of our method over the state-of-the-arts. ",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we study the privacy preservation problem in a cooperative networked control system working for the task of LQG control. The system consists of a user and a server: the user owns the state process, the server provides computation capability, and the user employs the server to compute control inputs for it. To enable the server's computation, the user needs to provide the measurements of the process states to the server. However, the user regards the states as privacy and wants the server to have deviated knowledge of the state estimates rather than the true value. Regarding that, we propose a novel local design of privacy preservation, which creates a deviation in the server's knowledge of the state estimates from the true value. Meanwhile, we propose an associated privacy metric to measure the deviation and analyze the privacy performance accordingly. Furthermore, we analyze the service loss in the LQG control performance caused by the privacy scheme. Finally, we study the performance trade-off between the privacy preservation and the LQG control, where the proposed optimization problems are solved by numerical methods efficiently. ",

Besides, their multi-scale ship instance segmentation performance is moderate especially for small ships. To solve these problems, we propose a mask attention interaction and scale enhancement network (MAI-SE-Net) for SAR ship instance segmentation. MAI uses an atrous spatial pyra-mid pooling (ASPP) to gain multi-resolution feature re-sponses, a non-local block (NLB) to model long-range spa-tial dependencies, and a concatenation shuffle attention block (CSAB) to improve interaction benefits. SE uses a content-aware reassembly of features block (CARAFEB) to generate an extra pyramid bottom-level to boost small ship performance, a feature balance operation (FBO) to improve scale feature description, and a global context block (GCB) to refine features. Experimental results on two public SSDD and HRSID datasets reveal that MAI-SE-Net outperforms the other nine competitive models, better than the suboptimal model by 4.7% detec-tion AP and 3.4% segmentation AP on SSDD and by 3.0% detection AP and 2.4% segmentation AP on HRSID.

However, these CNN-based feature representations are not robust enough to handle complex real-world scenarios due to ignoring the internal structure of landmarks, as well as the relations between landmarks and context. In this work, we formulate the facial landmark detection task as refining landmark queries along pyramid memories. Specifically, a pyramid transformer head (PTH) is introduced to build both homologous relations among landmarks and heterologous relations between landmarks and cross-scale contexts. Besides, a dynamic landmark refinement (DLR) module is designed to decompose the landmark regression into an end-to-end refinement procedure, where the dynamically aggregated queries are transformed to residual coordinates predictions. Extensive experimental results on four facial landmark detection benchmarks and their various subsets demonstrate the superior performance and high robustness of our framework. ",

Despite the extensive literature on offline CPD, unsupervised online CPD still suffers from major challenges, including scalability, hyperparameter tuning, and learning constraints. To mitigate some of these challenges, in this paper, we propose a novel deep learning approach for unsupervised online CPD from multi-dimensional time series, named Adaptive LSTM-Autoencoder Change-Point Detection (ALACPD). ALACPD exploits an LSTM-autoencoder-based neural network to perform unsupervised online CPD. It continuously adapts to the incoming samples without keeping the previously received input, thus being memory-free. We perform an extensive evaluation on several real-world time series CPD benchmarks. We show that ALACPD, on average, ranks first among state-of-the-art CPD algorithms in terms of quality of the time series segmentation, and it is on par with the best performer in terms of the accuracy of the estimated change-points.

    "abstract": "The detection of anomalous behaviours is an emerging need in many applications, particularly in contexts where security and reliability are critical aspects. While the definition of anomaly strictly depends on the domain framework, it is often impractical or too time consuming to obtain a fully labelled dataset. The use of unsupervised models to overcome the lack of labels often fails to catch domain specific anomalies as they rely on general definitions of outlier. This paper suggests a new active learning based approach, ALIF, to solve this problem by reducing the number of required labels and tuning the detector towards the definition of anomaly provided by the user. The proposed approach is particularly appealing in the presence of a Decision Support System (DSS), a case that is increasingly popular in real-world scenarios. While it is common that DSS embedded with anomaly detection capabilities rely on unsupervised models, they don't have a way to improve their performance: ALIF is able to enhance the capabilities of DSS by exploiting the user feedback during common operations. ALIF is a lightweight modification of the popular Isolation Forest that proved superior performances with respect to other state-of-art algorithms in a multitude of real anomaly detection datasets.

Moreover, it establishes a bridge with information theory, which simplifies the thorny issue of evaluating the utility of a protected data set. Bistochastic privacy also clarifies the trade-off between protection and utility by using bits, which can be viewed as a natural currency to comprehend and operationalize this trade-off, in the same way than bits are used in information theory to capture uncertainty. A discussion on the suitable parameterization of bistochastic matrices to achieve the privacy guarantees of this new model is also provided. ",

We construct a new dataset containing Japanese written media and annotations of furigana. We propose an evaluation metric for such data which is similar to the evaluation protocols used in object detection except that it allows groups of objects to be labeled by one annotation. We propose a method for detection of furigana that is based on mathematical morphology and connected component analysis. We evaluate the detections of the dataset and compare different methods for text extraction. We also evaluate different types of images such as books and comics individually and discuss the challenges of each type of image. The proposed method reaches an F1-score of 76\\% on the dataset. The method performs well on regular books, but less so on comics, and books of irregular format.

The volume of data access or computing jobs can be heterogeneous across different job types and can unpredictably change over time. Cloud service providers cope with this demand heterogeneity and unpredictability by over-provisioning the number of servers hosting each job type. In this paper, we propose the addition of erasure-coded servers that can flexibly serve multiple job types without additional storage cost. We analyze the service capacity region and the response time of such erasure-coded systems and compare them with standard uncoded replication-based systems currently used in the cloud. We show that coding expands the service capacity region, thus enabling the system to handle variability in demand for different data types. Moreover, we characterize the response time of the coded system in various arrival rate regimes. This analysis reveals that adding even a small number of coded servers can significantly reduce the mean response time, with a drastic reduction in regimes where the demand is skewed across different job types.

    "abstract": "Opinion formation and propagation are crucial phenomena in social networks and have been extensively studied across several disciplines. Traditionally, theoretical models of opinion dynamics have been proposed to describe the interactions between individuals (i.e., social interaction) and their impact on the evolution of collective opinions. Although these models can incorporate sociological and psychological knowledge on the mechanisms of social interaction, they demand extensive calibration with real data to make reliable predictions, requiring much time and effort. Recently, the widespread use of social media platforms provides new paradigms to learn deep learning models from a large volume of social media data. However, these methods ignore any scientific knowledge about the mechanism of social interaction. In this work, we present the first hybrid method called Sociologically-Informed Neural Network (SINN), which integrates theoretical models and social media data by transporting the concepts of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) from natural science (i.e., physics) into social science (i.e., sociology and social psychology). In particular, we recast theoretical models as ordinary differential equations (ODEs). Then we train a neural network that simultaneously approximates the data and conforms to the ODEs that represent the social scientific knowledge. In addition, we extend PINNs by integrating matrix factorization and a language model to incorporate rich side information (e.g., user profiles) and structural knowledge (e.g., cluster structure of the social interaction network). Moreover, we develop an end-to-end training procedure for SINN, which involves Gumbel-Softmax approximation to include stochastic mechanisms of social interaction. Extensive experiments on real-world and synthetic datasets show SINN outperforms six baseline methods in predicting opinion dynamics. ",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we study the three-node Decode-and-Forward (D&F) relay network subject to random and burst packet erasures. The source wishes to transmit an infinite stream of packets to the destination via the relay. The three-node D&F relay network is constrained by a decoding delay of T packets, i.e., the packet transmitted by the source at time i must be decoded by the destination by time i+T. For the individual channels from source to relay and relay to destination, we assume a delay-constrained sliding-window (DCSW) based packet-erasure model that can be viewed as a tractable approximation to the commonly-accepted Gilbert-Elliot channel model. Under the model, any time-window of width w contains either up to a random erasure or else erasure burst of length at most b (>= a). Thus the source-relay and relay-destination channels are modeled as (a_1, b_1, w_1, T_1) and (a_2, b_2, w_2, T_2) DCSW channels. We first derive an upper bound on the capacity of the three-node D&F relay network. We then show that the upper bound is tight for the parameter regime: max{b_1, b_2}|(T-b_1-b_2-max{a_1, a_2}+1), a1=a2 OR b1=b2 by constructing streaming codes achieving the bound. The code construction requires field size linear in T, and has decoding complexity equivalent to that of decoding an MDS code. ",

We develop the three following metrics of the rhythmic complexity of a musical piece and its parts: 1) the rhythmic heterogeneity, based on the permutation entropy, where high values indicate a wide variety of rhythmic patterns; 2) the syncopation, based on the distribution of on-beat onsets, where high values indicate a high proportion of off-the-beat notes; and 3) the component extractor, based on the communities of a visibility graph of the rhythmic figures over time, where we identify structural components that constitute the piece at a (to be explained) perceptual level. With the same parameters, our metrics are comparable within a piece or between pieces. ",

This problem arises from the decomposition of the lower bound on the evidence (ELBO) into two terms: one corresponding to the likelihood function of the model and the second to the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the prior distribution and the variational posterior. In particular, we show both theoretically and empirically that there is a trade-off between these two terms in the overparameterized regime only when the KL is appropriately re-scaled with respect to the ratio between the the number of observations and neurons.

    "abstract": "Understanding sensory-induced cortical patterns in the primary visual cortex V1 is an important challenge both for physiological motivations and for improving our understanding of human perception and visual organisation. In this work, we focus on pattern formation in the visual cortex when the cortical activity is driven by a geometric visual hallucination-like stimulus. In particular, we present a theoretical framework for sensory-induced hallucinations which allows one to reproduce novel psychophysical results such as the MacKay effect (Nature, 1957) and the Billock and Tsou experiences (PNAS, 2007).

We show that interpolating label noise induces adversarial vulnerability, and prove the first theorem showing the dependence of label noise and adversarial risk in terms of the data distribution. Our results are almost sharp without accounting for the inductive bias of the learning algorithm. We also show that inductive bias makes the effect of label noise much stronger. ",

    "title": "On Improving the Performance of Glitch Classification for Gravitational  Wave Detection by using Generative Adversarial Networks",
    "abstract": "Spectrogram classification plays an important role in analyzing gravitational wave data. In this paper, we propose a framework to improve the classification performance by using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). As substantial efforts and expertise are required to annotate spectrograms, the number of training examples is very limited. However, it is well known that deep networks can perform well only when the sample size of the training set is sufficiently large. Furthermore, the imbalanced sample sizes in different classes can also hamper the performance. In order to tackle these problems, we propose a GAN-based data augmentation framework. While standard data augmentation methods for conventional images cannot be applied on spectrograms, we found that a variant of GANs, ProGAN, is capable of generating high-resolution spectrograms which are consistent with the quality of the high-resolution original images and provide a desirable diversity. We have validated our framework by classifying glitches in the {\\it Gravity Spy} dataset with the GAN-generated spectrograms for training. We show that the proposed method can provide an alternative to transfer learning for the classification of spectrograms using deep networks, i.e. using a high-resolution GAN for data augmentation instead. Furthermore, fluctuations in classification performance with small sample sizes for training and evaluation can be greatly reduced. Using the trained network in our framework, we have also examined the spectrograms with label anomalies in {\\it Gravity Spy}. ",
