    "title": "Stochastic Restoration of Heavily Compressed Musical Audio using  Generative Adversarial Networks",
    "abstract": "Lossy audio codecs compress (and decompress) digital audio streams by removing information that tends to be inaudible in human perception. Under high compression rates, such codecs may introduce a variety of impairments in the audio signal. Many works have tackled the problem of audio enhancement and compression artifact removal using deep learning techniques. However, only a few works tackle the restoration of heavily compressed audio signals in the musical domain. In such a scenario, there is no unique solution for the restoration of the original signal. Therefore, in this study, we test a stochastic generator of a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) architecture for this task. Such a stochastic generator, conditioned on highly compressed musical audio signals, could one day generate outputs indistinguishable from high-quality releases. Therefore, the present study may yield insights into more efficient musical data storage and transmission. We train stochastic and deterministic generators on MP3-compressed audio signals with 16, 32, and 64 kbit/s. We perform an extensive evaluation of the different experiments utilizing objective metrics and listening tests. We find that the models can improve the quality of the audio signals over the MP3 versions for 16 and 32 kbit/s and that the stochastic generators are capable of generating outputs that are closer to the original signals than those of the deterministic generators.

For the argument classification (AC), the team achieved its best performing results with a five-class BERT-based cascade model complemented with some handcrafted rules. The rules were used to determine if the expression was monetary or not. Then, each monetary expression was classified as a premise or as a conclusion in the first level of the cascade model. Finally, each premise was classified into the three premise classes, and each conclusion into the two conclusion classes. For the information retrieval (i.e., relation ID detection or RID), our best results were achieved by a combination of a BERT-based binary classifier, and the cosine similarity of pairs consisting of the monetary expression and budget dense embeddings.

We collect a corpus of utterances containing contrastive focus and we evaluate the accuracy of a BERT model, finetuned to predict quantized acoustic prominence features, on these samples.

However, not all contact attempts have a positive effect: some attempts do not change customer decisions, while others might even interfere with the desired outcome. In this work we propose using causal inference to estimate the effect of contacting each potential customer and setting the contact policy accordingly. We demonstrate this approach on data from Worthy.com, an online jewelry marketplace. We examined the Worthy business process to identify relevant decisions and outcomes, and formalized assumptions on how they were made. Using causal tools, we selected a decision point where improving AE contact activity appeared to be promising. We then generated a personalized policy and recommended reaching out only to customers for whom it would be beneficial. Finally, we validated the results in an A\\B test over a 3-month period, resulting in an increase in item delivery rate of the targeted population by 22% (p-value=0.026).

The proposed models are validated by testbed experiments over a 802.15.4 wireless link. Testbed experiments for different traffic patterns are provided to validate the proposed models.

    "abstract": "Due to the extreme complexity of scale and shape as well as the uncertainty of the predicted location, salient object detection in optical remote sensing images (RSI-SOD) is a very difficult task. The existing SOD methods can satisfy the detection performance for natural scene images, but they are not well adapted to RSI-SOD due to the above-mentioned image characteristics in remote sensing images. In this paper, we propose a novel Attention Guided Network (AGNet) for SOD in optical RSIs, including position enhancement stage and detail refinement stage. Specifically, the position enhancement stage consists of a semantic attention module and a contextual attention module to accurately describe the approximate location of salient objects. The detail refinement stage uses the proposed self-refinement module to progressively refine the predicted results under the guidance of attention and reverse attention. In addition, the hybrid loss is applied to supervise the training of the network, which can improve the performance of the model from three perspectives of pixel, region and statistics. Extensive experiments on two popular benchmarks demonstrate that AGNet achieves competitive performance compared to other state-of-the-art methods.

After the operator surrogate models are trained during Step 1, PINN can effectively approximate the solution to the FPL equation during Step 2 by using the pre-trained surrogate models. The operator surrogate models greatly reduce the computational cost and boost PINN by approximating the complex Landau collision integral in the FPL equation. The operator surrogate models can also be combined with the traditional numerical schemes. It provides a high efficiency in computational time when the number of velocity modes becomes larger. Using the opPINN framework, we provide the neural network solutions for the FPL equation under the various types of initial conditions, and interaction models in two and three dimensions. Furthermore, based on the theoretical properties of the FPL equation, we show that the approximated neural network solution converges to the a priori classical solution of the FPL equation as the pre-defined loss function is reduced.

The simultaneous use of wavelength multiplexing, broadband modulation, and integration detection allows large neural networks to be run at the client by effectively pushing the energy and memory requirements back to the server.

    "abstract": "Program synthesis or code generation aims to generate a program that satisfies a problem specification. Recent approaches using large-scale pretrained language models (LMs) have shown promising results, yet they have some critical limitations. In particular, they often follow a standard supervised fine-tuning procedure to train a code generation model only from the pairs of natural-language problem descriptions and ground-truth programs. Such paradigm largely ignores some important but potentially useful signals in the problem specification such as unit tests, which thus often results in poor performance when solving complex unseen coding tasks. To address the limitations, we propose \"CodeRL\", a new framework for program synthesis tasks through pretrained LMs and deep reinforcement learning (RL). Specifically, during training, we treat the code-generating LM as an actor network, and introduce a critic network that is trained to predict the functional correctness of generated programs and provide dense feedback signals to the actor. During inference, we introduce a new generation procedure with a critical sampling strategy that allows a model to automatically regenerate programs based on feedback from example unit tests and critic scores. For the model backbones, we extended the encoder-decoder architecture of CodeT5 with enhanced learning objectives, larger model sizes, and better pretraining data. Our method not only achieves new SOTA results on the challenging APPS benchmark, but also shows strong zero-shot transfer capability with new SOTA results on the simpler MBPP benchmark. ",

For a single-coil acquisition, we introduce deep cascade RSN (DC-RSN), a cascade of RSN blocks interleaved with data fidelity (DF) units. Secondly, we improve the structure recovery of DC-RSN for T2 weighted Imaging (T2WI) through assistance of T1 weighted imaging (T1WI), a sequence with short acquisition time. T1 assistance is provided to DC-RSN through a gradient of log feature (GOLF) fusion. Furthermore, we propose perceptual refinement network (PRN) to refine the reconstructions for better visual information fidelity (VIF), a metric highly correlated to radiologists opinion on the image quality. Lastly, for multi-coil acquisition, we propose variable splitting RSN (VS-RSN), a deep cascade of blocks, each block containing RSN, multi-coil DF unit, and a weighted average module. We extensively validate our models DC-RSN and VS-RSN for single-coil and multi-coil acquisitions and report the state-of-the-art performance.

Specifically, our defense detects the adversarial pixels and \"zeros out\" the patch region by repainting with mean pixel values. We formulate the patch detection problem as a semantic segmentation task such that our model can generalize to patches of any size and shape.

    "abstract": "Due to the adoption of horizontal business models following the globalization of semiconductor manufacturing, the overproduction of integrated circuits (ICs) and the piracy of intellectual properties (IPs) can lead to significant damage to the integrity of the semiconductor supply chain. Logic locking emerges as a primary design-for-security measure to counter these threats, where ICs become fully functional only when unlocked with a secret key. However, Boolean satisfiability-based attacks have rendered most locking schemes ineffective. This gives rise to numerous defenses and new locking methods to achieve SAT resiliency. This paper provides a unique perspective on the SAT attack efficiency based on conjunctive normal form (CNF) stored in SAT solver. First, we show how the attack learns new relations between keys in every iteration using distinguishing input patterns and the corresponding oracle responses. The input-output pairs result in new CNF clauses of unknown keys to be appended to the SAT solver, which leads to an exponential reduction in incorrect key values. Second, we demonstrate that the SAT attack can break any locking scheme within linear iteration complexity of key size. Moreover, we show how key constraints on point functions affect the SAT attack complexity. We explain why proper key constraint on AntiSAT reduces the complexity effectively to constant 1. The same constraint helps the breaking of CAS-Lock down to linear iteration complexity. Our analysis provides a new perspective on the capabilities of SAT attack against multiplier benchmark c6288, and we provide new directions to achieve SAT resiliency. ",

    "title": "iLibScope: Reliable Third-Party Library Detection for iOS Mobile Apps",
    "abstract": "Vetting security impacts introduced by third-party libraries in iOS apps requires a reliable library detection technique. Especially when a new vulnerability (or a privacy-invasive behavior) was discovered in a third-party library, there is a practical need to precisely identify the existence of libraries and their versions for iOS apps. However, few studies have been proposed to tackle this problem, and they all suffer from the code duplication problem in different libraries. In this paper, we focus on third-party library detection in iOS apps. Given an app, we aim to identify the integrated libraries and pinpoint their versions (or the version range).To this end, we first conduct an in-depth study on iOS third-party libraries to demystify the code duplication challenge. By doing so, we have two key observations: 1) even though two libraries can share classes, the shared classes cannot be integrated into an app simultaneously without causing a class name conflict; and 2) code duplication between multiple versions of two libraries can vary. Based on these findings, we propose a novel profile-based similarity comparison approach to perform the detection. Specifically, we build a library database consists of original library binaries with distinct versions. After extracting profiles for each library version and the target app, we conduct a similarity comparison to find the best matches. We implemented this approach in iLibScope. We built a benchmark consists of 5,807 apps with 10,495 library integrations and applied our tool to it. Our evaluation shows that iLibScope achieves a recall exceeds 99% and a precision exceeds 97% for library detection. We also applied iLibScope to detect the presence of well-known vulnerable third-party libraries in real-world iOS mobile apps to show the promising usage of our tool. It successfully identified 405 vulnerable library usage from 4,249 apps. ",

    "abstract": "Graph neural networks (GNNs) have gained traction over the past few years for their superior performance in numerous machine learning tasks. Graph Convolutional Neural Networks (GCN) are a common variant of GNNs that are known to have high performance in semi-supervised node classification (SSNC), and work well under the assumption of homophily. Recent literature has highlighted that GCNs can achieve strong performance on heterophilous graphs under certain \"special conditions\". These arguments motivate us to understand why, and how, GCNs learn to perform SSNC. We find a positive correlation between similarity of latent node embeddings of nodes within a class and the performance of a GCN. Our investigation on underlying graph structures of a dataset finds that a GCN's SSNC performance is significantly influenced by the consistency and uniqueness in neighborhood structure of nodes within a class.

    "abstract": "Security and Privacy are crucial in modern Internet services. Transport Layer Security (TLS) has largely addressed the issue of security. However, information about the type of service being accessed goes in plain-text in the initial handshakes of vanilla TLS, thus potentially revealing the activity of users and compromising privacy. The ``Encrypted ClientHello'' or ECH overcomes this issue by extending TLS 1.3 where all of the information that can potentially reveal the service type is masked, thus addressing the privacy issues in TLS 1.3. However, we notice that Internet services tend to use different versions of TLS for application data (primary connection/channel) and supporting data (side channels) such as scheduling information \\textit{etc.}. %, during the active session. Although many internet services have migrated to TLS 1.3, we notice that it is only true for the primary connections which do benefit from TLS 1.3, while the side-channels continue to use lower version of TLS (e.g., 1.2) %which do not support ECH and continue to leak type of service accessed. We demonstrate that privacy information leaked from the side-channels can be used to affect the performance on the primary channels, like blocking or throttling specific service on the internet. Our work demonstrates that adapting ECH on primary channels alone is not sufficient to prevent the privacy leaks and attacks on primary channels. Further, we demonstrate that it is necessary for all of the associated side-channels also to migrate to TLS 1.3 and adapt ECH extension in order to offer complete privacy preservatio ",

    "abstract": "Most of the existing object detection works are based on the bounding box annotation: each object has a precise annotated box. However, for rib fractures, the bounding box annotation is very labor-intensive and time-consuming because radiologists need to investigate and annotate the rib fractures on a slice-by-slice basis. Although a few studies have proposed weakly-supervised methods or semi-supervised methods, they could not handle different forms of supervision simultaneously. In this paper, we proposed a novel omni-supervised object detection network, which can exploit multiple different forms of annotated data to further improve the detection performance. Specifically, the proposed network contains an omni-supervised detection head, in which each form of annotation data corresponds to a unique classification branch. Furthermore, we proposed a dynamic label assignment strategy for different annotated forms of data to facilitate better learning for each branch. Moreover, we also design a confidence-aware classification loss to emphasize the samples with high confidence and further improve the model's performance. Extensive experiments conducted on the testing dataset show our proposed method outperforms other state-of-the-art approaches consistently, demonstrating the efficacy of deep omni-supervised learning on improving rib fracture detection performance.

In doing so, they assume a fixed attention granularity defined by the individual tokens (e.g., text characters or image pixels), which may not be optimal for modeling complex dependencies at higher levels. In this paper, we propose ContextPool to address this problem by adapting the attention granularity for each token. Inspired by the success of ConvNets that are combined with pooling to capture long-range dependencies, we learn to pool neighboring features for each token before computing attention in a given attention layer. The pooling weights and support size are adaptively determined, allowing the pooled features to encode meaningful context with varying scale. We show that ContextPool makes attention models more expressive, achieving strong performance often with fewer layers and thus significantly reduced cost. Experiments validate that our ContextPool module, when plugged into transformer models, matches or surpasses state-of-the-art performance using less compute on several language and image benchmarks, outperforms recent works with learned context sizes or sparse attention patterns, and is also applicable to ConvNets for efficient feature learning.

    "abstract": "Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection has received considerable attention in the context of scene understanding. Despite the growing progress on benchmarks, we realize that existing methods often perform unsatisfactorily on distant interactions, where the leading causes are two-fold: 1) Distant interactions are by nature more difficult to recognize than close ones. A natural scene often involves multiple humans and objects with intricate spatial relations, making the interaction recognition for distant human-object largely affected by complex visual context. 2) Insufficient number of distant interactions in benchmark datasets results in under-fitting on these instances. To address these problems, in this paper, we propose a novel two-stage method for better handling distant interactions in HOI detection. One essential component in our method is a novel Far Near Distance Attention module. It enables information propagation between humans and objects, whereby the spatial distance is skillfully taken into consideration. Besides, we devise a novel Distance-Aware loss function which leads the model to focus more on distant yet rare interactions. We conduct extensive experiments on two challenging datasets - HICO-DET and V-COCO. The results demonstrate that the proposed method can surpass existing approaches by a large margin, resulting in new state-of-the-art performance. ",

Existing face forgery detection methods based on frequency domain find that the GAN forged images have obvious grid-like visual artifacts in the frequency spectrum compared to the real images. But for synthesized videos, these methods only confine to single frame and pay little attention to the most discriminative part and temporal frequency clue among different frames. To take full advantage of the rich information in video sequences, this paper performs video forgery detection on both spatial and temporal frequency domains and proposes a Discrete Cosine Transform-based Forgery Clue Augmentation Network (FCAN-DCT) to achieve a more comprehensive spatial-temporal feature representation. FCAN-DCT consists of a backbone network and two branches: Compact Feature Extraction (CFE) module and Frequency Temporal Attention (FTA) module.

However, that same autonomy opens the door for malicious peers to poison the model by conducting either untargeted or targeted poisoning attacks. The label-flipping (LF) attack is a targeted poisoning attack where the attackers poison their training data by flipping the labels of some examples from one class (i.e., the source class) to another (i.e., the target class). Unfortunately, this attack is easy to perform and hard to detect and it negatively impacts on the performance of the global model. Existing defenses against LF are limited by assumptions on the distribution of the peers' data and/or do not perform well with high-dimensional models. In this paper, we deeply investigate the LF attack behavior and find that the contradicting objectives of attackers and honest peers on the source class examples are reflected in the parameter gradients corresponding to the neurons of the source and target classes in the output layer, making those gradients good discriminative features for the attack detection. Accordingly, we propose a novel defense that first dynamically extracts those gradients from the peers' local updates, and then clusters the extracted gradients, analyzes the resulting clusters and filters out potential bad updates before model aggregation. Extensive empirical analysis on three data sets shows the proposed defense's effectiveness against the LF attack regardless of the data distribution or model dimensionality. Also, the proposed defense outperforms several state-of-the-art defenses by offering lower test error, higher overall accuracy, higher source class accuracy, lower attack success rate, and higher stability of the source class accuracy.

    "abstract": "Current point-cloud detection methods have difficulty detecting the open-vocabulary objects in the real world, due to their limited generalization capability. Moreover, it is extremely laborious and expensive to collect and fully annotate a point-cloud detection dataset with numerous classes of objects, leading to the limited classes of existing point-cloud datasets and hindering the model to learn general representations to achieve open-vocabulary point-cloud detection. As far as we know, we are the first to study the problem of open-vocabulary 3D point-cloud detection. Instead of seeking a point-cloud dataset with full labels, we resort to ImageNet1K to broaden the vocabulary of the point-cloud detector. We propose OV-3DETIC, an Open-Vocabulary 3D DETector using Image-level Class supervision. Specifically, we take advantage of two modalities, the image modality for recognition and the point-cloud modality for localization, to generate pseudo labels for unseen classes. Then we propose a novel debiased cross-modal contrastive learning method to transfer the knowledge from image modality to point-cloud modality during training. Without hurting the latency during inference, OV-3DETIC makes the point-cloud detector capable of achieving open-vocabulary detection. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed OV-3DETIC achieves at least 10.77 % mAP improvement (absolute value) and 9.56 % mAP improvement (absolute value) by a wide range of baselines on the SUN-RGBD dataset and ScanNet dataset, respectively. Besides, we conduct sufficient experiments to shed light on why the proposed OV-3DETIC works. ",

    "abstract": "Multiview detection uses multiple calibrated cameras with overlapping fields of views to locate occluded pedestrians. In this field, existing methods typically adopt a ``human modeling - aggregation'' strategy. To find robust pedestrian representations, some intuitively use locations of detected 2D bounding boxes, while others use entire frame features projected to the ground plane. However, the former does not consider human appearance and leads to many ambiguities, and the latter suffers from projection errors due to the lack of accurate height of the human torso and head. In this paper, we propose a new pedestrian representation scheme based on human point clouds modeling. Specifically, using ray tracing for holistic human depth estimation, we model pedestrians as upright, thin cardboard point clouds on the ground. Then, we aggregate the point clouds of the pedestrian cardboard across multiple views for a final decision. Compared with existing representations, the proposed method explicitly leverages human appearance and reduces projection errors significantly by relatively accurate height estimation. On two standard evaluation benchmarks, the proposed method achieves very competitive results. ",

However, existing robustness verification methods are not sufficiently practical for deploying machine learning systems in the real world. On the one hand, these methods attempt to claim that no perturbations can ``fool'' deep neural networks (DNNs), which may be too stringent in practice. On the other hand, existing works rigorously consider $L_p$ bounded additive perturbations on the pixel space, although perturbations, such as colour shifting and geometric transformations, are more practically and frequently occurring in the real world. Thus, from the practical standpoint, we present a novel and general {\\it probabilistic robustness assessment method} (PRoA) based on the adaptive concentration, and it can measure the robustness of deep learning models against functional perturbations. PRoA can provide statistical guarantees on the probabilistic robustness of a model, \\textit{i.e.}, the probability of failure encountered by the trained model after deployment. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and flexibility of PRoA in terms of evaluating the probabilistic robustness against a broad range of functional perturbations, and PRoA can scale well to various large-scale deep neural networks compared to existing state-of-the-art baselines.

In Track3 of the 6th AI City Challenge, researchers provide a high-quality video dataset with densely action annotations. Due to the small data scale and unclear action boundary, the dataset presents a unique challenge to precisely localize all the different actions and classify their categories. In this paper, we make good use of the multi-view synchronization among videos, and conduct robust Multi-View Practice (MVP) for driving action localization. To avoid overfitting, we fine-tune SlowFast with Kinetics-700 pre-training as the feature extractor. Then the features of different views are passed to ActionFormer to generate candidate action proposals. For precisely localizing all the actions, we design elaborate post-processing, including model voting, threshold filtering and duplication removal. The results show that our MVP is robust for driving action localization, which achieves 28.49% F1-score in the Track3 test set. ",

In this work, we conduct an extensive empirical study (2200 models, 16 tasks) to investigate whether insights from the theory of computation can predict the limits of neural network generalization in practice. We demonstrate that grouping tasks according to the Chomsky hierarchy allows us to forecast whether certain architectures will be able to generalize to out-of-distribution inputs. This includes negative results where even extensive amounts of data and training time never led to any non-trivial generalization, despite models having sufficient capacity to perfectly fit the training data. Our results show that, for our subset of tasks, RNNs and Transformers fail to generalize on non-regular tasks, LSTMs can solve regular and counter-language tasks, and only networks augmented with structured memory (such as a stack or memory tape) can successfully generalize on context-free and context-sensitive tasks.

It seems to be set up for major adoption with its relatively moderate entry-level price. This paper analyzes the iCloud Private Relay from a network perspective and its effect on the Internet and future measurement-based research. We perform EDNS0 Client Subnet DNS queries to collect ingress relay addresses and find 1586 IPv4 addresses. Supplementary RIPE Atlas DNS measurements reveal 1575 IPv6 addresses. Knowledge about these addresses helps to passively detect clients communicating through the relay network. According to our scans, from January through April, ingress addresses grew by 20%. The analysis of our scans through the relay network verifies Apple's claim of rotating egress addresses. Nevertheless, it reveals that ingress and egress relays can be located in the same autonomous system, thus sharing similar routes, potentially allowing traffic correlation. ",

As social media continues to develop, people post a massive amount of information in different forms, including text, photos, audio and video. Thus, traditional SA algorithms have become limited, as they do not consider the expressiveness of other modalities. By including such characteristics from various material sources, these multimodal data streams provide new opportunities for optimising the expected results beyond text-based SA. Our study focuses on the forefront field of multimodal SA, which examines visual and textual data posted on social media networks. Many people are more likely to utilise this information to express themselves on these platforms.

    "abstract": "There is a growing interest in the challenging visual perception task of learning from long-tailed class distributions. The extreme class imbalance in the training dataset biases the model to prefer to recognize majority-class data over minority-class data. Recently, the dual branch network (DBN) framework has been proposed, where two branch networks; the conventional branch and the re-balancing branch were employed to improve the accuracy of long-tailed visual recognition. The re-balancing branch uses a reverse sampler to generate class-balanced training samples to mitigate bias due to class imbalance. Although this strategy has been quite successful in handling bias, using a reversed sampler for training can degrade the representation learning performance. To alleviate this issue, the conventional method used a carefully designed cumulative learning strategy, in which the influence of the re-balancing branch gradually increases throughout the entire training phase. In this study, we aim to develop a simple yet effective method to improve the performance of DBN without cumulative learning that is difficult to optimize. We devise a simple data augmentation method termed bilateral mixup augmentation, which combines one sample from the uniform sampler with another sample from the reversed sampler to produce a training sample. Furthermore, we present class-conditional temperature scaling that mitigates bias toward the majority class for the proposed DBN architecture. Our experiments performed on widely used long-tailed visual recognition datasets show that bilateral mixup augmentation is quite effective in improving the representation learning performance of DBNs, and that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance for some categories.

The model can effectively discover multiple moving objects and handle mutual occlusions; Second, we introduce a scalable pipeline for generating synthetic training data with multiple objects, significantly reducing the requirements for labour-intensive annotations, and supporting Sim2Real generalisation; Third, we show that the model is able to learn object permanence and temporal shape consistency, and is able to predict amodal segmentation masks; Fourth, we evaluate the model on standard video segmentation benchmarks, DAVIS, MoCA, SegTrack, FBMS-59, and achieve state-of-the-art unsupervised segmentation performance, even outperforming several supervised approaches. With test-time adaptation, we observe further performance boosts. ",

In our approach, we employ an effective 3D Contrastive Mixup Classification network for COVID-19 diagnosis on chest CT images, which is composed of contrastive representation learning and mixup classification. For the COVID-19 detection challenge, our approach reaches 0.9245 macro F1 score on 484 validation CT scans, which significantly outperforms the baseline method by 16.5%. In the COVID-19 severity detection challenge, our approach achieves 0.7186 macro F1 score on 61 validation samples, which also surpasses the baseline by 8.86%. ",

    "title": "Knowledge Distillation in Quantum Neural Network using Approximate  Synthesis",
    "abstract": "Recent assertions of a potential advantage of Quantum Neural Network (QNN) for specific Machine Learning (ML) tasks have sparked the curiosity of a sizable number of application researchers. The parameterized quantum circuit (PQC), a major building block of a QNN, consists of several layers of single-qubit rotations and multi-qubit entanglement operations. The optimum number of PQC layers for a particular ML task is generally unknown. A larger network often provides better performance in noiseless simulations. However, it may perform poorly on hardware compared to a shallower network. Because the amount of noise varies amongst quantum devices, the optimal depth of PQC can vary significantly. Additionally, the gates chosen for the PQC may be suitable for one type of hardware but not for another due to compilation overhead. This makes it difficult to generalize a QNN design to wide range of hardware and noise levels. An alternate approach is to build and train multiple QNN models targeted for each hardware which can be expensive. To circumvent these issues, we introduce the concept of knowledge distillation in QNN using approximate synthesis. The proposed approach will create a new QNN network with (i) a reduced number of layers or (ii) a different gate set without having to train it from scratch. Training the new network for a few epochs can compensate for the loss caused by approximation error. Through empirical analysis, we demonstrate ~71.4% reduction in circuit layers, and still achieve ~16.2% better accuracy under noise. ",

    "abstract": "While deep models have shown promising performance in medical image segmentation, they heavily rely on a large amount of well-annotated data, which is difficult to access, especially in clinical practice. On the other hand, high-accuracy deep models usually come in large model sizes, limiting their employment in real scenarios. In this work, we propose a novel asymmetric co-teacher framework, ACT-Net, to alleviate the burden on both expensive annotations and computational costs for semi-supervised knowledge distillation. We advance teacher-student learning with a co-teacher network to facilitate asymmetric knowledge distillation from large models to small ones by alternating student and teacher roles, obtaining tiny but accurate models for clinical employment. To verify the effectiveness of our ACT-Net, we employ the ACDC dataset for cardiac substructure segmentation in our experiments. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that ACT-Net outperforms other knowledge distillation methods and achieves lossless segmentation performance with 250x fewer parameters. ",

    "abstract": "The reliability of segmentation models in the medical domain depends on the model's robustness to perturbations in the input space. Robustness is a particular challenge in medical imaging exhibiting various sources of image noise, corruptions, and domain shifts. Obtaining robustness is often attempted via simulating heterogeneous environments, either heuristically in the form of data augmentation or by learning to generate specific perturbations in an adversarial manner. We propose and justify that learning a discrete representation in a low dimensional embedding space improves robustness of a segmentation model. This is achieved with a dictionary learning method called vector quantisation. We use a set of experiments designed to analyse robustness in both the latent and output space under domain shift and noise perturbations in the input space. We adapt the popular UNet architecture, inserting a quantisation block in the bottleneck. We demonstrate improved segmentation accuracy and better robustness on three segmentation tasks.

Our results show that entropical forces help generalizability.

    "abstract": "Objective: To improve accelerated MRI reconstruction through a densely connected cascading deep learning reconstruction framework. Materials and Methods: A cascading deep learning reconstruction framework (baseline model) was modified by applying three architectural modifications: Input-level dense connections between cascade inputs and outputs, an improved deep learning sub-network, and long-range skip-connections between subsequent deep learning networks. An ablation study was performed, where five model configurations were trained on the NYU fastMRI neuro dataset with an end-to-end scheme conjunct on four- and eight-fold acceleration. The trained models were evaluated by comparing their respective structural similarity index measure (SSIM), normalized mean square error (NMSE) and peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR). Results: The proposed densely interconnected residual cascading network (DIRCN), utilizing all three suggested modifications, achieved a SSIM improvement of 8% and 11% for four- and eight-fold acceleration, respectively. For eight-fold acceleration, the model achieved a 23% decrease in the NMSE when compared to the baseline model. In an ablation study, the individual architectural modifications all contributed to this improvement, by reducing the SSIM and NMSE with approximately 3% and 5% for four-fold acceleration, respectively. Conclusion: The proposed architectural modifications allow for simple adjustments on an already existing cascading framework to further improve the resulting reconstructions. ",
