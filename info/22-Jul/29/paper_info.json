    "abstract": "Trade executions for major stocks come in bursts of activity, which can be partly attributed to the presence of self- and mutual excitations endogenous to the system. In this paper, we study transaction reports for five FTSE 100 stocks. We model the dynamic of transactions between counterparties using both univariate and multivariate Hawkes processes, which we fit to the data using a parametric approach. We find that the frequency of transactions between counterparties increases the likelihood of them to transact in the future, and that univariate and multivariate Hawkes processes show promise as generative models able to reproduce the bursty, hub dominated systems that we observe in the real world. We further show that Hawkes processes perform well when used to model buys and sells through a central clearing counterparty when considered as a bivariate process, but not when these are modelled as individual univariate processes, indicating that mutual excitation between buys and sells is present in these markets.

    "abstract": "Transportation contributes a substantial fraction of all greenhouse gas emissions. One approach for reducing such emissions is to modify vehicles' route choices to minimize their fuel consumption or emission, which is known as eco-routing. Most eco-routing is based on vehicles choosing routes that minimize their individual fuel consumption or emissions. The Braess paradox demonstrates that when vehicles choose routes to minimize their individual goals, the aggregate effect may paradoxically result in the opposite net effect due to changes in congestion patterns. We construct a multiclass user equilibrium model in which some vehicles use eco-routing and others seek to minimize their individual travel times. Using this model, we show that the Braess paradox exists for eco-routing. If a large number of vehicles are trying to minimize their fuel consumption or emissions, the total fuel consumption or emissions may increase. We then solve the multiclass user equilibrium on publicly available city network data, and find that eco-routing results in increases in fuel consumption and emissions on some city networks as well.

Such out-of-lab environments pose challenges in collecting timely and accurate health status data using the limited professional care devices for health condition analysis, medication adherence measurement and future dose or treatment planning. Individual differences in behavioral signals collected from wearable sensors also lead to difficulties in adopting current general machine learning analysis pipelines. To address these challenges, we present a method for predicting medication status of Parkinson's disease patients using the public mPower dataset, which contains 62,182 remote multi-modal test records collected on smartphones from 487 patients. The proposed method shows promising results in predicting three medication status objectively: Before Medication (AUC=0.95), After Medication (AUC=0.958), and Another Time (AUC=0.976) by examining patient-wise historical records with the attention weights learned through a Transformer model. We believe our method provides an innovative way for personalized remote health sensing in a timely and objective fashion which could benefit a broad range of similar applications. ",

    "abstract": "Memristors, emerging non-volatile memory devices, have shown promising potential in neuromorphic hardware designs, especially in spiking neural network (SNN) hardware implementation. Memristor-based SNNs have been successfully applied in a wide range of various applications, including image classification and pattern recognition. However, implementing memristor-based SNNs in text classification is still under exploration. One of the main reasons is that training memristor-based SNNs for text classification is costly due to the lack of efficient learning rules and memristor non-idealities. To address these issues and accelerate the research of exploring memristor-based spiking neural networks in text classification applications, we develop a simulation framework with a virtual memristor array using an empirical memristor model. We use this framework to demonstrate a sentiment analysis task in the IMDB movie reviews dataset. We take two approaches to obtain trained spiking neural networks with memristor models: 1) by converting a pre-trained artificial neural network (ANN) to a memristor-based SNN, or 2) by training a memristor-based SNN directly. These two approaches can be applied in two scenarios: offline classification and online training. We achieve the classification accuracy of 85.88% by converting a pre-trained ANN to a memristor-based SNN and 84.86% by training the memristor-based SNN directly, given that the baseline training accuracy of the equivalent ANN is 86.02%. We conclude that it is possible to achieve similar classification accuracy in simulation from ANNs to SNNs and from non-memristive synapses to data-driven memristive synapses. We also investigate how global parameters such as spike train length, the read noise, and the weight updating stop conditions affect the neural networks in both approaches. ",

This latent representation is then used to learn a generative model that enables both unconditional and conditional generation of 3D scenes. Our model generalizes previous works that focus on single objects by removing the assumption that the camera pose distribution can be shared across samples. We show that GAUDI obtains state-of-the-art performance in the unconditional generative setting across multiple datasets and allows for conditional generation of 3D scenes given conditioning variables like sparse image observations or text that describes the scene.

    "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), inspired by Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), aggregate the message of nodes' neighbors and structure information to acquire expressive representations of nodes for node classification, graph classification, and link prediction. Previous studies have indicated that GNNs are vulnerable to Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs), which infer whether a node is in the training data of GNNs and leak the node's private information, like the patient's disease history. The implementation of previous MIAs takes advantage of the models' probability output, which is infeasible if GNNs only provide the prediction label (label-only) for the input. In this paper, we propose a label-only MIA against GNNs for node classification with the help of GNNs' flexible prediction mechanism, e.g., obtaining the prediction label of one node even when neighbors' information is unavailable. Our attacking method achieves around 60\\% accuracy, precision, and Area Under the Curve (AUC) for most datasets and GNN models, some of which are competitive or even better than state-of-the-art probability-based MIAs implemented under our environment and settings. Additionally, we analyze the influence of the sampling method, model selection approach, and overfitting level on the attack performance of our label-only MIA. Both of those factors have an impact on the attack performance. Then, we consider scenarios where assumptions about the adversary's additional dataset (shadow dataset) and extra information about the target model are relaxed. Even in those scenarios, our label-only MIA achieves a better attack performance in most cases. Finally, we explore the effectiveness of possible defenses, including Dropout, Regularization, Normalization, and Jumping knowledge. None of those four defenses prevent our attack completely. ",

A key element of GNNs is the pooling function which combines atom feature vectors into molecular fingerprints. Most previous works use a standard pooling function to predict a variety of properties. However, unsuitable pooling functions can lead to unphysical GNNs that poorly generalize. We compare and select meaningful GNN pooling methods based on physical knowledge about the learned properties. The impact of physical pooling functions is demonstrated with molecular properties calculated from quantum mechanical computations. We also compare our results to the recent set2set pooling approach. We recommend using sum pooling for the prediction of properties that depend on molecular size and compare pooling functions for properties that are molecular size-independent. Overall, we show that the use of physical pooling functions significantly enhances generalization. ",

In this paper, we highlight a new class of vulnerabilities, which we call \\emph{precision-based attacks}, and which affect several open source libraries. To address this vulnerability and implement differentially private mechanisms on floating-point space in a safe way, we propose a novel technique, called \\emph{interval refining}. This technique has minimal error, provable privacy, and broad applicability. We use interval refining to design and implement a variant of the Laplace mechanism that is equivalent to sampling from the Laplace distribution and rounding to a float. We report on the performance of this approach, and discuss how interval refining can be used to implement other mechanisms safely, including the Gaussian mechanism and the exponential mechanism. ",

Traditional solutions that require no offline training are limited to operating on videos with only a few abnormal frames. Our solution breaks this limit and achieves strong performance on benchmark datasets. ",

The increasing polarization, the strengthening of echo chambers, and the isolation caused by information filters in social networks are increasingly attracting the attention of researchers from different areas of knowledge such as computer science, economics, social and political sciences. Despite hundreds of publications in this area, there was little effort to systematize or present the knowledge developed in the field in an organized way. This study presents an annotated review of network polarization measures, models used to handle existing polarization, their applications, and case studies. Altogether, 405 scientific articles and conference papers were examined, with 74 filtered for this review. Several approaches for measuring polarization in graphs and networks were identified, including those based on homophily, modularity, random walks, and balance theory. The models used for reducing polarization included methods that propose edge or node editions (including edge insertions or deletions, and edge weight modifications), changes in social network design, or changes in the recommendation systems embedded in these networks. This review will be helpful to researchers investigating polarized social networks from a theoretical and applied perspective. ",

Pose or motion priors are important for generating realistic new poses and for reconstructing accurate poses from noisy or partial observations. Pose-NDF learns a manifold of plausible poses as the zero level set of a neural implicit function, extending the idea of modeling implicit surfaces in 3D to the high-dimensional domain SO(3)^K, where a human pose is defined by a single data point, represented by K quaternions. The resulting high-dimensional implicit function can be differentiated with respect to the input poses and thus can be used to project arbitrary poses onto the manifold by using gradient descent on the set of 3-dimensional hyperspheres. In contrast to previous VAE-based human pose priors, which transform the pose space into a Gaussian distribution, we model the actual pose manifold, preserving the distances between poses. We demonstrate that PoseNDF outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods as a prior in various downstream tasks, ranging from denoising real-world human mocap data, pose recovery from occluded data to 3D pose reconstruction from images. Furthermore, we show that it can be used to generate more diverse poses by random sampling and projection than VAE-based methods. ",

However, how to model the personal opinion evolution process under the effect of the online social influence as a function remains unclear. Here, we show that the uni-dimensional continuous user opinions can be represented by compressed high-dimensional word embeddings, and its evolution can be accurately modelled by an ordinary differential equation (ODE) that reflects the social network influencer interactions. Our three major contributions are: (1) introduce a data-driven pipeline representing the personal evolution of opinions with a time kernel, (2) based on previous psychology models, we model the opinion evolution process as a function of online social influence using an ordinary differential equation, and (3) applied Our opinion evolution model to the real-time Twitter data. We perform our analysis on 87 active users with corresponding influencers on the COVID-19 topic from 2020 to 2022. The regression results demonstrate that 99% of the variation in the quantified opinions can be explained by the way we model the connected opinions from their influencers. Our research on the COVID-19 topic and for the account analysed shows that social media users primarily shift their opinion based on influencers they follow (e.g., model explains for 99% variation) and self-evolution of opinion over a long time scale is limited.

Simulation results confirm that giving cognizance to the realistic requirements of end users is capable of significantly reducing the content transmission delay, compared to the existing caching schemes operating without SVC.

To ensure the quality of target sensing while preventing their potential eavesdropping, the BS combines the transmit confidential information signals with additional dedicated sensing signals, which play a dual role of artificial noise (AN) for degrading the qualities of eavesdropping channels. Under this setup, we jointly design the transmit information and sensing beamforming, with the objective of minimizing the weighted sum of beampattern matching errors and cross-correlation patterns for sensing subject to secure communication constraints. The robust design takes into account the channel state information (CSI) imperfectness of the eavesdroppers in two practical CSI error scenarios. First, we consider the scenario with bounded CSI errors of eavesdroppers, in which the worst-case secrecy rate constraint is adopted to ensure secure communication performance. In this scenario, we present the optimal solution to the worst-case secrecy rate constrained sensing beampattern optimization problem, by adopting the techniques of S-procedure, semi-definite relaxation (SDR), and a one-dimensional (1D) search, for which the tightness of the SDR is rigorously proved. Next, we consider the scenario with Gaussian CSI errors of eavesdroppers, in which the secrecy outage probability constraint is adopted. In this scenario, we present an efficient algorithm to solve the more challenging secrecy outage-constrained sensing beampattern optimization problem, by exploiting the convex restriction technique based on the Bernstein-type inequality, together with the SDR and 1D search.

    "title": "MKANet: A Lightweight Network with Sobel Boundary Loss for Efficient  Land-cover Classification of Satellite Remote Sensing Imagery",
    "abstract": "Land cover classification is a multi-class segmentation task to classify each pixel into a certain natural or man-made category of the earth surface, such as water, soil, natural vegetation, crops, and human infrastructure. Limited by hardware computational resources and memory capacity, most existing studies preprocessed original remote sensing images by down sampling or cropping them into small patches less than 512*512 pixels before sending them to a deep neural network. However, down sampling images incurs spatial detail loss, renders small segments hard to discriminate, and reverses the spatial resolution progress obtained by decades of years of efforts. Cropping images into small patches causes a loss of long-range context information, and restoring the predicted results to their original size brings extra latency. In response to the above weaknesses, we present an efficient lightweight semantic segmentation network termed MKANet. Aimed at the characteristics of top view high-resolution remote sensing imagery, MKANet utilizes sharing kernels to simultaneously and equally handle ground segments of inconsistent scales, and also employs parallel and shallow architecture to boost inference speed and friendly support image patches more than 10X larger. To enhance boundary and small segments discrimination, we also propose a method that captures category impurity areas, exploits boundary information and exerts an extra penalty on boundaries and small segment misjudgment. Both visual interpretations and quantitative metrics of extensive experiments demonstrate that MKANet acquires state-of-the-art accuracy on two land-cover classification datasets and infers 2X faster than other competitive lightweight networks. All these merits highlight the potential of MKANet in practical applications. ",

    "abstract": "Steganography usually modifies cover media to embed secret data. A new steganographic approach called generative steganography (GS) has emerged recently, in which stego images (images containing secret data) are generated from secret data directly without cover media. However, existing GS schemes are often criticized for their poor performances. In this paper, we propose an advanced generative steganography network (GSN) that can generate realistic stego images without using cover images, in which mutual information is firstly introduced in stego image generation. Our model contains four sub-networks, i.e., an image generator ($G$), a discriminator ($D$), a steganalyzer ($S$), and a data extractor ($E$). $D$ and $S$ act as two adversarial discriminators to ensure the visual and statistical imperceptibility of generated stego images. $E$ is to extract the hidden secret from generated stego images. The generator $G$ is flexibly constructed to synthesize either cover or stego images with different inputs. It facilitates covert communication by hiding the function of generating stego images in a normal image generator. A module named secret block is designed delicately to conceal secret data in the feature maps during image generation, with which high hiding capacity and image fidelity are achieved. In addition, a novel hierarchical gradient decay skill is developed to resist steganalysis detection. Experiments demonstrate the superiority of our work over existing methods. ",

To address this problem, we propose a novel collision handling neural network layer called Repulsive Force Unit (ReFU).

We show that ReFU is differentiable with trainable parameters and can be integrated into different network backbones that predict 3D garment deformations. Our experiments show that ReFU significantly reduces the number of collisions between the body and the garment and better preserves geometric details compared to prior methods based on collision loss or post-processing optimization.

On two images that look similar to human eyes, the same detector can make different predictions because of small image distortions like camera sensor noise and lighting changes. This problem is called inconsistency. Existing accuracy metrics do not properly account for inconsistency, and similar work in this area only targets improvements on artificial image distortions. Therefore, we propose a method to use non-artificial video frames to measure object detection consistency over time, across frames. Using this method, we show that the consistency of modern object detectors ranges from 83.2% to 97.1% on different video datasets from the Multiple Object Tracking Challenge. We conclude by showing that applying image distortion corrections like .WEBP Image Compression and Unsharp Masking can improve consistency by as much as 5.1%, with no loss in accuracy. ",

    "abstract": "Many complex systems involve interactions between more than two agents. Hypergraphs capture these higher-order interactions through hyperedges that may link more than two nodes. We consider the problem of embedding a hypergraph into low-dimensional Euclidean space so that most interactions are short-range. This embedding is relevant to many follow-on tasks, such as node reordering, clustering, and visualization. We focus on two spectral embedding algorithms customized to hypergraphs which recover linear and periodic structures respectively. In the periodic case, nodes are positioned on the unit circle. We show that the two spectral hypergraph embedding algorithms are associated with a new class of generative hypergraph models. These models generate hyperedges according to node positions in the embedded space and encourage short-range connections. They allow us to quantify the relative presence of periodic and linear structures in the data through maximum likelihood. They also improve the interpretability of node embedding and provide a metric for hyperedge prediction. We demonstrate the hypergraph embedding and follow-on tasks -- including structure quantification, clustering and hyperedge prediction -- on synthetic and real-world hypergraphs. We find that the hypergraph approach can outperform clustering algorithms that use only dyadic edges. We also compare several triadic edge prediction methods on high school contact data where our algorithm improves upon benchmark methods when the amount of training data is limited. ",

    "abstract": "Modern deep neural network models are known to erroneously classify out-of-distribution (OOD) test data into one of the in-distribution (ID) training classes with high confidence. This can have disastrous consequences for safety-critical applications. A popular mitigation strategy is to train a separate classifier that can detect such OOD samples at the test time. In most practical settings OOD examples are not known at the train time, and hence a key question is: how to augment the ID data with synthetic OOD samples for training such an OOD detector? In this paper, we propose a novel Compounded Corruption technique for the OOD data augmentation termed CnC. One of the major advantages of CnC is that it does not require any hold-out data apart from the training set. Further, unlike current state-of-the-art (SOTA) techniques, CnC does not require backpropagation or ensembling at the test time, making our method much faster at inference. Our extensive comparison with 20 methods from the major conferences in last 4 years show that a model trained using CnC based data augmentation, significantly outperforms SOTA, both in terms of OOD detection accuracy as well as inference time. We include a detailed post-hoc analysis to investigate the reasons for the success of our method and identify higher relative entropy and diversity of CnC samples as probable causes. We also provide theoretical insights via a piece-wise decomposition analysis on a two-dimensional dataset to reveal (visually and quantitatively) that our approach leads to a tighter boundary around ID classes, leading to better detection of OOD samples.

As a result, the context information cannot be fully exploited and extra noise will be introduced or the amount of knowledge injected is limited. To address these issues, we propose MLRIP, which modifies the knowledge masking strategies proposed by ERNIE-Baidu, and introduce a two-stage entity replacement strategy.

RHODE preserves the confidentiality of the training data, the model, and the prediction data; and it mitigates the federated learning attacks that target the gradients under a passive-adversary threat model. We propose a novel packing scheme, multi-dimensional packing, for a better utilization of Single Instruction, Multiple Data (SIMD) operations under encryption. With multi-dimensional packing, RHODE enables the efficient processing, in parallel, of a batch of samples. To avoid the exploding gradients problem, we also provide several clip-by-value approximations for enabling gradient clipping under encryption. We experimentally show that the model performance with RHODE remains similar to non-secure solutions both for homogeneous and heterogeneous data distribution among the data holders. Our experimental evaluation shows that RHODE scales linearly with the number of data holders and the number of timesteps, sub-linearly and sub-quadratically with the number of features and the number of hidden units of RNNs, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, RHODE is the first system that provides the building blocks for the training of RNNs and its variants, under encryption in a federated learning setting. ",

However, most of them simply swap Softmax with an efficient attention mechanism without considering the customized architectures specially for the efficient attention. In this paper, we argue that the handcrafted vanilla Transformer architectures for Softmax attention may not be suitable for efficient Transformers. To address this issue, we propose a new framework to find optimal architectures for efficient Transformers with the neural architecture search (NAS) technique. The proposed method is validated on popular machine translation and image classification tasks. We observe that the optimal architecture of the efficient Transformer has the reduced computation compared with that of the standard Transformer, but the general accuracy is less comparable. It indicates that the Softmax attention and efficient attention have their own distinctions but neither of them can simultaneously balance the accuracy and efficiency well. This motivates us to mix the two types of attention to reduce the performance imbalance. Besides the search spaces that commonly used in existing NAS Transformer approaches, we propose a new search space that allows the NAS algorithm to automatically search the attention variants along with architectures. Extensive experiments on WMT' 14 En-De and CIFAR-10 demonstrate that our searched architecture maintains comparable accuracy to the standard Transformer with notably improved computational efficiency.

    "abstract": "The most of CNN based super-resolution (SR) methods assume that the degradation is known (\\eg, bicubic). These methods will suffer a severe performance drop when the degradation is different from their assumption. Therefore, some approaches attempt to train SR networks with the complex combination of multiple degradations to cover the real degradation space. To adapt to multiple unknown degradations, introducing an explicit degradation estimator can actually facilitate SR performance. However, previous explicit degradation estimation methods usually predict Gaussian blur with the supervision of groundtruth blur kernels, and estimation errors may lead to SR failure. Thus, it is necessary to design a method that can extract implicit discriminative degradation representation. To this end, we propose a Meta-Learning based Region Degradation Aware SR Network (MRDA), including Meta-Learning Network (MLN), Degradation Extraction Network (DEN), and Region Degradation Aware SR Network (RDAN). To handle the lack of groundtruth degradation, we use the MLN to rapidly adapt to the specific complex degradation after several iterations and extract implicit degradation information. Subsequently, a teacher network MRDA$_{T}$ is designed to further utilize the degradation information extracted by MLN for SR. However, MLN requires iterating on paired low-resolution (LR) and corresponding high-resolution (HR) images, which is unavailable in the inference phase. Therefore, we adopt knowledge distillation (KD) to make the student network learn to directly extract the same implicit degradation representation (IDR) as the teacher from LR images. ",

However, it remains poorly understood how such `noise-induced transitions' are generated by the interplay of network structure and dynamics on the network. We identify two key roles for nodes on how tipping points can emerge in dynamical networks governed by the Boltzmann-Gibbs distribution. In the initial phase, initiator nodes absorb and transmit short-lived fluctuations to neighboring nodes, causing a domino-effect making neighboring nodes more dynamic. Conversely, towards the tipping point we identify stabilizer nodes whose state information becomes part of the long-term memory of the system. We validate these roles by targeted interventions that make tipping points more (less) likely to begin or lead to systemic change. This opens up possibilities for understanding and controlling endogenously generated metastable behavior. ",

A common approach to improve branch prediction accuracy is to employ lengthy history records of previously seen branch directions to capture distant correlations between branches. The larger the history, the richer the information that the predictor can exploit for discovering predictive patterns. However, without appropriate filtering, such an approach may also heavily disorganize the predictor's internal mechanisms, leading to diminishing returns. This paper studies a fundamental control-flow property: the sparsity in the correlation between branches and recent history. First, we show that sparse branch correlations exist in standard applications and, more importantly, such correlations can be computed efficiently using sparse modeling methods. Second, we introduce a sparsity-aware branch prediction mechanism that can compactly encode and store sparse models to unlock essential performance opportunities. We evaluated our approach for various design parameters demonstrating MPKI improvements of up to 42% (2.3% on average) with 2KB of additional storage overhead. Our circuit-level evaluation of the design showed that it can operate within accepted branch prediction latencies, and under reasonable power and area limitations. ",

    "abstract": "In recent years novel activation functions have been proposed to improve the performance of neural networks, and they show superior performance compared to the ReLU counterpart. However, there are environments, where the availability of complex activations is limited, and usually only the ReLU is supported. In this paper we propose methods that can be used to improve the performance of ReLU networks by using these efficient novel activations during model training. More specifically, we propose ensemble activations that are composed of the ReLU and one of these novel activations. Furthermore, the coefficients of the ensemble are neither fixed nor learned, but are progressively updated during the training process in a way that by the end of the training only the ReLU activations remain active in the network and the other activations can be removed. This means that in inference time the network contains ReLU activations only. We perform extensive evaluations on the ImageNet classification task using various compact network architectures and various novel activation functions. Results show 0.2-0.8% top-1 accuracy gain, which confirms the applicability of the proposed methods. Furthermore, we demonstrate the proposed methods on semantic segmentation and we boost the performance of a compact segmentation network by 0.34% mIOU on the Cityscapes dataset. ",

    "title": "Weakly-Supervised Camouflaged Object Detection with Scribble Annotations",
    "abstract": "Existing camouflaged object detection (COD) methods rely heavily on large-scale datasets with pixel-wise annotations. However, due to the ambiguous boundary, it is very time-consuming and labor-intensive to annotate camouflage objects pixel-wisely (which takes ~ 60 minutes per image). In this paper, we propose the first weakly-supervised camouflaged object detection (COD) method, using scribble annotations as supervision. To achieve this, we first construct a scribble-based camouflaged object dataset with 4,040 images and corresponding scribble annotations. It is worth noting that annotating the scribbles used in our dataset takes only ~ 10 seconds per image, which is 360 times faster than per-pixel annotations. However, the network directly using scribble annotations for supervision will fail to localize the boundary of camouflaged objects and tend to have inconsistent predictions since scribble annotations only describe the primary structure of objects without details. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel consistency loss composed of two parts: a reliable cross-view loss to attain reliable consistency over different images, and a soft inside-view loss to maintain consistency inside a single prediction map. Besides, we observe that humans use semantic information to segment regions near boundaries of camouflaged objects. Therefore, we design a feature-guided loss, which includes visual features directly extracted from images and semantically significant features captured by models. Moreover, we propose a novel network that detects camouflaged objects by scribble learning on structural information and semantic relations. Experimental results show that our model outperforms relevant state-of-the-art methods on three COD benchmarks with an average improvement of 11.0% on MAE, 3.2% on S-measure, 2.5% on E-measure and 4.4% on weighted F-measure.

We propose to disentangle the per-provenance relevance probability and its contribution to the final veracity probability in an interpretable way - the final veracity probability is proportional to a linear ensemble of per-provenance relevance probabilities. This way, it can be clearly identified the relevance of which sources contributes to what extent towards the final probability. We show that our system achieves state-of-the-art results on FEVER dataset comparable to two-stage systems typically used in traditional fact-checking pipelines, while it often uses significantly less parameters and computation. Our analysis shows that proposed approach further allows to learn not just which provenances are relevant, but also which provenances lead to supporting and which toward denying the claim, without direct supervision. This not only adds interpretability, but also allows to detect claims with conflicting evidence automatically. Furthermore, we study whether our model can learn fine-grained relevance cues while using coarse-grained supervision. We show that our model can achieve competitive sentence-recall while using only paragraph-level relevance supervision. Finally, traversing towards the finest granularity of relevance, we show that our framework is capable of identifying relevance at the token-level. To do this, we present a new benchmark focusing on token-level interpretability - humans annotate tokens in relevant provenances they considered essential when making their judgement. Then we measure how similar are these annotations to tokens our model is focusing on. Our code, and dataset will be released online. ",

    "abstract": "Predicting outcomes in sports is important for teams, leagues, bettors, media, and fans. Given the growing amount of player tracking data, sports analytics models are increasingly utilizing spatially-derived features built upon player tracking data. However, player-specific information, such as location, cannot readily be included as features themselves, since common modeling techniques rely on vector input. Accordingly, spatially-derived features are commonly constructed in relation to anchor objects, such as the distance to a ball or goal, through global feature aggregations, or via role-assignment schemes, where players are designated a distinct role in the game. In doing so, we sacrifice inter-player and local relationships in favor of global ones. To address this issue, we introduce a sport-agnostic graph-based representation of game states. We then use our proposed graph representation as input to graph neural networks to predict sports outcomes. Our approach preserves permutation invariance and allows for flexible player interaction weights. We demonstrate how our method provides statistically significant improvements over the state of the art for prediction tasks in both American football and esports, reducing test set loss by 9% and 20%, respectively. Additionally, we show how our model can be used to answer \"what if\" questions in sports and to visualize relationships between players. ",

    "abstract": "The acquisition and evaluation of pavement surface data play an essential role in pavement condition evaluation. In this paper, an efficient and effective end-to-end network for automatic pavement crack segmentation, called RHA-Net, is proposed to improve the pavement crack segmentation accuracy. The RHA-Net is built by integrating residual blocks (ResBlocks) and hybrid attention blocks into the encoder-decoder architecture. The ResBlocks are used to improve the ability of RHA-Net to extract high-level abstract features. The hybrid attention blocks are designed to fuse both low-level features and high-level features to help the model focus on correct channels and areas of cracks, thereby improving the feature presentation ability of RHA-Net. An image data set containing 789 pavement crack images collected by a self-designed mobile robot is constructed and used for training and evaluating the proposed model. Compared with other state-of-the-art networks, the proposed model achieves better performance and the functionalities of adding residual blocks and hybrid attention mechanisms are validated in a comprehensive ablation study. Additionally, a light-weighted version of the model generated by introducing depthwise separable convolution achieves better a performance and a much faster processing speed with 1/30 of the number of U-Net parameters. The developed system can segment pavement crack in real-time on an embedded device Jetson TX2 (25 FPS). The video taken in real-time experiments is released at https://youtu.be/3XIogk0fiG4. ",

Though significant progress has been made, interactiveness learning remains a challenging problem in HOI detection: existing methods usually generate redundant negative H-O pair proposals and fail to effectively extract interactive pairs. Though interactiveness has been studied in both whole body- and part- level and facilitates the H-O pairing, previous works only focus on the target person once (i.e., in a local perspective) and overlook the information of the other persons. In this paper, we argue that comparing body-parts of multi-person simultaneously can afford us more useful and supplementary interactiveness cues. That said, to learn body-part interactiveness from a global perspective: when classifying a target person's body-part interactiveness, visual cues are explored not only from herself/himself but also from other persons in the image. We construct body-part saliency maps based on self-attention to mine cross-person informative cues and learn the holistic relationships between all the body-parts. We evaluate the proposed method on widely-used benchmarks HICO-DET and V-COCO. With our new perspective, the holistic global-local body-part interactiveness learning achieves significant improvements over state-of-the-art.

Importantly, our framework bypasses the need to retrain expensive models and allows us to estimate causal effects based on observational data alone. Addressing the problem of extracting factual knowledge from pretrained language models (PLMs), we focus on simple data statistics such as co-occurrence counts and show that these statistics do influence the predictions of PLMs, suggesting that such models rely on shallow heuristics. Our causal framework and our results demonstrate the importance of studying datasets and the benefits of causality for understanding NLP models. ",

Model uncertainty in time-invariant systems can be reduced by recently proposed learning-based methods, thus improving the performance of robust controllers using data. However, in practice, many systems also exhibit uncertainty in the form of changes over time, e.g., due to weight shifts or wear and tear, leading to decreased performance or instability of the learning-based controller. We propose an event-triggered learning algorithm that decides when to learn in the face of uncertainty in the LQR problem with rare or slow changes. Our key idea is to switch between robust and learned controllers. For learning, we first approximate the optimal length of the learning phase via Monte-Carlo estimations using a probabilistic model. We then design a statistical test for uncertain systems based on the moment-generating function of the LQR cost. The test detects changes in the system under control and triggers re-learning when control performance deteriorates due to system changes. We demonstrate improved performance over a robust controller baseline in a numerical example. ",

We designed the feature extraction module to extract and fuse multi-scale features and different receptive field features to solve the problem of dark boundaries and discontinuous boundaries. We use a new loss function to optimize the model. The interference of class imbalance on model optimization is prevented to obtain finer and smoother boundaries.

The purpose of this construction is to obtain a network with a hierarchical structure (a deep learning architecture). An RBM corresponds a certain spin glass, thus a DBN should correspond to an ultrametric (hierarchical) spin glass. A model of such system can be easily constructed by using $p$-adic numbers. In our approach, a $p$-adic SFT corresponds to a $p$-adic continuous DBN, and a discretization of this theory corresponds to a $p$-adic discrete DBN.

    "abstract": "Recent speaker diarization studies showed that integration of end-to-end neural diarization (EEND) and clustering-based diarization is a promising approach for achieving state-of-the-art performance on various tasks. Such an approach first divides an observed signal into fixed-length segments, then performs {\\it segment-level} local diarization based on an EEND module, and merges the segment-level results via clustering to form a final global diarization result. The segmentation is done to limit the number of speakers in each segment since the current EEND cannot handle a large number of speakers. In this paper, we argue that such an approach involving the segmentation has several issues; for example, it inevitably faces a dilemma that larger segment sizes increase both the context available for enhancing the performance and the number of speakers for the local EEND module to handle. To resolve such a problem, this paper proposes a novel framework that performs diarization without segmentation. However, it can still handle challenging data containing many speakers and a significant amount of overlapping speech. The proposed method can take an entire meeting for inference and perform {\\it utterance-by-utterance} diarization that clusters utterance activities in terms of speakers. To this end, we leverage a neural network training scheme called Graph-PIT proposed recently for neural source separation. Experiments with simulated active-meeting-like data and CALLHOME data show the superiority of the proposed approach over the conventional methods. ",

    "title": "HelixFold-Single: MSA-free Protein Structure Prediction by Using Protein  Language Model as an Alternative",
    "abstract": "AI-based protein structure prediction pipelines, such as AlphaFold2, have achieved near-experimental accuracy. These advanced pipelines mainly rely on Multiple Sequence Alignments (MSAs) and templates as inputs to learn the co-evolution information from the homologous sequences. Nonetheless, searching MSAs and templates from protein databases is time-consuming, usually taking dozens of minutes. Consequently, we attempt to explore the limits of fast protein structure prediction by using only primary sequences of proteins. HelixFold-Single is proposed to combine a large-scale protein language model with the superior geometric learning capability of AlphaFold2. Our proposed method, HelixFold-Single, first pre-trains a large-scale protein language model (PLM) with thousands of millions of primary sequences utilizing the self-supervised learning paradigm, which will be used as an alternative to MSAs and templates for learning the co-evolution information. Then, by combining the pre-trained PLM and the essential components of AlphaFold2, we obtain an end-to-end differentiable model to predict the 3D coordinates of atoms from only the primary sequence. HelixFold-Single is validated in datasets CASP14 and CAMEO, achieving competitive accuracy with the MSA-based methods on the targets with large homologous families. Furthermore, HelixFold-Single consumes much less time than the mainstream pipelines for protein structure prediction, demonstrating its potential in tasks requiring many predictions. The code of HelixFold-Single is available at https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/PaddleHelix/tree/dev/apps/protein_folding/helixfold-single, and we also provide stable web services on https://paddlehelix.baidu.com/app/drug/protein-single/forecast.

    "abstract": "This paper addresses the problem of optimal robust stabilization of a discrete-time minimum-phase plant in the framework of robust control theory in the $\\ell_1$ setup and under poor a priori information. Coefficients of the transfer function of the plant nominal model with stable zeros are unknown and belong to a known bounded polyhedron in the space of coefficients. The gains of coprime factor perturbations of the plant and the upper bound of external disturbance are also unknown. The problem under consideration is to design adaptive controller that minimizes, with the prescribed accuracy, the worst-case asymptotic upper bound of the output. Solution of the problem is based on set-membership estimation of unknown parameters and treating the control criterion as the identification criterion. A hard nonconvex problem of on-line computation of optimal estimates is reduced, under additional nonrestrictive assumption, to a linear-fractional programming via a nonlinear transformation of estimated parameters. Despite the non-identifiability of the unknown parameters, the proposed adaptive controller guarantees, with the prescribed accuracy, the same optimal asymptotic upper bound of the output of adaptive system as the optimal controller for the plant with known parameters. In addition to the optimality of adaptive control, the proposed solution provides on-line verification/validation of current estimates and a priori assumptions. ",

    "abstract": "Brain tumor segmentation remains a challenge in medical image segmentation tasks. With the application of transformer in various computer vision tasks, transformer blocks show the capability of learning long-distance dependency in global space, which is complementary with CNNs. In this paper, we proposed a novel transformer-based generative adversarial network to automatically segment brain tumors with multi-modalities MRI. Our architecture consists of a generator and a discriminator, which are trained in min-max game progress. The generator is based on a typical \"U-shaped\" encoder-decoder architecture, whose bottom layer is composed of transformer blocks with resnet. Besides, the generator is trained with deep supervision technology. The discriminator we designed is a CNN-based network with multi-scale $L_{1}$ loss, which is proved to be effective for medical semantic image segmentation. To validate the effectiveness of our method, we conducted experiments on BRATS2015 dataset, achieving comparable or better performance than previous state-of-the-art methods. ",

    "abstract": "The asteroidal main belt is crossed by a web of mean-motion and secular resonances, that occur when there is a commensurability between fundamental frequencies of the asteroids and planets. Traditionally, these objects were identified by visual inspection of the time evolution of their resonant argument, which is a combination of orbital elements of the asteroid and the perturbing planet(s). Since the population of asteroids affected by these resonances is, in some cases, of the order of several thousand, this has become a taxing task for a human observer. Recent works used Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) models to perform such task automatically. In this work, we compare the outcome of such models with those of some of the most advanced and publicly available CNN architectures, like the VGG, Inception and ResNet. The performance of such models is first tested and optimized for overfitting issues, using validation sets and a series of regularization techniques like data augmentation, dropout, and batch normalization. The three best-performing models were then used to predict the labels of larger testing databases containing thousands of images. The VGG model, with and without regularizations, proved to be the most efficient method to predict labels of large datasets. Since the Vera C. Rubin observatory is likely to discover up to four million new asteroids in the next few years, the use of these models might become quite valuable to identify populations of resonant minor bodies.

    "abstract": "The LIDC-IDRI database is the most popular benchmark for lung cancer prediction. However, with subjective assessment from radiologists, nodules in LIDC may have entirely different malignancy annotations from the pathological ground truth, introducing label assignment errors and subsequent supervision bias during training. The LIDC database thus requires more objective labels for learning-based cancer prediction. Based on an extra small dataset containing 180 nodules diagnosed by pathological examination, we propose to re-label LIDC data to mitigate the effect of original annotation bias verified on this robust benchmark. We demonstrate in this paper that providing new labels by similar nodule retrieval based on metric learning would be an effective re-labeling strategy. Training on these re-labeled LIDC nodules leads to improved model performance, which is enhanced when new labels of uncertain nodules are added. We further infer that re-labeling LIDC is current an expedient way for robust lung cancer prediction while building a large pathological-proven nodule database provides the long-term solution. ",
