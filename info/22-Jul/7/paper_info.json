    "title": "Improving Trustworthiness of AI Disease Severity Rating in Medical  Imaging with Ordinal Conformal Prediction Sets",
    "abstract": "The regulatory approval and broad clinical deployment of medical AI have been hampered by the perception that deep learning models fail in unpredictable and possibly catastrophic ways. A lack of statistically rigorous uncertainty quantification is a significant factor undermining trust in AI results. Recent developments in distribution-free uncertainty quantification present practical solutions for these issues by providing reliability guarantees for black-box models on arbitrary data distributions as formally valid finite-sample prediction intervals. Our work applies these new uncertainty quantification methods -- specifically conformal prediction -- to a deep-learning model for grading the severity of spinal stenosis in lumbar spine MRI. We demonstrate a technique for forming ordinal prediction sets that are guaranteed to contain the correct stenosis severity within a user-defined probability (confidence interval). On a dataset of 409 MRI exams processed by the deep-learning model, the conformal method provides tight coverage with small prediction set sizes. Furthermore, we explore the potential clinical applicability of flagging cases with high uncertainty predictions (large prediction sets) by quantifying an increase in the prevalence of significant imaging abnormalities (e.g. motion artifacts, metallic artifacts, and tumors) that could degrade confidence in predictive performance when compared to a random sample of cases.

We propose a state-augmented algorithm for solving the aforementioned radio resource management (RRM) problems, where, alongside the instantaneous network state, the RRM policy takes as input the set of dual variables corresponding to the constraints, which evolve depending on how much the constraints are violated during execution. We theoretically show that the proposed state-augmented algorithm leads to feasible and near-optimal RRM decisions. Moreover, focusing on the problem of wireless power control using graph neural network (GNN) parameterizations, we demonstrate the superiority of the proposed RRM algorithm over baseline methods across a suite of numerical experiments.

    "abstract": "The emerging beyond 5G and envisioned 6G wireless networks are considered as key enablers in supporting a diversified set of applications for industrial mobile robots (MRs). The scenario under investigation in this paper relates to mobile robots that autonomously roam in an industrial floor and perform a variety of tasks at different locations whilst utilizing high directivity beamformers in mmWave small cells. In such scenarios, the potential close proximity of mobile robots connected to different base stations, may cause excessive levels of interference having as a net result a decrease in the overall achievable data rate in the network. To resolve this issue, a novel mixed integer linear programming formulation is proposed where the trajectory of the mobile robots is considered jointly with the interference level at different beam sectors. Therefore, creating a low interference path for each mobile robot in the industrial floor. A wide set of numerical investigations reveal that the proposed path planning optimization approach for the mmWave connected mobile robots can improve the overall achievable throughput by up to 31% compared to an interference oblivious scheme, without penalizing the overall travelling time.

For a precise quantification of forest land cover changes, the availability of spatially fine resolution data is a necessity. Since 1972, NASAs LANDSAT Satellites are providing terrestrial images covering every corner of the earth, which have been proved to be a highly useful resource for terrestrial change analysis and have been used in numerous other sectors. However, freely accessible satellite images are, generally, of medium to low resolution which is a major hindrance to the precision of the analysis. Hence, we performed a comprehensive study to prove our point that, enhancement of resolution by Super-Resolution Convolutional Neural Network (SRCNN) will lessen the chance of misclassification of pixels, even under the established recognition methods. We tested the method on original LANDSAT-7 images of different regions of Sundarbans and their upscaled versions which were produced by bilinear interpolation, bicubic interpolation, and SRCNN respectively and it was discovered that SRCNN outperforms the others by a significant amount.

While previous research in PINNs has mainly focused on constructing and balancing loss functions during training to avoid poor minima, the effect of sampling collocation points on the performance of PINNs has largely been overlooked. In this work, we find that the performance of PINNs can vary significantly with different sampling strategies, and using a fixed set of collocation points can be quite detrimental to the convergence of PINNs to the correct solution. In particular, (1) we hypothesize that training of PINNs rely on successful \"propagation\" of solution from initial and/or boundary condition points to interior points, and PINNs with poor sampling strategies can get stuck at trivial solutions if there are \\textit{propagation failures}. (2) We demonstrate that propagation failures are characterized by highly imbalanced PDE residual fields where very high residuals are observed over very narrow regions. (3) To mitigate propagation failure, we propose a novel \\textit{evolutionary sampling} (Evo) method that can incrementally accumulate collocation points in regions of high PDE residuals. We further provide an extension of Evo to respect the principle of causality while solving time-dependent PDEs. We empirically demonstrate the efficacy and efficiency of our proposed methods in a variety of PDE problems. ",

    "abstract": "Including local participation in cultural heritage management has always been a concern since the Venice Charter so far (1964). In addition, the Faro Convention (2005) shifted focus from cultural heritage values to the values of cultural heritage for society. In this case, it is necessary to achieve the maximum engagement of stakeholders in all stages of management. Nowadays, the concept of community engagement in all stages of cultural heritage management is accepted for almost everyone. But the idea of citizen participation is a little like eating spinach: no one is against it in principle because it is good for you. If we accept that community engagement is good for us, the problem is how to let people participate? Not only communities are not very aware of their rights on their cultural heritage, but also cultural heritage authorities are unwilling to involve people in their decision-making process. Suppose, in an ideal society of course, people know that the cultural heritage is their properties and they would like to manage their assets by themselves, and authorities have realized that they are not omni-knowledge and omni-potent, there is still an unsolved problem, no one knows how we want to implement a people-centered approach in cultural heritage context. This how is referring to two main issues related to community engagement approach; lack of recognized method, on the one hand, and determining an appropriate tool, on the other hand. This paper is proposing a practical model and a simple tool for including local community in decision-making process in the Bisotun World heritage Site. ",

Applying state-of-the-art stylization methods to novel views frame by frame often causes jittering artifacts due to the lack of cross-view consistency. Therefore, this paper investigates 3D scene stylization that provides a strong inductive bias for consistent novel view synthesis. Specifically, we adopt the emerging neural radiance fields (NeRF) as our choice of 3D scene representation for their capability to render high-quality novel views for a variety of scenes. However, as rendering a novel view from a NeRF requires a large number of samples, training a stylized NeRF requires a large amount of GPU memory that goes beyond an off-the-shelf GPU capacity. We introduce a new training method to address this problem by alternating the NeRF and stylization optimization steps. Such a method enables us to make full use of our hardware memory capacity to both generate images at higher resolution and adopt more expressive image style transfer methods. Our experiments show that our method produces stylized NeRFs for a wide range of content, including indoor, outdoor and dynamic scenes, and synthesizes high-quality novel views with cross-view consistency.

    "abstract": "Heterogeneous networks, which connect informative nodes containing text with different edge types, are routinely used to store and process information in various real-world applications. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and their hyperbolic variants provide a promising approach to encode such networks in a low-dimensional latent space through neighborhood aggregation and hierarchical feature extraction, respectively. However, these approaches typically ignore metapath structures and the available semantic information. Furthermore, these approaches are sensitive to the noise present in the training data. To tackle these limitations, in this paper, we propose Text Enriched Sparse Hyperbolic Graph Convolution Network (TESH-GCN) to capture the graph's metapath structures using semantic signals and further improve prediction in large heterogeneous graphs. In TESH-GCN, we extract semantic node information, which successively acts as a connection signal to extract relevant nodes' local neighborhood and graph-level metapath features from the sparse adjacency tensor in a reformulated hyperbolic graph convolution layer. These extracted features in conjunction with semantic features from the language model (for robustness) are used for the final downstream task. Experiments on various heterogeneous graph datasets show that our model outperforms the current state-of-the-art approaches by a large margin on the task of link prediction. We also report a reduction in both the training time and model parameters compared to the existing hyperbolic approaches through a reformulated hyperbolic graph convolution. Furthermore, we illustrate the robustness of our model by experimenting with different levels of simulated noise in both the graph structure and text, and also, present a mechanism to explain TESH-GCN's prediction by analyzing the extracted metapaths.

As the basis of the framework, we introduce a program logic dFHL that accommodates continuous dynamics and safety conditions. Our framework presents a dFHL-based workflow for deriving goal-aware RSS rules; we discuss its software support, too. We conducted experimental evaluation using RSS rules in a safety architecture.

To overcome the drawback of SRS, this paper proposes a Latin Hypercube Sampling based Boundary Attack (LHS-BA) to save query budget.

    "abstract": "Detecting Human-Object Interaction (HOI) in images is an important step towards high-level visual comprehension. Existing work often shed light on improving either human and object detection, or interaction recognition. However, due to the limitation of datasets, these methods tend to fit well on frequent interactions conditioned on the detected objects, yet largely ignoring the rare ones, which is referred to as the object bias problem in this paper. In this work, we for the first time, uncover the problem from two aspects: unbalanced interaction distribution and biased model learning. To overcome the object bias problem, we propose a novel plug-and-play Object-wise Debiasing Memory (ODM) method for re-balancing the distribution of interactions under detected objects. Equipped with carefully designed read and write strategies, the proposed ODM allows rare interaction instances to be more frequently sampled for training, thereby alleviating the object bias induced by the unbalanced interaction distribution. We apply this method to three advanced baselines and conduct experiments on the HICO-DET and HOI-COCO datasets. To quantitatively study the object bias problem, we advocate a new protocol for evaluating model performance. As demonstrated in the experimental results, our method brings consistent and significant improvements over baselines, especially on rare interactions under each object. In addition, when evaluating under the conventional standard setting, our method achieves new state-of-the-art on the two benchmarks. ",

However, prediction of these scores from white matter tract data has not been attempted. In this paper, we propose a deep-learning-based framework for neuropsychological score prediction using microstructure measurements estimated from diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) tractography, focusing on predicting performance on a receptive vocabulary assessment task based on a critical fiber tract for language, the arcuate fasciculus (AF). We directly utilize information from all points in a fiber tract, without the need to average data along the fiber as is traditionally required by diffusion MRI tractometry methods. Specifically, we represent the AF as a point cloud with microstructure measurements at each point, enabling adoption of point-based neural networks. We improve prediction performance with the proposed Paired-Siamese Loss that utilizes information about differences between continuous neuropsychological scores. Finally, we propose a Critical Region Localization (CRL) algorithm to localize informative anatomical regions containing points with strong contributions to the prediction results. Our method is evaluated on data from 806 subjects from the Human Connectome Project dataset. Results demonstrate superior neuropsychological score prediction performance compared to baseline methods. We discover that critical regions in the AF are strikingly consistent across subjects, with the highest number of strongly contributing points located in frontal cortical regions (i.e., the rostral middle frontal, pars opercularis, and pars triangularis), which are strongly implicated as critical areas for language processes.

Traditional market research is time-consuming and labour-intensive, and its practical value is restricted.

This paper proposes a high-precision movie merchandising prediction model based on machine learning technology: WE model. This model integrates three machine learning algorithms to accurately predict the movie merchandising market. The WE model learns the relationship between the movie merchandising market and movie features by analyzing the main feature information of movies. After testing, the accuracy rate of prediction and evaluation in the merchandising market reaches 72.5%, and it has achieved a strong market control effect. ",

    "abstract": "Uncertainty quantification is a key component of machine learning models targeted at safety-critical systems such as in healthcare or autonomous vehicles. We study this problem in the context of meta learning, where the goal is to quickly adapt a predictor to new tasks. In particular, we propose a novel algorithm to construct \\emph{PAC prediction sets}, which capture uncertainty via sets of labels, that can be adapted to new tasks with only a few training examples. These prediction sets satisfy an extension of the typical PAC guarantee to the meta learning setting; in particular, the PAC guarantee holds with high probability over future tasks. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach on four datasets across three application domains: mini-ImageNet and CIFAR10-C in the visual domain, FewRel in the language domain, and the CDC Heart Dataset in the medical domain. In particular, our prediction sets satisfy the PAC guarantee while having smaller size compared to other baselines that also satisfy this guarantee. ",

    "abstract": "This paper has provided a novel design idea and some implementation methods to make a real time detection of multi-areas with multiple detecting areas that are generated by the real time drawing on the screen display of the video. The drawing on the video will remain the output as polylines, and the colors of the outlines will change when the stage of drawing or detecting is changed. The shape of the drawn area is free to be customized and real-time effective. The configuration of the drawn areas can be renewed and the detecting areas are working individually. The detection result should be shown with a GUI designed by Tkinter. The object recognition model was developed on YOLOv5 but can be changed to others, which means the core design and implementation idea of this paper is model-independent. With PIL and OpenCV and Tkinter, the drawing effect is real time and efficient. The design and code of this research is basic and can be extended to be implemented in numerous monitoring and detecting situations. ",

Since previous versions were found to have security vulnerabilities, to fix the most common security flaws, the WiFi Protected Access 3 (WPA3) got introduced. Although WPA3 is an improvement over its predecessor in terms of security, recently it was found that WPA3 has a few security vulnerabilities as well. In this paper, we have mentioned the previously known vulnerabilities in WPA3 and WPA2. In addition to that, we have created our own dataset based on WPA3 attacks (Section III). We have proposed a two-stage solution for the detection of an intrusion in the network. The two-stage approach will help ease computational processing burden of an AP and WLAN Controller. First, AP will perform a lightweight simple operation for some duration (say 500ms) at certain time interval. Upon discovering any abnormality in the flow of traffic an ML-based solution at the controller will detect the type of attack. Our approach is to utilize resources on AP as well as the back-end controller with certain level of optimization. We have achieved over 99% accuracy in attack detection using an ML-based solution. We have also publicly provided our code and dataset for the open-source research community, so that it can contribute for future research work. ",

We answer this by manipulating the input order and position information in a way that destroys the natural sequence order of query and passage and shows that the model still achieves comparable performance. Overall, our results highlight that syntactic aspects do not play a critical role in the effectiveness of re-ranking with BERT. We point to other mechanisms such as query-passage cross-attention and richer embeddings that capture word meanings based on aggregated context regardless of the word order for being the main attributions for its superior performance.

This happens for example when two affine users of a social network were not exposed to one another. Community detection on this kind of data suffers then from considering affine nodes as not affine. To solve this problem, we explicitly model the (non-)exposure mechanism in a Bayesian community detection framework, by introducing a set of additional hidden variables. Compared to approaches which do not model exposure, our method is able to better reconstruct the input graph, while maintaining a similar performance in recovering communities. Importantly, it allows to estimate the probability that two nodes have been exposed, a possibility not available with standard models. ",

    "abstract": "Energy efficiency is at the core of sustainability solutions for 5/6G networks. We argue this is a too narrow perspective on sustainability, as it ignores the effects of the increased traffic demand these networks stimulate and the need for additional equipment that this demand requires. The hope is that techniques to reduce the network's energy consumption in operation will be able to compensate for increases in traffic demand. However, there are more challenges than just reducing the energy that the network requires to function and it is not clear whether higher energy efficiency will be able to cope with increasing demand. The need for more equipment related to deployment of 5/6G networks may result in important environmental impacts: i) increased pressures on material extraction, which imply socio-environmental conflicts, ecosystem destruction and displacement, ii) more manufacturing and shipment, with effects on greenhouse gas emissions and pollution; iii) increased disposal complexities and challenges to recycle components of such equipments. By extending our view on sustainability to include the aforementioned often ignored implications, we are able to identify design requirements and technical pillars of 5/6G networks that need to be rethought. We also devise new paths forward to address these challenges. We argue that it is crucial to think of alternative applications and requirements that aim to serve user demands explicitly, instead of incessantly creating new needs. We also claim that acknowledging material limitations in the production of new hardware is critical, promoting retrofitting and modular design in future network development. The conclusions of this article show that it is time to start rethinking the course of mobile network development in order to align it to current environmental objectives to tackle the climate emergency the world is experiencing.

Here we show that universal transformers equipped with local attention and adaptive halting mechanisms can learn to exploit an external, grid-like memory to carry out multi-digit addition.

Unlike previous work, SeHGNN utilizes a light-weight parameter-free neighbor aggregator to learn structural information for each metapath, and a transformer-based semantic aggregator to combine semantic information across metapaths for the final embedding of each node. As a result, SeHGNN offers the simple network structure, high prediction accuracy, and fast training speed.

Besides, we propose a comprehensive evaluation framework for the complex structure of urban systems. Results show that MetroGAN outperforms the state-of-the-art urban simulation methods by over 20% in all metrics.

In this paper, we introduce a geometric flow network (GFNet) to explore the geometric correspondence between different views in an align-before-fuse manner. Specifically, we devise a novel geometric flow module (GFM) to bidirectionally align and propagate the complementary information across different views according to geometric relationships under the end-to-end learning scheme. We perform extensive experiments on two widely used benchmark datasets, SemanticKITTI and nuScenes, to demonstrate the effectiveness of our GFNet for project-based point cloud semantic segmentation.

These two approaches exhibit different failure modes. Consequently, hybrid algorithms present an attractive research goal. Unfortunately, dense anomaly detection requires translational equivariance and very large input resolutions. These requirements disqualify all previous hybrid approaches to the best of our knowledge. We therefore design a novel hybrid algorithm based on reinterpreting discriminative logits as a logarithm of the unnormalized joint distribution $\\hat{p}(\\mathbf{x}, \\mathbf{y})$. Our model builds on a shared convolutional representation from which we recover three dense predictions: i) the closed-set class posterior $P(\\mathbf{y}|\\mathbf{x})$, ii) the dataset posterior $P(d_{in}|\\mathbf{x})$, iii) unnormalized data likelihood $\\hat{p}(\\mathbf{x})$. The latter two predictions are trained both on the standard training data and on a generic negative dataset. We blend these two predictions into a hybrid anomaly score which allows dense open-set recognition on large natural images. We carefully design a custom loss for the data likelihood in order to avoid backpropagation through the untractable normalizing constant $Z(\\theta)$. Experiments evaluate our contributions on standard dense anomaly detection benchmarks as well as in terms of open-mIoU - a novel metric for dense open-set performance.

    "abstract": "Side-channel attacks impose a serious threat to cryptographic algorithms, including widely employed ones, such as AES and RSA, taking advantage of the algorithm implementation in hardware or software to extract secret information via timing and/or power side-channels. Software masking is a software mitigation approach against power side-channel attacks, aiming at hiding the secret-revealing dependencies from the power footprint of a vulnerable implementation. However, this type of software mitigation often depends on general-purpose compilers, which do not preserve non-functional properties. Moreover, microarchitectural features, such as the memory bus and register reuse, may also reveal secret information. These abstractions are not visible at the high-level implementation of the program. Instead, they are decided at compile time. To remedy these problems, security engineers often sacrifice code efficiency by turning off compiler optimization and/or performing local, post-compilation transformations. This paper proposes SecConCG, a constraint-based compiler approach that generates optimized yet secure code. SecConCG controls the quality of the mitigated program by efficiently searching the best possible low-level implementation according to a processor cost model. In our experiments with ten masked implementations on MIPS32 and ARM Cortex M0, SecConCG speeds up the generated code from 10% to 10x compared to non-optimized secure code at a small overhead of up to 7% compared to non-secure optimized code. For security and compiler researchers, this paper proposes a formal model to generate secure low-level code. For software engineers, SecConCG provides a practical approach to optimize code that preserves security properties. ",

If not possible, we investigate if it is possible to determine it \\emph{pressure robustly}, i.e. pollution free from the pressure reaction. For convex domains there is but one variational boundary value problem among the investigated that allows the independent determination. It is the one with essential no-penetration conditions combined with homogeneous tangential traction conditions. Further, in most but not all investigated cases, the weakly divergence-free displacement can be computed pressure robustly provided the total body force is decomposed into its direct sum of divergence- and rotation-free components using a Helmholtz decomposition. The elasticity problem is solved using these components as separate right-hand sides. The total solution is obtained using the superposition principle. We employ a $(\\mathbf{u},p)$ higher-order finite element formulation with discontinuous pressure elements. It is \\emph{inf-sup} stable for polynomial degree $p\\ge 2$ but not pressure robust by itself. We propose a three step procedure to solve the elasticity problem preceded by the Helmholtz decomposition of the total body force.

We design VMRF, an innovative view matching NeRF that enables effective NeRF training without requiring prior knowledge in camera poses or camera pose distributions. VMRF introduces a view matching scheme, which exploits unbalanced optimal transport to produce a feature transport plan for mapping a rendered image with randomly initialized camera pose to the corresponding real image.

    "abstract": "Video-based person re-identification (ReID) is challenging due to the presence of various interferences in video frames. Recent approaches handle this problem using temporal aggregation strategies. In this work, we propose a novel Context Sensing Attention Network (CSA-Net), which improves both the frame feature extraction and temporal aggregation steps. First, we introduce the Context Sensing Channel Attention (CSCA) module, which emphasizes responses from informative channels for each frame. These informative channels are identified with reference not only to each individual frame, but also to the content of the entire sequence. Therefore, CSCA explores both the individuality of each frame and the global context of the sequence. Second, we propose the Contrastive Feature Aggregation (CFA) module, which predicts frame weights for temporal aggregation. Here, the weight for each frame is determined in a contrastive manner: i.e., not only by the quality of each individual frame, but also by the average quality of the other frames in a sequence. Therefore, it effectively promotes the contribution of relatively good frames. Extensive experimental results on four datasets show that CSA-Net consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance. ",

    "abstract": "Channel pruning is widely used to reduce the complexity of deep network models. Recent pruning methods usually identify which parts of the network to discard by proposing a channel importance criterion. However, recent studies have shown that these criteria do not work well in all conditions. In this paper, we propose a novel Feature Shift Minimization (FSM) method to compress CNN models, which evaluates the feature shift by converging the information of both features and filters. Specifically, we first investigate the compression efficiency with some prevalent methods in different layer-depths and then propose the feature shift concept. Then, we introduce an approximation method to estimate the magnitude of the feature shift, since it is difficult to compute it directly. Besides, we present a distribution-optimization algorithm to compensate for the accuracy loss and improve the network compression efficiency. The proposed method yields state-of-the-art performance on various benchmark networks and datasets, verified by extensive experiments.

This study is the first to investigate the robustness of visually grounded dialog models towards textual attacks. These attacks represent a worst-case scenario where the input question contains a synonym which causes the previously correct model to return a wrong answer. Using this scenario, we first aim to understand how multimodal input components contribute to model robustness. Our results show that models which encode dialog history are more robust, and when launching an attack on history, model prediction becomes more uncertain. This is in contrast to prior work which finds that dialog history is negligible for model performance on this task. We also evaluate how to generate adversarial test examples which successfully fool the model but remain undetected by the user/software designer. We find that the textual, as well as the visual context are important to generate plausible worst-case scenarios. ",

However, to reap full benefits of RIS-aided CF-mMIMO, the main challenge is to efficiently design cooperative beamforming (CBF) at base stations (BSs), RISs, and users. Firstly, we investigate the fractional programing to convert the weighted sum-rate (WSR) maximization problem into a tractable optimization problem. Then, the alternating optimization framework is employed to decompose the transformed problem into a sequence of subproblems, i.e., hybrid BF (HBF) at BSs, passive BF at RISs, and combining at users. In particular, the alternating direction method of multipliers algorithm is utilized to solve the HBF subproblem at BSs. Concretely, the analog BF design with unit-modulus constraints is solved by the manifold optimization (MO) while we obtain a closed-form solution to the digital BF design that is essentially a convex least-square problem. Additionally, the passive BF at RISs and the analog combining at users are designed by primal-dual subgradient and MO methods. Moreover, considering heavy communication costs in conventional CF-mMIMO systems, we propose a partially-connected CF-mMIMO (P-CF-mMIMO) framework to decrease the number of connections among BSs and users. To better compromise WSR performance and network costs, we formulate the BS selection problem in the P-CF-mMIMO system as a binary integer quadratic programming (BIQP) problem, and develop a relaxed linear approximation algorithm to handle this BIQP problem. Finally, numerical results demonstrate superiorities of our proposed algorithms over baseline counterparts. ",

As an efficient method to obtain deep SNN, the conversion method has exhibited high performance on various large-scale datasets. However, it typically suffers from severe performance degradation and high time delays. In particular, most of the previous work focuses on simple classification tasks while ignoring the precise approximation to ANN output. In this paper, we first theoretically analyze the conversion errors and derive the harmful effects of time-varying extremes on synaptic currents. We propose the Spike Calibration (SpiCalib) to eliminate the damage of discrete spikes to the output distribution and modify the LIPooling to allow conversion of the arbitrary MaxPooling layer losslessly. Moreover, Bayesian optimization for optimal normalization parameters is proposed to avoid empirical settings. The experimental results demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance on classification, object detection, and segmentation tasks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time to obtain SNN comparable to ANN on these tasks simultaneously. Moreover, we only need 1/50 inference time of the previous work on the detection task and can achieve the same performance under 0.492$\\times$ energy consumption of ANN on the segmentation task. ",

The human brain can rapidly learn various concept knowledge in a self-organized and unsupervised way, which is accomplished through the coordination of multiple learning rules and structures in the human brain. Spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) is a widespread learning rule in the brain, but spiking neural network trained using STDP alone are inefficient and performs poorly. In this paper, taking inspiration from the short-term synaptic plasticity, we design an adaptive synaptic filter, and we introduce the adaptive threshold balance as the neuron plasticity to enrich the representation ability of SNNs. We also introduce an adaptive lateral inhibitory connection to dynamically adjust the spikes balance to help the network learn richer features. To accelerate and stabilize the training of the unsupervised spiking neural network, we design a sample temporal batch STDP which update the weight based on multiple samples and multiple moments. We have conducted experiments on MNIST and FashionMNIST, and have achieved state-of-the-art performance of the current unsupervised spiking neural network based on STDP.

However, such explanations are not robust to certain real-world changes in the underlying model (e.g., retraining the model, changing hyperparameters, etc.), questioning their reliability in several applications, e.g., credit lending. In this work, we propose a novel strategy -- that we call RobX -- to generate robust counterfactuals for tree-based ensembles, e.g., XGBoost. Tree-based ensembles pose additional challenges in robust counterfactual generation, e.g., they have a non-smooth and non-differentiable objective function, and they can change a lot in the parameter space under retraining on very similar data. We first introduce a novel metric -- that we call Counterfactual Stability -- that attempts to quantify how robust a counterfactual is going to be to model changes under retraining, and comes with desirable theoretical properties. Our proposed strategy RobX works with any counterfactual generation method (base method) and searches for robust counterfactuals by iteratively refining the counterfactual generated by the base method using our metric Counterfactual Stability. We compare the performance of RobX with popular counterfactual generation methods (for tree-based ensembles) across benchmark datasets. The results demonstrate that our strategy generates counterfactuals that are significantly more robust (nearly 100% validity after actual model changes) and also realistic (in terms of local outlier factor) over existing state-of-the-art methods.

In this work we address the above gap, and introduce Graph Trees with Attention (GTA), a new family of tree-based learning algorithms that are designed to operate on graphs. GTA leverages both the graph structure and the features at the vertices and employs an attention mechanism that allows decisions to concentrate on sub-structures of the graph. We analyze GTA models and show that they are strictly more expressive than plain decision trees. We also demonstrate the benefits of GTA empirically on multiple graph and node prediction benchmarks. In these experiments, GTA always outperformed other tree-based models and often outperformed other types of graph-learning algorithms such as Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Graph Kernels. Finally, we also provide an explainability mechanism for GTA, and demonstrate it can provide intuitive explanations. ",

However, the novel Open Science practices could be an opportunity to disrupt such dynamics and diversify the credit of the different scientific contributors involved in the diverse phases of the lifecycle of the same research effort. In fact, a paper and research data (or software) contextually published could exhibit different authorship to give credit to the various contributors right where it feels most appropriate. As a preliminary study, in this paper, we leverage the wealth of information contained in Open Science Graphs, such as OpenAIRE, and conduct a focused analysis on a subset of publications with supplementary material drawn from the European Marine Science (MES) research community. The results are promising and suggest our hypothesis is worth exploring further as we registered in 22% of the cases substantial variations between the authors participating in the publication and the authors participating in the supplementary dataset (or software), thus posing the premises for a longitudinal, large-scale analysis of the phenomenon.

Yet, today's solutions are unable to deliver robust and high tracking accuracies across multiple agents in practical, everyday environments - a feature central to the future of immersive and collaborative applications. This can be attributed to the limited scope of diversity leveraged by these fusion solutions, preventing them from catering to the multiple dimensions of accuracy, robustness (diverse environmental conditions) and scalability (multiple agents) simultaneously. In this work, we take an important step towards this goal by introducing the notion of dual-layer diversity to the problem of sensor fusion in multi-agent tracking. We demonstrate that the fusion of complementary tracking modalities, - passive/relative (e.g., visual odometry) and active/absolute tracking (e.g., infrastructure-assisted RF localization) offer a key first layer of diversity that brings scalability while the second layer of diversity lies in the methodology of fusion, where we bring together the complementary strengths of algorithmic (for robustness) and data-driven (for accuracy) approaches. RoVaR is an embodiment of such a dual-layer diversity approach that intelligently attends to cross-modal information using algorithmic and data-driven techniques that jointly share the burden of accurately tracking multiple agents in the wild. Extensive evaluations reveal RoVaR's multi-dimensional benefits in terms of tracking accuracy (median of 15cm), robustness (in unseen environments), light weight (runs in real-time on mobile platforms such as Jetson Nano/TX2), to enable practical multi-agent immersive applications in everyday environments.

Namely, there exists the possibility that protected policyholder characteristics are implicitly inferred from non-protected ones by predictive models, and are thus having an undesirable (or illegal) impact on prices. A technical solution to this problem relies on building a best-estimate model using all policyholder characteristics (including protected ones) and then averaging out the protected characteristics for calculating individual prices. However, such approaches require full knowledge of policyholders' protected characteristics, which may in itself be problematic. Here, we address this issue by using a multi-task neural network architecture for claim predictions, which can be trained using only partial information on protected characteristics, and it produces prices that are free from proxy discrimination. We demonstrate the use of the proposed model and we find that its predictive accuracy is comparable to a conventional feedforward neural network (on full information).

    "title": "TractoFormer: A Novel Fiber-level Whole Brain Tractography Analysis  Framework Using Spectral Embedding and Vision Transformers",
    "abstract": "Diffusion MRI tractography is an advanced imaging technique for quantitative mapping of the brain's structural connectivity. Whole brain tractography (WBT) data contains over hundreds of thousands of individual fiber streamlines (estimated brain connections), and this data is usually parcellated to create compact representations for data analysis applications such as disease classification. In this paper, we propose a novel parcellation-free WBT analysis framework, TractoFormer, that leverages tractography information at the level of individual fiber streamlines and provides a natural mechanism for interpretation of results using the attention mechanism of transformers. TractoFormer includes two main contributions. First, we propose a novel and simple 2D image representation of WBT, TractoEmbedding, to encode 3D fiber spatial relationships and any feature of interest that can be computed from individual fibers (such as FA or MD). Second, we design a network based on vision transformers (ViTs) that includes: 1) data augmentation to overcome model overfitting on small datasets, 2) identification of discriminative fibers for interpretation of results, and 3) ensemble learning to leverage fiber information from different brain regions. In a synthetic data experiment, TractoFormer successfully identifies discriminative fibers with simulated group differences. In a disease classification experiment comparing several methods, TractoFormer achieves the highest accuracy in classifying schizophrenia vs control. Discriminative fibers are identified in left hemispheric frontal and parietal superficial white matter regions, which have previously been shown to be affected in schizophrenia patients. ",

    "title": "Unified Embeddings of Structural and Functional Connectome via a  Function-Constrained Structural Graph Variational Auto-Encoder",
    "abstract": "Graph theoretical analyses have become standard tools in modeling functional and anatomical connectivity in the brain. With the advent of connectomics, the primary graphs or networks of interest are structural connectome (derived from DTI tractography) and functional connectome (derived from resting-state fMRI). However, most published connectome studies have focused on either structural or functional connectome, yet complementary information between them, when available in the same dataset, can be jointly leveraged to improve our understanding of the brain. To this end, we propose a function-constrained structural graph variational autoencoder (FCS-GVAE) capable of incorporating information from both functional and structural connectome in an unsupervised fashion. This leads to a joint low-dimensional embedding that establishes a unified spatial coordinate system for comparing across different subjects. We evaluate our approach using the publicly available OASIS-3 Alzheimer's disease (AD) dataset and show that a variational formulation is necessary to optimally encode functional brain dynamics. Further, the proposed joint embedding approach can more accurately distinguish different patient sub-populations than approaches that do not use complementary connectome information. ",

    "title": "Saturation region of Freeway Networks under Safe Microscopic Ramp  Metering",
    "abstract": "We consider ramp metering at the microscopic level subject to vehicle safety constraint. The traffic network is abstracted by a ring road with multiple on- and off-ramps. The arrival times of vehicles to the on-ramps, as well as their destination off-ramps are modeled by exogenous stochastic processes. Once a vehicle is released from an on-ramp, it accelerates towards the free flow speed if it is not obstructed by another vehicle; once it gets close to another vehicle, it adopts a safe behavior. The vehicle exits the traffic network once it reaches its destination off-ramp. We design traffic-responsive ramp metering policies which maximize the saturation region of the network. The saturation region of a policy is defined as the set of demands, i.e., arrival rates and the routing matrix, for which the queue lengths at all the on-ramps remain bounded in expectation. The proposed ramp metering policies operate under synchronous cycles during which an on-ramp does not release more vehicles than its queue length at the beginning of the cycle. We provide three policies under which, respectively, each on-ramp (i) pauses release for a time-interval at the end of the cycle, or (ii) modulates the release rate during the cycle, or (iii) adopts a conservative safety criterion for release during the cycle. None of the policies, however, require information about the demand. The saturation region of these policies is characterized by studying stochastic stability of the induced Markov chains, and is proven to be maximal when the merging speed of all on-ramps equals the free flow speed. Simulations are provided to illustrate the performance of the policies. ",

    "title": "Improving Streaming End-to-End ASR on Transformer-based Causal Models  with Encoder States Revision Strategies",
    "abstract": "There is often a trade-off between performance and latency in streaming automatic speech recognition (ASR). Traditional methods such as look-ahead and chunk-based methods, usually require information from future frames to advance recognition accuracy, which incurs inevitable latency even if the computation is fast enough. A causal model that computes without any future frames can avoid this latency, but its performance is significantly worse than traditional methods. In this paper, we propose corresponding revision strategies to improve the causal model. Firstly, we introduce a real-time encoder states revision strategy to modify previous states. Encoder forward computation starts once the data is received and revises the previous encoder states after several frames, which is no need to wait for any right context. Furthermore, a CTC spike position alignment decoding algorithm is designed to reduce time costs brought by the revision strategy. Experiments are all conducted on Librispeech datasets. Fine-tuning on the CTC-based wav2vec2.0 model, our best method can achieve 3.7/9.2 WERs on test-clean/other sets, which is also competitive with the chunk-based methods and the knowledge distillation methods.
